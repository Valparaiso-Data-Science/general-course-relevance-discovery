<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table of Contents</head><p>There are also four shorter sessions within the first and second sessions. Some areas of instruction may offer a limited number of selected courses during the Summer Term, June 1 -August 4, with unique start, end, deadline dates and class meeting times to accommodate the particular needs of the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About SMU The Vision of Southern Methodist University</head><p>To create and impart knowledge that will shape citizens who contribute to their communities and lead their professions in a global society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission Southern Methodist University General Admission Policy</head><p>Consistent with its vision and mission, SMU seeks to enroll students who have the potential for academic success and who will enrich the collegiate community. The rich variety of perspectives SMU seeks are those that result from differences in racial, ethnic, linguistic, socio-economic, geographic, educational and religious backgrounds; different life experiences, and talents in the arts or athletics. SMU examines each prospective student's application for admission individually to determine the nature and extent of the applicant's potential to succeed and to enrich the community. The admission review of application materials includes records of intellectual and extra-curricular achievements as well as past behavior. Through financial support, SMU endeavors to ensure that cost of attendance will not be a barrier to achieving its goal of a diverse community.</p><p>All degree-seeking first-year students, regardless of intended major, enter the University as SMU Pre-Majors, and they are advised through the University Advising Center. Students normally qualify for entry into a major and specific degree program during their sophomore year. Applicants to BFA and BBA degree programs should refer to the admission process for those degrees in the Meadows School of the Arts and the Cox School of Business respectively. Admission into any undergraduate degree program requires the completion of minimum academic standards determined by the school in which the program is based. The specific requirements for admission into each of SMU's undergraduate schools are outlined in the admission section of that school's information in this catalog.</p><p>SMU collects information about the prior disciplinary and criminal history of applicants for admission to SMU programs. This information may be considered as part of a holistic review of applicants when deciding whether to offer admission to a prospective student. An applicant's failure to disclose complete and accurate disciplinary and criminal history in a timely manner, as required in the application process, may result in the University revoking an offer of admission or rescinding that person's status as a student.</p><p>SMU's Notice of Nondiscrimination is found in the catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First-Year Admission Criteria</head><p>Selection of degree-seeking students at SMU is based on several criteria: the high school curriculum, academic performance in the classroom, grade pattern, rank in class (if available), SAT and/or ACT scores, counselor and teacher recommendations, essay, behavioral record and extracurricular activities. Although no specific cutoff is applied to any single measure, generally a student who has both accomplished a strong academic record and exhibited a variety of noteworthy and personal achievements will contribute and benefit most from the SMU experience. Matriculation to the University is contingent upon continuing academic achievement and completion of the high school diploma. The Admission Committee may revoke offers of admission for students whose academic, extracurricular or behavioral records are not consistent with information presented in the application for admission. As an independent institution, SMU has no limits on enrollment based solely on geography or distinctions in tuition, fees or other costs based on the residency of the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High School Curriculum</head><p>High school curricula, including curricular rigor, academic performance in the classroom, elective choices and senior-year course load, are considered in the admission review. Applicants should submit high school records with a minimum of 15 or more academic units. The recommended distribution for a minimum program is as follows: four units of English, three units of mathematics (algebra 1, plane geometry, algebra 2), three units of science (including two units of laboratory science), three units of social science and two units of a second language (a two-year sequence).</p><p>American Sign Language may be used to satisfy the second language requirement. Engineering applicants should have completed four years of math (including higher-level math beyond algebra 2) and a year each of chemistry and physics. Note: Most students who are successful in the admission process present credentials well in excess of the minimum course recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Home School Criteria</head><p>Home school and distance learning applicants are expected to complete the equivalent of the high school curriculum as outlined above and submit SAT and/or ACT scores. In addition, students must submit the Home School Supplement form, which provides the education coordinator an opportunity to share his or her philosophy for homeschooling, comments concerning the grading scale and caliber of academic work completed, and a brief recommendation of the student. Access a checklist at www.smu.edu/admission/apply/firstyear/homeschool for the home school requirements. In addition to these requirements, SAT subject exams (suggested: English, literature, math and science) are highly encouraged for students who have taken the majority of high school coursework at home. Home-schooled students are eligible for federal student aid for college if they have "completed a secondary school education in a home school setting that is treated as a home school or private school under State law" <ref type="bibr">[Section 484(d)</ref> <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> of the Higher Education Act of 1965].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Timetable for First-Year Students</head><p>All prospective students must complete an application form and submit a $60 nonrefundable application fee. Fee waivers are available for students who have demonstrated financial need or by admission office approval. Any student who submits an application form to SMU will be fully considered for admission. Those who do not submit additional materials <ref type="bibr">(e.g. transcripts, test scores, recommendations, etc.)</ref> to provide sufficient evidence of academic and extra-curricular achievement to earn admission may be denied admission or offered a place on SMU's wait list. First-year applicants are reviewed on the admissions calendar as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Deadline: November 1</head><p>Early Decision 1 (binding) Early Action (nonbinding) Notification Date: By December 31</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Deadline: January 15</head><p>Early Decision 2 (binding) Regular Decision (nonbinding) Notification Date: By April 1 Note: The priority deadline for merit scholarship consideration is January 15. Applications for admission received after January 15 are considered if space is available. Notification will be rolling after April 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required Testing</head><p>SMU requires all applicants, except dual admission applicants to Meadows School of the Arts and students who graduate from secondary schools outside the United States, to submit ACT or SAT scores. Applicants for whom test scores are required may self-report them for admission consideration as long as official test results are on file prior to beginning course work. SMU will superscore an applicant's ACT or SAT scorescombining the highest scores on each section of a test in order to achieve the highest possible ACT composite or SAT combined score. When a student submits both ACT and SAT scores, the admission office will use whichever is higher to make an admission decision. Further, a student's educational record at SMU will include only those test administrations used to compute the highest ACT composite superscore or the highest SAT combined superscore, whichever contributed to the offer of admission. If an applicant submits official ACT or SAT scores, even when not required, those scores will be considered for both admission and scholarship consideration according to this policy.</p><p>Students whose native language is not English and whose entire secondary education has not been in an English-medium school are required to present evidence of their ability to perform academic work and contribute to a classroom in English. Such students should submit one of the following:</p><p>• an official total score of at least 90 on the TOEFL English language proficiency exam with recommended subscores of at least: 20 <ref type="bibr">Reading,</ref><ref type="bibr">20 Listening,</ref><ref type="bibr">24 Speaking,</ref><ref type="bibr">24</ref> Writing. Because SMU values class participation and a writing-intensive curriculum, particular emphasis is placed on speaking and writing skills. Students who score less than 90 are generally not offered admission* to SMU, or • an official score of at least 6.5 on the IELTS Academic English competency test with recommended subscores of at least: 6.5 <ref type="bibr">Reading,</ref><ref type="bibr">6.5 Listening,</ref><ref type="bibr">7.5 Speaking,</ref><ref type="bibr">6.5</ref> Writing. Because SMU values class participation and a writing-intensive curriculum, particular emphasis is placed on speaking and writing skills. Students who score less than 6.5 are generally not offered admission* to SMU, or • an official score of at least 60 on the Pearson Test of English (PTE Academic). Students who score less than 60 are generally not offered admission* to SMU, or • evidence of successful completion of SMU's Intensive English Program with a recommendation for degree study at SMU from the IEP Director. *Students not offered admission to SMU based on English proficiency may be offered conditional admission pending completion of SMU's Intensive English Program (IEP) www.smu.edu/iep. SMU has successfully provided support for English language learners through its IEP and dedicated coursework for students whose first-language is not English. The University uses these tests to provide the best possible path for success to our students whose native language is not English.</p><p>To evaluate more fully a new student's readiness for the SMU classroom, those students offered admission based on scores from one of the above tests must complete an English language placement exercise prior to beginning classes. The results will determine appropriate placement in first-year composition courses. SMU offers such courses to support an English language learner's academic success. In cases where a student's skills are not sufficient to begin for-credit course work, SMU may require the student to complete the Intensive English Program prior to beginning a degree program at SMU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Optional Policy for Dual Admission applicants to SMU Meadows School of the Arts:</head><p>Recognizing that admission to Dual Admission programs in the Meadows School of the Arts (Music, Theatre, Dance, Art, Film-BFA) require an audition or portfolio review to demonstrate an applicant's readiness for their academic program, SMU does not require an ACT or SAT score for admission consideration to those programs. Applicants should submit an SAT or ACT score report for academic merit scholarship consideration. If an applicant submits ACT or SAT scores, those scores will be considered for both admission and scholarship consideration according to the policy described above. Note that students who do not submit test scores will be considered only for artistic scholarships and need-based aid.</p><p>Students who do not submit test scores should list their Meadows major first on the application for admission. Students not admitted to Meadows via their portfolio or audition, but who still wish to be considered for admission to SMU, will be required to submit test scores at that time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consideration for the Performing Arts Auditions/Visual Arts</head><p>In order to pursue one of the Dual Admission Program majors, all first-year and transfer students must be admitted both to the Meadows School of the Arts via audition or portfolio review, as well as to the University via the undergraduate application for admission. Admission to Meadows through the audition or portfolio process does not guarantee admission to the University. Information regarding audition and portfolio requirements and deadlines may be obtained at www.smu.edu/admission/arts or by contacting the Office of Recruitment, Meadows School of the Arts, Southern Methodist University, Dallas TX 75275-0356; phone 214-768-3217. The audition and/or portfolio review is both an admission review and a review for artistic scholarships.</p><p>Transfer students entering degree programs within the Division of Theatre may do so only in the fall term. Transfer students in the Division of Dance, Division of Music, Division of Art, and Division of Film &amp; Media Arts normally enter in the fall term; spring admission may be offered in exceptional cases. Entry in the fall is encouraged as course sequencing for transfer students beginning in the spring could delay graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consideration for the Edwin L. Cox School of Business</head><p>In order to be considered for admission into the Cox School of Business, applicants who gradaute from high school in May 2020 or later must indicate a Cox major as an academic interest on their application. All applications will be processed through the main Admission office. Admission is highly selective, but holistic in nature with an emphasis on a student's academic performance. Students will be notified if they have received admission into the Cox School of Business upon receipt of their acceptance to the University. If a student is not admitted to Cox, they are still eligible for admission to the University if they indicate a second choice academic interest on their application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reserving a Place</head><p>All admitted students are required to submit a nonrefundable $685 deposit and orientation fee. Admitted students who did not apply under a binding decision plan must submit this deposit by the May 1 deadline to reserve a place in the class. Students admitted under a binding decision plan will be notified of their deposit deadline when they are admitted. This deposit includes the nonrefundable housing deposit as well as the matriculation and orientation fees. All first-year and second year students must live on campus unless permission is granted to live at home by the dean of Residence Life and Student Housing. To facilitate advising and enrollment, students are required to submit their final high school transcript confirming graduation prior to enrolling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit by Examination, Audition and Portfolio Review</head><p>Credit by examination policies are reviewed annually and are subject to change for the following academic year. The following policies are for students who matriculate during 2019-2020.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examinations Administered in High School</head><p>SMU grants credit and placement for scores of 4 or 5 on most Advanced Placement examinations taken in high school (see <ref type="table">table below</ref>). Credit will be awarded only for exams taken while in high school. AP test scores are evaluated and SMU course credit is assigned based on the articulation policies in effect for the term students matriculate to the University, regardless of when the test was taken.</p><p>Students may not receive credit for an AP exam, an International Baccalaureate exam and a college course covering the same subject matter; i.e., the course equivalency will only be awarded once. Students may decline all or part of their test credit in favor of taking the equivalent credit at SMU; declining credit is an irrevocable declaration. Credit granted by SMU is not considered resident credit and does not count towards the 60 resident hours required for an SMU degree.</p><p>An official copy of test results must be sent from the testing agency to the University Registrar's Office for credit. To facilitate advising and enrollment, students should submit their official scores no later than the first day of class. Score of 5: credit for 1401 and 1402, and placement in the 4th term course; and, credit for 3rd term course upon successful completion of the 4th term course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AP Examination Scores Credits Course(s) Credited University Curriculum Compenent Satisfied</head><p>Score of 4 or 5: encouraged to take the departmental placement assessment as score on the departmental test may qualify a student for a higher placement and additional credit than the AP score.</p><p>Score of 3: encouraged to take the departmental placement exam for possible placement in either 2nd term or 3rd term course. If placed in the 2nd term course, upon successful completion student will receive credit for 1st term course. If placed in the 3rd term course, and upon successful completion student will receive credit for the 1st and 2nd term courses.  <ref type="bibr">(3 hours)</ref> None</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notes</head><p>• AP credit in the sciences may be used to satisfy the Science and Engineering breadth requirement of the University Curriculum. The UC's Natural and Applied Science depth requirement must be satisfied through coursework at SMU or through transfer credit of a science course with lab from an accredited college or university. • Physics does not award placement credit for labs. • Duplicate credit is not allowed toward an SMU degree. Students who enroll in classes that duplicate Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or other test credit awards will lose these credits after the fifth day of the term. Once credit is revoked, it may not be awarded again. Students must report any credit by exam no later than the end of their first term of enrollment.</p><p>Mathematics. Math credit exams are offered for the courses listed below and must be taken prior to initial enrollment. Calculators are not permitted on these exams, except for MATH 1307. Students interested in credit exams for courses beyond this level may contact the Mathematics Department.</p><p>• MATH 1307 -Introduction to Mathematical Sciences • MATH 1309 -Introduction to Calculus for Business and Social Science (suggested preparation = one full year of high school calculus) • MATH 1337 -Calculus I (suggested preparation = one full year of high school calculus) • MATH 1338 -Calculus II Computer Science. The Computer Science and Engineering Department offers a credit exam for CS 1341 -Principles of Computer Science that must be taken prior to initial enrollment.</p><p>Music. All entering undergraduate students (except transfer students from 4-year NASM schools) are required to take entrance examinations in written music theory and musicianship before classes begin. The date and time of these exams are listed in the "Orientation Schedule" published by the Division of Music each year and emailed to students. Students are advised to make appropriate end-of-summer plans to be present and on time for these exams. Students must be available for the entire testing period, and these exams cannot be made up once the semester begins. Since the exams are used for course section placement, all students are required to take the exams whether or not they are seeking credit by examination.</p><p>All music degrees require coursework in Class Piano. Prospective music majors with no formal piano study should enroll directly in Class Piano during their first semester. Prospective music majors with any amount of formal piano study must be tested individually for placement into the appropriate Class Piano course. Scheduling information for these tests is provided in the "Orientation Schedule" published by the Division of Music each year and emailed to students.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Certificate Programs</head><p>SMU grants credit for the successful completion of the international certificate programs listed below. Credit granted by SMU is not considered resident credit and does not count towards the 60 resident hours required for an SMU degree. In certain cases, departmental examinations may be required as a part of the evaluation process.</p><p>1. The International Baccalaureate. Six to eight credits will be awarded for scores of 5, 6 or 7 on International Baccalaureate higher-level exams in transferable subjects, with a maximum award of 32 credits. Students will not be awarded credit for standard-level exams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IB HL Examination Scores Credits Course(s) Credited</head><p>• The Language A exam is typically taken in the native language of the student.</p><p>• Language B is a second, third or fourth language studied by the student.</p><p>• For "all other languages" under Language A and for Language B, the course prefix will match the world language completed. • IB credit in the sciences may be used to satisfy the Science and Engineering breadth requirement of the University Curriculum. The UC's Natural and Applied Science depth requirement must be satisfied through coursework at SMU or through transfer credit of a science course with lab from an accredited college or university. • Physics does not award IB credit for labs.</p><p>• Students enrolled in courses at SMU for which IB credit has previously been awarded will have the IB credit rescinded, and the grade in the course will count toward the student's SMU GPA. Students are responsible for knowing and reporting their IB scores to SMU to prevent duplicate enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent Dual Credit/College Programs</head><p>Students may receive credit for college courses taken prior to graduation from high school if the courses meet the criteria for transfer work outlined in the Transfer Admission Criteria section of this catalog. Dual Credit may not be used to satisfy the second language requirement of the University Curriculum. Official college transcripts are required for all college-level work attempted, regardless of transferability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Admission Criteria</head><p>Selection of transfer applicants is based on several criteria, including academic curriculum, performance, grade patterns, behavioral and extracurricular activities, as well as other relevant experiences. For all candidates who are not entering SMU directly from high school, the Admission Committee considers the rigor of the courses attempted. All transfer students are required to complete college algebra or a collegelevel math course before transferring to SMU. If algebra l, geometry and algebra II were taken in high school and graduation was fewer than three years ago, this requirement is waived. We recommend that all transfer applicants should have completed at least one course in English composition, a lab science, a math course beyond college algebra and at least one course pertaining to the applicant's intended major. The committee weighs overall academic performance as well as evidence of recent improvement. For some applicants, high school performance is also a factor. Candidates with fewer than 30 hours are considered on an individual basis and may be asked to submit additional information. Transfer students with fewer than 24 credits at the time of matriculation will follow the same University Curriculum requirements as first year students. Although the average GPA of successful transfer applicants is considerably higher, applicants with a transfer GPA below 2.700 (on a 4.000 scale) are not typically successful in gaining admission. Candidates with a transferable GPA below 2.000 are not competitive for admission to the University.</p><p>Competitive applicants for admission will have completed the equivalent of one of the following math courses:</p><p>• MATH 1307 -Introduction to Mathematical Sciences • MATH 1309 -Introduction to Calculus for Business and Social Science • MATH 1337 -Calculus I • STAT 2331 -Introduction to Statistical Methods Students with more than 30 transferable hours may be admitted directly to the school of their intended major if the admission requirement of that school has been met. The specific requirements for admission into each of SMU's undergraduate schools are outlined in the admission section of that school's information in this catalog.</p><p>All transfer students who intend to major in dance, music or theatre must also audition. Art majors and students seeking a B.F.A. in film and media arts are required to submit a portfolio for consideration. Requirements and contact information are available in the First-Year Admission Criteria section under the heading Performing Arts Auditions/Visual Arts Consideration.</p><p>Prospective transfer students must complete an Undergraduate Application for Transfer Admission and submit a $60 nonrefundable application fee. An official academic transcript that includes the last completed term from each college or university attended must be sent to SMU Undergraduate Admission, PO Box 750181, Dallas, TX 75275-0181. In addition, applicants must submit a Statement of Good Disciplinary Standing from their current college or university.</p><p>A final high school transcript (or GED high school equivalency test results), required of all transfer applicants, should be sent to the address above to confirm high school diploma as well as world language and math background. A high school transcript and SAT or ACT scores, are required when less than 30 transferable hours have been earned. SAT or ACT exam results will not be required of students for whom five or more years have lapsed since high school or high school equivalent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>Regardless of the number of transferable credit hours completed elsewhere, University policy requires that of the 122 minimum credit hours required for a degree, at least 60 hours must be SMU credit hours. That is, they must be earned in SMU courses, SMU credits or SMU-approved international programs.</p><p>No transfer credit is given for any correspondence course or work completed at a school that is not accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency. Only grades of C-or better in comparable courses are transferable to SMU for accepted students. Vocational-technical courses, courses below college level, credit by examination earned at another college or university, and PE activity courses in excess of two hours do not transfer. For courses not taught at SMU locations or in SMU-approved international programs, free-elective transfer credit (FETC) may be awarded for appropriate courses completed with a grade of Cor better at regionally accredited colleges or universities that meet SMU's academic standards. FETC is assigned by the various school records offices for transferability, or used by the Office of the University Registrar if courses are considered transferable but lack sufficient information to determine an exact equivalency. Similarly, Business Elective Transfer Credit (BETC) is used to award transfer credit by the Cox School of Business' Office of BBA Academic Advising, Records and Special Programs, for transferable courses where there is not an equivalent business course prefix.</p><p>All grades for transferable courses are used to calculate the transfer GPA. Exceptions are made for repeated courses where the grades in the first attempts were D+ or lower. In these cases, only grades in the last attempts of the repeated courses prior to matriculation at SMU are used to calculate the transfer GPA, even if lower. Courses must be repeated at the same institution in which the original grade was earned or carry the same course number based on a statewide course numbering system. For repeated courses where the grade in the first attempt was a C-or higher, both grades will be used to calculate the transfer GPA but credit will be awarded for only one successful attempt. Transfer course grades are not calculated in major/minor GPAs. A grade of W (Withdrawn) is not used to calculate the transferable GPA. A grade of I (Incomplete) or a missing grade is calculated as F. A grade of IP (In Progress) for a current term is not calculated. This grade replacement policy for eligible transfer courses will be used in all transfer and allcollege GPA calculations and other academic determinations at SMU. For a complete list of how grades are calculated please see the smu.edu/transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note:</head><p>For some majors requiring a subset of courses and specific GPAs for entry, the subset GPA is calculated using the first graded attempt of these courses, even if the first attempt of the course was failed or later repeated.</p><p>Official college transcripts are required for all college-level work attempted, regardless of transferability. Transcripts must be sent directly to SMU from the institution attended. A transcript issued to a student is acceptable provided it is received in a sealed, letterhead envelope with the institution's Office of the Registrar stamp. Transcripts must be dated fewer than three years prior to processing. Coursework from one institution that appears on an official transcript from another institution will not be accepted for transfer credit. An official transcript must be issued by each institution attended. Photocopies of transcripts provided by other institutions are not acceptable.</p><p>An online version of the transfer credit evaluation is available to transfer students prior to their enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Transcript Credit</head><p>All international university transcripts must be accompanied by a professional evaluation and an official transcript, including an English translation if it is not in English, and course descriptions or syllabi. It is the student's responsibility to procure this evaluation and to assume financial responsibility for it. An exception to this requirement is an exchange agreement between SMU and an international institution that is modeled after the U.S. education system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reserving a Place</head><p>All degree-seeking admitted transfer students wishing to enroll at SMU are required to submit a $420 transfer orientation and matriculation deposit to reserve a place in the academic program. This $420 deposit should be sent to the Office of Admission. Space can be guaranteed only to those students who have submitted the deposit by the deadline noted in the acceptance packet. Note: This $420 deposit is nonrefundable. Students seeking financial aid should wait until they receive their financial aid award before submitting a deposit.</p><p>Note that admitted transfer students cannot enroll at SMU until their final transcript has been received and evaluated for transferability and a Good Standing Form has been received from their last institution. For this reason, transfer students entering for the fall term are discouraged from attending the second summer term at their current institution before matriculation to SMU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Housing Deposit</head><p>Housing accommodations are offered on a space-available basis for new transfer students who are 20 or older. Transfer students who are 17-19 years old live on campus unless permission is granted to live at home by the dean of Residence Life and Student Housing. Housing links will be sent to interested transfer students once the student has been accepted and has sent a nonrefundable deposit of $520, which includes an additional $100 housing deposit, to the Office of Admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Student Admission</head><p>International citizens and U.S. passport holders studying outside the United States who apply to SMU as first-year and transfer undergraduate students are expected to meet all requirements for admission.</p><p>For admission consideration, students for whom English is not the native language and whose entire high school curriculum was not in an English-medium school are required to submit a test score from an internationally recognized English language test as explained in the Required Testing section of this catalog.</p><p>Students who are otherwise admissible but whose English proficiency scores are slightly below those mentioned above may be offered conditional admission pending successful completion of SMU's Intensive English Program prior to matriculation. Transfer students from U.S. institutions without an internationally recognized English language test score will be evaluated on the basis of college-level grades in English composition/rhetoric courses. All students whose English composition courses were completed at a university outside the United States are required to complete an SMU English language placement exam for appropriate course-placement.</p><p>International transfer students who have completed college-level work at a university outside the United States are required to submit the following (in English or with an English translation):</p><p>• An official transcript.</p><p>• Course descriptions.</p><p>• Professional evaluation. (More information is found in the International Tran-script Credit section of this catalog.) The expenses to be incurred in attending the University are listed in the Financial Information section of this catalog. Additional costs that international students may expect include room and board during school holidays, travel expenses, international student health insurance, and the international student fee (foreign passport holders only). Need-based financial aid is not available for international students; however, firstyear international students will be considered for academic scholarships if their application is complete by the January 15 deadline. Some academic scholarships require an SAT or ACT for consideration. Transfer international applicants will be considered for all transfer scholarships for which they are eligible, provided the appropriate application deadline has been met.</p><p>When an international student has been admitted, paid the appropriate enrollment deposit and provided adequate proof of sufficient financial funds, the International Student and Scholar Services Office will issue the I-20 Certificate of Eligibility. The student will be required to produce the I-20, acceptance letter and proof of finances when applying at the U.S. embassy or consulate for a student visa.</p><p>All international students taking one or more credit hours must enroll in the University-offered health insurance plan unless they have a special waiver granted by SMU's Dr. Bob Smith Health Center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission for Military Veteran</head><p>SMU welcomes applications from military veterans. Student veterans meet under-graduate admission criteria of the University as first year or transfer students. Veterans are considered for first-year admission if they graduated from high school within the last three years and have not completed any college coursework. Student veterans seeking to be competitive in the transfer admission process should have 24 or more term credit hours at a previous accredited college or university and a recommended 2.700 cumulative GPA (on a 4.000 scale). Additional information is available online at www.smu.edu/EnrollmentServices/Veterans and www.smu.edu/apply ("First Year Students" or "Transfer Students" links).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Visiting Students</head><p>Visiting students are those who enroll in University courses for credit, but who do not intend to pursue an SMU degree. This category of students is normally limited to those who 1) are degree-seeking students in good standing and visiting from another four-year college or university, 2) have already earned a degree, or 3) are participants in special SMU initiatives such as concurrent or summer enrollment opportunities for college and high school students. Visiting students are admitted through the Division of Enrollment Services based on their likelihood to be successful in and benefit from SMU coursework as evidenced from their academic, behavioral and extracurricular history. They are eligible to register -on a space available basis -in classes for which they have satisfied SMU's prerequisites. Visiting students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.000 or better in order to continue their studies at SMU. Failure to maintain the appropriate GPA standard may result in removal from the program. Admission as a visiting student does not qualify a student for admission to a degree program at SMU. Applications for visiting students are found at www.smu.edu/visitingstudent or may be obtained by emailing visitingstudent@smu.edu; phone 214-768-4272.</p><p>Visiting students from international colleges and universities whose entire curriculum is not taught in English are required to submit a test score from an internationally recognized English language test as explained under Required Testing in the Admission section of the catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission of Students</head><p>If a student in good standing withdraws from SMU for one term, the student's file remains active and the student is able to register as though in continuous enrollment at the University (re-entry). Students who left on probation will return on probation. All holds must be cleared prior to enrollment. Re-entry students are responsible for meeting all financial aid, housing and advising deadlines.</p><p>After nonattendance for two or more regular (fall, spring) terms, students who formerly attended SMU, including those who have completed a degree, are required to submit an application for reinstatement or reactivation through the Division of Enrollment Services, Undergraduate Admission. The application is available at www.smu.edu/admission ("Apply" tab). Any student who has been suspended is also required to apply for reinstatement. Students who have been suspended are required to attach to their reinstatement application a statement indicating the reasons why they now are prepared to return to SMU. Although the Division of Enrollment Services facilitates the application process, an academic dean or the Committee on Academic Appeals determines reinstatement.</p><p>A student who has already earned an undergraduate degree at SMU and is seeking an additional undergraduate degree must apply for reactivation if the student has not attended SMU for two or more regular (fall, spring) terms.</p><p>Returning students are strongly advised to apply for reactivation or reinstatement at least 60 days prior to the start of the term of re-entry. Returning students should note that separate applications exist for financial aid and residence halls and that they should contact these offices as early as possible. The deadline for filing this application and supporting materials for domestic students is one month prior to the first day of classes of the term of re-entry. International applicants must apply at least one month prior to the term of re-entry; however, they are encouraged to apply at least 90 days in advance in order to facilitate the immigration process. In addition, the availability of academic advising and courses may be limited immediately prior to and at the beginning of the term.</p><p>All students who return to SMU after any period of nonenrollment must forward official transcripts from each college or university attended since last enrolled at SMU. If the last term of enrollment at SMU was prior to fall 2000, official transcripts from each college or university attended prior to SMU also must be forwarded to the Division of Enrollment Services.</p><p>Students should be aware of specific policies regarding transfer courses taken after matriculation to SMU (see Transfer Courses from Other Institutions in the Academic Records and General and Enrollment Standards section of this catalog). In addition, each college within SMU has specific policies regarding reinstatement, reactivation, transfer credit and statute of limitations, so students should refer to their school's section of this catalog for that information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Forgiveness</head><p>SMU's academic forgiveness policy permits a student to have academic work taken 10 or more years prior to the term of admission or readmission forgiven. Forgiven hours will not be included in the GPA nor used for actions such as the determination of admission, academic probation, suspension, honors, scholarships and graduation. Students should see the Academic Records and General and Enrollment Standards section in this catalog for details of this policy. The academic forgiveness application is available through the Division of Enrollment Services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Matriculation to the University</head><p>Final matriculation to SMU is contingent upon the student maintaining the same academic and behavioral record on which the University based its offer of admission. In addition to the nonrefundable deposit (and housing application and deposit for those seeking on-campus housing), the following items are required for final matriculation to the University:</p><p>Official Final Transcript. All new students must supply a final, official transcript from the institution(s) previously attended. In addition to final grades and degrees awarded, the transcript must bear an official seal of the school and signature of its certifying official.</p><p>Official Test Scores. Students entering SMU as first-year students must have official ACT or SAT scores on file that match those on which the University based its offer of admission, if such scores were a requirement of their admission application. Official scores are those that come directly from the testing agency or appear on the student's high school transcript that bears an official seal of the school and signature of its certifying official. If the student submitted such scores as part of the application process, there is no need to submit them again.</p><p>Immunizations. All students (undergraduate, graduate, part-time and full-time, to include international and IEP/ESL students) are required to have an SMU medical history form on file in the SMU Memorial Health Center before registration. To comply with SMU policy, all students must also submit to the health center their immunization records that provide proof of immunization against measles, mumps and rubella. These MMR immunizations must be documented by a physician, public health record, military health record or school health record. Students will not be allowed to register without immunization compliance. Texas state law requires that all new students under the age of 22 must provide documentation demonstrating they have been vaccinated against bacterial meningitis. The documentation must show evidence that a meningitis vaccine or booster was given during the five-year period preceding and at least 10 days prior to the first day of class of the student's first term. Students should provide the documentation at least 10 days before the first day of class. Students seeking exemption from this requirement due to health risk or conscience, including religious belief, should see the second page of the SMU medical history health form.</p><p>Students are encouraged to check their my.SMU account for immunization status. Immunizations are available at the health center. Health history forms are available on the health center's website.</p><p>Health Insurance. To ensure that students have appropriate health care coverage, SMU requires all domestic students taking nine or more credit hours, both undergraduate and graduate, to have health insurance through either an individual/family plan or the University-offered plan. All international students taking one or more credit hours must enroll in the University-offered plan unless they have a special waiver granted by the SMU's Dr. Bob Smith Health Center.</p><p>International Student Compliance. Students who have been issued an SMU I20 or DS2019 immigration document student visa (F/J visa) must complete the International Student Compliance online tutorial and must attend a required government check-in process with the International Student and Scholar Services Office prior to enrolling for classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuition, Fees and Financial Aid Tuition, Fees and Living Expenses</head><p>The Financial Information Bulletin is issued each academic year. It provides the general authority and reference for SMU financial regulations and obligations, as well as detailed information concerning tuition, fees and living expenses.</p><p>Continuing students registering must ensure that payment for the full amount of charges is posted to their account by the payment due date showing on their bill. The due dates are also published on the Bursar website.</p><p>Billing notifications are sent to the student's SMU email address and to the designated authorized payer(s) email address when a bill is generated. The billing notification will provide instructions on how to view the bill online through SMUpay. If notification is not received two weeks prior to the due date, the student and/or designated authorized payer(s) should contact the Office of the University Bursar.</p><p>Payments made in person or mailed must be received by the Office of the University Bursar, located on the first floor of the Laura Lee Blanton Student Services Building, no later than 4 p.m. Central Time on the payment due date. Payments made online via electronic check or credit card must be posted no later than 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the payment due date. Students and/or those paying on behalf of students who pay online automatically receive an electronic confirmation of payment; students and/or designated authorized payer(s) paying through other methods can also verify receipt of payment online.</p><p>Students enrolling after the payment due date must pay at the time of enrollment. Students whose accounts are not cleared by the payment due date or at the time of enrollment are subject to a late payment fee of $50 for balances between $250 and $999.99, and $150 for balances between $1,000 and $5,000. Balances more than $5,000 are charged 3 percent of the outstanding balance, not to exceed $750. Also, after the monthly payment due date has passed, a 1.5 percent past due fee will be assessed on the unpaid student and/or miscellaneous account each month until the balance is paid. The enrollment of students whose accounts remain unpaid after the payment due date may be canceled at the discretion of the University. Students are individually responsible for their financial obligations to the University.</p><p>All refunds except federal parent PLUS loans, prepayment accounts, the SMU Monthly TuitionPay Payment Plan and international wires will be made payable to the student. A credit card payment will only be refunded to the student if federal student loans have been applied to their account. International wires will be refunded by wire to the originating wire account less a $35 wire-processing fee. The PLUS loan borrower can request the refund to be processed to the student by submitting a Parent PLUS Release form, located on the Bursar website. If the refund is issued by check, the student may request, in writing, that the refund be sent to another party.</p><p>Any outstanding debts to the University will be deducted from the credit balance prior to issuing a refund. Any outstanding debts to the University that include Title IV funds must have an Authorization to Credit Account form and/or an Authorization to Credit Account Parent form on file in order to transfer funds to cover current award year debts. Students need to sign the ACA form and the federal parent PLUS loan borrower needs to sign the ACAP form.</p><p>Any outstanding debts to the University that do not include Title IV funds will be deducted from the credit balance prior to issuing a refund. All other debts should be paid directly by the student.</p><p>A student whose University account is overdue or who in any other manner has an unpaid financial obligation to the University will be denied the recording and certification services of the Office of the Registrar, including the issuance of a transcript or diploma, and may be denied readmission until all obligations are fulfilled. The Division of Enrollment Services may stop the registration, or may cancel the completed registration, of a student who has a delinquent account or debt, and may assess all attorney's fees and other reasonable collection costs (up to 50 percent) and charges necessary for the collection of any amount not paid when due. Matriculation in the University constitutes an agreement by the student to comply with all University rules, regulations and policies.</p><p>Applications for financial assistance should be submitted well in advance of registration in accordance with recommended filing dates set forth by the Division of Enrollment Services, Office of Financial Aid. Applications received after the recommended deadline can expect a delay in application processing time due to the increased volume. This will ultimately delay disbursement of financial aid to the student account. Students and families are expected to clear all billed charged by the published billing due dates regardless of the status of their financial aid application. Any funds that disburse to the student account after the payment due date has passed, will be applied to any outstanding charges first. Remaining financial aid funds will be refunded to the student.</p><p>During the registration process, students will be prompted to read and agree to the Student Rights and Responsibilities, which provides information regarding financial rights and obligations, SMU's Honor Code, the Code of Conduct, and the student appeals and complaints process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuition Refunds for Withdrawal From the University</head><p>No refunds of tuition or fees will be considered without an official withdrawal. Policies for official withdrawal, including medical and mandatory administrative withdrawal, are found under Withdrawal From the University in the Academic Records and General and Enrollment Standards section of this catalog.</p><p>Reduction of tuition and fees is determined by the effective date of the withdrawal and is based on the schedule listed in the Financial Information Bulletin and the SMU Bursar website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial aid implications of withdrawing from the University</head><p>Federal regulations require schools to adjust financial aid when a student officially withdraws from the University before completing 60% of the term. Financial aid is reduced to a pro-rated amount based on the amount of time the student was enrolled in classes in that specific term, thus "earning" financial aid proportionate to the amount of time enrolled. The "unearned" portion of aid will be returned to the funding source. Students completing 60% or more of a term are considered to have earned 100% of their financial aid for that term. This federally mandated calculation is completely independent of university's refund policies for withdrawals and may require a reduction in financial aid even if there is no reduction in tuition charges. The end result could create a substantial student account balance after the withdrawal is processed. For this reason, students are strongly encouraged to contact their financial aid adviser, before initiating a withdrawal, to discuss the financial implications of withdrawing. For additional information on the University's tuition refund policies, see the SMU Financial Information Bulletin or the University Bursar's website. Information on the implications of withdrawing on your financial aid can be found on the Office of Financial Aid website.</p><p>Medical withdrawals and mandatory administrative withdrawals allow a prorated refund of tuition and fees and must be initiated through the academic adviser or academic Dean's office.</p><p>tuition and fees.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SMU Satisfactory Progress Measures for Federal, State and Institutional Financial Aid Eligibility</head><p>In accordance with the Higher Education Act of 1965 and federal policy, SMU maintains requirements of Satisfactory Academic Progress for students receiving federal financial aid. The standards below are also used for state and institutional funds. Students who are enrolling for a fifth year of undergraduate studies and are seeking institutional financial assistance must provide a written appeal to the financial aid office and, as appropriate, must file financial aid applications (FAFSA and CSS/PROFILE) as well as obtain degree completion plans from their academic adviser.</p><p>Satisfactory academic progress is measured at the end of spring term each year until the student graduates. Undergraduate students must meet three measures:</p><p>1. Qualitative Measure: At the end of spring term, a student must be making satisfactory academic progress measured by the student's cumulative GPA of 2.000 or better, which is the standard for graduation at SMU. 2. Quantitative Measure: At the end of spring term, a student must be making satisfactory academic progress measured by determining if the student has passed 75 percent of the classes he/she attempted during the academic year. 3. Program Time and Term Limits: Attempted hours cannot exceed the number of hours required to earn the degree by more than 150%. The same measurement applies to the number of terms attended. The number of terms attended cannot exceed the number of terms required to earn a degree by more than 150%. Students exceeding 150% are not eligible to receive federal, state or institutional aid. A student that fails one or more of these measurements does not meet the minimum requirements for satisfactory academic progress and is, therefore, ineligible for financial aid funding. Eligibility may be reestablished by increasing academic performance back to a satisfactory level. Students may also regain eligibility on a temporary, or probationary, basis by submitting an appeal to the Office of Financial Aid for review. Information on the appeal process is available on the Office of Financial aid website.</p></div>

The inculcation of personal standards of honesty and integrity is a goal of education in all the disciplines of the University.</p><p>The faculty has the responsibility of encouraging and maintaining an atmosphere of academic honesty by being certain that students are aware of the value of it, understand the regulations defining it and know the penalties for departing from it. The faculty should, as far as is reasonably possible, assist students in avoiding the temptation to cheat. Faculty members must be aware that permitting dishonesty is not open to personal choice. A professor or instructor who is unwilling to act upon offenses is an accessory with the student offender in deteriorating the integrity of the University.</p><p>Students must share the responsibility for creating and maintaining an atmosphere of honesty and integrity. Students should be aware that personal experience in completing assigned work is essential to learning. Permitting others to prepare their work, using published or unpublished summaries as a substitute for studying required material, or giving or receiving unauthorized assistance in the preparation of work to be submitted are directly contrary to the honest process of learning. Students who are aware that others in a course are cheating or otherwise acting dishonestly have the responsibility to inform the professor and/or bring an accusation to the Honor Council.</p><p>Students and faculty members must share the knowledge that any dishonest practices permitted will make it more difficult for the honest students to be evaluated and graded fairly and will damage the integrity of the whole University. Students should recognize that their own interests and their integrity as individuals would suffer if they condone dishonesty in others.</p></div>

Honor codes for graduate students enrolled in the Cox School of Business, Dedman School of Law, Perkins School of Theology and Simmons School of Education and Human Development are explained in their graduate catalogs.</p><p>In support of the Honor Code, the Honor Council has the responsibility to maintain and promote academic integrity. The Honor Council is composed of a minimum of 27 members selected through an application and interview process organized by the Honor Council Executive Board.</p><p>Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, cheating, academic sabotage, facilitating academic dishonesty and fabrication. Plagiarism is prohibited in all papers, projects, take-home exams or any other assignments in which the student submits another's work as being his or her own. Cheating is defined as intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise. Academic sabotage is defined as intentionally taking any action that negatively affects the academic work of another student. Facilitating academic dishonesty is defined as intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of the Honor Code. Fabrication is defined as intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise.</p><p>Suspected cases of academic dishonesty may be handled administratively by the appropriate faculty member in whose class the alleged infraction occurred or referred to the Honor Council for resolution. Suspected violations reported to the Honor Council by a student or by an instructor will be investigated and, if the evidence warrants, a hearing will be held by a board composed of a quorum of four members of the Honor Council.</p><p>Any appeal of an action taken by the Honor Council shall be submitted to the University Conduct Council in writing no later than four calendar days (excluding school holidays) after notification of the Honor Council's decision.</p></div>

At SMU, the student is assumed to have a high degree of loyalty and responsibility to the University and its well-being, as well as to himself or herself in personal, social and intellectual pursuits; the student's behavior both on and off campus is evidence of this.</p><p>Students at SMU will discover that they are encouraged to exercise a great amount of personal freedom as well as accompanying responsibilities. Through their personal capacities for intelligent thought and action, mature students understand that there are situations in which certain behavior must be modified for the benefit of others. The University stands firm in its commitments to the rights and freedoms of students, expecting in return the same respect and concern.</p><p>Due respect for the entire University community, faculty, staff and one's fellow students is always expected. The University expects all students to be responsible citizens and to abide by all federal, state and local laws. The University Code of Conduct applies to students both on and off campus. It is the University's expectation that students will avoid behaviors such as, but not limited to, the misuse of drugs and alcohol, dishonesty, gambling, hazing, or behavior that endangers or threatens to endanger the health and safety of any person.</p><p>Students are required to identify themselves when asked by a properly identified faculty or staff member, or by another student serving as a University staff member.

The purpose of the conduct review process is to encourage personal responsibility.</p><p>Depending on the degree of misconduct, a student may be subject to sanctions ranging from an informal warning to expulsion from the University. In addition, a student may be assigned educational sanctions designed to promote personal growth and development. Should a student be asked to leave the University, he or she should do so in an expeditious and peaceful manner. The student should remain off campus until he or she receives written permission from the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Community Standards to return to campus. In the event of such separation, a student is still responsible for University financial obligations.</p><p>To ensure fairness and due process for all students in the conduct process, the student is granted an impartial hearing and the right to appeal to the University Conduct Council. A student who is appealing a sanction may remain in school until the decision and penalty are reviewed, unless otherwise determined by the Dean of Students, the Vice President for Student Affairs, or their designee. All actions related to the conduct review process are subject to presidential review. empowering spaces for students to develop as leaders through purposeful learning, educational, and advocacy opportunities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment and Academic Records</head><p>The standards herein are applicable to all students at the University and constitute the basic authority and reference for matters pertaining to University academic regulations and records management. Enrollment in the University is a declaration of acceptance of all University rules and regulations. A complete University Policy Manual is available at www.smu.edu/policy. Additional information regarding rules and regulations of the University can be found in this catalog. Undergraduate students must follow the University-wide requirements that are in effect for the academic year of matriculation to SMU. The applicable requirements of majors and minors are those in effect during the academic year of matriculation to SMU or those of a subsequent academic year. Students may not follow a catalog for an academic year in effect prior to their matriculation term. Students who are not enrolled for three or more years will return to SMU under the current catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Policies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidentiality of Education Records</head><p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 is a federal law that grants students the right to inspect, obtain copies of, challenge, and, to a degree, control the release of information contained in their education records. The act and regulations are very lengthy, and for that reason, SMU has issued its own FERPA-based guidelines that are available at the University Registrar's Office FERPA website www.smu.edu/FERPA. Policy 1.10 of the University Policy Manual also discusses this law.</p><p>In general, no personally identifiable information from a student's education record will be disclosed to any third party without written consent from the student. Several exceptions exist, including these selected examples: 1) information defined by SMU as directory information may be released unless the student requests through my.SMU Student Homepage that it be withheld, 2) information authorized by the student through my.SMU Student Homepage may be released to those individuals designated by the student and 3) information may be released to a parent or guardian if the student is declared financially dependent upon the parent or guardian as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Additional information is available at www.smu.edu/FERPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student File Number</head><p>The University assigns each student an eight-digit SMU identification number, which is used to verify each student's identity and is provided without additional charges. The student should furnish the SMU ID number on all forms when requested, as this number is the primary means the University has to verify the identity for each student's academic records and transactions related to the records.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Name Change</head><p>A student who has a change in name must provide the University Registrar's Office with his or her Social Security card or the form issued by the Social Security Administration. A valid passport may also be used to complete a name change. Enrollment or records services for the student under a name different from the last enrollment cannot be accomplished without one of the above documents. All transcripts and diplomas are issued only under a person's legal name as recorded by the University Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preferred Name</head><p>Students who wish to use a name other than their legal name can add a preferred name to their file in addition to their primary/legal name, or update a preferred name already on file, using the self service functions in the my.SMU Student Homepage. The University will make efforts to use the preferred name in communications and in the course of university business. However, there are situations that due to business practices, legal requirements or system limitations the use of a primary/legal name will be used.</p><p>SMU has many offices that keep records with student names and many data systems used for specific applications. In addition to updating their preferred name in my.SMU, students may need to notify some offices regarding their use of a preferred name.</p><p>A preferred name is a first, middle and/or last name that may be chosen to be used instead of legal first, middle and last name. There is no documentation required to create or change a preferred name. Students are advised that if they choose to use a preferred name, they should use it consistently and resist changing it frequently. Students also are advised that the use of a preferred last name can lead to confusion with employers and organizations in attempting to match official educational records with applications and it is recommended that students provide both their preferred and legal names on applications.</p><p>Here is a partial list of standard name usage: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Email and Mailing Addresses, Telephone, and Emergency Contact</head><p>Each student must provide the University Registrar's Office with both a home and local address, both a home and local telephone number and contact information of a designated emergency contact using the self-service functions in the my.SMU Student Homepage. Students enrolling at SMU authorize the University to notify their emergency contacts in the event of a situation affecting their health, safety, or physical or mental well-being, and to provide these contacts with information related to the situation.</p><p>Students who enroll in an arranged section course will be asked to provide the University Registrar's Office with an off-campus study address. This is the physical location the student is living while enrolled in this course.</p><p>When a student applies for graduation and becomes a candidate they can provide a diploma address (address to which they would like their diploma mailed) to the University Registrar's Office.</p><p>International students are required to provide a residence address (physical street address where they are currently living) as their mailing (local) address. International students will be prevented from enrolling if a U.S. address is not provided.</p><p>Students are expected to keep current all their addresses and telephone numbers, including emergency contact details, through my.SMU, the University's Web-based self-service system. Students may be prevented from enrolling if their information is insufficient or outdated. Changes to parent information should be reported by contacting records@smu.edu, and the email should include the student's full name and SMU student ID number.</p><p>The University issues all students an email address. Students may have other email addresses, but the University-assigned email address is the official address for University electronic correspondence, including related communications with faculty members and academic units.</p><p>Official University correspondence may be sent to students' mailing addresses or SMU email addresses on file. It is the responsibility of students to keep all their addresses current and to regularly check communications sent to them since they are responsible for complying with requests, deadlines and other requirements sent to any of their mailing addresses on file or to their SMU email.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell Phones</head><p>The University requests that students provide mobile/cell telephone numbers, as they are one means of communicating with students during an emergency. Mobile/cell telephone numbers may also be used by University officials conducting routine business. Students who do not have a mobile/cell telephone or do not wish to report the numbers should provide this information to the University through my.SMU Student Homepage. Students may be prevented from enrolling if their mobile/cell telephone numbers are not on file or if they have not declared "no cell" or "prefer not to report" in my.SMU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethnicity</head><p>SMU requires that a valid ethnic group category be on file for all students. SMU's policies and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 protect the confidentiality and privacy of this information. A student's ethnic group category can be viewed in my.SMU Student Homepage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents.</head><p>Ethnicity is self-determined. Students of multiple ethnic backgrounds may select multiple ethnic group categories. If the ethnic group value is incorrect, the student should go to the University Registrar's Office in the Laura Lee Blanton Student Services Building and complete an Ethnic/Racial Category Update Form.</p><p>International Students Living in the U.S. While Attending School. Selecting an ethnic group category is not required unless the student becomes a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcript Service</head><p>A transcript is an official document of the permanent academic record maintained by the University Registrar's Office. The permanent academic record includes all SMU courses attempted, all grades assigned, degrees received and a summary of transfer hours accepted. Official transcripts and certifications of student academic records are issued by the University Registrar's Office for all students. Copies of high school records and transfer transcripts from other schools must be requested from the institutions where the coursework was taken.</p><p>Transcripts are $12.25 per copy. Additional copies in the same request mailed to the same address are $3.50. Additional copies mailed to different addresses are $12.25 a copy. PDF transcripts are $16.00 per email address and are available only for students who attended after summer 1996.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note:</head><p>No incomplete or partial transcripts, including only certain courses or grades, are issued.</p><p>Transcripts cannot be released unless the student has satisfied all financial and other obligations to the University. Instructions for requesting a transcript to be mailed or picked up on campus are available at www.smu.edu/registrar ("Transcript Requests" link). A student may request his or her official transcript through the online my.SMU Student Homepage. Requests are processed through the National Student Clearinghouse. Telephone and email requests are not accepted. Students or their specified third party can pick up their transcripts at the University Registrar's Office, 101 Blanton Student Services Building.</p><p>Transcripts may be released to a third party as specified by the student on the Student's Consent for SMU to Release Information to Student's Specified Third Party form accessible at www.smu.edu/LegalDisclosures/FERPA/Forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note:</head><p>Chapter 675, <ref type="bibr">S.B. 302</ref>. Acts of the 61st Texas <ref type="bibr">Legislature, 1969</ref> Regular Session, provides as follows: Section I. No person may buy, sell, create, duplicate, alter, give or obtain; or attempt to buy, sell, create, duplicate, alter, give or obtain a diploma, certificate, academic record, certificate of enrollment or other instrument which purports to signify merit or achievement conferred by an institution of education in this state with the intent to use fraudulently such document or to allow the fraudulent use of such document. Section II. A person who violates this act or who aids another in violating this act is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 and/or confinement in the county jail for a period not to exceed one year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Veterans</head><p>The University Registrar's Office certifies veterans each term for their benefits under federal programs, including the Yellow Ribbon Program. Most academic programs at SMU qualify for U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs benefits, making an SMU education accessible and affordable. Veterans are required to provide specific documents before they can be certified with the VA's Veterans Benefits Administration. Specific information regarding the certification process is available from the University Registrar's Office at www.smu.edu/enrollmentServices/Veterans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Examination</head><p>Final course examinations shall be given in all courses where they are appropriate, must be administered as specified on the official examination schedule and shall not be administered during the last week of classes.</p><p>Exceptions to the examination schedule may be made only upon written recommendation of the chair of the department sponsoring the course and with the concurrence of the dean of that school, who will allow exceptions only in accordance with guidelines from the Office of the Provost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complaint Procedures for Students With Disabilities</head><p>The complaint procedures for students with disabilities are available in the Disability Accommodations and Success Strategies office, Loyd Center, Suite 202 and online at www.smu.edu/Provost/ALEC/DASS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification of Students</head><p>A student's classification is determined by the number of hours earned or by the degree-seeking status of the student: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Hour Loads</head><p>The unit of measure for the valuation of courses is the credit hour. Based upon the federal definition of a credit hour, each credit hour requires one hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours per week of preparation on the part of students, for approximately 15 weeks a term. Most courses are valued for three credit hours, i.e., three contact hours per week and at least six hours of preparation. For threecredit-hour courses deployed via different course types, modes of delivery, or calendars, total number of direct contact hours should be equal to or greater than 45 hours, with the total out-of-class work equal to or greater than 90 hours. Courses that deviate from this standard must provide documentation illustrating how the number of contact hours and/or work outside the course equate to this standard within the term in which the course is offered.</p><p>A full-time load in the fall and spring is 12 credit hours for undergraduates. For the summer term (all sessions in the summer term combined) a full-time load is nine hours for undergraduates. On request an undergraduate can be certified as full-time for the first or second session of the summer term at six hours. Students who enroll for fewer than these minimum hours are designated part-time students. The normal undergraduate enrollment for each of the regular terms is 15 credit hours. An undergraduate student enrolled in an engineering co-op course or enrolled for six hours of student teaching is considered a fulltime student.</p><p>Cautionary Note: Federal financial aid agencies and some other agencies require a minimum number of hours of enrollment for full-time status and do not make exceptions for summer, internship, co-op or student-teaching enrollments. Students on financial aid should consult an adviser in the Financial Aid Office regarding minimum enrollment requirements for their situation. Likewise, international students on an F-1 or J-1 visa should consult an adviser in the International Student &amp; Scholar Services office regarding minimum enrollment requirements for their situation.</p><p>Minimum and Maximum Course Loads. Minimum and maximum course loads allowed for the fall and spring terms are based on the school of record. The maximum course load allowed for a summer term (all sessions combined) for all schools of record is 14 credit hours. Each student should be fully aware that hours taken beyond 18 in any term will be charged to his or her student account.</p><p>SMU Pre-Majors. Students who have not yet declared a major and who wish to enroll for more than 18 hours in a fall or spring term must have the approval of their academic adviser and the University Advising Center.</p><p>Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences. Majors in Dedman College who wish to enroll for more than 18 hours in a fall or spring term must have the approval of their academic and/or major adviser and the Office of Records and Academic Services.</p><p>Cox School of Business. B.B.A. students may enroll for more than 18 hours in a fall or spring term provided their cumulative GPAs (SMU, all-college and business) are 2.000 or higher to show satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree.</p><p>Lyle School of Engineering. Students must have the approval of their academic adviser to enroll for fewer than 12 hours or more than 18 hours during a fall or spring term. Normally, a student must have a GPA of 3.000 or higher to enroll for more than 18 hours. An exception is made during the term in which a student is to graduate. Credit will not be allowed for more than 21 hours in a fall or spring term.</p><p>Meadows School of the Arts. Students are not permitted to enroll during a fall or spring term for more than 18 hours unless their GPA for the preceding term is at least 3.000. During the term in which a student is to graduate, he or she may enroll for 19 hours (or nine hours for a summer session) regardless of the preceding term GPA. A student in the Meadows school cannot receive credit for more than 21 credit hours in a fall or spring term. A student with a GPA below 2.000 for the preceding term will not be permitted to enroll for more than 13 hours.</p><p>Simmons School of Education and Human Development. A student in the Simmons School with a declared major in applied physiology and sport management or educational studies may enroll for up to 18 hours in a fall or spring term. A student may petition to take up to 21 credit hours in a fall or spring term provided he or she meets the following criteria: 1. The student has a cumulative GPA of 3.000 or higher and has demonstrated academic success while enrolled in 18 hours in prior terms. 2. The student needs to take the extra hour(s) in order to graduate at the end of the term in which he or she is enrolling. 3. The student has gained permission from his or her adviser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stop Enrollment/Administrative Withdrawal</head><p>Insufficient or improper information given by the student on any admission or enrollment form -or academic deficiencies, non-attendance, disciplinary actions and financial obligations to the University -can constitute cause for the student to be determined ineligible to enroll or to be administratively withdrawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Forgiveness</head><p>A student can declare courses taken 10 or more years prior to the term of admission or readmission to be forgiven, which means the work is not included in the GPA or hours earned when determining admission, academic probation, suspension, honors and graduation. A student should request academic forgiveness at the time of admission or readmission. The student can select the term at which academic forgiveness starts. Academic forgiveness applies to all courses taken during or prior to that term, regardless of the grades earned. Academic forgiveness cannot be applied to only some courses for a term or to only selected terms within the forgiveness period.</p><p>Once academic forgiveness is declared and the student has enrolled, academic forgiveness cannot be rescinded. Forgiven academic work taken at SMU remains on the permanent academic record, with a notation of "academic forgiveness" on the record.</p><p>Currently enrolled students cannot request academic forgiveness. Transfer applicants must provide transcripts from all institutions attended, including those where all work may be forgiven.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Courses From Other Institutions</head><p>Courses taken prior to matriculation at SMU: Credit may be awarded for college courses a student takes prior to matriculation at SMU, including courses a student takes before graduating from high school, if the courses meet the criteria for transfer work outlined in the Admission to the University, Transfer Admission Criteria section of this catalog. Credit may be denied for educational reasons.</p><p>Courses taken after matriculation to SMU: Once students have matriculated at SMU, they may transfer no more than 30 hours to SMU from accredited colleges and universities. Students who complete more than 30 transferable hours after matriculating can designate which of their courses apply to the 30-hour limit. Students may change the designation of the courses. Students should make these transfer-credit designations in consultation with their records offices.</p><p>Note: SMU schools have differing policies regarding the post-matriculation transferability of courses from two-year institutions, and with very few exceptions, post-matriculation transfer work must be completed at accredited, four-year institutions.</p><p>Courses taken at another U.S. institution where the instruction is in the U.S.: To ensure in advance that a course taken at another accredited college or university will transfer and that proper credit will be awarded, the student taking the course should obtain prior approval from the chair of the department, the records office of the school at SMU that normally offers the course, the academic adviser, and the student's school of record. Petitions for pre-approval of transfer work are available in the schools' records offices. Students who fail to secure prior approval for transfer work taken within the United States may petition later for transfer credit, but they have no assurance that credit will be awarded. In either case, permission may be denied for educational reasons.</p><p>Courses taken at a U.S. institution where the instruction is in an international location and courses taken at a non-U.S. institution: Transfer credit is not awarded for courses taken at a U.S. institution where the instruction is in an international location and courses taken at a non-U.S. institution, except where the student is on a F-1 or J-1 visa studying at a home country institution (see below). Students who wish to take courses abroad through a program or university not already affiliated with SMU can petition the Study Abroad Office for approval of the program or university abroad by October 1st for programs offered the following academic year. The approval of a new study abroad program or foreign university can take several months to procure. If the program is approved, the student will be required to apply for study abroad by the regular deadline and through the regular processes for SMU study abroad (see the SMU Study Abroad website for information on deadlines and processes). Courses taken through the SMU Study Abroad Office are treated as SMU course work. <ref type="bibr">(Effective Summer 2019)</ref> Courses taken in the home country of a student on an F-1 or J-1 visa: Students attending SMU on an F-1 or J-1 visa can take courses at an institution recognized in their home country as offering the equivalent of U.S. university course work for transfer credit. For study at another institution during a fall or spring term the student must obtain prior approval from the International Student &amp; Scholar Services Office as this can affect their status. To ensure in advance that a course taken at this international institution will transfer and that proper credit will be awarded, the student taking the course should obtain prior approval from the chair of the department, the records office of the school at SMU that normally offers the course, the academic adviser, the student's school of record, and the Office of General Education. Petitions for pre-approval of transfer work are available in the schools' records offices. Students who fail to secure prior approval for transfer work taken may petition later for transfer credit, but they have no assurance that credit will be awarded. In either case, permission may be denied for educational reasons. <ref type="bibr">(Effective November 15, 2018)</ref> Official college transcripts are required for all college-level work attempted, regardless of transferability. Students are responsible for making sure a transcript of all transfer work attempted is sent to the University Registrar's Office immediately following completion of the work.</p><p>All international university transcripts must be accompanied by a professional evaluation and an official transcript, including an English translation if it is not in English, and course descriptions or syllabi. It is the student's responsibility to procure this evaluation and to assume financial responsibility for it. SMU accepts evaluations only from the following agencies:</p><p>• International Academic Credential Evaluators Inc. (www.iacei.net) • Josef Silny &amp; Associates Inc., International Education Consultants (www.jsilny.org) • World Education Services Inc. (www.wes.org)</p><p>The evaluations provided by the above agencies should include an explanation that the institution is recognized by the ministry of education in the student's home country and is generally considered to offer at least the equivalent of U.S. higher education credit. In addition, it should include an explanation of the credits, the grading system and course levels, as well as a course-by-course evaluation. The report is not binding to SMU and it will be considered a recommendation for SMU's independent decision of the credit to be given. Information and applications from the agencies are available online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Policies Course Scheduling and Enrollment Cycles</head><p>When students enter their school of record and into a specific degree program, they are assigned an academic adviser. Students should consult with the adviser for course scheduling, schedule changes, petitions, degree requirements and other such academic concerns. Advisers normally will have established office hours. The school's records office monitors progress and maintains official degree plans for all students in a school. Students should schedule conferences with their academic advisers and the school's records office upon admission to a school and prior to their final term to ensure that they are meeting all University and graduation requirements.</p><p>Each fall, spring and summer term has an enrollment period during which the formal process of enrollment in the University is completed. Prior to each enrollment period, the University Registrar's Office will publish enrollment instructions.</p><p>To assist new and readmitted students in making a comfortable, satisfying transition to University academic life, programs of academic advising, enrollment and orientation are conducted prior to each term. Information concerning the programs is distributed by the Office of the Student Experience.</p><p>Each student is personally responsible for complying with enrollment procedures and for ensuring the accuracy of his or her enrollment. Students are expected to confirm the accuracy of their enrollment each term. Students who discover a discrepancy in their enrollment records after the close of enrollment for the term should immediately complete a Petition for Enrollment Policy Exception. Petitions are to be submitted to the appropriate records office within six months of the term in which the discrepancy appeared; contact information for submitting a Petition for Enrollment Policy Exception can be viewed on the University Registrar's Office website at www.smu.edu/EnrollmentServices/Registrar/Enrollment/EnrollmentPolicyException. Petitions submitted later than six months after the discrepancy may not be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrolling for Graduate Courses Accelerated Pathway Programs</head><p>The Accelerated Pathway Programs policy applies to undergraduate students who enroll in one of SMU's Accelerated Pathway Programs. Institutional aid may be eligible for covering tuition costs associated with graduate courses as described below.</p><p>Students may not enroll for any graduate level course work to be applied toward their master's degree, prior to the accumulation of 90 credit hours toward their baccalaureate degree. Students must apply and be admitted as a graduate student at least one fall or spring term prior to receiving their master's degree having had their baccalaureate degree conferred prior to that term. Students must enroll and be in good standing as a full-time status graduate student for at least one fall or spring term prior to receiving their master's degree Graduate hours earned as an undergraduate are included in the determination of full-time status for the term. Graduate hours and grades earned as an undergraduate that count towards their baccalaureate degree are included in the undergraduate scholastic totals and the graduate scholastic totals. Graduate hours and grades earned as an undergraduate that do not count towards that baccalaureate degree are excluded from the undergraduate scholastic totals but are included in the graduate scholastic totals. The maximum number of graduate hours (up to 30 hours) that may be taken in the final year of the baccalaureate degree is mandated by SMU's accrediting agency. The number of graduate hours which may be counted toward the baccalaureate degree is determined by the school to which the master's degree belongs. An undergraduate is limited to earning a maximum of 30 graduate hours as an undergraduate student after the completion of 90 credit hours towards their baccalaureate degree. A student must earn a minimum 150 combined hours to be conferred both a baccalaureate and master's degree.</p><p>Students considering an Accelerated Pathway Program should consult with the Office of Financial Aid about its effect on federal, state and institutional aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Graduate Course Enrollment</head><p>In addition to the Accelerated Pathway Programs, with the written permission of their academic dean and permission of the dean of the graduate courses, an excelling undergraduate student may enroll for graduate level coursework that will be part of their undergraduate record, count towards the undergraduate degree and be included in the undergraduate scholastic totals. The undergraduate student must have accumulated 90 credit hours toward their baccalaureate degree. Graduate hours enrolled as an undergraduate are included in the determination of full-time status for the term. An undergraduate is limited to earning a maximum of 30 graduate hours as part of their undergraduate record.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student-Athletes.</head><p>Students must consult with the Athletic Compliance Office prior to dropping a course. In the consultation, the student will review the effects the drop might have on his or her athletic participation and financial aid. After the consultation, the Athletic Compliance Office will update my.SMU to allow the student to process the drop, if necessary. The consultation is advisory; students are responsible for their enrollment. For assistance regarding scholarships or other aspects of being a student-athlete, students should contact the Office of the Assistant Athletic Director for Student-Athlete Development.</p><p>International Students. Students must consult with the International Student &amp; Scholar Services Office prior to dropping a course. (Contact isss@smu.edu for consultation.)

This information is shared with the Office of Student Academic Success and Engagement, the student's records office (University Advising Center for SMU Pre-Majors), and the Altshuler Learning Enhancement Center (A-LEC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from the University</head><p>Policies on refunds for withdrawal from the University are found in the Financial Information section of this catalog and in the Financial Information Bulletin. No refunds are made without an official withdrawal.</p><p>Students should be aware of the difference between a drop and a withdrawal and remember that they have different deadlines and separate financial policies. The deadlines for each are posted each term on the Official University Calendar at www.smu.edu/registrar. A drop occurs when a student removes one or more courses from his or her schedule and remains enrolled in at least one credit hour for the term. A withdrawal occurs when removing the course or courses will result in the student being enrolled in zero hours for the term.</p><p>If a student removes all courses from his or her schedule prior to the first day of the term, the transaction is considered a cancellation and does not result in financial penalty or impact the student's transcript.</p><p>A student who wishes to withdraw (resign) from the University before the end of a term or session must initiate a Student Petition for Withdrawal form and secure approval from his/her school's records office.</p><p>The records office will then submit the form to the Office of the University Registrar. The effective date of the withdrawal is the date on which the Student Petition for Withdrawal is processed in the University Registrar's Office. Discontinuance of class attendance or notification to the instructors of intention to withdraw does not constitute an official withdrawal.</p><p>The enrollment of students who withdraw on or before the tenth day of the fall or spring semester as listed on the Official University Calendar will be canceled. Courses and grades are not recorded for canceled enrollments; however, the student will owe a portion of his/her tuition and fees. Additional information is available in the Financial Information Bulletin. A student who withdraws after the tenth class day of the fall or spring semester will receive the grade of W in each course in which he or she enrolled.</p><p>Medical withdrawals allow a prorated refund of tuition and fees and have conditions that must be met prior to re-enrollment at SMU. Medical withdrawals can only be authorized by professionals in the Dr. Bob Smith Health Center, Dean of Student Life, or Vice President for Student Affairs. The last day for a medical withdrawal is the last day of class instruction for the term from which the student is withdrawing. Retroactive medical withdrawals cannot be granted.</p><p>Mandatory administrative withdrawals occur when a student is not suspended but current and/or future enrollments are canceled or withdrawn. A student's academic record is annotated with "mandatory administrative withdrawal" and the effective dates for this withdrawal. Mandatory administrative withdrawals allow a prorated refund of tuition and fees and have conditions that must be met prior to reenrollment at SMU. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Audit Enrollment (Course Visitor)</head><p>Individuals desiring to audit (visit) a class, including those concurrently enrolled for regular coursework, are required to process an Audit Permit form. Audit Permit forms must be completed, approved and received in the University Registrar's Office no later than the last day to enroll for the term. Forms are available at www.smu.edu/registrar/FormsLibrary. Space must be available in the class. The following regulations are applicable:</p><p>1. Classroom recitation and participation are restricted; availability of course handouts, tests and other materials is restricted; no grade is assigned and no credit is recorded; no laboratory privileges are included. 2. The individual's name does not appear on class rosters or grade rosters. 3. Regular admission and enrollment procedures are not conducted for auditors. 4. The audit fee is nonrefundable. Undergraduate students enrolled full time, for any given term (12 credit hours for fall and spring or nine credit hours per summer term) may audit one three-hour course at no charge. 5. If credit is desired, the course must be enrolled for and repeated, as a regular course, and the regular tuition must be paid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>No-Credit Enrollment</head><p>Enrollment for no credit is accomplished in the conventional manner of enrollment, with regular admission and enrollment procedures being required. The student pays the regular tuition and fees, participates in class activities, and receives the grade of NC upon completion of the coursework. The student must indicate in writing no later than the 12th day of classes (the fourth day of classes in summer sessions; the second day of classes in intersession terms) that he or she wishes to take a course for no credit. Permission of the instructor or department is required for this type of enrollment, and the student is listed on class rolls. This enrollment is different from audit enrollments, for which no enrollment or grade is recorded.</p><p>SMU Abroad students should also see the Grade Options for Courses Taken on SMU Abroad Programs section of this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance</head><p>Regular class attendance is required. At the beginning of the course, the instructor announces policies regarding the effect of class attendance and tardiness on the student's standing in the course via the course syllabus. These policies may include dropping a student from the course for nonattendance or tardiness as described below. All reasons for absence or tardiness should be submitted at once to the instructor.</p><p>The satisfactory explanation of absence may release a student from disciplinary action but does not relieve a student from responsibility for the work of the course during his or her absence. A student who misses an announced test, examination or laboratory period in a regular course of study and has the permission of the instructor may be given an opportunity to make up the work at the instructor's convenience. The instructor determines in all instances the extent to which absences and tardiness affect each student's grade.</p><p>Students who miss two successive class meetings during the official add-drop period at the beginning of each term are subject to being dropped from the course. To avoid this possibility, students should contact the instructor or the department immediately following such a series of absences.</p><p>Students may be dropped by a course instructor or academic dean for nonattendance or tardiness with a grade of W until the University deadline to drop. Department chair approval is required. After the deadline, students must remain enrolled in the course.</p><p>Students may also be dropped by a course instructor for extreme inappropriate classroom behavior. The instructor must submit the Administrative Drop Request to drop a student from the course by the University deadline to drop a course indicated in the official Academic Calendar. Department Chair approval is required. After the deadline, the student must remain enrolled in the course and receive a final grade of F.</p><p>Students are charged an administrative fee for instructor initiated drops for attendance, tardiness and disruptive behavior.</p><p>A student who has a passing grade in a course at the time of the final examination, but who misses the examination and satisfies the instructor that the absence was unavoidable, may secure permission to take the examination at a time convenient for the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excused Absences for University Extracurricular Activities and Religious Holidays</head><p>Students who participate in officially sanctioned, scheduled University extracurricular activities or observe a religious holiday should be given an opportunity to make up class examinations or other graded assignments missed as a result of this participation or related travel. The manner in which examinations or other assignments missed because of these activities are to be made up is left to the discretion of each individual faculty member. However, students should not be penalized in any way for these excused absences and should be informed by the instructor at the beginning of the term, preferably in writing, of the instructor's makeup policy. It is the responsibility of the student to make arrangements with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled examination or other missed assignment for making up this work, and to obtain any class notes or other course material missed due to absence prior to taking any subsequent examinations or submitting any subsequent graded assignments.</p><p>This statement of University policy applies for all students. To minimize the difficulties caused for both student-athletes and their instructors by excused absences due to University-sanctioned athletic activities or related travel, the Athletic Department shall 1) make available to all student-athletes and their academic advisers prior to registration a copy of the student's activity and travel schedule for the upcoming term, so as to facilitate the student's enrollment in class sections that will minimize activity and travel conflicts; and 2) require all student-athletes to provide a copy of that term's activity and travel schedule, and a copy of this Statement of University Policy, to each of their instructors at the first class meeting of the term.</p><p>Other University colleges and departments whose students will miss classes because of their participation in officially sanctioned, scheduled University extracurricular activities, related travel, or observing of religious holidays are encouraged to adopt similar procedures to minimize the difficulties caused by such absences.</p><p>A list of religious holidays for use in requesting excused absences is available on the Official University Calendar. Students must notify the class instructor in writing by the 12th day of the term of any such absences that will occur during that term. Accommodations are to be made without penalty. More information can be found in the University Policy Manual, available at www.smu.edu/policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absence Due to Illness</head><p>The Dr. Bob Smith Health Center does not provide documentation for granting excused absences from class. If students are absent for illness, they should talk to their professors about how they might catch up with the material missed. If students are seriously ill and require hospitalization or an extended absence, students should talk to their professors and the Office of Student Life to decide how to deal with the interruption in their studies. To facilitate communication with their professors about their absence, students may submit the Absence from Class Form available at www.smu.edu/healthcenter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation of Course Numbers</head><p>Each SMU course has a four-digit course number. The first number indicates the general level of the course (3000-level and higher is considered advanced). The second digit specifies the number of credit hours; exceptions are noted below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Policies</head><p>A student's grades are available to him or her through my.SMU Student Homepage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Scale</head><p>The grade of a student in any course is determined by the instructor of the course. The following grades are authorized for recording on the student's official undergraduate academic record maintained by the University Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades</head><p>Description </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of F, D, W, and Missing/Blank</head><p>Failing is graded F. If the student's work is incomplete, poor quality and not acceptable, a grade of F will be given. After such a grade, credit may be obtained only by repeating the course.</p><p>The grade of D represents performance below average expectations. Students receiving a D in a course that is a prerequisite to another course should consult with their advisers about repeating the course so that they will be adequately prepared for work in the following course. Courses passed with a grade of D, D-or D+ will generally not count toward major or minor requirements.</p><p>The grade of W cannot be recorded unless completion of the official drop or withdrawal process has occurred by the applicable deadline during the term of enrollment. Only the grade of W may be recorded if the student has officially dropped courses from the schedule or withdrawn (resigned) from the University for the term. The grade of W may not be revoked or changed to another grade because the act of officially dropping/withdrawing is irrevocable.</p><p>A final official grade must be recorded for each enrollment. An F will be assigned for a missing or blank grade indicating an official grade has not been received from the instructor. Graduation candidates must receive a grade for all course enrollments prior to the deadline on the Official University Calendar. Failure to do so can result in removal from the degree candidacy list and/or the assignment of a grade of F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of Incomplete</head><p>A student may temporarily receive a grade of Incomplete (I) if at least 50 percent of the course requirements have been completed with passing grades, but for some justifiable reason acceptable to the instructor, the student has been unable to complete the full requirements of the course.</p><p>At the time a grade of I is given, the instructor must stipulate in my.SMU the requirements and completion date that are to be met and the final grade that will be given if the requirements are not met by the completion date.</p><p>The maximum period of time allowed to clear the Incomplete is 12 months. If the Incomplete grade is not cleared by the date set by the instructor or by the end of the 12-month deadline, whichever is earlier, the grade of I will be changed to the grade provided by the instructor at the time the Incomplete was assigned or to a grade of F if no alternate grade was provided.</p><p>The grade of I is not given in lieu of a grade of F or W, or other grade, each of which is prescribed for other specific circumstances.</p><p>The grade of I in a course does not authorize a student to attend or enroll in the course during a later term. Graduation candidates must clear all Incompletes prior to the deadline on the Official University Calendar, which may allow less time than 12 months. Failure to do so can result in removal from the degree candidacy list and/or conversion of the grade of I to the grade indicated by the instructor at the time the grade of I was given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Options for Courses Taken on SMU Abroad Programs</head><p>Courses taken on SMU Abroad fall and spring term programs may not be taken on a no-credit or pass/fail basis. The only exception to this policy is for courses designated by SMU's academic departments with no credit or pass/fail as their only grading basis option. Students who study abroad on SMU Abroad fall and spring term programs are enrolled in a SMU placeholder course to denote full-time enrollment. This placeholder course (designated with a Z) is taken on a credit/no-credit basis. Students must submit their transcript from the study abroad program showing successful completion of credit hours to receive a grade of CR in the Z course.</p><p>Courses taken on SMU Abroad summer programs and during Jan Term (January) may not be taken for a grade of NC (No Credit), but students may petition for one of these courses to be graded on a pass/fail basis. Students must petition approval for the pass/fail option from the program director and the faculty member teaching the course. The deadline to complete the Undergraduate Pass/Fail Option Declaration form to petition for a course taken on an SMU Abroad summer program is the payment deadline for the program; for Jan Term classes, the deadline is no later than the second day of classes for Jan Term. Forms are available in the schools' records offices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Point Average</head><p>A student's grade point average (cumulative GPA) is computed by multiplying the credit hours of each course attempted by the grade points earned in the particular course and then dividing the total number of grade points by the total number of hours attempted, excluding those hours for which grades are shown with an asterisk on the grade chart. The GPA is truncated, not rounded, at three decimal places.</p><p>For assistance estimating your GPA see the GPA calculator on the SMU website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Changes</head><p>Changes of grades, including change of the grade of I, are initiated by the course instructor and authorized by the academic chair and by the academic dean of the school in which the course was offered. If a student requests a grade change, the instructor may ask the student to provide the request as a written petition, which may become an official part of any further process at the instructor's discretion. Changes of grades may be made only for the following authorized reasons: to clear a grade of I, to correct a processing error or to reflect a re-evaluation of the student's original work. A change of grade will not be based on additional work options beyond those originally made available to the entire class.</p><p>Changes of grades of I should be processed within a calendar year of the original grade assignment. Other changes of grades must be processed by the end of the next regular term. No grade will be changed after 12 months or after a student's graduation, except in cases where a grade is successfully appealed -provided that written notice of appeal is given within six months following graduation -and in extenuating circumstances authorized by the academic dean and approved by the University Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades for Repeated Courses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Replacement Repeat</head><p>Effective for courses taken Fall 2017 or later, undergraduate students may repeat up to six courses taken at SMU for which grades of D+ or lower were received. The grade from the repeated course, even if lower, will be the grade used to calculate the student's GPA. A course may be repeated only once under this policy.</p><p>Students must repeat the exact same course originally taken to be considered a repeat. The course must be taken at SMU. Not every course is offered again and thus may not be available to be repeated. Students cannot take or repeat a course that is a prerequisite for a course already satisfactorily completed.</p><p>The first six courses repeated will be coded as Grade Replacement repeats. A course being repeated that is dropped (W) will not count as a grade replacement repeat. Only the credit hours of the repeated course and not the initial credit hours count toward the number needed for graduation. Both the initial and the second grades are shown on the student's permanent academic record. Probation, suspension and dismissal, as determined by the initial grade, stands. Students are cautioned that for some purposes, such as admission into an academic program, both grades or only the initial grade could be used. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Average Repeat</head><p>In all other cases, students will be allowed to repeat courses according to the following rules: Both the initial and the second grades will be recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Both grades will be included in the calculation of the GPA and in the determination of academic probation, suspension, dismissal, honors and graduation. Only the repeated course and not the initial credit hours count toward the number of hours needed for graduation. Note: Students cannot take or repeat a course that is a prerequisite for a course already satisfactorily completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass/Fail Option</head><p>Students may take one course per term on a pass/fail basis. The maximum total credit with a grade of Pass that may count toward a degree is 12 hours. In addition to these courses, students may take up to four additional Personal Responsibility and Wellness (PRW2) courses beyond the courses required for their degree requirements. Only one additional PRW2 course may be taken per term. These additional PRW2 courses are graded on a pass/fail basis only and do not count toward the minimum hours for a student's degree requirements or toward the one pass/fail course per term limitation.</p><p>A student must indicate intention to take a course pass/fail no later than the 12th day of classes (the fourth day of classes in summer sessions; the second day of classes in intersession terms) by filing a form available in the school's records office. Students participating in SMU Study Abroad should review the deadlines under Grade Options for Courses Taken on SMU Abroad Programs. After the declaration of intent, students may not change their pass/fail declaration back to a letter grade. If a department grades a course pass/fail for all students, a declaration by the student is not required. A failed course cannot be repeated on a pass/fail basis, except for those courses designated as pass/fail-only courses.</p><p>Students should consult with their academic advisers before declaring the pass/fail option for any course, as some courses may not be taken pass/fail. In general, elective courses may be taken on a pass/fail basis. With the exception of courses only offered on a pass/fail basis, courses required to fulfill the University Curriculum may not be taken pass/fail. Courses in the academic majors and minors also are excluded; however, in some programs, courses may be taken pass/fail after the minimum program requirements have been met. SMU schools may have different pass/fail policies for major and minor courses; students should see the academic requirements in each school's section of this catalog for information on pass/fail grading. There may also be other courses required to meet certain professional accreditation standards or entrance requirements, such as teacher preparation and preprofessional studies that may not be taken pass/fail by a particular student. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of such limitations and requirements.</p><p>Under the pass/fail option, pass (P) grades are A, B and C (including C-); failing (F) grades are D+, D, Dand F. A student who declares pass/fail is not entitled to know the regular letter grade, and a pass/fail grade cannot be changed to a regular letter grade (or vice versa) after the pass/fail grade has been assigned. The grade of P is not calculated in the GPA, although the credit hours are included in the total number of hours earned. The grade of F is calculated in the GPA. No courses in the Simmons School's educational studies degree program may be taken on a pass/fail basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Appeals</head><p>A student who feels that an assigned grade is other than the grade earned must first discuss the matter with the course instructor to determine if the discrepancy is caused by error or misunderstanding. At the time of the initial discussion, the student may be asked to provide a written petition requesting the change of grade.</p><p>A student who is not satisfied by the instructor's decision on a request for a grade change, and who maintains that the original grade was capriciously or unfairly determined, may appeal to the chair of the department in which the course was offered (or, in the case of a nondepartmental course, to a faculty agent designated by the dean of the school offering the course). After discussing the matter with the student, and bearing in mind that the final authority in matters of academic judgment in the determination of a grade rests with the course instructor, the chair (or faculty agent) will consult with the course instructor, who will subsequently report to the student the disposition of the appeal.</p><p>A student who is not satisfied by the disposition of the appeal may appeal the decision to the dean of the school offering the course. The dean will take action as he or she deems appropriate. A student may appeal the dean's decision to the provost. In their actions, the dean and the provost must respect the principle that the determination of a grade rests with the course instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Forgiveness</head><p>SMU's policy for omitting courses from a student's GPA is found under Academic Forgiveness in the General Policies section of this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Advising and Satisfactory Progress Policies Academic Advising</head><p>Academic advising is an important process for each undergraduate student at SMU. Each student must meet with his or her assigned academic adviser prior to enrolling for an academic term. At this meeting, the adviser will assist the student in planning a program of study, understanding the Degree Progress Report, and scheduling courses that will count toward graduation requirements. After the initial required advising session, the student is encouraged to seek assistance from the adviser when considering whether to add or drop courses.</p><p>For an effective advising relationship, the student must be prepared when meeting with the adviser. The student must initiate the advising appointment. Prior to the meeting, the student should obtain through my.SMU a Degree Progress Report that provides detailed information concerning completion of degree requirements. The student should also be familiar with different academic programs of interest. The adviser will give assistance to the student, but the student has the final responsibility for the accuracy of the enrollment, the applicability of courses toward the degree requirements, and his or her academic performance.</p><p>Students are assigned an academic adviser by their academic dean's office, records office or major department. A student who enrolls without first meeting with his or her assigned academic adviser may be subject to sanctions including, but not limited to, cancellation of the term enrollment and restriction from the self-service enrollment functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mandatory Declaration of Major</head><p>Students officially declare their major when they have made a firm choice and when they have met the specific program entrance requirements for their intended school and department. For most students, the declaration of the major occurs in the sophomore year. Students are expected to qualify for and to declare a major no later than upon completion of 75 credit hours, including credits by examination and transfer credits, in order to continue their studies at SMU. Students in the Simmons School's educational studies degree program must declare a second major as well; they cannot graduate with an educational studies degree alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change of Academic Program</head><p>Undergraduate students who desire to change their academic program -that is, transfer from one school to another within the University, change their degree objective, change their major or change their minorshould first notify the records office of the school in which they are currently enrolled. Students can change their academic program at any time during a term. The program change is effective on the date received, approved and processed. However, changes should be made at least one week prior to enrollment for a term for the change to be effective for that enrollment.</p><p>A visiting student who wishes to be admitted to an undergraduate program offered by a school of the University must meet all standard University admission requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent Degree Programs</head><p>Students can simultaneously earn degrees from multiple schools of the University with approval of the records offices of each school. The requirements for each degree must be met. Students should meet with advisers in each school at an early date to prepare a proposed plan of study and to complete the processing of all necessary forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leave of Absence</head><p>A leave of absence is a temporary leave from the University -a kind of "timeout" -that may be necessary during an academic career. Students may elect to take leaves of absence for a variety of reasons, including 1) medical reasons due to accident or illness, 2) family crises or other personal situations that require an extended absence from school, 3) financial issues that may take time to resolve, and 4) academic difficulties that may best be handled by taking time to refocus on college work.</p><p>Typically, a leave of absence is for one term or one academic year. A student may extend a leave of absence by contacting Enrollment Services. The process to return to SMU after a leave-of-absence period can be an easy one, especially if the student has gone through the steps to file for a leave of absence and planned ahead for the return. Following SMU's leave-of-absence guidelines helps 1) assure that the degree requirements per the catalog of record when the student initially matriculated at SMU still apply upon return, 2) assist with financial aid processing, and 3) provide the support needed to return to SMU and successfully finish the degree.</p><p>The SMU Leave of Absence Policy provides students with a formal process to "stop out" of SMU for either voluntary or involuntary reasons. Typically, a leave of absence is for a temporary departure from the institution; however, intended permanent withdrawals from SMU will also be processed under the Leave of Absence Policy.</p><p>In addition, students who are participating in study-away programs that do not fall under the auspices of SMU should complete the Leave of Absence Form. The completion of this process will assist all respective offices at SMU to create and monitor a formal, centralized record of the status for all students who are not enrolled. The Leave of Absence Form and Leave of Absence procedures are available at www.smu.edu/registrar ("Forms Library" link). The University Policy Manual is available at www.smu.edu/policy.</p><p>The first step to effect a leave of absence is for the student to arrange an appointment to meet with his or her academic adviser, who will then assist the student with the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progress</head><p>The University sets the goal and expects that all undergraduate students will make regular and satisfactory progress toward their degrees. There are three categories that may apply when an undergraduate student is not making satisfactory academic progress: 1) academic probation, 2) academic suspension or 3) academic dismissal. This policy sets out the standards and procedures for each of these categories. In addition, a student who has been suspended may seek academic reinstatement under the standards set out in this policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University-wide Requirements</head><p>Academic Probation. For all undergraduate students, a student will be placed on academic probation if he or she fails to meet the following: 1. For a student who enters SMU directly from high school or a student who enters SMU with fewer than 15 transfer hours, when the student fails to complete the Discernment and Discourse sequence and/or the Quantitative Foundation requirements of the University Curriculum after the completion of 60 units earned as SMU credit. 2. For a part-time student or a student who enters SMU with at least 15 transfer hours, when the student fails to complete the Discernment and Discourse sequence and/or the Quantitative Foundation requirements of the University Curriculum after completion of 30 units through enrollment at SMU. Academic Suspension. For all undergraduate students, a student will be placed on academic suspension if he or she fails to meet the following:</p><p>1. For a student who enters SMU directly from high school or a student who enters SMU with fewer than 15 transfer hours, when the student fails to complete the Discernment and Discourse sequence and/or the Quantitative Foundation requirements of the University Curriculum after the completion of 75 units earned as SMU credit. 2. For a part-time student or a student transferring more than 15 hours, when the student fails to complete the Discernment and Discourse sequence and/or the Quantitative Foundation requirements of the University Curriculum after completion of 45 units earned as SMU credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SMU Pre-Majors</head><p>Academic Probation. For SMU Pre-Majors, once a student's cumulative SMU GPA falls below 2.000, the student is placed on academic probation at the beginning of the next enrolled term (fall, spring or summer). The student has the next two enrolled regular terms (fall, and spring) and the first summer term following the probation start date to raise his or her cumulative SMU GPA to at least a 2.000. A student has the opportunity to enroll only for one summer term while on academic probation. The summer term must be at SMU.</p><p>When the student is placed on academic probation because his or her cumulative SMU GPA is below 2.000, then the student will be assigned to a designated probation counselor. At the beginning of his or her next term at SMU, the student will be required to complete a self-assessment and share this self-assessment with the probation counselor, who will then work with each student to determine the appropriate academic interventions. These academic interventions can include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Re-evaluation of course enrollments and pre-major objectives. 2. Biweekly academic counseling sessions with the probation counselor (or his or her designee). 3. Enrollment in courses, such as HDEV 1110 -Reading and Learning Strategies or HDEV 1211 -Success Strategies, aimed at improving academic performance. 4. Evaluation of medical and/or psychological needs such as the need for drug or alcohol education. 5. Participation in tutoring and/or study skills workshops.</p><p>The student will sign a contract that stipulates the agreed-upon academic interventions.</p><p>Academic Suspension. If a student does not achieve a cumulative SMU GPA of at least a 2.000 according to the stipulations stated above, then he/she will be placed on academic suspension. A student is suspended effective the first day of the next term (fall, spring or summer), and the suspension period includes a minimum of one regular term (fall or spring). Credits earned at another college or university during a term of suspension may not be applied toward an SMU degree. A grade point deficiency must be made up through enrollment at SMU.</p><p>A student may petition to the University Committee on Academic Petitions for an additional, consecutive probationary term if the term GPA during the student's probationary period indicates academic improvement and if the student has undergone all academic recovery efforts agreed upon in the contract with the probation counselor.</p><p>As soon as possible after the student is placed on academic suspension, the student should contact the probation counselor if he/she has any desire or intent to seek reinstatement after the period of academic suspension. The probation counselor will work with the student to determine appropriate conditions that the student should satisfy to be eligible for reinstatement. These conditions might include the completion of coursework with a certain minimum GPA; however, reinstatement is not guaranteed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Reinstatement.</head><p>A student who has been academically suspended once may apply for academic reinstatement to the University. Reinstatement to the University is not guaranteed. A student is not eligible to request reinstatement until the end of the time period of academic suspension. The request for reinstatement should be submitted to the University Committee on Academic Petitions, which will make a decision on the request. Ordinarily, the decision whether to grant reinstatement will be based primarily on whether the student has satisfied the conditions set out for the period of academic suspension.</p><p>A student who is reinstated after academic suspension has two regular enrolled terms (fall and spring) in which to earn a cumulative SMU GPA of at least a 2.000. A student will return on academic probation and may not be reinstated for a summer term. Students who do not earn a cumulative SMU GPA of at least a 2.000 within two regular terms (fall and spring) after having been academically suspended will be permanently dismissed.</p></div>

For more information on these items see the Student Handbook. a. Disciplinary Suspension. A student is separated from the University for an assigned time period, and under the conditions deemed necessary by the conduct review process. A student suspended from the University before an academic semester ends will not receive a refund of any monies paid and is not relieved of any financial obligations to the University, including tuition, fees, and room and board. No academic credit earned during the period of suspension at any other institution may be transferred to SMU. A conduct suspension and its effective dates are recorded on a student's academic transcript. The notation remains for the time the student is enrolled in the University and may be removed three (3) years after graduation. If the student leaves the University before graduation, the notation may be removed three <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> years after the anticipated date of graduation from the University. During the period of suspension the student is considered not in good standing. The removal of the notation must be requested by the student after the designated time period and approved by the Office of the Dean of Students before the notation will be removed. b. Disciplinary Dismissal (aka, Expulsion). A student is separated from the University on a permanent basis. A student's dismissal will be permanently recorded on his/her academic transcript. A student dismissed from the University will not receive a refund of any monies paid and is not relieved of any financial obligations to the University, including tuition, fees, and room and board. A student expelled from the University may not enter campus grounds for any reason without express written permission from the Office of the Dean of Students. The dismissed student is considered not in good standing. c. Disciplinary Violation (DV). A notation indicating a disciplinary violation will be recorded on a students' academic transcript at the direction of the Dean of Students. The notation will remain for the time he/she is enrolled at the University and for three (3) years following his/her graduation. If the student leaves the University before graduation, the notation may be removed three (3) years after the anticipated date of graduation from the University. A student with a DV notation is considered in good standing. The removal of the notation must be requested by the student after the designated time period and approved by the Office of the Dean of Students before the notation will be removed. d. Temporary Suspension. Pending a conduct hearing, a student is banned from campus and participation in any SMU-related activities. Student may contact faculty members to request permission to continue individual academic assignments remotely, but faculty are not required to grant the request. A notation is recorded on the student's academic transcript that a conduct matter is pending. e. Honor Code Violation (HV). A notation indicating an honor code violation will be recorded on a students' academic transcript at the direction of the Dean of Students. The notation will remain for the time he/she is enrolled at the University and for three (3) years following his/her graduation. If the student leaves the University before graduation, the notation may be removed three (3) years after the anticipated date of graduation from the University. A student with a HV notation is considered in good standing. The faculty member retains complete discretion to award a grade for the course he or she deems appropriate. The removal of the notation must be requested by the student after the designated time period and approved by the Office of the Dean of Students before the notation will be removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Petitions and Waivers</head><p>Petitions and/or requests for waivers concerning University requirements, graduation requirements and the evaluation of transfer work should be submitted to the student's school of record office. Additional information is found under Grade Appeals in the Grade Policies section of this catalog. Petitions and/or requests for waivers concerning a major or a minor should be submitted to the appropriate department chair or program coordinator/director for consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SMU Credit Requirement</head><p>University policy requires that of the 122 minimum required credit hours for an undergraduate degree, at least 60 hours must be earned as SMU credit through enrollment at SMU's Dallas campus, SMU online offerings, SMU-in-Plano, SMU-in-Taos, SMU Abroad programs (both faculty led and provider offerings), and SMU credits awarded based on SMU departmental examination, audition and portfolio reviews.</p><p>Credit hours earned in venues not listed above that are applied toward the 122 minimum will be recorded as transfer or test credits. Therefore, regardless of the number of transferable or test credits completed, to receive an SMU undergraduate degree, students must earn 60 credit hours through enrollment at SMU. Of the 122 minimum required credit hours for an undergraduate degree, only two hours may be Personal Responsibility and Wellness courses. For further degree requirements, students should refer to the individual school sections of this catalog.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Policies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apply to Graduate</head><p>Students must file an Application for Candidacy to Graduate with their schools' records offices no later than the last day of the first week of the term in which they will complete all degree requirements. Applications are filed through my.SMU Student Homepage by the deadline date on the Official University Calendar.</p><p>Students who file an application after the published deadline may be required to pay a nonrefundable late fee. Late applications may be denied after the start of the next term, and the Application for Candidacy to Graduate applied to the next conferral date. Students taking coursework at another institution and transferring the course(s) back to SMU are responsible for ensuring that the University Registrar's Office receives their official transcript in order for their degree to be conferred for the anticipated graduation term. SMU has three degree conferral periods for most programs: fall (December), spring <ref type="bibr">(May)</ref> and summer (August). In addition, students who complete their degree requirements during a Jan Term (January), May term or August term will have their degrees conferred at the conclusion of the intersessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Commencement Participation</head><p>An All-University Commencement Convocation is held in May for students enrolled and on schedule to complete degree requirements during the spring term. Students enrolled and on schedule to complete all degree requirements during the following summer session may also participate in the University Commencement Convocation, although their degrees will not be conferred until August. Students may also participate in departmental or school ceremonies according to the policies of the departments or schools. Doctoral candidates may participate in commencement only after all degree requirements are complete.</p><p>An All-University December Commencement Convocation is held each year for students completing degree requirements during the fall term. Students who completed degree requirements during the previous summer session may also participate. Students on schedule and enrolled to complete all degree requirements during the following Jan Term (January) intersession may also participate in the December ceremony, although their degrees will be conferred in January.</p><p>A student may participate in either the fall or spring All-University Commencement Convocation for a given degree, but not in both.</p><p>To participate in a ceremony, a student must apply online and file an Application for Candidacy to Graduate or Intent to Participate Form. Students earning majors in multiple schools must file separately with each school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree Honors</head><p>There are three classes of graduation honors: summa cum laude, magna cum laude and cum laude. The awarding of graduation honors will be determined by GPAs announced at the beginning of each academic year for each of the five undergraduate schools -Dedman, Cox, Lyle, Meadows and Simmons. The required GPAs generally represent the top 5 percent, 10 percent and 15 percent of graduates in the school. Students earning a degree with majors in two or more schools will receive the highest degree honors for which they are eligible.</p><p>The required GPAs for each school will be determined by pooling all graduates in the school from the previous three academic years. The GPA used is the lower of the student's SMU cumulative GPA and allcollege GPA (this includes transfer work). Only undergraduate coursework is calculated.</p><p>Students may obtain information about minimum GPAs required in past years from their academic schools or online at www.smu.edu/EnrollmentServices/Registrar/AcademicRecords. Separate from earning graduation honors, students who have completed the requirements of the University Honors Program may earn honors in the liberal arts. Departmental distinction may also be awarded in Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, Lyle School of Engineering, Meadows School of the Arts, and Simmons School of Education and Human Development; the Cox School of Business awards the honors in business distinction to students who have successfully completed the requirements for the Cox B.B.A. Honors Program. These honors require completion of requirements prescribed by the department or school. Further information may be obtained from the individual departments and schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statute of Limitations for Degree Plans</head><p>A student who has been readmitted to the University following an absence of more than three years will be expected to meet all requirements for graduation current at the time of readmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The University Curriculum</head><p>In keeping with the University's educational mission, all undergraduates are required to complete a program of study that emphasizes the values of what historically has been known as a liberal education -namely, learning to read, write and think critically and acquiring a basic understanding of human society in all its dimensions. The courses and experiences included in this program of study provide a solid and broad education that will equip students to compete in and adapt to the rapidly changing contemporary world while complementing more focused study in the major.</p><p>The University Curriculum is the vehicle through which SMU ensures that all undergraduates meet the general education requirements stipulated by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, specifically, "Through general education, students encounter the basic content and methodology of the principle areas of knowledge: humanities and fine arts, social and behavioral sciences, and natural sciences and mathematics. Courses in each of these specific areas introduce a breadth of knowledge and reinforce cognitive skills and effective learning opportunities for each student. Therefore, it is important that courses selected by students do not focus on skills, techniques and procedures specific to that student's occupation or profession. Such courses may also include interdisciplinary courses."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The University Curriculum</head><p>The motto of Southern Methodist University, Veritas Liberabit Vos ("the truth shall set you free"), epitomizes the ideals of an SMU education and is the fundamental principle for the University Curriculum. The wisdom to acquire and critically reflect on existing knowledge and the insight and capacity to create new knowledge -the hallmarks of an educated person -exemplify the characteristics SMU seeks to instill in its students.</p><p>The University Curriculum constitutes roughly one-third of the baccalaureate degree plan for all SMU students. It consists of three main coursework components plus a number of specified Proficiencies and Experiences. The heart of the University Curriculum is its Foundations, Breadth and Depth requirements. UC requirements can be met through any part of the student's undergraduate career, including work in the major or minor, elective courses or approved activities. The number of courses and/or credit hours required to complete the University Curriculum will vary according to the individual student's academic background, preparation, major and curricular choices. The list of UC courses will vary by term, especially with respect to identified and approved UC Proficiencies and Experiences courses, and will be listed on the Office of the Registrar Web page. Each student has access to a regularly updated and individualized Degree Progress Report that charts their progress and identifies courses the student can use to meet the various requirements. Students are advised to work closely with divisional/departmental and University advisers in navigating the UC requirements and planning their coursework each term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of University Curriculum Requirements University Curriculum Foundations</head><p>A university education must provide students in all majors with the tools to embark on a lifetime of learning. UC Foundations courses assure that students read and write critically, possess basic quantitative reasoning skills, understand the concepts of lifelong personal responsibility and wellness, and explore how different academic disciplines define and create knowledge. Because these skills are essential for a successful college experience, Foundations courses should be completed within a student's first four terms of enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discernment and Discourse (3-9 credits, typically 6)</head><p>The University Curriculum emphasizes academic reading, writing and oral expression in the Discernment and Discourse sequence. The Discernment and Discourse sequence introduces students to academic thought and communication in seminars that allow students to work closely with faculty in small classes. All seminars share the goal of assisting students in the development of critical reading, expository and analytical writing, oral communication, and research protocols.</p><p>Most students will satisfy this requirement by taking DISC 1312 in the fall and DISC 1313 in the spring. Students scoring lower than a 580 on the SAT-R or lower than 21 on the ACT English section will begin in DISC 1311. Students scoring at or above 580 (SAT-R) or at or above 21 (ACT English) will begin in DISC 1312. Students scoring a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement English Language/English Literature Test and students scoring 5, 6 or 7 on the IB English A Literature higher-level exam will place out of DISC 1312 and begin with DISC 1313. All SMU students (first-year and transfers) must take at least one collegelevel writing course after graduating from high school. Transfer students with a combination of AP/IB credit and one college-level writing course after graduating high school will need to take DISC 1313 at SMU. No student can fulfill the Discernment and Discourse requirement solely with AP/IB credit.</p><p>Students participating in the University Honors Program satisfy this requirement with DISC 2305 and DISC 2306 in the fall and spring of their first year. Each term, students must be enrolled in and may not drop Discernment and Discourse until they have completed the requirement. A minimum grade of C-is required to pass each course.</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Foundation (3 credits)</head><p>Quantitative reasoning refers to the ability to understand, evaluate and use quantitative information. Quantitative information takes many forms, and quantitative reasoning skills span a vast spectrum from basic numerical manipulations to advanced statistics and mathematics. One three-credit course is required to ensure that students possess these necessary skills. Students scoring a 4 or 5 on the Calculus AB, Calculus BC or Statistics Advanced Placement tests and students scoring 5, 6 or 7 on the IB Mathematics higher-level exam will place out of this requirement. Math placement testing is also available through SMU's Mathematics Department examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal Responsibility and Wellness (2 credits*)</head><p>All students complete this requirement by completing two one-credit courses. Taken during the first year, PRW1* introduces students to the University and explores three sets of issues: 1) the role of personal responsibility in coping with college and life's other transitional periods; 2) challenges and opportunities such as managing time and stress, benefiting from diversity and autonomy, dealing with pitfalls related to alcohol and drugs, and exploring resources and activities on campus; and, 3) personal finance decisions while at SMU and later in life, including managing money, using credit cards and making major purchases.</p><p>In PRW2 (physical fitness courses), students work with instructors to establish personal goals and fitness plans for the term. A variety of individual and group fitness courses will be available, with each course containing core objectives and student-learning outcomes based on health-related fitness components. Grades will be given based on attendance, understanding of training/health principles and satisfactory improvement toward the goals that students set for themselves.</p><p>issues. Sometimes taught collaboratively by faculty members from different departments and organized around a major topic or "big question," KNW courses develop students' understanding of the multiple approaches whereby different disciplines define, acquire and create knowledge, including the ethical considerations involved. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second Language (4-8 credits)</head><p>SMU students fulfill the Second Language Foundation Requirement by demonstrating proficiency in reading, writing, speaking and understanding a second language at the Intermediate level, equal to the firstyear's study of language at the university level.</p><p>While students in their first year of college may receive credit for dual and/or transfer credit earned prior to matriculation at SMU, this credit will not satisfy SMU's Second Language Foundation requirement.</p><p>At SMU, proficiency can be achieved in one of the following ways, after matriculation: 1. Students placing into and successfully completing a course in the second semester level of a language (or above) will be able to satisfy their Second Language Requirement with that course. SMU offers Arabic, Chinese, Classical Greek, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Russian, American Sign Language, and Spanish, as well as Biblical Hebrew and Biblical (Koine) Greek. 2. Dependent on prior approval from the World Languages and Literature Department, students may complete language coursework at another accredited four-year institution. 3. Placing into the fourth term or beyond on the SMU World Languages placement test and also earning an appropriate score on an SMU designated Second Language Proficiency Test. (You will need to pay a non-refundable registration fee for your proficiency test and take the test within one year of matriculation at SMU.) 4. Taking two approved substitution courses if recommended by the Office of Disability Accommodations and Success Strategies (DASS). 5. Achieving a score of Intermediate-Mid or above on the ACTFL OPI examination in a language not taught at SMU.</p><p>Students can fulfill the Second Language Foundation requirement prior to matriculation in one of the following ways: 1. Presenting an appropriate score on a recognized second language proficiency exam (4 or 5 on AP exam; 5, 6, or 7 on IB HL exam; 640 or above on SAT II). 2. Demonstrating an existing proficiency in a language other than English as documented by: a. Matriculation as an International Student from a non-English-dominant country AND providing high school transcripts from a non-English-medium high school; b. Successful completion of an ESL DISC course at SMU. Please visit the Second Language site for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Curriculum Breadth Requirements (maximum of 22 credits)</head><p>Students are required to complete Breath courses in seven distinct areas of university study that reflect fundamental ideas associated with core academic disciplines: Creativity and Aesthetics (CA); Philosophical and Religious Inquiry and Ethics (PRIE); and Language and Literature (LL). Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics consists of the divisions of Pure and Applied Sciences (PAS) and Technology and Mathematics (TM). History, Social and Behavioral Sciences consists of the divisions of Historical Contexts (HC) and Individuals, Institutions and Cultures (IIC). Some courses may meet two different breadth requirements. Such double counting could, in principle, reduce the seven-course requirement to four. Some breadth courses also satisfy major and/or minor requirements. Breadth courses may satisfy Proficiency and Experiences requirements (see below). The maximum of 22 credits reflects that lab-based science courses may be four credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creativity and Aesthetics (CA)</head><p>To develop an understanding of and appreciation for the creative impulse in a variety of artistic, cultural and historical contexts, graduates of SMU will be able to identify, explore and explain concepts fundamental to the visual, literary and performing arts through critical analysis, performance or the act of personal creation. Creativity and Aesthetics courses also seek to expose students to the fundamental role that creativity plays in maintaining a robust, adaptive and prosperous society. Students take one course from the Creativity and Aesthetics division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophical and Religious Inquiry and Ethics (PRIE)</head><p>Students often enter college asking questions such as who am I, why am I here, what constitutes a good life? Philosophical and religious inquiry helps them explore approaches humanity has taken to answer these and other questions. With the resurgence of religion worldwide such, exploration is timely. This inquiry also serves as the basis for thoughtful choice and action. Students must take one course from the Philosophical and Religious Inquiry and Ethics division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language and Literature (LL)</head><p>Students will demonstrate how symbolic systems communicate meaningfully within their language communities. Students will analyze and create meaningful texts such as analytical essays, literary works, computer code, logical proofs, musical compositions, and films. Students must take one course from the Language and Literature division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Historical Contexts (HC)</head><p>To understand societies in the contemporary world and the forces that have shaped them, graduates of SMU will be able to identify and analyze problems, events and documents or artifacts from the past and know how to situate them in their appropriate social, political, economic, and cultural contexts. Students take one course from the Historical Contexts division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individuals, Institutions and Cultures (IIC)</head><p>To understand complex social systems, graduates of SMU will explore contemporary efforts to document and analyze the interaction of individuals, cultures and institutions that shape economic, political and social experiences. Students take one course from the Individuals, Institutions and Cultures division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Science and Engineering (SE)</head><p>To be active, engaged citizens in a global society, graduates of SMU will be able to engage in scholarly discourse in science and engineering and to understand the implications of these disciplines. Students should be aware of the meaning and methods of science and engineering, and of the ways that both disciplines shaped and continue to shape the world around us.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology and Mathematics (TM)</head><p>Technology plays an increasingly important role in the lives of our students, which will only expand after graduation. Underlying most modern technologies are advances in mathematics. Students will discover the history, uses, and implications of mathematics and technology that shape our world. Students must take one course from the Technology and Mathematics division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Curriculum Depth Requirements (maximum of 10 credits)</head><p>The Depth courses provide more advanced knowledge or the application of fundamental ideas to other disciplinary areas. Students are required to complete three Depth courses in the three areas of Humanities and Fine Arts (HFA), History, Social and Behavioral Sciences (HSBS), and Natural and Applied Sciences (NAS).</p><p>Most students will fulfill at least one and often two Depth requirements with coursework required for their major. Some courses may meet the requirements of two different Depth areas. Such double counting could, in principle, reduce the three-course requirement to two. Depth courses may satisfy Proficiency and Experiences requirements. Students may use a second Science and Engineering (SE) Breadth course to satisfy the Natural and Applied Sciences (NAS) Depth requirement. Only one SE requirement (lecture and lab) can be met through AP credit. The maximum of 10 credits reflects that lab-based science courses may be four credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proficiencies and Experiences</head><p>To prepare SMU graduates for both career development and lifelong learning, the University Curriculum requires all undergraduates to develop and refine writing, quantitative reasoning, oral communication and information literacy skills beyond the introductory level provided through Foundations courses. The University Curriculum also encourages all undergraduates to apply curricular knowledge to the diverse, global communities in which they will live and work. The four following UC Proficiencies and Experiences (P&amp;E), required of all undergraduate students, may be met through credit-bearing coursework or approved, noncredit activities that have been identified as meeting that requirement:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human Diversity</head><p>The Human Diversity proficiency requirement challenges students to explore in a reflective way basic issues related to race, ethnicity, gender, or societal difference. This requirement may be satisfied by taking courses or participating in on-or off-campus projects that bring together aspects of human diversity in a creative and meaningful way. It is recommended that students complete this requirement in their first year. select these two from a second Writing proficiency, a second Oral Community, or these three additional P&amp;Es:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community Engagement</head><p>The Community Engagement experience requirement challenges students to engage in a reflective way in substantial community-based activities where communities are groups of people with a shared identity held together by ties of affinity or necessity not easily broken. This requirement may be satisfied by engaging in communities that are civic, religious, professional, familial, ethnic or otherwise constituted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Engagement</head><p>The Global Engagement experience requirement challenges students to participate in a reflective way by partaking in activities outside or inside the classroom or by engaging intellectually with cultures outside the U.S. or in immigrant communities inside the U.S. This requirement may be satisfied by taking courses or participating in on-and off-campus projects, which are sustained over time. Many SMU Abroad courses satisfy this requirement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface to the Curriculum</head><p>All SMU undergraduates participate in general education. General education provides students with a broad background in the liberal arts, which is essential to their growth as educated human beings. The general education curriculum is designed to help students put their majors into context, to promote valuable skills that students acquire in and outside the classroom in preparation for the modern workplace, to enable and encourage students to engage in their civic responsibilities in college and beyond, and to create a passion and platform for life-long learning. The elements of general education are fundamental, breadth, depth and co-curricular proficiency requirements. These elements are designed to build on one another over the fouryear undergraduate experience. Students begin in fundamentals with a focus on writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language proficiency, wellness, and ways of knowing. The latter exposes students to multiple lenses through which to view a particular problem or issue while comparing the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. The breadth requirements, typically met in the first two years, provide students an opportunity to explore a variety of interdisciplinary interests. Depth requirements, often met in the major, enable students to apply what they learn in breadth courses to an area of focus. Finally, during their time at SMU, students gain a variety of skills that are recognized through the co-curricular proficiency requirements. These include writing in the discipline, oral communication, diversity of and engagement in the human experience, and information literacy. Thus, general education is an integral part of students' learning and growth as they work toward graduating with a major or majors.</p><p>SMU undergraduate students choose curricula from over 100 baccalaureate degrees in more than 90 subject areas offered by the five undergraduate schools. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baccalaureate Degree Programs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Programs</head><p>www.smu.edu/univhonors The University offers a variety of honors and distinction programs to encourage research and creative scholarship among its best students.</p><p>The University Honors Program, the largest of these programs, is open to students in all majors and designed to prepare high performing students to meet the challenges of rapid change and take advantage of the possibilities this dynamic world presents. To this end, the program emphasizes the values of a liberal arts education, namely, the ability to read, write and think critically, and the acquisition of a basic understanding of human society in all its dimensions. Along with these objectives, the program provides exceptional opportunities for international study and the exploration of topics across disciplines.</p><p>The University Honors Program focuses on University Curriculum courses taken over the course of a student's career at SMU. Students begin with a two-term, first-year honors humanities seminar that encourages critical reflection about major concepts and works of literature that have shaped the modern world. Classes are small (15 or fewer students), with students in several honors sections occasionally meeting together as a larger group. Designed to be broad and introductory, and drawing on material from the past and present, the course offerings explore the way different disciplines raise questions and construct knowledge about the human experience.</p><p>In addition to the first-year honors humanities sequence of DISC 2305 and DISC 2306, students also take at least four honors seminars (Breadth and Depth courses or Ways of Knowing courses, or a one-credit-hour sophomore seminar that introduces research methods and opportunities) from among the honors offerings.</p><p>The final requirement is for the Senior Culminating Project -designed to draw the student out of the classroom and into the larger society -applying the knowledge learned to the outside world. There are many possibilities for this project, including the senior thesis in the major (see below), a Richter Fellowship, an Engaged Learning project or fellowship or other research fellowship, as well as certain internships.</p><p>The University Honors Program creates an intellectual community of students and faculty that extends beyond the classroom. Beginning with several orientation activities, special events throughout the year provide additional occasions for coming together. Honors students and faculty are encouraged to attend dinners, programs, seminars and book discussions that may be organized around scholars, artists or other distinguished visitors to the campus. Honors students benefit, too, from the sense of solidarity and community found in a campus venue dedicated to bringing together students in all University honor and scholar programs, the Scholars' Den. The program also takes advantage of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Visits to museums, studios, theatres and live-music venues allow students to experience the myriad opportunities for learning that only a large urban center can provide. At the same time, the University Honors Program at SMU is not segregated from the campus. Honors students interact with their fellow students in nonhonors classes; in the Residential Commons; in the student center; on the playing fields; and in the numerous student governing, social, pre-professional, political, cultural and social organizations that enhance student life at SMU.</p><p>Entrance to the University Honors Program is by invitation prior to matriculation or by application after at least one term of coursework at SMU. At the end of their undergraduate years, students who maintain a 3.000 GPA in their honors courses and at least a 3.300 overall GPA receive a diploma inscribed with the designation "Honors in the Liberal Arts." More information about the University Honors Program is available on the website (www.smu.edu/univhonors) or from the director, Dr. <ref type="bibr">David D. Doyle, Jr. (ddoyle@smu.edu)</ref>.</p><p>The Richter Research Fellowship Program provides funding for undergraduates to travel and conduct independent research under a faculty adviser's supervision. All honors students who have completed their second year are eligible to apply. Often this research work is connected to a student's senior honors capstone or distinction project, although that is not a requirement to apply for the fellowship. Richter projects have included researching literacy in Ghana, education for non-native English speaking children in rural California, environment/government correlation in Fiji and women's reproductive health in Ethiopia. The Richter Fellowships are available only to those students who are members of the University Honors Program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Department and Division Honors.</head><p>In addition to the University Honors Program, individual schools, departments and divisions of the University offer honors or distinction programs to exceptional students in their upperclass years. The strongest SMU students are encouraged to participate in honors programs at both the University level (the University Honors Program) and the departmental level. Depending on the major, students take a series of honors courses and seminars in their departments or divisions. Many departments and divisions also offer internships and re-search programs to upperclass students majoring in their fields. Such activities provide practical experience and specialized training within the major. Students completing honors or distinction programs within their departments or divisions graduate with an "Honors in" designation specific to their department or division. More information on these programs can be found under the individual department and division listings in this catalog.</p><p>The following is a list of schools with honors programs and departments that offer honors within the major, with a general overview of the programs:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The University maintains an academic campus at Fort Burgwin, located 10 miles southeast of Taos, New Mexico. Academic terms are regularly offered at the SMU-in-Taos campus in January and during the summer.</p><p>The campus is home to historic Fort Burgwin, originally established in 1852. The fort served many purposes, chief among them to protect area settlers, prior to its abandonment in 1860 just before the Civil War. Reconstructed, the fort now serves as office and classroom space for campus academic programs. Pot Creek Pueblo, one of the largest prehistoric sites in the northern Rio Grande Valley, is also located on the property. This site is one of the ancestral homes of modern-day Taos and Picuris pueblos, and was occupied from A.D. 1250 to 1320. SMU-in-Taos offers academic courses in January, May, June, and August. Courses are offered in the humanities, natural and social sciences, business, engineering, performing and studio arts, and archaeological research. At just eight class days, January Term is the most intensive term. Students can enroll in up to four credit hours and ski or snowboard on the weekends for PRW II credit. May and August are 12 class day terms in which students may take up to five credit hours. A longer, more traditional summer term in June allows students to take up to eight hours of coursework. Course offerings vary each year, and are designed to emphasize the Southwest, experiential learning and sustainability. Courses are heavily field trip oriented to take advantage of the campus' proximity to important northern New Mexico cultural sites.</p><p>Program participants are housed in small residences called casitas. Each casita has shared dorm rooms, bathrooms and a large study area with fireplace. Laundry facilities are located on campus, as well as a campus center, chapel, dining hall, library, computer lab and auditorium. Campus recreational facilities include a sand volleyball court, tennis and basketball courts, workout room and hiking trails.</p><p>Additional information on the campus and its programs is available online or by contacting the SMU-in-Taos Office, Southern Methodist University, PO Box 750145, Dallas TX 75275; phone 214-768-3657.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences General Information</head><p>Dedman College is the heart of SMU. It is home to the humanities, social and behavioral sciences, mathematics, and natural sciences -disciplines central to the traditions of higher education.</p><p>When SMU opened the doors of Dallas Hall in 1915 to welcome its first class of students, those students matriculated into the College of Arts and Sciences, the academic unit that would eventually become Dedman College. In 1963, with the formulation of the Master Plan, the college became the School of Humanities and Sciences in recognition of its role in the specialized education of students in the liberal arts. From 1963 until 1980, the basic liberal arts education for all SMU students was provided by University College, an independent, non-degree-granting academic unit.</p><p>The School of Humanities and Sciences was merged in 1980 with University College to create a new entity central to the enterprise of undergraduate education. This college would provide the basic foundations in liberal arts education to all SMU students and also serve as a center for the integration of specialized education in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. As an indication of its centrality to the educational process, the name was changed from school to college, emphasizing that it is a community of students and teachers, whose life together, no matter how diversified and specialized, is unified by the implicit and explicit values derived from a liberal arts education. In 1981, the newly formed college was endowed by the late Robert H. Dedman, Sr., and his wife, Nancy McMillan Dedman, and was renamed Dedman College.</p><p>In addition to being the oldest academic unit at SMU, Dedman College is also the largest. Annually, approximately 2,350 undergraduate students major in Dedman College programs, and the school enrolls approximately 450 graduate students. More than 315 faculty members are based in the college's 16 academic departments. Undergraduate students in Dedman College may major and minor in more than 50 programs. Dedman College offers 24 graduate programs leading to a master's degree and 16 programs leading to a Ph.D. degree. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Programs of Study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Programs</head><p>During their four years at SMU, students may participate in the University Honors Program, described in the Academic Programs section of this catalog, and subsequently graduate with "Honors in the Liberal Arts." Students participating in the University Honors Program are encouraged to join a departmental distinction program (described in the Academic Programs section and under General Information in the Dedman College section) to earn the designation "Honors in the Liberal Arts, Departmental Distinction" on their transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs for Preprofessional Students</head><p>Preprofessional students should become familiar with the entrance requirements of the particular professional school they intend to enter. Requirements differ to some extent even within the same profession, and some schools require that specific courses be included in the preprofessional curriculum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prelaw</head><p>SMU does not require prelaw students to declare a particular major or academic program. Prelaw seniors who go on to law school may have majors in any undergraduate schools. Success in law school requires skills in critical analysis, logical reasoning, and written and oral expression. The spoken and written word are the principal tools of the legal profession; thus, students who intend to study law must develop an excellent knowledge and grasp of the English language and a clear, concise style of expression.</p><p>A sound liberal arts education is valuable for prelaw students. Courses in political science, history, economics, statistics and anthropology help students understand the structure of society and the problems of social ordering with which the law is concerned.</p><p>The study of philosophy, literature, fine arts, world languages and other cultures imparts familiarity with traditions of universal thought and trends that have influenced legal developments nationally and internationally. The examination of human behavior in sociology and psychology will aid the prospective law student in understanding the types and effects of human behavior with which law is involved.</p><p>The systematic ordering of abstractions and ideas acquired by studying logic and the sciences contributes much to a prelaw student's capacity to analyze, understand and rationally organize his or her thoughts. In some fields of legal practice, a knowledge of technology, engineering, computers and accounting is useful.</p><p>Admission to Law Schools. Candidates for admission to an American Bar Association-approved school of law must take the Law School Admission Test administered by the national Law School Admission Council. Candidates are urged to take the test on the July, September or November testing dates of the fall term in which they apply to law school. Except in very rare circumstances, law schools require applicants for admission to hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. For additional prelaw information, and assistance in the application process, undergraduate students may consult the prelaw services in the University Advising Center, located in the Laura Lee Blanton Building, Suite 408. </p></div>

There is no preferred major but there are numerous prerequisite courses. Honors work is appropriate.</p><p>Most medical and dental schools require the following courses for entry. These courses should be completed by the end of the junior year: English, 6 credit hours; mathematics (including calculus and statistics), 6 credit hours; biology, 8-14 credit hours (14 for Texas medical schools); chemistry, 16 credit hours; and physics, 8 credit hours. In addition, some schools require biochemistry. This coursework may be done as part of a major or minor in the sciences or as electives in a non-science major or minor. Some courses will apply toward the University-wide requirements.</p><p>Candidates for admission to medical school must take the Medical College Admission Test. The test should be taken in the spring of the junior year. Candidates for dental school must take the Dental Admission Test, also suggested in the spring of the junior year. All students intending to apply to medical or dental schools should meet with the Office of Pre-Health Advising no later than early in their junior year (or year of application) to review academic and extracurricular progress and to receive important information about the HPRC (Health Professions Recommendation Committee) process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Internship Program</head><p>The Dedman College Undergraduate Internship Program helps students begin to prepare for employment. Internship credit is designed to demonstrate and reinforce the valuable and highly marketable skills that our students develop. The following guidelines apply:</p><p>• Credit-bearing internships are supervised by faculty, department or program. Note: Noncredit-bearing internships are those without faculty, department or program supervision. Internship orientation is strongly suggested for noncredit-bearing internships. Students may be asked to sign a Release of Liability for some internships. • Dedman Internship Program Orientation and Standardized University Release of Liability for Education Internship are required for credit-bearing internships. • The Hegi Family Career Development Center can assist students in finding suitable internships, developing resumes, and preparing for interviews and the internship experience. Students are advised to visit the career center to help ensure adequate preparation for internships. • Internship credit and grades are based on a written learning contract signed by the student and faculty supervisor and approved by the department chair or director of undergraduate studies. In addition, students and site supervisors will complete evaluations of the experience. These evaluations are not considered in determination of the grade. • Internships that are used to qualify for Dedman College course credit may not also be used to qualify for course credit in another SMU school. • Internship credit requires a written component based on and reflective of the experiential dimension. • Internship credit is available only through approved internship courses.</p><p>• Internship credit may range from one to three hours.</p><p>• Maximum total internship credit that may be applied toward a degree is three hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Education</head><p>The University offers teacher education through the Simmons School of Education and Human Development and recommends candidates for certification by the State Board of Educator Certification. The recommendation is based on a candidate's successful completion of 24 credit hours in education (EDU) courses and six credit hours of student teaching. In addition, candidates must pass the Texas Examinations of Educator Standards. Prospective secondary teachers must have majors in appropriate teaching fields; students who wish to teach in a science or humanities discipline at the secondary level should combine a Dedman major in that area with the appropriate education (EDU) coursework through the Simmons School. More information is available from the Department of Teaching and Learning. For a general description of the program in teacher education, students should see the Simmons School of Education and Human Development section of this catalog.</p></div>

Although only one major is required for graduation, with careful planning, students may complete two or more majors and/or multiple minors within the prescribed total hours. Students may also qualify for baccalaureate degrees from two or more schools in the University. Some characteristic pairings are English or political science in Dedman College and journalism in Meadows School of the Arts; physics or mathematics in Dedman College and electrical engineering in the Lyle School of Engineering; and world language in Dedman College and a major or minor in the Cox School of Business. Since all requirements for both degrees must be met, students should confer with advisers in both schools at an early date to prepare a plan of study.</p><p>Students are individually responsible for knowing and complying with all regulations and requirements that may apply to their respective programs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Distinction</head><p>During their junior and senior years, students may participate in the honors courses and seminars offered within their major departments. A variety of internships and research programs are also offered in some departments to provide practical exposure and experience within the disciplines. By successfully completing a special program of study in the major department, a student may be awarded departmental distinction regardless of eligibility for graduation honors. This award is conferred by the major department on the basis of criteria prescribed by the department, but all programs include the minimum requirements of independent reading and research beyond the regular departmental requirements for a degree and the completion of a senior paper or research report. Further information can be obtained from the individual departments in the Courses of Study in Dedman College section of this catalog or from www.smu.edu/dedman.</p></div>

The Air Force ROTC program develops skills and provides education vital to the career officer. Active-duty Air Force personnel provide all instruction and program administration. Students who participate in the UNT Air Force ROTC program are responsible for their own travel and other physical arrangements.</p><p>The program is open to all students. First-year students may enroll in the four-year program, and students with at least three undergraduate or graduate academic years remaining may apply for the two-or threeyear program. Current emphasis in the Air Force ROTC college scholarship program is to award scholarships to candidates pursuing undergraduate engineering or other scientific and technical disciplines. Nearly 90 percent of Air Force ROTC scholarships are awarded in these disciplines. However, students in every degree program enjoy scholarship opportunities as the Air Force seeks to engage students who excel both academically and militarily. Scholarships are awarded at various amounts in increments of four, three and two years and entitlements may be extended to cover a fifth year of school if the student is taking an approved technical major. Uniforms and textbooks for Air Force ROTC courses are issued at no cost to cadets. Students register for the aerospace studies courses at the same time and in the same manner as they register for other SMU courses. The Air Force ROTC courses may be taken as electives in most academic majors. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Distinction</head><p>A biological sciences major with sufficiently high academic standing may graduate with departmental distinction by successfully completing a special program of study that includes advanced coursework, research and a senior thesis under the direction of a member of the departmental faculty. To graduate with departmental distinction, a student must be working toward a B.S. degree and must submit an application to the Undergraduate Studies Committee of the department. At the time of the application, the student must have begun a research project with a departmental faculty member, and must have completed at least 14 credit hours of biological sciences, including at least six advanced hours (3000 level and above), with a GPA in these courses of at least 3.500 and an overall GPA of at least 3.500. For students who have transferred to SMU, two grade point averages will be calculated: one for all work attempted and one for work completed through enrollment at SMU. Admission to the program will be based on the lower of the two averages.</p><p>With departmental approval, the student will enroll for BIOL 4398, and continue to work on the distinction research project. Upon completion of this course with a grade of B+ or better, the student has the option to enroll in BIOL 4399 (pass/fail). On the basis of this research project, an oral presentation will be made to the faculty, and a senior thesis or review article will be written. In addition, three 4000-or 5000-level courses must be completed: one from BIOL 4319, BIOL 4325, BIOL 4331, BIOL 4370, and at least two from BIOL 5304, BIOL 5305, BIOL 5310, BIOL 5311, BIOL 5325, BIOL 5340. Completion of these requirements and maintenance of a 3.500 GPA for all biological sciences courses attempted will determine if the B.S. degree will be awarded with departmental distinction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological Sciences B.S. (Molecular and Cell Biology, M.S.)</head><p>The primary goal of the combined B.S.-M.S. degree is to encourage and better prepare undergraduates for careers in biological research. The accelerated pathway permits students to complete the requirements for the B.S. degree in biological sciences and the requirements for the M.S. degree in molecular and cell biology in a total of five years.</p><p>Students need to complete most corequisites and University Curriculum requirements in a timely fashion, preferably by the end of their junior year. The calculus and/or statistics corequirement should be completed by the end of the sophomore year. All chemistry and physics corequirements should be completed by the end of the junior year. Most advanced biology electives, including the biological chemistry course BIOL 5310, also should be completed by the end of the junior year because the senior year will be largely filled with 6000-level biology classes.</p><p>In addition, students are expected to be engaged in full-time research in the lab of a faculty member during summers following their sophomore, junior and senior years, and to continue their research throughout the academic year. During the academic year, students may receive course credit for their research <ref type="figure">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>In coordination with a faculty member, students should apply to the Biology Graduate Committee for admission into the B.S.-M.S. program in the spring of their sophomore year. Later admission to the program may be considered, but students must be on track to complete course requirements, as described above. A research mentor must be identified, and a minimum 3.200 GPA in science courses is required. To remain in the program, students will need to maintain a minimum 3.000 GPA in science courses and exhibit satisfactory progress in their lab work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological Sciences, B.A.</head><p>The B.A. degree program is designed for students who wish to couple training in the biological sciences with a broad liberal arts program.

Huffington Department of Earth Sciences provides ways of understanding and appreciating dynamic Earth processes, the physical environment, and the place of humanity in the long and complex history of the planet and solar system. The programs also provide the background for rewarding careers in industry, government and academia. The faculty offers learning and research opportunities in geology, geochemistry, geophysics, resource geology, planetary geology, paleontology, and natural resource and energy management.</p><p>Earth science is an interdisciplinary, applied science that integrates well with other fields. It attracts students with broad interests in geology, chemistry, biology, environmental science, archaeology, astronomy, oceanography, engineering, applied mathematics or physics. The department strongly encourages combined majors. In addition to combinations with the above fields, many undergraduate Earth science majors have double majors or minors in business (especially finance, real estate or marketing), economics, prelaw, computer science, archaeology, world languages, English, history, journalism and premed.</p><p>Academic programs are tailored to the educational and career objectives of each student. Because of the heavily funded active research programs within the department and ties with the Dallas geological community, students often receive excellent pre-and post-graduation employment opportunities. The department also has some financial aid available for undergraduate majors, including department scholarships and support for off-campus field programs.</p><p>The department offers two different majors in Earth sciences: earth sciences B.A. and B.S. Two minors, one in geology and the other in environmental earth sciences, are available for those not pursuing a major in the earth sciences. The department is also the home of the environmental science and environmental studies programs which can be found in the section on Dedman Interdisciplinary programs.</p></div>

Each student should devise a program of study that meets individual interests and needs and also achieves a balance between diversification and specialization. Except where specified, there are no prerequisites, and interested students are invited into all courses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>www.smu.edu/biochemistry</head><p>Professor Steven Vik, Director</p><p>The B.S. degree in biochemistry reflects the interdisciplinary nature of modern biochemistry and includes courses in physics, mathematics, chemistry and biology. Undergraduate research is also highly recommended. These courses will prepare students for graduate study leading to a Ph.D. degree, for entrance to professional schools such as medicine, or for the chemical or biotechnology industry. The program includes a core of required courses but allows some flexibility in the choice of additional upperdivision courses. Students planning to attend graduate school are advised to take at least three credits of undergraduate research (BIOL 3398, BIOL 4398 or CHEM 4397).</p><p>Note: There are two options for choosing the additional courses. Option 1 has been certified by the American Chemical Society for professional training in biochemistry. Option 2 provides a more traditional curriculum for biochemistry majors.</p><p>Students obtaining a B.S. degree in biochemistry may not also obtain a major or minor in chemistry or biology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Distinction</head><p>A biochemistry major may graduate with departmental distinction by successfully completing a special program of study that includes independent reading and research and a senior thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty. The student must submit an application to the biochemistry adviser by the first term of the junior year and must have completed at least 22 hours toward the biochemistry degree with a GPA of at least 3.500 in courses required for the major. Upon approval from the respective departments, the student must enroll in the following courses: BIOL 4398, BIOL 4399 or CHEM 4397. Upon completion of these courses, the student will write a senior thesis and present it orally before a public audience including a faculty committee composed of the student's research adviser, the biochemistry adviser, and at least one additional faculty member. Upon successful completion of all degree requirements, the senior thesis and maintenance of a GPA of at least 3.500 in courses required for the major, the B.S. degree will be awarded with departmental distinction. The B.S. degree in biophysical sciences bridges the disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics, connecting the complexity of life to the laws of physics. The program at SMU consists of core courses in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and the School of Education. It includes the entire SMU prehealth curriculum and additional courses that provide advanced learning in order to provide a strong foundation for careers in medicine or research. The remaining credit hours can be obtained from a selection of elective courses that are available in the degree plan. This program is advised in the SMU Department of Physics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Major</head><p>Students obtaining a B.S. degree in biophysical sciences cannot receive a minor or second major in chemistry or physics. In addition, no advanced biology courses, except Genetics and Cell Biology, can be double counted towards a minor or second major in biology. The minor in classical studies offers an integrated program studying the various aspects of the civilization of ancient Greece and Rome. The minor requires 18 hours, of which at least nine hours must be at the advanced level (3000 or above). Coursework for the minor must be distributed as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Major</head><p>Requirements for the Minor Classical Languages (6 Credit Hours) Explores the conceptual and philosophical underpinnings of ancient understandings of reality in Western and non-Western cultures in both ancient and modern times.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associate Professor Austin Baldwin, Director</head><p>The minor in cognitive science is an interdisciplinary minor focused on the study of the mind and the nature of cognition and intelligence, from the perspectives of psychology and philosophy, and potentially (depending upon which courses students elect to take) other disciplines including computer science, neuroscience, linguistics, or mathematics. Topics include the nature of cognition, consciousness, perception, memory, emotion, language acquisition, reasoning, decision-making and behavior, using tools from neuroscience, computer modelling, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and formal logic.</p><p>No more than two courses can be double-counted towards this minor and another minor or major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Minor</head><p>The cognitive science minor requires five courses (15 credit hours) from the lists below. Students take one introductory course, one theoretical foundation course, one empirical foundation course, one interdisciplinary bridge course, and one elective course. These courses must be distributed as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introductory Course (3 Credit Hours)</head><p>These lower-level courses provide good preparation for further study in cognitive science. At most, one course from this list may count towards the minor. These courses introduce students to central theoretical and philosophical issues at the heart of cognitive science and bring together explanations at different levels and/or from different academic disciplines. This theoretical background serves as a springboard for further specialization and helps to provide scaffolding to draw together other courses in this interdisciplinary minor. Students must choose at least one course from this list: The following interdisciplinary courses each illustrate how issues in cognitive science can be beneficially approached by work drawing from multiple disciplines within cognitive science. Many of these courses have prerequisites not directly included in this minor, so may be ideal only for students who have relevant preparation or are willing to take extra prerequisites. Students must choose at least one course from this list.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">•</formula><p>Note: Some courses are listed as both foundations and interdisciplinary, but no student can count a single course as both. All students must take three separate courses to meet these three requirements.</p><p>• These courses each contribute in important ways to cognitive science, but are specialized or advanced in ways that kept them from fitting earlier in the encouraged progression for the minor. Depending on whether students opt to count an introductory course towards the minor, one to two courses will remain. For the remaining course(s), students must choose an elective course from any of the nonintroductory lists, including this list of other electives.</p><p>• ANTH 3303 -Self, Culture, The ethnic studies program offers an interdisciplinary examination of African-American and Mexican-American experiences through the social sciences and humanities. Students receive instruction in important periods of African, Mexican and American history, probing the roots of traditions beginning in early African and pre-Columbian cultures, as well as examining minorities in contemporary U.S. society. This program provides good preparation for graduate work in the social sciences, the humanities and professional schools, as well as jobs and careers in many fields. Education, law, journalism, urban planning, business, social work and politics are a few of the fields for which ethnic studies provides a strong background.</p><p>The B.A. degree focuses on humanities and, consequently, requires less work in methodology and statistics than the B.S. degree. Courses to fulfill the requirements for this program should be selected in consultation with the program director. A total of 33 credit hours are required to complete the major in African and African-American studies. Three courses chosen from the following, with two outside of history and at least one at the 3000 level or above:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The major in individualized studies in the liberal arts provides students the opportunity to design a thematically coherent interdisciplinary program of study that brings fields of inquiry together in unique combinations not currently offered as a program in the SMU curriculum. Interested and academically qualified students are invited to explore this possibility with the program's director (Dedman College Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for Curriculum). If the student's plan of study appears to have merit, the director will suggest three faculty members to serve on the student's Faculty Supervisory Committee, who will provide additional guidance in designing the program.</p><p>Students with at least a 3.500 GPA in the first 24 credit hours taken through enrollment at SMU are eligible to pursue the program, which consists of individually designed majors in the liberal arts of at least 36 credit hours, with a minimum of 24 credit hours of advanced courses (3000 level or above). The program must satisfy all University-wide requirements and all other University and Dedman College graduation requirements. Students are responsible for fulfilling all prerequisites for courses taken. The degree will be identified as a B.A. with a major in individualized studies in the liberal arts. A note on the transcript will denote the specialization. Students intending to seek admission to graduate schools are encouraged to include at least 30 credit hours of a coherent set of courses in an identifiable disciplinary field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administrative Procedures</head><p>The Dedman College Undergraduate Council shall have the final authority to approve all individualized studies programs. The Dedman College associate dean for academic affairs will act as the director of the individualized studies program. Prior to declaring the major, a number of steps must be completed:</p><p>1. The student should contact the Dedman College Office of Records and Academic Services to confirm that the student is eligible to declare an individualized studies program. 2. The student, with the assistance of the individualized studies program director, must form a Faculty Supervisory Committee with a minimum of three members. The committee will provide advice and guidance to the student. At least two members, including the chair of the committee, shall be resident members of the Dedman College faculty. 3. Contact the individualized studies program director to obtain instructions for preparing a plan of study. The student will submit a plan of study to the director and to each Faculty Supervisory Committee member. If the committee and the director approve the plan of study, the plan is then submitted for approval by the Dedman College Undergraduate Council. 4. The plan is transmitted to the Dedman College Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and to th 5. e Dedman College Office of Records and Academic Services.</p><p>The plan of study must be submitted to the Dedman College Undergraduate Council for approval before the completion of 60 total credit hours of coursework. The chair of the Faculty Supervisory Committee and the Dedman College Dean's Office will recommend candidates for graduation. The director of the Office of Records and Academic Services will be responsible for verifying and certifying graduation requirements.</p><p>Note that a Summary Report must be prepared by the student in the final semester of study before graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distinction</head><p>Students completing an individualized studies major can do so with distinction, which is a prearranged, two-term sequence of advanced coursework culminating in an advanced research project. The research is planned during the junior year and accomplished during the senior year. Many of these projects may qualify as a project through the Dedman College Interdisciplinary Institute and/or an Engaged Learning project, and it is the student's responsibility to consider all possibilities and deadlines.</p><p>To undertake distinction, a student must have completed 60 credit hours of coursework, have a GPA of 3.500 in the major courses, and must have completed a minimum of 15 advanced hours (3000 level or above) in the individualized studies major. The research project for distinction in individualized studies must be substantively different from a research project for possible distinction in a second major field. Graduation with distinction is designated on the diploma for a student who successfully completes the criteria outlined.</p><p>To earn distinction, a student must: 1. Complete 36 credit hours of approved coursework for the individualized studies major with a 3.500 GPA or higher. 2. Submit a formal research proposal, based on the two options listed below, for approval of the student's Faculty Supervisory Committee and the individualized studies program director (Dedman College Dean's Office). The proposal must be unanimously approved. Any substantive changes must be reviewed and approved by the Faculty Supervisory Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Option One:</head><p>Create a Distinction Committee of three faculty members including at least two members of the Faculty Supervisory Committee. This project committee should include a mentor in each field that the project brings together.</p><p>Complete an advanced theory or methods course as recommended by the student's Distinction Committee and approved by the Faculty Supervisory Committee. This course may or may not be a part of the 36-credit hour major and should directly relate to the development of the distinction project.</p><p>Complete a research project for three credit hours beyond the 36-credit hour major requirement. This can either be a DCAR course or an independent study taken in the field connected to the primary distinction committee member. As part of the course, the student must complete a significant research paper with a minimum of 5,000 to 8,000 words of text, including a bibliography, in APA or other appropriate academic writing style. The course instructor is the primary member of the Distinction Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Option Two:</head><p>If the student has significant coursework in one Dedman College subject area, the student may submit a proposal to the Faculty Supervisory Committee to meet that department's requirements for distinction. This plan must have the approval of the Faculty Supervisory Committee and the department. The course instructor for distinction must be a faculty member of that department and a member of the student's Faculty Supervisory Committee.</p><p>3. Give an oral presentation and defense of the project to the Distinction Committee or instructor (whichever is applicable), the student's Faculty Supervisory Committee and the individualized studies program director (Dedman College Dean's Office). The presentation should include an overview of the project rationale, methodology, significant results and relevance to the larger academic community. This presentation must be scheduled to take place before the last day of instruction. The distinction paper must be submitted at least two weeks prior to presentation to the distinction committee or instructor, the Faculty Supervisory Committee, and the individualized studies program director (Dedman College Dean's Office). All parties must be able to attend. For option two, the instructor and the Faculty Supervisory Committee must be able to attend. 4. Complete the overall project with a grade of A or A-, determined by the student's Distinction Committee or instructor, and approved by the Faculty Supervisory Committee and the director of the individualized studies program. When all the above qualifications have been met, the granting of distinction for individualized studies in the liberal arts is recommended by the Faculty Supervisory Committee to the director of the program, and ultimately granted or denied by the individualized studies program director (Dedman College Dean's Office).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>To succeed in an international career, students need expertise in the politics, economics, history, language and cultures of societies other than their own. The curricula for the International and Area Studies Program are designed to provide students with a foundation for this expertise, requiring coursework in the social sciences, business, language and humanities. A student majoring in international studies chooses a region in which to specialize: Africa/Middle East, Asia, Europe, or Latin America.</p><p>As an alternative to the international studies major or minor, a student may choose the area studies minor. These minors include Africa/Middle East studies, Asian studies, European studies, and Latin American and Iberian studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Studies Major Rules for SMU Abroad Credit</head><p>To maximize the educational experience in these degree programs, all international studies majors are strongly encouraged to spend at least one term or summer studying abroad. The University offers numerous study abroad opportunities around the world; most of these courses may be applied to the international studies major. The following policies apply to the International Studies Program:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For the International Studies Major</head><p>• Up to 12 credit hours of world language study may be taken in an SMU-approved study abroad program and counted toward the language requirement for the major. • Up to 15 credit hours in the student's regional specialization may be taken in an SMU-approved study abroad program and counted toward the major. • Of the 15 credit hours required from the Core Courses, 12 hours must be taken on an SMU campus (Dallas, Taos or Plano). Three hours of transfer credit (not an SMU-approved study abroad program) may be counted toward fulfillment of the Core Courses requirement. • If a student wishes to take a course abroad for credit in the global perspective, it is highly recommended that the course be preapproved by the director before enrolling. Petitions after the course has been taken may not be approved. • The senior seminar (INTL 4388) must be taken on an SMU campus (Dallas, Taos or Plano).</p><p>• A total of 33 credit hours (exclusive of the 12 hours of language study required for the major) are required for the major in international studies. • These policies do not change the required number of credit hours in advanced courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Distinction</head><p>The International Studies program offers selected undergraduate majors an opportunity to undertake a special program of study and research as a candidate for award of the B.A. degree with departmental distinction. The criteria for departmental distinction are as follows:</p><p>• A minimum 3.000 grade point average overall • A minimum 3.500 grade point average in the major • Preparation for a department distinction thesis under the supervision of a faculty adviser. The grade received for INTL 4307 must be A-or higher • A minimum 3.500 grade point average in a least two advanced courses related to the topic of the thesis; one of these may be a course taken outside the requirements for the major • Passing "with distinction" an oral examination of at least one hour, conducted by a faculty committee A student wishing to undertake work toward departmental distinction should follow this process:</p><p>• Apply for admission to candidacy no later than December 1 (for May or August graduates) or May 1 (for December graduates). • Arrange for a distinction thesis adviser • Register for INTL 4307 during the last semester of senior year, having met all criteria for distinction (see above). Potential candidates are strongly encouraged to begin developing a thesis several months ahead of registration for INTL 4307. Students will meet with their distinction thesis adviser on a regular basis during the term (i.e. several times a month), and must make sure that sufficient copies of the completed thesis are submitted to members of the thesis committee at least ten days prior to the oral examination.</p><p>The defense or oral examination will last at least one hour. Each member of the committee will have an opportunity to examine the candidate on topics relevant to the thesis and related courses taken by the students. All oral examinations must be completed before the first day of the semester's final examination period.</p><p>The distinction thesis adviser will assign a regular letter grade for INTL 4307, reflecting the adviser's judgment of the quality of work and research performed by the candidate. If the advisor anticipates that the grade may fall below A-before the date of the oral examination, the committee will be so informed. The committee may then, by unanimous vote only, decide to conduct the examination.</p><p>By unanimous agreement of its members, the distinction committee will report in writing whether the student has (or has not) passed the examination "with distinction." If the examination committee recommends against distinction, it shall report the reasons in writing to the program director of designated representative. No decision to deny distinction will be reported in the student's permanent file or transcript; but a grade for INTL 4307 will be reported to the University Registrar. </p></div>

Studies reveal how the historical shapes, institutional structures, literary visions and artistic forms that emerged from the Middle Ages have colored our concepts of God, society, self, love, individualism and success. It is appropriate for preprofessional training in multiple fields such as business, religious studies, biology, music theory, and world languages and literatures. The major can also lead to graduate work in medieval studies or, more usually, in such disciplines as literature, history, and art and music history.</p><p>The Dallas Medieval Consortium makes it possible for students at SMU, the University of Dallas and the University of Texas at Dallas to enroll in selected medieval studies courses on the other campuses. Through the consortium, SMU students can elect no more than 15 credit hours in medieval subject courses at any other consortium university.</p><p>Medieval studies is an interdisciplinary major of 30 credit hours in medieval subjects, and advanced Latin language and literature, distributed over at least three broad subject areas in medieval studies: 1) history, 2) literature, and 3) music and visual arts (art/music history), with no fewer than six credit hours in each area. Latin language and literature courses after the second year may, with the approval of the director, count toward hours for the medieval studies major. Students are encouraged to take courses in medieval philosophy, religious studies and church history when they are available. Individual student programs are approved by the director and a committee of two other members of the Medieval Studies Program faculty.</p><p>Many departmental courses in the field of medieval studies are offered each year; courses listed as "MDVL" are interdisciplinary.

Here are some of the questions we will consider: When and why does the content of law -what the law is -depend on the content of morality -on what is right and wrong, just and unjust, fair and unfair, etc.? When and how does interpreting and applying laws (statutes, precedents, etc.) involve making value judgments, including moral judgments? Does the United States Constitution enact the "original understanding" of freedom of speech, due process of law, equal protection of the laws, and so on? Or does it, instead, direct us to apply our own, perhaps quite different, understandings of these concepts? (The latter view is called "the moral reading" of the Constitution.) Is there a moral obligation to obey the law? When and why is punishing those who break the law morally justified? Satisfies elective requirements in the following majors and minors: philosophy, ethics, human rights, and law and legal reasoning. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>Statistical data scientists are specialists in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. There is an accelerating demand for experts in statistical analysis and data analytics because of today's big data phenomenon fueled by an explosion of data from sources such as sensors, social media, cloud computing, medical instruments, business processes and surveys. As a result, the field of statistics will be increasingly more fundamental to academia, business and government in order to accommodate the escalating dependence on data-driven decisions. An attractive aspect of the statistics profession is the wide variety of problems that can be addressed:</p><p>• Government agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau and the Food and Drug Administration need statisticians. • Manufacturing and related industries employ statisticians to work in areas such as quality and productivity. • Banks and insurance companies hire statisticians to assist in modeling financial data.</p><p>• Medical schools, research hospitals and pharmaceutical companies typically employ statistical specialists as biostatisticians. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, statistical science is a valuable double major or minor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>The Cox School of Business offers three undergraduate programs. All Cox classes, unless otherwise noted in the course descriptions, are open only to students in the Bachelor of Business Administration or Minor in Business Administration programs. Students in the minor in business may enroll only in the classes listed in this minor's curriculum (Minor Requirements section). Note: Detailed information regarding SMU's admission requirements, regulations and procedures is found in the Admission to the University section of this catalog.</p><p>• The B.B.A. program offers seven academic majors within business. Admission is available to entering SMU students through the BBA Scholars Program, the Business Direct Program, or to continuing and transfer students through the process described in Admission of SMU Students to a Business Major or Admission of External Transfer Students to a Business Major below. • The minor in business administration provides a comprehensive introduction to business for SMU students who have majors outside the Cox School. Courses in this minor are a subset of the B.B.A. core courses and are offered throughout the academic year. Admission to the minor in business administration follows the same requirements outlined in Admission of SMU Students to a Business Major or Admission of External Transfer Students to a Business Major below. • The minor in business offers non-Cox students a foundation in business concepts to complement their primary areas of academic interest. Courses in this program are offered during summer and intersession terms at the three SMU campuses (Dallas and Plano in Texas and Taos, New Mexico). These courses are open to all non-Cox majors or students not enrolled in the minor in business administration. Cox majors and minors in business administration may take BUSE 3310 or FINA 3312 as free elective credit only; they may not take other minor in business courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guidelines for In-class Requirement and Use of Electronic Devices</head><p>All B.B.A. majors and minors in business administration and all prebusiness students enrolled in ITOM 2308, ITOM 3306 and ACCT 4307/ITOM 4307 are required to have laptop computers and bring them to each class session. Windows-based PCs are highly preferred, particularly for finance majors. Note: Students must have Windows AND the current version of Office for Windows installed on their laptops.</p><p>All instructors have the right and responsibility to set course policy, which should be included in the syllabus. Students are bound by the instructor's policy regardless of what other instructors or courses may accept and/or require. This policy may include (but is not restricted to) the following alternatives.</p><p>• The use of laptop computers is limited to one of the following levels:</p><p>• Laptop use is restricted to course-related (and possibly session-related) content and applications only. • If there is no course-related content that students can reasonably be expected to need during class sessions, laptop use can be restricted to note-taking use only. • If in-class tests are provided in electronic form, students may be allowed to take the test on their laptops. • If none of the above uses is desired, the use of laptops can be prohibited during class sessions. • Use of chat services during class sessions is prohibited.</p><p>• Unless there are course-related applications of mobile phones, PDAs and smart-phones, the use of such equipment during class sessions is prohibited. Mobile phones must be shut off or set to silent mode during class sessions, and answering telephone calls and text messages during class is prohibited. • Use of cameras and video cameras on mobile phones and laptops during class sessions may be prohibited or allowed.

The all-college cumulative GPA includes all SMU coursework and courses completed at all other colleges if these courses have content-based equivalents at SMU. If credit is nontransferable because the grade earned is below C-, but the course is equivalent in content to an SMU course, the grade will count toward the all-college cumulative GPA. • Once a student enrolls at SMU, all remaining subset courses must be completed through enrollment at SMU. • All subset courses must be taken for a grade (not taken pass/fail), with the exception of those courses in which the student has test credit. • Students must have passing grades in all subset courses before entering the Cox School.</p><p>• Current University grading policy, as summarized under Academic Forgiveness in the General Policies section of this catalog, permits forgiveness of academic work taken 10 or more years prior to the term of admission. Academic work forgiven under this policy will not be included in the allcollege cumulative GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission via the Extended Subset</head><p>Students who do not achieve a 3.500 all-college cumulative GPA and/or 39 credit hours completed may seek admission to Cox through the extended subset option by adding the first graded attempt of ACCT 2302 to the original subset. Students who have completed at least 39 credit hours and who earn a minimum 3.500 all-college cumulative GPA as of the term in which the extended subset is completed will be admitted to the Cox B.B.A. degree program. Once a student enrolls at SMU, ACCT 2302 must be completed through enrollment at SMU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying for Admission as a First-Year Applicant</head><p>First-year applicants submit an application for admission to the SMU Division of Enrollment Services and follow the University requirements for admission (under the Admission to the University section in this catalog). Applicants who are admitted to SMU and who indicate business as their primary academic interest on the application for admission are automatically reviewed for admission to the Cox BBA Scholars Program or the Business Direct Program. More information is available in the BBA Scholars and Business Direct programs sections.</p><p>Admission to the Cox BBA Scholars Program and to the Business Direct Program is by invitation only to students entering SMU directly from high school. Transfer students are not considered for admission in either the BBA Scholars Program or the Business Direct Program. First-year students invited to join either program must accept their invitation no later than the University's deposit deadline (typically May 1) prior to SMU matriculation in the following fall. Students who accept admission to the Cox BBA Scholars Program may enter Cox during their first year at SMU. Students who accept admission to the Business Direct Program may enter Cox after completion of the subset courses with good academic standing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Declaring a Business Major as a Current SMU Student</head><p>Students who meet the Cox admission requirements should complete a Change of Degree Program form at the records office of their current school. This form will be forwarded with the student's academic record to the Cox School. Business majors normally enter Cox after three terms of full-time enrollment; students who take longer to complete the admission requirements may need additional time to complete degree requirements. • For admission purposes to the Cox B.B.A. program, the all-college cumulative GPA is recorded at the end of the term the student completes the business subset courses AND has at least 39 cumulative credit hours. The all-college cumulative GPA includes all SMU coursework and courses completed at all other colleges if these courses have content-based equivalents at SMU. If credit is nontransferable because the grade earned is below C-, but the course is equivalent in content to an SMU course, the grade will count toward the all-college cumulative GPA. • Current University grading policy, as summarized under Academic Forgiveness in the General Policies section of this catalog, permits forgiveness of academic work taken 10 or more years prior to the term of admission. Academic work forgiven under this policy will not be included in the allcollege cumulative GPA. • Students must have passing grades in all subset courses before entering the Cox School.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission of External Transfer Students to a Business Major/B.B.A. Degree Program</head><p>• When evaluating courses taken at other colleges or universities, the Cox School will use the grades and credit hours designated by the school at which the courses were taken. Business Elective Transfer Credit (BETC) is used to award transfer credit for transferable courses where there is not an equivalent business course prefix. The Cox School will not recalculate grades earned at schools that use grading systems different from SMU's nor change the number of credit hours for a course. Transfer students who have not completed the business subset courses may be eligible for admission to SMU as prebusiness majors and will then follow the admission requirements outlined above for current SMU students. Those who have completed the subset courses but who do not meet Cox admission requirements may be eligible for admission to SMU via the extended subset option or for admission to SMU to pursue a nonbusiness major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Admission via the Extended Subset</head><p>Students who do not achieve a 3.500 all-college cumulative GPA and/or 39 credit hours completed may seek admission to Cox through the extended subset option by adding the first graded attempt of ACCT 2302 to the original subset. Students who have completed at least 39 credit hours and who earn a minimum 3.500 all-college cumulative GPA as of the term in which the extended subset is completed will be admitted to the Cox B.B.A. degree program. Once a student enrolls at SMU, ACCT 2302 must be completed through enrollment at SMU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Minors</head><p>SMU students who are NOT seeking a major in the Cox School may select from two business minors. The minor in business administration provides a comprehensive introduction to business for SMU students who have majors outside the Cox School. Students in this minor take specified B.B.A. core courses, which are offered throughout the academic year. The minor in business offers non-Cox students a foundation in business concepts to complement their primary areas of academic interest. Courses in this program are offered during summer and intersession terms at SMU's three campuses (Dallas and Plano in Texas and Taos, New Mexico). These courses are open to all non-Cox majors or students not enrolled in the minor in business administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to the Minor in Business Administration</head><p>The minor in business administration operates concurrently with the B.B.A. degree program and includes seven courses that can apply toward either the B.B.A. degree or the minor in business administration (Minor Requirements section). Students in this minor must meet the same admission requirements as students in the Cox B.B.A. program as described above and will be enrolled in the same sections of business courses as business majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to the Minor in Business</head><p>The minor in business is open to all SMU students who are NOT pursuing a B.B.A. major or the minor in business administration. The minor in business does not have prerequisite courses or GPA-based admission requirements. The minor in business offers courses designed to provide a general overview of business topics to complement a variety of academic interests. Students may pursue this minor by enrolling in the appropriate courses and completing a minor declaration form with the academic adviser for their major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statute of Limitations</head><p>If a student is readmitted to SMU after an absence of three years or longer, the student will be readmitted under the University catalog in effect at the time of readmission and will be subject to degree and admissions requirements in that current catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance of Transfer Credit Prior to Enrollment</head><p>A prospective transfer student must present to the Division of Enrollment Services official transcripts containing a full record of all previous college work attempted. Failure to provide full records of all work is grounds for dismissal from the Cox School. To avoid delay, students should forward transcripts to the SMU Division of Enrollment Services no later than July 1 for the fall term and December 1 for the spring term.</p><p>In general, transfer credit will be accepted for business major or minor credit only if the courses completed are equivalent in content to those offered at SMU and if the university's school of business at which the courses were completed is accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). In the case of transfer credit completed at a junior/community college, only those courses with equivalents at the first-year and sophomore level at SMU (1000-and 2000-level courses) will be accepted for business major or minor credit.</p><p>Prior to matriculation, the Cox School will accept transfer business credit toward the B.B.A. degree from schools accredited by AACSB International regardless of the student's classification if there are equivalent/appropriate courses at SMU.</p><p>Courses completed with a grade of D+ or less or those completed without letter grades (pass/fail or satisfactory/unsatisfactory) will not be transferred for any degree credit. Grades earned elsewhere will be considered for admission purposes and in determining graduation with honors. When evaluating courses taken at other colleges and universities, the Cox School will use the grades designated by the school at which the courses were taken. The Cox School will not recalculate grades earned at schools that use grading systems different from SMU's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit for Current SMU Students</head><p>Students enrolled in the Cox School who are seeking to fulfill any portion of their degree requirements through transfer credit must file a petition for approval of their intentions with the B.B.A. Academic Advising and Records Office in 252 Maguire prior to enrollment for such courses. With the approval of the appropriate SMU departmental chair, SMU students may complete a maximum of 30 transfer credit hours for degree credit. Students are cautioned to check the current SMU catalog before enrolling in courses at other institutions and to verify transferability with the appropriate offices. Matriculated students must complete all required business courses through enrollment at SMU. Exceptions to this policy require concurrent approval of the associate dean for undergraduate studies, the appropriate department chair, and the director of B.B.A. academic advising and records.</p><p>Regardless of the number of acceptable transfer credit hours, at least 60 of the total 122 baccalaureate credit hours must be completed through enrollment at SMU. Of the required business credit hours, a minimum of 30 must be completed through enrollment at SMU or SMU-approved international programs.</p><p>Detailed information regarding University-wide policies is provided in this catalog in the Admission to the University section and the Academic Records and General and Enrollment Standards section, and topics for the latter are listed in the table of contents.</p></div>

The chief administrative officer of each department is the department chair, who reports directly to the dean. More information on the Lyle School of Engineering and its programs is available at www.smu.edu/lyle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperative Education</head><p>The The SMU Co-op Program is designed so each student can enhance his or her education and career by receiving professional training while alternating terms of classroom instruction. Participation in the program allows students to</p><p>• Confirm that they like working in their major.</p><p>• Discover the kind of work they like within their major.</p><p>• Establish a professional reputation.</p><p>• Earn the cumulative equivalent of one year of a new graduate's starting salary before graduation.</p><p>• Gain invaluable work experience when competing for full-time jobs upon graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How the Cooperative Program Operates</head><p>Entry into the SMU Co-op Program is typically offered in the summer term after the sophomore year or the fall term of the junior year during the student's academic progression. Two sample terms of entry are shown below: Each applicant receives advising from the program's director and a direct result of advising is that the student gains a better understanding of individual options and a strategy for pursuing those options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who May Apply?</head><p>Any Lyle School of Engineering undergraduate student in good standing who has enough time remaining before graduation to alternate at least three times between terms of full-time work and terms of full-time school may apply for the Co-op Program. Transfer students must be admitted and accepted to SMU before applying.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When to Apply</head><p>Many students choose to begin the application process during the first term of their first year. This early start is especially beneficial for students planning to participate in fraternity/sorority recruitment during the second term of their first year. Students should apply two or more terms before the work term begins. The first of these terms is for preparation; the second is for applying and interviewing with companies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policies of the Cooperative Engineering Education Program</head><p>Since 1925, the school has created and maintained numerous corporate relationships. Many factors contribute to these relationships, including the quality of SMU's academics and research, the achievements of alumni, and SMU's close proximity to high-tech corporations. Each SMU Co-op Program student directly benefits from the program's strong corporate relationships and bears an obligation to preserve these relationships by following the Co-op Program Undergraduate Student Agreement. The agreement balances the student's individual needs with the long-term goal of maintaining the program's corporate relationships for future SMU students. The terms of the program include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p>• Students must maintain good standing with SMU and their employer at all times.</p><p>• All training jobs must be approved in advance by the SMU Co-op Program director.</p><p>• Before each work term begins, undergraduate students in the program must enroll in the appropriate program course for the term when they work, including summer. • SMU charges no fees or tuition for these courses. Each course is graded on a pass/fail basis by the program's director. The courses do not count toward graduation. The course numbers for each work term are, respectively, ENGR 1099, ENGR 2099, ENGR 3099, ENGR 4099, ENGR 5099. • Students enroll at SMU each term, including summers, once they begin the program's rotation between work and school. • Co-op students take full-time class loads at SMU during alternating school terms.</p><p>• Co-op students do not work part-time for the employer during school terms.</p><p>• Co-op students complete all work terms with the same company unless decided otherwise.</p><p>• Once a student accepts a Co-op Program position, the student may switch positions within the sponsoring company with the approval of the company. • Each student in the program completes his or her originally planned number and sequence of alternating work terms. The term of graduation must be a term of full-time study at SMU. • Each student in the program accepts responsibility for knowing and following all SMU Co-op Program regulations and those of the participating employer. • Students agree to complete all of their University required paperwork even while participating in the Co-op Program (e.g., FAFSA, CSS Profile, enrolling for classes, enrolling for housing, applying for graduation in their last senior term. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Co-op Certificate</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Engineering Internship Program</head><p>The internship program allows full-time students to include a minimum of three terms of professional work experience during their study. Students must have obtained junior-level class status prior to participating in the internship program. Students cannot simultaneously enroll in a full-time load of coursework and participate in a full-time work experience. A full-time course of study is defined as 12 or more credit hours per term, and a full-time work experience is defined as a minimum of 37.5 hours worked per week. In order to maintain satisfactory academic achievement, students enrolled in a full-time course load shall not work more than a maximum of 20 hours a week. Students who are actively participating in a full-time work experience shall not enroll in more than nine credit hours per term. Zero hours of credit will be awarded for each term of internship. Participation in this program will not jeopardize the full-time status of international students. Students who wish to participate in this program need to • Receive an internship job offer relating to their major.</p><p>• Provide a job description to the Hart Center for Engineering Leadership.</p><p>• Complete the Undergraduate Engineering Internship Program Agreement form.</p><p>• Obtain the following approvals: faculty adviser, department chair, Director of Career Development in the Hart Center and the International Student Office (for all international students). Once the necessary approvals are obtained, the student must register for the Undergraduate Internship Program course that is designated by the student's department <ref type="bibr">(CEE 5050,</ref><ref type="bibr">CS 5050,</ref><ref type="bibr">ECE 5050,</ref><ref type="bibr">EMIS 5050,</ref><ref type="bibr">ME 5050)</ref>.</p><p>Within two weeks of the end of the term or at the end of the internship, whichever comes first, the student must submit a report outlining the activities and duties of the internship. The student will submit a copy of the report to the faculty adviser, the International Office (if applicable) and the Director of Career Development of the Lyle School of Engineering.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The mission of the CEE department is to advance learning and discovery in service to humanity. To that end, undergraduate programs within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering educate and train leaders in the fields of environmental protection, resource management, construction and engineering design. Programs are tailored to the individual needs and interests of CEE students, so that students with interests in studying global climate change, protecting the quality of the drinking water, or designing the next generation of high-rise buildings or smart highways receive the training they need to excel in their careers.</p><p>Civil and environmental engineering are inextricably linked. While civil engineering focuses on the infrastructure of modern society, environmental engineering is concerned with the well-being and health of people and the environment. Civil and environmental engineering functioned as a single integrated discipline in the early 1900s when it was critical to address sanitary problems to protect public health and to develop regional water supplies and the civil infrastructure to support rapid urbanization and early industrialization. Separate disciplines gradually emerged, evolving and broadening to address the overall quality and function of modern society -preserving the environment while enabling the realization of an enriched life through technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Civil Engineering Program</head><p>Civil engineers are engaged in planning, design, construction, maintenance and management of the infrastructure of modern society. They are responsible for the design of water supply and wastewater treatment systems; transportation systems such as highways, railways, waterways, mass transit, airports, ports and harbors; dams, reservoirs and hydroelectric power plants; thermoelectric power plants; transmission and communication towers; high-rise buildings; and even aircraft and aerospace structures, shuttles and space stations. Every major structure critical to this country, and global society, depends on the work of civil engineers.</p><p>The mission of the civil engineering program is to prepare graduates for professional practice and advanced studies by focusing on the following areas: structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transportation planning, environmental engineering and water resources., Graduates will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to be fully participatory members of civil engineering teams and contributors to civil engineering efforts conducted within the evolving global economy.</p><p>The mission and educational objectives of the civil engineering program are consistent with the missions of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, the Lyle School of Engineering, and the overall institutional mission of SMU, and were determined based on the needs of the program's various constituencies. The program prepares graduates to achieve the following educational objectives during the first 5 to 15 years of their professional careers:</p><p>1. Be entrusted by society to create a sustainable and resilient world and enhance the global quality of life through the practice of civil engineering. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Engineering Program</head><p>The environmental field is dynamic and wide-ranging, comprising many different disciplines and professional roles. Environmental engineering involve not only traditional water and wastewater management, but also the management of hazardous and radioactive materials, pollution prevention and waste minimization, innovative hazardous waste treatment and site remediation processes, environmental and occupational health, resource conservation and recovery, sustainable development of natural resources, and air quality management and pollution control. In addition, modern manufacturing, both domestic and worldwide, focuses on using recycled and natural materials to fabricate products that are competitive in the marketplace and harmlessly degraded in the environment. The trend toward global manufacturing will grow stronger in the years ahead. Environmental challenges presented by this movement must be overcome if the economic and lifestyle benefits of globalization are to be extended to all peoples of the world.</p><p>The educational objectives of the environmental engineering program are consistent with the missions of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, the Lyle School of Engineering, and the overall institutional mission of SMU, and were determined based on the needs of the program's various constituencies. The program prepares graduates to achieve the following educational objectives during the first 5 to 15 years of their professional careers:</p><p>1. Be entrusted by society to create a sustainable and resilient world and enhance the global quality of life through the practice of environmental engineering. 2. Serve others competently, collaboratively, and ethically as either engineering designers, managers, or leaders in the public or private sectors. 3. Demonstrate mastery and leadership as builders, planners, environmental stewards, innovators, and advocates for public health, safety, and welfare.</p><p>4. Obtain licensing as professional engineers. The environmental engineering program prepares graduates for professional practice and advanced study through a focus in the following areas: 1) water supply and resources, 2) environmental systems and process modeling, 3) environmental chemistry, 4) wastewater management, 5) solid waste management, 6) hazardous waste management, 7) atmospheric systems and air pollution control, and 8) environmental and occupational health.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Facilities</head><p>Students in the CS Department have access to a wide range of facilities and equipment. The department's computing environment has evolved into an Ethernet-based network of personal computers and servers. General-use UNIX servers that run OSF1 and Linux are available. A wireless network is also available throughout the CS facilities. Windows-based PC labs are used during the first two years of coursework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curriculum in Computer Science</head><p>Computers play an ever-increasing role in society. Their use permeates all other academic disciplines and industrial arenas. Computer science is the study of the concepts and theory surrounding computer design and software construction. The SMU undergraduate program in computer science is designed to give students a solid understanding of these concepts, providing them with the technical knowledge needed to pursue either an advanced degree or a challenging career in the computer industry. The diversity of the Lyle School of Engineering computer environment exposes undergraduate computer science students to many different hardware and software systems.</p><p>To study and use computers, one must communicate with them through a variety of software interfaces, including programming languages. At SMU, the student will study several high-level languages -such as C++ and Java -that simplify the use of computers. In addition, students are exposed to a variety of computer-aided software engineering tools. Assembly languages and operating systems (such as Linux/UNIX) for microcomputers, mainframes and supercomputers are studied to provide an understanding of the architecture and organization of a digital computer. Mathematical topics such as discrete mathematics, graph theory, and Boolean and linear algebra are included in required undergraduate classes so that students may better understand the internal structure of the computer and the effective utilization of its languages.</p><p>Knowledge of the computer's internal structure is important to understanding its capabilities. Thus, computer science students take courses in assembly language, computer logic and computer organization. Courses in systems programming and operating systems extend this structural study into the "software" of the computer. A required sequence of software engineering courses prepares students for advanced systems and software applications.</p><p>Many of the computer science core courses <ref type="bibr">(CS 2341, CS 3345, CS 3353, CS 4345, CS 4351 and CS 4352)</ref> contain major project-oriented components to prepare students for applying their theoretical knowledge in teams.</p><p>The free electives in the B.A. in computer science program can be used to individually tailor a student's study plan. For example, students who want a program even more intensive than the computer science major could satisfy their free electives with more computer science courses. Students interested in a broader education could satisfy these electives with courses offered by any department in the University. The B.S. degree allows students to major in any of five concentration tracks or to pursue a general program where they can choose nine hours of computer science electives. The research track allows students to participate in an undergraduate research project of their choice. Like graduate students, undergraduate students majoring in research are required to perform independent research in an area of their choice (with a tenure-track faculty member as an adviser), document the research results and present the results of the research in a presentation open to the entire University community. The security track facilitates a more indepth study of software security issues. The data-intensive computing track introduces concepts of data storage and analysis necessary for many modern applications. The software engineering track focuses on software design and testing. The game development track is provided in collaboration with SMU Guildhall.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Majors and the Accelerated Pathways Program</head><p>Because of the flexibility of the curriculum, the majority of management science majors choose to receive a second major or one or more minors from a wide range of other disciplines. Examples include a Bachelor of Science, a major in management science or a second bachelor's degree in economics, mathematics, business, computer science, history, psychology, Spanish or French.</p><p>Other management science majors continue their studies to obtain a Master of Science in Engineering Management, systems engineering, information engineering or operations research. The Accelerated Pathways program allows students to accelerate progress toward completion of a graduate degree.</p><p>More information on these and other options available to management science majors is available at www.smu.edu/Lyle/Departments/EMIS. EMIS faculty and advisers are also available to answer questions about the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computing Facilities</head><p>Students in the EMIS Department have access to a wide range of computing facilities and networking equipment. The department manages three PC-based computing labs, including the Enterprise Systems Design Laboratory created for students in the senior design course. General-use UNIX and Linux machines (including eight-processor 64-bit Xeon workstations) provide advanced computing, analytical software and Web hosting to all engineering students. Windows-and Linux-based PCs and workstations are the primary desktop equipment. All computing facilities are networked via high-speed Ethernet, with Gigabit Ethernet connections to Internet 1, Internet 2 and the National Lambda Rail research network. Open computing labs and wireless services provide additional facilities access points for students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curriculum in Management Science</head><p>Management science deals with the development of mathematically based models for planning, managing, operating and decision-making. In the EMIS curriculum, these methods are also applied to the design and management of efficient systems for producing goods and delivering services.</p><p>A management scientist at a major airline would be concerned with building mathematical models to decide the best flight schedules, plane routes, and assignments of pilots and crews to specific flights and of flights to specific gates, as well as the best number of planes to own and operate, cities to fly to, cities to use as major hubs, layout for an airport terminal, overbooking policy and location to refuel aircraft. Optimal and good usable solutions for such issues can be uncovered through analysis with computer-based mathematical models. The management scientist develops an understanding of a practical decision problem, then designs and constructs a model that incorporates data from the MIS department and produces a high-quality solution.</p><p>Because of its generality, management science has broad applications in all engineering disciplines and in the fields of computer science, economics, finance, marketing, medicine, logistics, production, information engineering and statistics. Management science methods are used extensively in industry and government, and SMU's EMIS program prepares the technically oriented student to excel in today's competitive business environment. ABET, www.abet.org, does not provide accreditation for the discipline of management science.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curriculum in Mechanical Engineering</head><p>Mechanical engineering offers the broadest curriculum in engineering to reflect the wide range of mechanical engineering job opportunities in government and industry. The mechanical engineer is concerned with creation, research, design, analysis, production and marketing of devices for providing and using energy and materials. The major concentration areas of the program include the following:</p><p>Solid and Structural Mechanics. Concerned with the behavior of solid bodies under the action of applied forces. The solid body may be a simple mechanical linkage, an aerodynamic control surface, an airplane or space vehicle, or a component of a nuclear reactor. The applied forces may have a variety of origins, such as mechanical, aerodynamic, gravitational, electromotive and magnetic. Solid mechanics provides one element of the complete design process and interacts with all other subjects in the synthesis of a design.</p><p>Fluid Mechanics. Deals with the behavior of fluid under the action of forces applied to it. The subject proceeds from a study of basic fundamentals to a variety of applications, such as flow-through compressors, turbines and pumps, around an airplane or missile. Fluid mechanics interacts with solid mechanics in the practice of mechanical engineering because the fluid flow is generally bounded by solid surfaces. Fluid mechanics is also an element in the synthesis of a design.</p><p>Thermal Sciences. Concerned with the thermal behavior of all materials -solid, liquid and gaseous. The subject is divided into three important branches, namely, thermodynamics, energy conversion and heat transfer. Thermodynamics is the study of the interaction between a material and its environment when heat and/or work are involved. Energy conversion is a study of the transformation of one form of energy to another, such as the conversion of solar energy to electrical energy in a solar cell. Heat transfer is a study of the processes by which thermal energy is transferred from one body of material to another. Since energy is required to drive any apparatus and since some of the energy is thermal energy, the thermal sciences interact with all other areas of study as an integral part of the design process.</p><p>Materials Science and Engineering. Pertains to the properties of all materials -solid, liquid and gaseous. It deals with mechanical, fluid, thermal, electrical and other properties. Properties of interest include modulus of elasticity, compressibility, viscosity, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and many others. The study of materials proceeds from the characteristics of individual atoms of a material, through the cooperative behavior of small groups of atoms, up to the behavior and properties of the bulk material. Because all mechanical equipment is composed of materials, works in a material environment and is controlled by other material devices, it is clear that the materials sciences lie at the heart of the design synthesis process.</p><p>Control Systems. Provides necessary background for engineers in the dynamics of systems. In the study of controls, both the transient and steady-state behaviors of the system are of interest. The transient behavior is particularly important in the starting and stopping of propulsion systems and in maneuvering flight, whereas the steady-state behavior describes the normal operating state. Some familiar examples of control systems include the flight controls of an airplane or space vehicle and the thermostat on a heating or cooling system. Design Synthesis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The study and practice of art offers a unique experience for the exercise of imaginative freedom, the opportunity for the independent organization of work, and the promise of self-knowledge and personal satisfaction. Contemporary art is also increasingly a source of knowledge about the world and, for many, an active agent in the transformation of social life. The Division of Art embraces these values in its art courses leading to the B.A., B.F.A. and M.F.A. degrees.</p><p>At the heart of the student's experience is the acquisition of skills, concepts and strategies relevant to an expanded notion of studio culture in contemporary art. Students are encouraged to explore and develop art in a challenging environment that rewards experimentation and risk-taking. The Division of Art offers a program of study that prepares students for the successful continuation of professional practice as an artist, the pursuit of graduate study in art or the application of visual art to other fields of study.</p><p>The program is marked by its wide range of supporting resources: studio courses that offer grounding in techniques and concepts; courses in the critical and historical study of art; well-equipped workshops, galleries and exhibition areas that provide ample opportunities for the public presentation of student work; field trips to public and private collections of art and to artists' studios; and a lively series of lectures and seminars by distinguished contemporary practitioners, critics and curators. Small class size coupled with an approach that takes full advantage of the division's setting within a distinguished school of the arts of a major university offers a transdisciplinary educational experience that few, if any, specialist colleges of art can match.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Program</head><p>The Art History Honors Program is available to majors with exceptional academic records who seek a greater intellectual challenge. It is conducted as a two-term sequence (fall: ARHS 4391 and spring: ARHS 4392) during senior year, culminating with a 30-page thesis and faculty review. Students should contact the art history undergraduate adviser for more information.</p><p>Art History, B.A.</p><p>The B.A. degree in art history trains students to negotiate a world saturated with images. It challenges students to confront critically the issues posed by the visual culture that mediates their understanding of the past, present and future. Built on the fertile exchange between the arts and the humanities, art history at SMU subscribes to an interdisciplinary and intercultural approach to learning. Students are taught to think across current categories and boundaries and practice a socially responsible art history.</p><p>In addition to developing acute visual sensibilities, students acquire the ability to evaluate and organize information, conduct scholarly research and articulate their ideas in both written and spoken language.</p><p>Students completing this course of study are prepared for advanced training in the field of art history; museum and gallery professions; or work in a broad range of other fields, including publishing, arts administration, teaching and public policy.</p><p>Foundation Courses. All students must enroll in a three-class art history foundations sequence beginning in the first fall term following declaration of the major.</p><p>Temporalities/Global Perspectives Courses. Temporalities courses are upper-level art history courses that offer frameworks for a broad understanding of temporal dimensions: a duration of time, the power of some areas over others, the telescoping of past into present and vice versa, or questions of recurrence across time. The global perspectives designation is used for courses that are structured around distinctive spatial dimensions: a geographic feature like an ocean, territorial boundaries, colonial expansion, national imaginaries, subcultures or other social spaces of artistic production.</p><p>Required Methods and Theories Courses. These small, upper-level art history classes are reading and writing intensive and offer the occasion to think critically and carefully about the dynamics of historical change and to engage with issues and debates in art history.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The Division of Dance offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a minor in dance performance. Students receive professional dance training within the context of a comprehensive liberal arts education. The goal is to develop the disciplined, versatile dance artist through a balanced study of ballet, modern dance and jazz dance techniques, complemented and reinforced by a broad range of theoretical studies and performance opportunities. The program provides an atmosphere in which students are nurtured and stimulated in their quest for artistic achievement, technical mastery and scholarly excellence. Undergraduate majors study dance as a performing art with the intent to become practicing artists. The core of the dance curriculum is designed with this goal in mind. The combination of performance and liberal arts education courses serves to develop the articulate dancer.</p><p>The Division of Dance has four dance studios, three of which are located in the Owen Arts Center. Studios are equipped with sprung floors, digital sound and projection systems, grand pianos, ballet barres and mirrors. The Charles S. Sharp Performing Arts Studio doubles as a performing space and is also equipped with a tech booth and a theatrical lighting system. Live accompaniment is provided for all ballet and modern technique classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission, Audition and Financial Aid</head><p>Dance is a dual admit program: in addition to meeting University admission criteria, all first-year and transfer applicants must participate in a performance audition, which is the principal factor in determining eligibility to major or minor in dance. In the performance audition, applicants are observed in a ballet class, modern dance sequences and a jazz dance combination. After this process, selected candidates are asked to perform a prepared solo that is 90 seconds in length. Applicants should bring a brief résumé, a wallet-sized photograph, music for the solo (tablet or smartphone) and appropriate dancewear and footwear (the modern dance portion of audition will be danced barefoot). Campus and regional dance auditions occur between October and March. Auditions are scheduled at www.smu.edu/danceadmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>All dance majors are required to perform and choreograph as an integral part of their performance studies. Performance opportunities include concerts featuring masterworks and contemporary works in the genres of ballet, modern and jazz presented on the main stage in the Bob Hope Theatre, concerts featuring student choreography in noontime Brown Bag performances in the Owen Arts Center lobby and mainstage concerts in the Bob Hope Theatre and performances in venues in the Dallas Arts District including the Meadows at the Winspear concerts presented in collaboration with the Meadows Symphony. Other opportunities include special events, outreach programs and interdisciplinary projects within and beyond the Meadows community. All dance students are required to take ballet, modern dance, and jazz dance in their first four terms. In the final four terms, all dance students must take a minimum of one dance techniques class per day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance Performance, B.F.A.</head><p>Southern Methodist University is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance. The program is designed to create the versatile dance artist/scholar who possesses technical prowess and expressive range in the genres of ballet, modern and jazz and the ability to think critically and express their ideas through choreography, verbal expression and well-crafted writing. The degree requires 80 credit hours in dance, of which a minimum of 47 credit hours are in technique and the remaining 33 credit hours provide students with the opportunity to develop scholarly and creative abilities in dance and related areas of interest.</p><p>Curriculum Notes: A student must be enrolled in a minimum of six credit hours of dance in order to be a dance major in good standing and maintain an artistic scholarship. In the first two years, students are required to take two technique classes per day and in the junior and senior years, students are required to take a minimum of one technique class per day. Students are required to attend auditions as designated by the Division and perform in concerts as cast. A minimum of four terms of ensemble credit (DANC 3080) are required; enrollment will be processed by the division after casting is determined for each term. Four terms of dance composition <ref type="bibr">(DANC 3241,</ref><ref type="bibr">DANC 3242,</ref><ref type="bibr">DANC 3243,</ref><ref type="bibr">DANC 4291)</ref> are required beginning in the junior year. The Dance curriculum is progressive and requires eight semesters to complete for those coming in to the university as first year students. Transfer students may complete the program in less time depending on the application of transfer credit to the course requirements in both the University Curriculum and the B.F.A. in Dance Performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>Dance majors are expected to apply themselves scholastically and to conscientiously assume artistic and academic responsibilities associated with the degree. Students are required to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.700 in dance courses to continue in the dance performance major. Grades lower than C are not acceptable in any required dance course and will necessitate repeat enrollments. If GPA requirements are not met, the student is placed on academic probation. To be eligible for scholarship, students are required to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.700 in dance courses, and they must be enrolled in a minimum of six credit hours in dance. Full participation in the program and in division performances is required of every student. Performance studies and production activities in the Division of Dance take precedence over performance opportunities outside of the division. Students must submit a request and be granted permission to participate in any project outside the division prior to committing to the project. Students are expected to adhere to this policy as well as all policies of the division, which are outlined in the Division of Dance Student Handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation</head><p>High standards of discipline and execution are essential for artistic growth, progress and success. Regular class attendance, attendance at auditions for concerts, classroom and theatre etiquette, punctuality and attendance at student meetings are essential. Students meet with individual faculty at midterm to receive a progress report and to establish individual goals. At the close of each term, each student receives a performance evaluation by the collective faculty. Various aspects of a student's work are examined at this evaluation, including technical progress, performance artistry, capacity for and commitment to class work, attitude, academic performance, participation in all aspects of the program, and health and fitness. When standards are not met, a student is advised that significant improvement must take place to remain in the program. Poor critiques may result in probationary measures and/or loss of dance scholarship funding. The following courses required for the dance major also count toward the requirements of the University Curriculum: <ref type="bibr">DANC 1151</ref><ref type="bibr">, DANC 1326</ref><ref type="bibr">, DANC 2160</ref><ref type="bibr">, DANC 2170</ref>.

Admission to the minor is by audition only and acceptance criteria for the minor are the same as those for the major. Minors are assigned a faculty adviser in the Division of Dance and are required to consult with that adviser prior to registering each semester. Dance performance minors do not perform in main stage concerts but are eligible to audition for student concerts by permission of the chair. Minors are allowed to take only one technique class in any given semester. Students who wish to take more than the nine required credit hours of technique may do so only by permission of the chair.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The Division of Film and Media Arts offers students intensive training and close mentorship in the art of cinema and digital media, helping students develop their own artistic voice and vision. Production courses focus on fostering individual creativity and imagination while simultaneously developing technical skills (screenwriting, cinematography, editing and sound). History and critical studies courses expose students to the key artists and theorists of film and media, as well as to the various aesthetic movements that have developed across the globe. Students are also taught the business aspects of film/media, exposing them to how industrial concerns affect technological and artistic choices, and preparing them to successfully negotiate their place in the industry upon graduation. As such, students are encouraged to take an internship in the professional sector to gain practical experience in the field and establish professional contacts.</p><p>The B.A. in film and media arts requires 33 credit hours; it is designed to prepare students for careers in media industries or for postgraduate work in film and media studies. The B.A. is also designed to allow time for significant study in another discipline, making room for double majors and multiple minors in other fields. A wide variety of courses in cinema and media history, theory and criticism provide extensive insight into these media as art forms and as vibrant social and cultural institutions. Courses that focus on the business of film, television and new media initiate students into the diverse aspects of these industries. Additionally, courses in production offer experience in writing, shooting, directing and editing film and other media. Finally, a capstone course provides final preparation for either entrance into a career in the media industries or further graduate studies.</p><p>The B.F.A. in film and media arts requires 51 credit hours and emphasizes developing the unique creative voice of each student. The B.F.A. is designed to prepare students for careers in media production and to develop their creative abilities in the art form. Courses in production offer experience in writing, shooting, directing and editing film and other media. Courses that focus on the business of film, television and new media initiate students into the diverse aspects of the industries they plan to enter. Additionally, courses in cinema and media history and criticism provide a basic and necessary knowledge of these media as art forms and as vibrant social and cultural institutions.

Details about what to include in the application packet are available on the division website. Note: Thesis registration should take place the final fall of a student's SMU career, and application should take place the spring before that (i.e., for those graduating in May, application and registration will occur the spring term of the student's junior year).</p><p>Applications will be reviewed by a faculty committee, and students whose proposals are accepted will be notified by the end of the spring term so they can move forward on the projects during the summer break. Applications for a senior thesis are competitive and only a small number of proposals will be accepted each year.</p><p>The ensuing fall, approved students will register for FILM 5314 and complete their projects largely independently, though with advice and help from their committees as necessary. Each student registered for FILM 5314 in a given term will have, at most, until the end of the following term of that academic year to complete the proposed project to the satisfaction of his/her committee. This means thesis defenses should be scheduled no later than mid-April to allow time to address any issues or concerns raised by the committee at the defense.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Journalism</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The world of journalism is changing fast. Once-divergent media forms are rapidly coming together in ways that make it essential for 21st-century journalism education to reflect the complexity of actual practice. Graduates must be prepared to function and lead in a new and changing environment. The Division of Journalism offers the Bachelor of Arts with majors and minors in journalism and fashion media to prepare students to succeed in this dynamic setting.</p><p>Majors study multimedia journalism, including broadcast, print and online formats. They learn professional skills that enable them to adapt swiftly to a changing journalism environment. Content that is useful and interesting will have value regardless of the delivery system or systems of a particular era. For this reason, students also are taught the intellectual and theoretical skills they will need to help them interpret the world around them and understand the role of the media in society. They will graduate as clear, concise thinkers and writers.</p><p>Specialized knowledge also plays an increasingly critical role for media professionals in this competitive age. Students in the Division of Journalism may develop expertise in financial reporting while pursuing their degree through the William J. O'Neil program in business journalism, detailed below. Students with an interest in the growing fields of fashion journalism or fashion industry promotions may earn a Bachelor of Arts in fashion media, a rigorous interdisciplinary program housed in the Division of Journalism. Students may also specialize in sports journalism in a program intended to give a sports-specific background to reporting of sports across all media platforms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructional Facilities</head><p>The Division of Journalism is located in the Journalism Complex in the Umphrey Lee Center, which houses faculty and administrative offices, audio and video production, and media support areas. The main media content areas are a complete broadcast studio with control room and a convergence newsroom with computer equipment designed for production of multiplatform news content. Classrooms and conference rooms in the Journalism Complex are state of the art, with complete audio and video capabilities. All labs are equipped with the latest computers for each student.</p><p>The Journalism Complex is a secured area where journalism majors are permitted 24-hour access. The concept and design of the Journalism Complex promote the individualized instruction for which the Division of Journalism is known. Each student is encouraged to spend as much time as desired on highly specialized equipment to pursue projects and assignments in a professional media work environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission and Degree Requirements</head><p>Strong writing skills are essential to the student's success in the division's journalism curriculum and later in the profession of journalism. Students may enroll in journalism classes as first-year students. Those seeking permission to major or minor in the Division of Journalism must have completed 24 hours of study, which may include transfer hours. Students must also have taken DISC 1312 (or equivalent), JOUR 2103, and JOUR 2302, with a minimum combined GPA of 2.5 across these three courses, with no grade lower than C+ in any one of them. Students must declare the major or minor before taking JOUR 2312. Students transferring from other universities must have completed equivalent courses and obtained the equivalent GPA in those courses before they can be considered a major candidate in the Division of Journalism. The Journalism Division has a focus on and commitment to diversity, recognizing the need for diversity in media and communications in the 21st century.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scholarships</head><p>Honors scholarships are awarded each year to outstanding students who intend to major in journalism.</p><p>Other scholarships are available to journalism students through a variety of foundations and gifts to the division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The William J. O'Neil Program in Business Journalism</head><p>As global markets and fast-paced technological change buffet American workers, consumers, investors and companies, business has become one of the most important components of news. The O'Neil Program equips aspiring journalists with both the technical knowledge to understand often-complex business and economic issues and the journalistic skills to make those topics understandable and accessible to news audiences. And because an ability to follow the money is critical to many beats, the tools and techniques developed in this program will prepare students for more sophisticated and insightful coverage of subjects ranging from national and local politics to technology, the fashion industry and the environment.</p><p>This innovative interdisciplinary program includes courses in the Cox School of Business. In addition to the 37 credit hours required for the journalism major or the 37 hours required for the major in fashion media, students wishing to concentrate in business and finance journalism will complete a second major in business, the minor in business administration or the minor in business, plus ECO 1311 and ECO 1312. Students will put into practice what they are learning about business, financial markets and economics in advanced journalism classes and in coverage of North Texas-based companies and the regional economy.</p><p>Admission to the program is subject to the approval of the faculty member who holds the O'Neil Chair in Business Journalism. Students studying in the program will be advised by this faculty member.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specialization in Sports Journalism</head><p>Recent research indicates an increasing market need for specialized knowledge in sports journalism, and concomitant growth in the job market for sports journalists. This program is intended to train sports journalists of the future, and will include study of the kinds of data, statistics, modern analytics, and social media that are playing a growing role in sports of all kinds. The 40-hour sports specialization is within the journalism major and includes all the core requirements of that major. In addition, students will complete a gateway course, JOUR 2306 -Sports, News Media and Social Media Analytics, as well as six hours of interdisciplinary work that includes options for sports-related courses in history, ethics, and law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internships and Practica</head><p>Upon achieving junior and senior status, students are encouraged to take on experiences that enable them to work under the guidance of professionals in the news industry (internships). Many on-campus activities also offer practical experience (practica), and students are strongly urged to take advantage of the opportunities available to them to work in on-campus media, including SMUDailyCampus.com, SMU Look, and SMU-TV.</p><p>Practica are taken for one credit hour at a time. Internships may be taken for one, two or three credit hours at a time, depending on the number of hours worked. A total of three credit hours of internships and practica may be counted toward a student's degree requirements but no more than two internships may be taken for credit. Internships and practica may not be counted toward the required six credit hours of electives within the division.</p><p>All internships taken for credit must have prior approval of the faculty adviser. Internships and practica are taken on a pass/fail basis only and are restricted to journalism majors and minors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance</head><p>Due to limited class space and enrollment pressures, a student who fails to appear on the first day of journalism class may be administratively dropped from the class at the instructor's discretion. Furthermore, students must comply with any more specific attendance policies spelled out in course syllabi; creation and enforcement of such policies are entirely at the instructor's discretion. The division strives to keep class size small enough for individual attention, and large enough to ensure discussion and interaction among students.</p><p>Off-Campus Programs Journalism students may participate in academic programs offered abroad and through partners in the United States. Two programs of particular interest to journalism students are the Washington Term Program and SMU-in-London.</p><p>Washington Term Program. Through a cooperative program with American University in Washington, D.C., students have an opportunity to study in the nation's capital as a part of the Washington Term Program. Students may complete up to six hours of journalism elective credit and internships, as well as courses in other disciplines. The program is restricted to journalism majors and minors.</p><p>SMU-in-London. SMU students can earn six credit hours by enrolling in the SMU-in-London communications program. Conducted each year during the second session of summer school, the program allows students to study in London, a hub for international communications. Courses offered carry three credit hours. They do not require prerequisites, and they are designed to take full advantage of London's importance as an international center. Students live in dormitories in London. As part of their international experience, students are encouraged to explore the culture and fine arts offerings of London and European countries on their own, as class schedules permit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs of Study</head><p>Journalism students will study multimedia journalism, learning the basic skills and conventions of broadcast journalism, print journalism and the emerging skill set needed to practice journalism on the Internet. The major requires 37 credit hours within the division. Journalism majors may count no more than 40 hours of JOUR courses toward graduation. Courses may be used to fulfill only one of the student's divisional requirements (i.e., a student may not fulfill two divisional requirements with one course). Note: All journalism majors must declare and complete a second major or a minor of their choosing. The fashion media major does not meet this requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimum Grade Requirement</head><p>Only courses passed with a grade of C-or better will count for credit toward the major or minor in journalism or the major in fashion media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Distinction</head><p>The honors program in journalism is highly selective. At midterm of the sophomore year, and again at midterm of the junior year, declared journalism majors with a GPA of 3.500 or better can apply to the honors program. All interested students, including those who have been previously awarded honors scholarships, need to apply for admission to the program. </p></div>

Even when the producer is also the artist, composer, recording engineer, and financier, he/she must step outside of all other roles to plan how the end result can best be achieved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>Undergraduate education in the Division of Theatre reflects a commitment to the rigorous study of theatre within a liberal arts context. To this end, undergraduate theatre majors pursue coursework not only in theatre, but also in the social and natural sciences, literature, the arts and humanities, and other areas of human culture and experience. A faculty adviser works closely with each student to develop a program of study best suited to the individual's needs and career goals. In addition, the Division of Theatre presents an annual season of public productions chosen for their timeliness, public appeal and suitability for training. Practical experience in all areas of theatre operation is considered a vital part of the educational program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructional Facilities</head><p>The Division of Theatre is housed in the well-equipped facilities of the Meadows School of the Arts. These facilities include the Greer Garson Theatre (a 380-seat theatre with a classical thrust stage), the Bob Hope Theatre (a 400-seat proscenium theatre), the Margo Jones Theatre (a 125-seat "black box" theatre), the Hamon Arts Library and numerous rehearsal studios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>Theatre is a dual admit program: in addition to meeting University admission criteria, prospective theatre majors at SMU are admitted to the major by audition and interview. All prospective students prepare an audition, consisting of two contrasting monologues and a song. Candidates may also be asked to demonstrate improvisational skills. Students seeking admission into the B.F.A. in Theatre Studies program may also be asked to demonstrate ability in their particular area of interest by supplying writing samples, portfolio materials, etc. Admission to the major requires both admission to SMU and admission through the theatre audition process. Note: Admission procedures for applicants seeking to transfer from other schools are the same as those for first-year applicants. Transfer students may begin work only in the fall term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Progress and Artistic Growth</head><p>Students must continually demonstrate a high order of talent and commitment in both class work and production work to progress in the curriculum. At the end of each term, the faculty of the Division of Theatre evaluates each student's progress, examining all aspects of a student's academic and production participation. Every student meets with the faculty to receive this evaluation. An unsatisfactory evaluation is accompanied by the reasons for this evaluation and the terms for continuation in the program. An unsatisfactory evaluation may also result in a student's immediate dismissal from the program. Only</p><p>Theatre courses passed with a grade of C-or better will count toward the major in Theatre. Students cast in mainstage faculty-directed productions are expected to enroll in the appropriate rehearsal and performance laboratory course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degrees and Programs of Study</head><p>The Division of Theatre offers the B.F.A. degree in theatre with a specialization in theatre studies or a specialization in acting.</p></div>

(Acting Specialization)</head><p>The B.F.A. degree in theatre with a specialization in acting is a unique program of specialized acting study within a liberal arts context. Enriched by the intellectual growth engendered by both their liberal arts and theatre courses, acting students engage in an intense investigation of acting at the highest level. The purpose of the program is two-fold: to prepare students for 1) entrance into the profession, and/or 2) admission to a top-flight, graduate training program. Upon completion of two years of foundational actor training, students in the acting major receive advanced training in the areas of acting, stage movement and stage voice. The B.F.A. degree in theatre with a specialization in theatre studies reflects a commitment to theatre training within the context of liberal education. Based on the division's philosophy that an understanding of and experience with the actor's process are essential to education and training in all areas of theatre, all undergraduate theatre majors focus on foundational actor training during the first two years of their program of study. Focused study in one area of theatre, chosen from directing, play-writing, stage management, critical studies and design, is required to complete the major. With the approval of the student's theatre adviser and the chair of the division, this emphasis may be individualized to suit the specific goals of the student. All theatre studies students must complete at least 12 hours of upper-level courses among those offered in directing, playwriting, stage management, critical studies or design.

Before being assigned to student teaching, candidates are reviewed by the faculty to determine whether adequate progress has been made in order to assume responsibility for school-age students. Such factors as academic performance, maturity and a demonstrated sense of responsibility are considered. Students must have an overall 3.000 GPA in all education courses before beginning student teaching, and all qualifier exams and state tests must be passed prior to the studentteaching/internship experience.</p><p>Eligibility for Internship. Students deemed by the director of the undergraduate program to be eligible for a first-year teaching position may forego student teaching to seek an internship in an accredited school in the state of Texas. As an intern, students are enrolled in three credit hours of classes each term for the academic year and work under the supervision of an SMU instructor. As required by the Texas Education Agency, the principal will assign a mentor to work with the intern at the school level. The SMU supervisor will conduct six formal observations during the year and complete a midyear conference and an effectiveness evaluation at the end of the school year. The mentor is involved in this process.</p><p>TExES Exam. All students seeking teacher credentials are required to take and pass the two statemandated Texas Examinations of Educator Standards tests in the desired teaching fields. Students must attend preparation debriefs and participate in an online preparation module. When a student does not pass the TExES qualifier, a faculty mentor will develop an individual plan of supplemental study to complement a retake of the TExES qualifier. The two TExES tests for grades EC through six include the EC-12 Pedagogy and Professional Responsibilities Test and the EC through grade six Core Subjects Test. Students preparing for teaching in fourth through eighth grade middle schools must pass the EC-12 Pedagogy and Professional Responsibilities Test and the fourth through eighth grade Core Subjects Test.

Cox, the Cox School has a rich heritage that began in 1920 when the SMU Board of Trustees established a Department of Commerce at the request of the Dallas business community. In 1921 the Department of Commerce was renamed the School of Commerce, and in 1941 the Board of Trustees established the School of Commerce as a separate entity within the University. At this point, the School of Commerce became the School of Business Administration, and the Bachelor of Business Administration degree was approved by the trustees. The graduate program at the School of Business Administration began in 1949 with the authorization of a Master of Business Administration program. Both the undergraduate and the graduate degree programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). The Cox School also grants a minor in business administration and a minor in business to undergraduates. The graduate program at the School of Business Administration began in 1949 with the authorization of a Master of Business Administration program. Both the undergraduate and the graduate degree programs are fully accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). The graduate program offers M.B.A; M.S.; M.A./M.B.A.; J.D./M.B.A.; and M.S./M.B.A. degrees, including degrees offered in joint and dual programs with the other SMU schools.

With the exception of courses that are offered only with pass/fail grading, courses taken to fulfill UC requirements may not be taken pass/fail. 3. Following SMU matriculation, students must meet Discernment and Discourse, Quantitative Foundation, Personal Responsibility and Wellness, and Ways of Knowing UC Foundations requirements through SMU coursework. 4. PRW1 should be completed during the first 30 hours of undergraduate work. 5. A minimum grade of C-is required in all DISC-sequence courses, and students must be enrolled in and may not drop Discernment and Discourse until they have completed the DISC requirement. 6. Students may request consideration of a course transferred from another regionally accredited institution. All UC student requests for substitution must include concrete assessment evidence that the proposed alternative course or experience satisfies the specific Student Learning Outcomes associated with the requirement. The request form is then vetted by the student's academic adviser and reviewed by SMU departments where appropriate before it is submitted to the associate dean for general education or the assistant dean for the University Curriculum for approval consideration. Appeals may be made to the Committee on Academic Petitions. 7. Probation and suspension rules related to the Foundations components of the University Curriculum are found under "Academic Progress: University-wide Requirements" in the Academic Records and General and Enrollment Standards section of this catalog. 8. SMU faculty, through the Council on General Education, are responsible for determining whether SMU courses meet Foundation, Breadth and Depth requirements.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Art, B.A.</head><p>The B.A. in art is designed to offer students a degree in art that allows time for significant study in another discipline as well. This makes room for double majors and extensive study in the humanities, sciences or other degree programs. The B.A. degree gives students with varied interests in university study a sound footing in the visual, tactile and conceptual capabilities, as well as historical and cultural knowledge and a range of theoretical and analytical bases, for making art. To earn a B.A., the student is required to take a minimum of 48 hours in the Division of Art and nine to 12 hours in the Division of Art History. <ref type="bibr">Credits: 2</ref> Available to majors with a GPA of 3.000 or higher. <ref type="bibr">Credits: 3</ref> Independent study for undergraduate majors under the direction and supervision of a faculty member.

A directed study is a close collaboration between the professor and an advanced student who conducts a rigorous project that goes beyond the experience available in course offerings. Instructor permission required. <ref type="bibr">Credits: 3</ref> Given to us by ancient Roman reality and myth, the distinction between the city as a physical place ("urbs") and the city as an idea ("orbis") created a long-standing link between territory and ritual, locale and law, nation and citizen, and homeland and world. Students investigate the city in Italy in space and time as it is the locus of such cultural to-andfro. The goal is to better understand the complexities of the Italian city as a living entity. The period of study spans some 3,000 years, from the Etruscan foundations of Rome to Richard Meier's Jubilee Church, located along the suburban periphery of the city. Topics include the Italian city of antiquity, early Christianity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Baroque era, and modernism. Includes city and museum tours, lecture, readings, discussion, and short essays. (Temporalities pre-and post-1500) (SMU-in-Italy)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdisciplinary Programs and Courses</head><p>Interdisciplinary Studies in the Arts, B.A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professor Kevin Paul Hofeditz, Director</head><p>The major in interdisciplinary studies provides an opportunity for outstanding students to design programs that bring together multiple disciplines within the Meadows School of the Arts. Another option is to combine a discipline or disciplines housed in the Meadows School of the Arts with areas of study found elsewhere in the University for the purpose of exploring new forms of artistic expression or communication. Academically qualified students may explore the possibility of a specialized major with the program director. If the proposed plan appears to have merit, the program director will suggest faculty advisers who can provide further assistance in designing the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Description</head><p>Students with at least a 3.000 GPA in the first 24 credit hours taken through enrollment at SMU are eligible to pursue the program. The program consists of individually designed majors in the arts of at least 36 term hours, with a minimum of at least 24 credit hours of advanced courses (3000 level or above). At least two-thirds of the courses that count toward the major must be taken in the Meadows School of the Arts. The program must satisfy all Universitywide requirements and all other University and Meadows School graduation requirements. Students are responsible for fulfilling all prerequisites for courses taken. This program is designed to allow exceptional students an opportunity to design an interdisciplinary program; it is not intended to be a way of avoiding divisional requirements. Certain Meadows courses are open only to majors or by audition. Admission to such courses is at the discretion of the faculty of the division in which such courses are offered. The degree will be identified as a Bachelor of Arts. The transcript will refer to the major as "Interdisciplinary Studies in the Arts." A note on the transcript will denote the specialization. Students intending to seek admission to graduate schools are encouraged to include at least 30 hours of a coherent set of courses in an identifiable disciplinary field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administrative Procedures</head><p>The Meadows Academic Policies Committee shall have the final authority to approve all specialized programs. In order to initiate discussion of a specialized major, a student must submit to the program director a preliminary plan of study in the form of a brief statement of goals and a course list made in consultation with appropriate faculty advisers. A number of steps must be completed prior to declaring the major:</p><p>1. If the program director approves the program, the student and the faculty advisers must form a supervisory committee with a minimum of three members. The supervisory committee will provide advice and guidance to the student. At least two members, including the chair of the committee, shall be resident members of the Meadows School faculty. The chair of the committee will normally be the faculty adviser. 2. The student will submit a formal plan of study to the supervisory committee. The plan of study must include a proposal for a special project such as a thesis, exhibition or performance. Satisfactory completion (in the judgment of the supervisory committee) of this special project is a requirement. If the commit-tee approves the plan, it must then be submitted to the program director, who will submit it to the Meadows Academic Policies Committee for approval. 3. Once approved by the Meadows Academic Policies Committee, the plan will be transmitted to the Office of the Meadows Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The plan of study normally should be submitted to the Meadows Academic Policies Committee for approval before the completion of 60 total credit hours of coursework. 4. The chair of the supervisory committee and the program director will recommend candidates for graduation.</p><p>The chair of the supervisory committee will certify that the required project has been completed to the satisfaction of the committee. The supervisory committee may recommend that the degree be awarded with distinction if the GPA in the courses required for the major exceeds or equals 3.500 and if the project is deemed excellent. The associate dean for student affairs will be responsible for verifying and certifying graduation requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>The Division of Music is devoted to the advancement of music performance and scholarship; preparation of the next generation of music professionals; and service to the artistic life of the community, nation and world. Students in the Division of Music pursue the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Music degree. Majors and minors offered by the division are described below. All music programs are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>Music is a dual admit program: in addition to meeting University admission criteria, first-year and transfer applicants intending to major in music must complete an audition prior to matriculation. Auditions assess a prospective student's previous experience and potential for success in the intended major. Entering students intending to major in composition must submit a portfolio of original compositions and pass a performance audition. Both the Division of Music and the University must accept the candidate in order for him or her to be classified as a music major. Information regarding auditions may be obtained at www.smu.edu/musicadmission or by contacting the Office of the Associate Director for Music Admission of the Division of Music. In decisions regarding advanced placement, the Division of Music considers transfer credits and AP test results; however, departments reserve the right to give additional tests to determine the most appropriate placement in any course sequence.</p><p>Non-degree students are those applicants for admission who wish to be enrolled in University courses for credit but are not intending to pursue an SMU degree program. Non-degree students are admitted through the Office of Non-degree Credit Studies and are eligible to register in day and evening classes for which they have satisfied prerequisites and received departmental approval. Admission as a non-degree-seeking student does not qualify a student as a degree applicant. The presence of non-degree students in courses or ensembles may not displace an opportunity for a degree-seeking music major.</p></div>

Field Experience and Student Teaching. The Educator Preparation Program includes extensive field experience to help students prepare for careers in teaching. A personal/criminal background check is required prior to field experience. The student progresses from observational activities in classrooms to practice teaching. Upon completion of all coursework in the Bachelor of Science in Educational Studies degree, students have the opportunity to student teach and/or apply for an internship. The student assumes responsibility for an entire classroom in a carefully managed student-teaching experience. SMU students receive mentoring from faculty members noted for their exceptional records as both master teachers and scholars. Exemplary teachers from inner city to suburban settings also act as mentors during the field experience. Part of the field experience comes in the form of either a one-term student-teaching experience or a two-term internship. During the one-term experience, students work with an experienced teacher fulltime for 15 weeks in an assigned classroom in a pre-approved Dallas-area public, private or charter school. During this student-teaching term, the student-teaching experience, which is six credit hours, is regarded as full-time enrollment status at SMU for insurance purposes. Students receiving financial aid should meet with financial aid counselors in advance of the student-teaching term to determine aid status. Student teaching ensures that graduates of the SMU teacher education program are better able to enter the teaching profession ready to meet the dynamic learning needs of today's youth.</p></div>
