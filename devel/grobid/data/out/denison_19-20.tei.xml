<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Denison's History</head><p>Denison holds a storied place in American higher education. Among the earliest colleges to be established in the original "Northwest Territory" beyond the Allegheny Mountains and north of the Ohio River, it held its first classes during the presidency of Andrew Jackson. The institution was first called the Granville Literary and Theological Institution, then Granville College. In the mid-1850s, in honor of a key benefactor, it took the name Denison University.</p><p>Well before it reached its first centennial, Denison had gained a reputation for attracting outstanding professors and college leaders, sending a number on to advance higher education across the country. The growing academic reputation of Denison briefly encouraged the faculty and Trustees to offer graduate degrees, but by the early twentieth century it was clear that the strength of the institution was in high-quality undergraduate instruction, and the title "university" was retained primarily for historical reasons.</p><p>Focus upon leadership in undergraduate education and commitment to the residential principle led the college to develop concrete plans for the physical expansion of the campus and measured growth, with the college reaching its present size of about 2,200 students by 1970. In 1916, the famed landscape architectural firm of Frederick Law Olmsted Sons produced an innovative design for Denison. The "Olmsted Plan" has remained the touchstone for the continuing development of the Denison campus. Residentiality is a key component of a Denison education, creating a four-year, on-campus living and learning experience for students.</p><p>Today's Denison, a recognized leader among 21st century American liberal arts colleges, builds upon all of these founding traditions. A nonsectarian institution independent of any denominational affiliation since the 1960s, Denison actively seeks outstanding students from across the country and around the world. Denison offers a rich and deep education in the natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, fine arts, and interdisciplinary studies, as well as extraordinary campus leadership opportunities aimed at preparing graduates who will make a difference in their communities, their country, and the world.</p><p>Learn more about Denison's history (https://denison.edu/campus/about/ our-history).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our Mission Mission Statement</head><p>Our purpose is to inspire and educate our students to become autonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents and active citizens of a democratic society. Through an emphasis on active learning, we engage students in the liberal arts, which fosters self-determination and demonstrates the transformative power of education. We envision our students' lives as based upon rational choice, a firm belief in human dignity and compassion unlimited by cultural, racial, sexual, religious or economic barriers, and directed toward an engagement with the central issues of our time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guiding Principles</head><p>Denison's mission statement is supported by the following guiding principles:</p><p>Our curriculum balances breadth with depth, building academic specialization upon a liberal arts foundation in the arts, the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. Responsive to new ways of learning, we continue to develop interdisciplinary integration of the many forms of knowledge. While our students pursue specialized learning in their chosen majors, they also develop the framework for an integrated intellectual life, spiritually and morally informed.</p><p>Our faculty is committed to undergraduate education. As teacher-scholaradvisers, their principal responsibility is effective teaching informed by the best scholarship. Faculty members place a priority on close interaction with students, interactive learning, and partnerships with students in original research. Our low student/faculty ratio allows for close supervision of independent research and collaborative work in small groups and classes.</p><p>We seek to ensure an ever-broader range of racial, ethnic, international and socioeconomic backgrounds in a student body of about 2,200 students. We offer different kinds of financial aid to meet the different needs of our students.</p><p>The focus of student life at Denison is a concern for the whole person. The University provides a living-learning environment sensitive to individual needs yet grounded in a concern for community, in which the principles of human dignity and ethical integrity are paramount. Students engage in a wide range of co-curricular activities that address the multidimensional character of their intellectual and personal journey.</p><p>Denison is a community in which individuals respect one another and their environment. Each member of the community possesses a full range of rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is a commitment to treat each other and the environment with mutual respect, tolerance, and civility.</p><p>A student earning a BA degree may have no more than 56 hours from the major field (14 courses) count toward the 127 hours required for graduation. Required cognates would not be included in this "56 Hour" rule. Interdepartmental BA degrees may require no more than 68 hours (17 courses). NOTE: A student may count towards graduation no more than 4 credits for participation experiences that are credited S/U, unless such credits in excess of 4 are required for the student's major or minor.</p><p>• Earn a cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.0 overall including the major and minor (if applicable);</p><p>Normally, all Denison courses completed by the student, including repeated and failed courses, will count in the calculation of the overall grade-point average. Normally, all courses eligible to count toward the student's major, minor, and concentration, including courses beyond the minimum requirements, will be included in the calculation of the major, minor, and concentration grade-point average.</p><p>• Complete at least 64 of the required 127 credit hours while in residence at Denison and also reside at Denison for the two semesters of the senior year. Satisfactory completion of a minor at Denison requires at least one-half of the credit hours that fulfill minor requirements to be completed in residence at Denison. Generally, all students, except those enrolled in recognized pre-professional 3-2 programs, must complete the last two semesters in residence at Denison. Exceptions to these requirements may be made by the Academic Standing Board. A course taken "in residence" is defined as any course scheduled by the Denison Registrar and taught on the Denison campus, by a Denison faculty member. This policy prescribes a university-wide minimum residence requirement; individual departments may have stricter requirements.</p><p>Denison reserves the right to not award a student a degree if serious violations of the Code of Student Conduct have been alleged against that student or if charges exist against that student that cannot be adjudicated prior to commencement exercises. For the present purpose, "serious violations" are those that normally could result in suspension or expulsion. At the discretion of the Vice President for Student Development or the Provost, a student facing allegations or charges of academic dishonesty may be permitted to participate in commencement exercises, however, the student would not receive a diploma or be considered a graduate of Denison. A valid diploma would be sent when all serious conduct matters have been resolved, and the student is deemed eligible to receive a degree from Denison.</p><p>Please note that qualifications and further clarification of these requirements appear in various following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Credit Policy</head><p>The guidelines below establish the minimum standards for academic credit at Denison.</p><p>1. Minimum standard for one credit: A one-credit course requires three hours of work per week (one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and two hours of out-of-class student work) over a period of 14 weeks of instruction plus one week of exams. Direct faculty instruction is defined in the "Forms of Instruction" section below.</p><p>The General Education Program 2. Minimum standard for courses over one credit. Courses offered for other than one credit are simply multiples of the one-credit standard. Therefore, a four-credit course requires four hours of classroom or direct faculty instruction AND eight hours of out of class student work (for a total of twelve hours of weekly work) over 14 weeks of instruction plus one week of exams.</p><p>3. Intensive Capstone/Practicum/Research/Creative courses. Capstone, practicum, directed/independent studies, research and creative courses may require students to invest a greater amount of time in work outside of class. These courses may shift the distribution of the minimum standards described above. Reasons for deviations from the one-third/two-thirds ratio should be articulated on course syllabi.</p><p>4. This policy establishes the minimum expectation for academic credit. Students often will be required to invest more time than the required minimum to earn the credit awarded by the course. A student may not petition to add academic credit to a course solely on the basis of the time beyond the minimum they invested in the course.</p><p>Courses offered for less than one credit should generally conform to the one-third/two-thirds ratio of classroom or direct faculty instruction to out of class student work. Partial-term courses must begin and end during the time that the regular semester (14 weeks of instruction plus one week of exams) is scheduled, and students must remain full-time students during the term in which they enroll for a partial-term course.</p><p>Faculty may use their discretion in the weekly distribution of the onethird/two-thirds ratio as long as this guideline is generally met by the end of the semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Forms of Instruction and Student Work</head><p>Faculty led instruction may take place in a variety of modes, including forms of instruction outside of regularly scheduled course hours. Thus, Classroom Instruction is one form of instruction offered at Denison. Other forms of Direct Faculty Instruction include, but are not limited to:</p><p>• Advising for group or individual projects Out of class student work includes, but is not limited to, various types of reading, writing, and research activities; visits to the Writing Center or similar academic support units, and rehearsal, practice, and creative work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The General Education Program</head><p>The General Education requirements ensure that students develop core liberal arts competencies and encounter a broad range of liberal arts inquiries -social, scientific, humanistic, and artistic -embraced by the Denison University faculty. In addition, the requirements expose students to a diversity of perspectives that enable them to interact more effectively in an increasingly interdependent world. Thus, the General Education program seeks to accomplish three goals:</p><p>1. development of competencies, 2. exposure to a broad variety of disciplines and, 3. development of a global perspective. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education: Summary of Requirements</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Foreign Language</head><p>At a minimum, all students must complete an elementary year of Foreign Language 111-112 at the college level. Students who have studied a language in high school and who wish to continue study of that language at Denison in order to fulfill this requirement will, however, be expected to complete the third semester of that language (i.e., to pass or demonstrate proficiency in the language at the 211 level). All entering students who have studied a foreign language in high school must take the appropriate placement test during the orientation period. Language courses 111, 112, and 211 will not count toward the divisional distribution requirements, except for Latin and Greek 211, which may count toward the Humanities requirement unless used to satisfy the Foreign Language requirement.</p><p>NOTE: Only one course from a single department may be used to fulfill the divisional requirements.</p><p>Five of these general education courses (or other courses) must fulfill these competencies:</p><p>• One power and justice requirement • One quantitative requirement • One oral communication requirement</p><p>• Two writing intensive course requirements (one of which must be completed by the end of the sophomore year)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Majors</head><p>Completing an academic major enables students to pursue their primary fields of specialization within the curriculum. Roughly a third of students' courses are completed within a program of study structured by a department or interdisciplinary program. Because the major is the primary means by which students undertake depth of study, students work closely with academic advisors to choose fields for which they are personally and professionally suited. Students may change their majors while at Denison. By the end of the sophomore year, students should formally declare a major. If possible, students should select an academic advisor associated with the chosen major. The specific objectives and requirements of each academic major can be found within this course catalog. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Individually Designed Major (IDM)</head><p>The Denison major promotes discipline of thought and depth of understanding as they are articulated within a specific field. The standard offering of Denison majors is carefully selected; each major is rigorously reviewed, and must meet a myriad of nationally accepted academic standards, and often follows a long tradition of academically sound pedagogy. Because the major is a distinctive hallmark of a Denison degree, the institution guards its majors with utmost care. The IDM option allows students to design their own majors that are not offered in Denison's standard curricula. However, the Academic Affairs Council applies the very highest standards in accepting IDMs. Students must have a compelling and coherent case for pursuing an IDM.</p><p>Individually Designed Majors approved in the last few years include the following titles:</p><p>• "Language Functionality in Society"</p><p>• "Integrated Science and Design"</p><p>• "Cultural Studies and Liberation"</p><p>• "Commerce, Media and the Arts"</p><p>• "Comparative Literature"</p><p>• "Public Health"</p><p>Students who wish to design their majors should consult with their advisors and the Registrar early in their Denison careers. Students must submit their IDM proposal to the Registrar by March 1 of the sophomore year. Approval of the proposal by the Academic Affairs Council must be completed by May 1 of the student's sophomore year. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concentrations</head><p>A concentration provides an interdisciplinary program of study that augments or complements a student's major. Concentrations are designed to require a depth of study in a field that crosses disciplinary boundaries. Typically, a concentration will be linked to a student's major. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Planning and Advising</head><p>Advising is a form of teaching that is purposeful, ongoing and regular.</p><p>Advising is integral to teaching at Denison. The Academic Advisor plays a key role in helping students learn to become autonomous thinkers, capable of self-determination through their exploration of the liberal arts.</p><p>The chief role of a faculty advisor is to assist students in thinking through their undergraduate liberal arts experience and their educational goals so that they may take full advantage of the resources available at Denison University. The advising relationship develops and changes over the course of four years, as student needs and concerns evolve. Advisors encourage students to think critically about the benefits of a liberal education. They also assist students in understanding Denison's current academic regulations as well as the educational resources available at the university. Advisors have an essential role in directing students to additional advising and mentorship resources from across campus.</p><p>Faculty advisors also offer guidance beyond these matters:</p><p>• assisting students in identifying their interests;</p><p>• helping students make links between immediate and long-range goals;</p><p>• discussing career paths and graduate school options;</p><p>• referring students to institutional resources for academic or personal support; and</p><p>• giving advice, when appropriate, on decisions relating to personal or quality-of-life choices.</p><p>During the first year of residence, Denison urges students to begin planning their programs of study. This program should be suited to the student's particular needs, interests, life aspirations, and career plans. The various academic departments and the faculty advisor, as well as the offices of Student Development, the Knowlton Center for Career Exploration, and Academic Support, will assist students with the planning process. Good educational planning, based on Denison's tradition of liberal education, should include consideration of educational objectives relating to career plans and personal developmental goals, analysis of high school and first semester Denison experiences and discoveries, course work and off-campus programs being considered, and a tentative choice of major. The student should discuss these issues with his/her faculty advisor.</p><p>Because education is an evolutionary process, Denison encourages students to explore the breadth of opportunity at Denison in their early years on campus. Modification of academic goals, vocational plans, and prospective majors is common, and students should not preclude consideration of any particular range of educational alternative.</p><p>The Dean of First Year Students assigns each incoming student a faculty advisor. Frequently, this person will be an instructor in one of the courses (for example, AC 101 -Advising Circles) taken by the student during the first semester. Otherwise, the Dean will make an assignment based on a student's initial academic interests. As a student's major and vocational goals become more clearly defined, it is likely that the student will choose to change to an advisor more familiar with those developing interests. Students may, with the consent of the new faculty advisor, officially switch to a new advisor. All changes must be reported to the Registrar's Office.</p><p>It is ultimately the responsibility of students to monitor their own academic progress and to ensure that all of their General Education and major/minor requirements are completed by their intended graduation date. Academic advising provides useful support toward this goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Lisska Center for Scholarly Engagement</head><p>The Lisska Center for Scholarly Engagement is Denison's fellowships office and a campus hub for programs that promote a culture of intellectual life on campus. Our mission is to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> advise and support students and recent alumni applying for nationally and internationally competitive fellowships and scholarships; (2) coordinate Denison's Summer Scholars program; (3) provide funding for student research and academic enhancement travel; and (4) support faculty in their role as scholars; and (5) sponsor a range of multidisciplinary programs and events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Fellowships Advising</head><p>The Lisska Center staff assists students and recent alumni applying for nationally-and internationally-competitive fellowships at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Fellowships fund summer programs, study abroad programs, service projects, and postgraduate study and research both in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>Examples of prestigious fellowships include the Rhodes Scholarship, the Marshall Scholarship, Fulbright awards, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship, the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship in Science and Mathematics, the Morris K. Udall Scholarship in National Environmental Policy, National Science Foundation Fellowships, the Boren Scholarship for International Study, DAAD (German Academic Exchange) grants, and many others.</p><p>Denison is proud of the many students and alumni who have won such awards over the years.</p><p>In collaboration with the Director of Foundation and Corporate Relations, the Lisska Center also works with Denison faculty members interested in applying for nationally-competitive fellowships and grants.</p><p>While some fellowship applications require an institutional endorsement and have a minimum GPA requirement, many do not. All interested students are encouraged to schedule an individual appointment and/or attend group information sessions. Comprehensive listings of national and international fellowships can be found on the Lisska Center's MyDenison page (https://my.denison.edu/node/44).</p><p>The Lisska Center provides intensive one-on-one support to those applying for any fellowship or grant opportunity. We help applicants identify appropriate opportunities, prepare their application materials, and write their application essays. We also coach fellowship competition finalists preparing for interviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Summer Scholar Program</head><p>The Lisska Center coordinates Denison's Summer Scholar <ref type="bibr">Program. Each</ref> year, more than 120 students across all disciplines receive funding to support independent research under the close supervision of a faculty member, or full-time collaborative work with faculty members, during the summer. It gives students in all disciplines a unique undergraduate venue in which to experiment with ideas and artistic expression, pursue an intellectual passion, and focus intently on the resolution of a question over a sustained period of time. Summer Scholar projects do not confer credit hours and are not graded. All students must produce a scholarly project (e.g., final poster, paper, performance, or equivalent) and present their summer's work in a public forum.</p><p>Summer Scholars receive a stipend ($4,000 for 10 weeks in 2019) and housing allowance allowance and supplemental research funds (up to $500 per student). Faculty advisors also receive a stipend per student supervised (three students maximum).</p><p>The Lisska Center holds information sessions and works closely with the Student Research Grants Committee (SRGC), which selects the recipients of Young Scholar, Early Experience, and Off-Campus Summer Scholar awards. The Lisska Center also works with the coordinators of the Anderson Summer Science Program, the Woodyard Scholar awards in the Department of Religion, the Ashbrook Summer Scholar awards, and the Battelle Summer Scholar awards. Guidelines can be found on the Lisska Center's MyDenison page (https://my.denison.edu/node/44).</p><p>The Lisska Center approves and coordinates the logistics of all Summer Scholar stipend payments, housing, and supplemental research grants. These activities include hosting a kick-off luncheon as well as weekly research dinners where Summer Scholars and faculty members share informal updates on their projects. The Lisska Center also organizes the early fall Summer Scholar poster sessions and performances where students present their final work.</p><p>Qualified rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in all disciplines are eligible to apply for Summer Scholar awards. A qualified student is one who:</p><p>• will be returning to Denison in the fall and has registered for classes;</p><p>• will be on an approved off-campus study program in the fall;</p><p>• is on an approved academic leave;</p><p>• is on an approved leave of absence and does not have to reapply to return.</p><p>Projects do not necessarily need to be in the discipline of the student's major. Interdisciplinary projects may be proposed as well. Any student who does not fall into one of the above categories is not eligible. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">The purpose of Denison's Research Table'</ref>s is threefold: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> to bring together faculty members from across the college and other institutions to explore various aspects of the liberal arts, using practices that sustain a strong academic community;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Tables</head><p>(2) to create a forum for faculty members from different disciplines to learn from one another; and (3) to deepen the intellectual tone on campus by increasing opportunities for different disciplinary perspectives to intersect and new pathways among faculty and students to form.</p><p>Research Tables should focus on multidisciplinary issues of interest to participants who are committed to sustained intellectual exploration within the liberal arts. Research Tables may vary in scope, ranging from limited undertakings similar to reading groups (e.g., locally based members, one-year time-frame) to more ambitious projects (e.g., one or more outside faculty members, travel component, up to a three-year timeframe). All Research Tables must culminate in a focused symposium that brings other scholars and practitioners to Denison. <ref type="table">Research Table  members</ref> must complete a final report summarizing the Research <ref type="table">Table'</ref>s focus, activities, and outcomes in terms of student learning and faculty research.</p><p>Students in good academic standing may be invited by faculty sponsors to participate in a Research </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental College</head><p>The Experimental College is a program of student-led, non-credit classes.</p><p>Teaching an Experimental College course gives students an opportunity to design a syllabus, guide classroom discussion, and engage a small group of peers in a topic of intellectual interest. Students do not receive course credit for leading or taking the class.</p><p>Students interested in teaching an Experimental College course must submit a proposal, including a syllabus, to the Lisska Center for approval. All proposed Experimental College courses must have a designated faculty or staff advisor and must be approved by the Director and Associate Director of the Lisska Center and the Chair(s) of relevant academic departments. The Lisska Center will provide a certificate to students who attend all course sessions and satisfactorily complete the work for the course. The Center also offers a small amount of financial support to cover any costs of course preparation, supplies, and possible field trips. The Lisska Center will put out calls for a limited number of new Experimental College classes once or twice a year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Faculty Events</head><p>The Lisska Center sponsors the Tuesday Faculty Lunch series, the Friday Faculty Lunches in Curtis, and the Faculty Research Dinners at Monomoy Place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Activities</head><p>The Lisska Center hosts Chowder Hours, home-cooked lunches for students, faculty, and staff featuring presentations on the scholarship of an individual or group. The Lisska Center also coordinates the Monday Musings series of informal presentations led by faculty members on their scholarly interests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gilpatrick House</head><p>Housing is available for up to ten students who have done intensive research (such as Summer Scholars), or who will be doing independent research during the coming academic year.</p><p>The Lisska Center encourages students at every stage of their academic career, from first-year students to seniors, to keep in touch with people at the Center, who will help them find and take advantage of research and scholarship opportunities appropriate for each student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Academic Projects</head><p>Students have the opportunity to undertake Directed Studies, Independent Studies, and Senior Research. These are explained below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directed Study</head><p>A student in good standing may work intensively in areas of special interest under the Directed Study plan. A Directed Study is appropriate when a student wants to explore a subject more fully than is possible in a regular course, or to study a subject not covered in the regular curriculum. A Directed Study should not normally duplicate a course that is regularly offered. A student electing a Directed Study must submit to the Registrar a proposal with appropriate departmental approval no later than the first Friday of the semester. Directed Studies are normally taken for 3 or 4 credits. A one-semester Directed Study is limited to a maximum of 4 credit hours. The form required for Directed Studies is available in the Office of the Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study</head><p>Independent Study engages a student in the pursuit of clearly defined goals. In this effort a student may employ skills and information developed in previous course experiences or may develop some mastery of new knowledge or skills.</p><p>A proposal for an Independent Study project must be approved in advance by the faculty member who agrees to serve as the project advisor. The approval must be submitted on the appropriate form to the Registrar no later than the first Friday of the semester.</p><p>The chief distinction between this and other options for individual study is that an individual faculty member works with the student only prior to the initiation of the study (or at its very beginning) and at the completion of the study. A student may propose an extensive independent project up to the equivalent of a full semester's work. An Independent Study project that constitutes a student's total academic load in a given semester may be done either on or off the campus. Any proposal or combination of proposals to do independent work, carrying more than four credit hours, must be submitted to the Academic Affairs Council. Such proposals would be subject to careful review and only with extenuating circumstances would be considered for approval. Examples of Independent Studies approved recently include: "An Existential Search for Religion, " "Genetics of Sarracenia, " "Creativity and the New York Musician, " and "Behavioral Studies of the Primates of the Peruvian Amazon."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Research</head><p>Students may enroll in Senior Research in their final year at Denison. Normally, Senior Research requires a major thesis, report or project in the Special Academic Honors student's field of concentration and carries eight semester-hours of credit for the year. Typically, a final grade for a year-long Senior Research will not be assigned until the completion of the year-long Senior Research at the end of the second semester. In which case, the first semester Senior Research grade will remain "in progress" (PR) until the completion of the second semester Senior Research. Instructors who choose to assign a grade at the completion of the first semester Senior Research should notify the Registrar at the beginning of December. Semester hours of credit for Senior Research shall not be counted toward the maximum hours allowed in the student's major. Each semester of Senior Research is limited to a maximum of 4 credit hours. The form required for Senior Research is available in the Office of the Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Academic Honors The Dean's List</head><p>A student earning a superior academic average is placed on the Dean's List. Notice of this accomplishment is sent to the student's hometown newspaper(s).</p><p>Academic qualifications for inclusion on the Dean's List require that a 3.7 academic average be maintained for the semester, with no D's, F's, U's, I's, X's, or W's, and that a minimum of 12 academic hours be completed for a grade. Students with X-grade notations are not eligible to receive Dean's List honors, neither contemporaneously nor retroactively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phi Beta Kappa</head><p>The Denison University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established in 1910. Election to Phi Beta Kappa takes place during the second semester of the senior year and is based primarily on a record of outstanding academic achievement. Election is also possible during the second semester of the junior year for a student whose academic record is truly exceptional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recognition of Senior Research or Senior Creative Project</head><p>A student who plans to complete a yearlong senior research or senior creative project may declare to the major department/program and to the Registrar the intention to submit a final product for Recognition. This declaration must be completed by February 1 of the senior year and requires the signatures of the Project advisor, a second evaluator, and the chair of the department/program. Departments and programs will determine the guidelines governing the design and execution of the project and may establish minimum requirements for students to undertake a project. A Senior Research or Senior Creative Project will be judged to merit Recognition if both the advisor and second evaluator give it a B or above, and at least one of the grades is a B+ or above.</p><p>(These grades are separate from the grade for the Senior Research course submitted by the advisor.) A Senior Research or Senior Creative Project that is judged to merit Recognition will receive the following acknowledgment:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>President's Medals</head><p>Each spring at the Academic Awards Convocation, the President awards medals to outstanding graduating seniors who have made especially good use of their undergraduate education and have contributed substantially to the community. The range of accomplishments the President seeks to acknowledge and honor are comparable to those associated with the winners of a major national scholarship such as the Rhodes or Marshall. The preeminent criterion for receipt of a President's Medal, Denison's most prestigious award, is academic achievement. In addition, candidates must embody some combination of the following:</p><p>• service to the community,</p><p>• contribution to the arts,</p><p>• enlargement of the community's global perspective,</p><p>• athletic fitness and achievement,</p><p>• leadership ability and contribution to community discourse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration</head><p>Registration is the formal enrollment in the College. In registering, the student subscribes to all the regulations, terms, and conditions, academic and financial, as set forth in this Catalog. A student must, therefore, confirm registration during the scheduled registration period each semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Normal Registration</head><p>A normal load is set at 16 semester hours of credit per semester. This total should include the appropriate requirements. The normal academic load enables a student to meet the graduation requirements within eight semesters. A student who pays regular tuition charges is permitted to audit, with the approval of the faculty instructor and without additional cost, one course a semester for which no credit may be claimed. Audits may not be allowed by the various departments until after credit seeking students have been accommodated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reduced Registration</head><p>This classification is recommended for a student, who for any reason, cannot carry a normal schedule satisfactorily. If reduced registration is advisable, a student may be required to carry a schedule of 12 to 14 credit hours and be asked to devote an extra semester to fulfill the graduation requirements. Without special permission from the Associate Provost, 12 hours shall be minimum registration for any regular student. With special permission a regular student may register for 9 to 11 credit hours. The reduced registration option could have ramifications for financial aid eligibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excess Registration</head><p>The payment of tuition for fall or spring semesters of any given academic year entitles a full-time regular Denison student to 18 credit hours in that semester. See the Annual Cost section of Catalog for the fee, billing, and payment arrangements if taking more than 18 hours in any semester.</p><p>With extenuating circumstances and evidence of careful planning, a student may request twice during their Denison career to take up to 20 hours and waive the excess hours fee. Any such request should be submitted to the Registrar's Office in writing prior to the beginning of the semester in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Partial Registration</head><p>With the permission of the appropriate Dean, a regular student may take a part-time schedule of eight or fewer academic semester hours of credit. A part-time regular student may pay by the credit hour and must carry eight hours or fewer. Regular students carrying more than eight hours are counted by the University as full-time students and must pay full tuition. A full-time student normally carries 15 to 16 hours. For students on financial aid or scholarship, a minimum registration of 12 hours is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Registration</head><p>Special registration is open to persons living within commuting distance of the campus, certain foreign students who want to take for credit, or to audit, certain courses of special interest but who are not degree candidates, and certain graduates who want to take post-graduate work. A special student may not register for more than 8 credit-hours of academic work except by permission from the Academic Standing Board. A special student desiring credit must submit appropriate credentials to the Office of Admissions. If, after one semester, a special student has failed to maintain a 2.0 average, the special standing can be terminated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Credit</head><p>With the consent of the instructor, a student may request to take a course for an additional hour of credit. The nature of the additional work that the student must do in order to receive the additional credit, and how that work will be evaluated, must be clearly outlined in the petition. Usually instructors award one grade, but may choose to assign different grades to the regular course and the additional project.</p><p>A student whose petition for additional credit is granted may not drop that credit after the deadline for dropping courses has passed.</p><p>Special academic projects (p. 13) including Directed Study and Senior Research are not eligible for additional credit over 4 credit-hours;</p><p>additional credit over 4-credit hours for Independent Study requires a proposal to be considered by the Academic Affairs Council.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes in Registration: Adding of Courses</head><p>Students may add courses or credits to their registration during the first two weeks (10 class days) of a semester. The student should consult with the advisor and must have the consent of the instructor and academic advisor. The appropriate documentation must be filed promptly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes in Registration: Dropping of Courses</head><p>A drop of a course or credit may be permitted through the end of the ninth week of classes by submitting to the Office of the Registrar a properly completed change of registration form. This excludes Denison Seminars and Private Music Lessons/Ensembles, which have an add/drop date at the end of the second week of classes. Please note that excess hour fees and applied music lesson or other course fees are not refunded after the fourth week in the case of a student withdrawing for any reason from a course or from the University. Change of registration after the stated deadlines requires action of the Academic Standing Board. The decision of the Academic Standing Board is final.</p><p>Student need not justify or seek approval for the drop through week nine of the semester. The instructor's signature is required in order to make sure the instructor is notified of the student's intentions. The advisor's signature is required to confirm that the student contacted the advisor to discuss the decision to drop the class and to hear the advisor's opinion about the impact this may have on the student's progress toward graduation before the class is dropped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Late Registration</head><p>Students failing to register by the deadline date prescribed in University publications and/or failing to respond properly to University official's notices regarding the problem shall be withdrawn from all preregistered courses. Such withdrawal carries with it financial forfeitures of 50 percent of all fees due. Appeal of this action shall be to the Academic Standing Board and, with a resulting decision of reinstatement, normally carries a minimum penalty of $50 and other disciplinary sanctions as deemed appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statement of Petition Policy</head><p>On the advice of the Registrar, students may petition the Academic Standing Board for exceptions to rules concerning academic policies and procedures. However, the Board will consider only those petitions submitted sufficiently far in advance so that, if denied, the petitioner will still have time to remedy the deficiency by suitable re-scheduling or other appropriate action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attendance Policy</head><p>A hallmark of a Denison education is the small, interactive, and participatory classroom, situated on a residential campus. Therefore, it is essential that students be present on campus and be active participants in their courses. Attendance policies are designed to promote the success and well-being of the individual students as well as the community of learners in each class and each co-curricular undertaking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies</head><p>For oneself and one's peers, attendance and presence on campus are vital to the Denison education.</p><p>It is expected that all students will attend and participate in regularly scheduled classes. If a class is missed, for any reason, the student is responsible for determining what occurred in the missed class. Absence from a class will not be accepted as an excuse for not knowing class material. Students are responsible for all information, discussion, and conceptual analysis that takes place during classes.</p><p>Attendance policy is set by the instructor. It is the responsibility of the instructor to establish 1. a policy on class attendance, 2. any criteria for excused absences when attendance is required, and 3. a policy for makeup of missed work.</p><p>The latter is particularly important because class absence is a loss of opportunity for learning. It is vitally important that each faculty member review these points in class early in the semester. The course syllabus is the contractual agreement between instructor and student. It is important that the instructor outline clearly the expectations and all other factors that determine grades and penalties.</p><p>It is the student's responsibility to provide any needed documentation for class absences, including medical excuses. At the student's request, Whisler Health Center will issue a dated documentation of visit in the event of a situation requiring class absence.</p><p>Each semester, students must be on campus and attend the first meeting of their registered classes. If circumstances prevent a student from arriving on campus for the first day of classes, the student must notify the Dean of Students. Students who miss class for an extended period of time during a semester because of personal, medical, or psychological reasons must also notify the Dean of Students. Without prior notification and approval for these types of absences, the student may be withdrawn or be required to take a leave of absence by the Dean of Students in consultation with the Associate Provost and relevant campus offices and individuals (including faculty).</p><p>Denison's orientation programs are designed to welcome and introduce new students to our campus resources, community, and culture. All students attending Denison for their first semester (new First-Year Students and Transfer Students) are required to attend Denison's mandatory orientation programs. Failure to attend and/or complete the required orientation activities may result in a student being withdrawn or having their offer of admission revoked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absence Policy</head><p>Students at Denison University are expected to give the highest priority to their academic commitments. However, sometimes conflicts arise among various academic pursuits. At these times, students, faculty, staff, and administrators all share the responsibility of recognizing, minimizing, and resolving these conflicts.</p><p>Legitimate Conflicts: Courses and activities that earn academic credit at Denison may place legitimate demands on a student's time outside of the regularly scheduled meeting times for that course or activity. This may give rise to potential conflicts to regularly scheduled classroom/ lab hours. Such activities might include, but not be limited to, courserelated field trips, fine arts performances (but not rehearsals), and varsity sports contests (both regular season and all post-season contests, but not scrimmages or practices).</p><p>When the demands of one course or credit-bearing activity impinge upon another, the student and the faculty or staff members are encouraged to work together to achieve a reasonable accommodation that resolves the conflict without sacrificing the academic integrity and rigor of the course or activity. Moreover, all parties (students, faculty, staff, and administrators) have the following specific responsibilities when dealing with legitimate conflicts.</p><p>Scheduling responsibilities of all faculty, staff, and students: a) to confine course instruction and examinations to the time slots for the course, following the course grid and final examination assigned times, unless specific exception has been granted for the course by the Provost's Office; b) to indicate clearly on the course syllabus the policies and expectations for class attendance, assignments, and examinations, and, if attendance at a supplemental event (such as a lecture, field trip, or performance) is expected and that event occurs at a time outside of the regularly scheduled meeting times, to inform students of the event as soon as possible;</p><p>c) to provide students alternative means of meeting the requirements of the course when attendance at a supplemental event for that course is scheduled for a time outside of the course's regularly scheduled meeting times; d) to avoid scheduling any supplemental events in the Monday-Friday 4:30-6:30 p.m. time period; e) if a scheduling conflict arises (that is, if a student is asked to attend a supplemental event, an athletic competition, or a similar university activity at a time in which they are required to attend another class).</p><p>i. the student should inform both faculty or staff members immediately and seek a mutually agreed upon resolution;</p><p>ii. the faculty members should work with the student to resolve legitimate conflicts without sacrificing the academic integrity and rigor of the course;</p><p>iii. faculty and staff members should provide an alternative way for students to meet course requirements or the expectations of creditbearing activities;</p><p>iv. in situations when the student, faculty, and/or staff member cannot reach an acceptable resolution to the conflict, the Associate Provost for Academic Affairs will be asked to provide consultation to all parties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Integrity</head><p>Every Denison student is expected to know and uphold University standards in matters of academic honesty. Students who practice academic dishonesty assault their own integrity as well as that of the University. Behavior that is in direct violation of these standards is discussed in the student handbook. Each Denison student is expected to be familiar with this policy. Please note that violations may result in suspension or expulsion from the University. Denison's Code of Academic Integrity (https://denison.edu/academics/curriculum/ integrity) is the foundation of the university's commitment to and policies regarding Academic Integrity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Classification</head><p>Classification of students is determined by the amount of academic credit earned.</p><p>• First-Year Standing -A student is classified as a first-year student if hours earned are fewer than 26 semester-hours of credit.</p><p>• Sophomore Standing -A student must have earned 26 semester hours of credit.</p><p>• Junior Standing -A student must have earned 60 semester hours of credit.</p><p>• Senior Standing -A student must have earned 90 semester hours of credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility Rule</head><p>A regularly enrolled student registered on a full-time basis (normally 12 semester-hours or more) and in good academic standing shall be eligible to participate in all college and intercollegiate activities. The student whose scholastic record falls below a 2.0 average will not be permitted to participate in intercollegiate athletics. First-year students are eligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics during their first semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Earned by Advanced Placement Testing</head><p>First-Year Students and Transfer Students who score a 4 or 5 on a College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Advanced Placement Examination (AP) will usually receive academic credit for their scores. Should results be presented in academic disciplines or areas that are not part of the Denison curriculum, credit will be subject to departmental review and credit hours may or may not be assigned. Two other kinds of advanced placement testing can be considered for credit. A student presenting "A" marks on the British System "A" Level Examination or a score of 6 or 7 on an International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level Subject Exam may ask the appropriate Denison department for advanced placement credits. In a few instances positive results from advanced placement examinations can be applied toward general education or major/minor credits but departments reserve the right of review and the final determination of how such credits count.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Grievance Policy</head><p>The assessment of student academic performance, including the assignment of particular grades, is a faculty responsibility. The faculty member offering the course is responsible for the evaluation of student course work and, under normal circumstances, is the sole judge of the grades received by students in that course.</p><p>If a student feels that a course grade was the result of prejudiced, capricious, or in some other way unjust evaluation on the part of the instructor, that student may file a grievance petition with the Academic Standing Board. The petition must be filed within the semester following the awarding of the disputed evaluation, even if the student or faculty member is off-campus and unable to appear until a later date. Petitions should include evidence of prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation and evidence of attempts to deal with the problem at the departmental level, including discussions with the faculty member involved and the relevant department chair. Only after these steps have been taken will the matter become part of the formal academic grievance process. Simple disagreement with the instructor's philosophy in assigning grades, or with the instructor's professional judgment about the quality of the work does not constitute cause for petitioning.</p><p>The Academic Standing Board will transmit evidence of the charges to the faculty member. After evaluating the charges and hearing the instructor's explanation, and possibly discussing the situation with other members of the class and/or members of the involved department, the elected teaching faculty of the committee will recommend a solution.</p><p>Both the student and the faculty member will have the right to appear personally before the committee and to present their views.</p><p>If the Academic Standing Board decides there is no basis to alter the grade, the process will terminate at that point. If the Academic Standing Board recommends that the grade should be changed, it will request that the instructor make the change, providing the instructor with a written explanation of its reasons. Should the instructor decline, the instructor should provide an explanation in writing. The entire matter will then be referred to the six elected faculty members of the President's Advisory Board, who will be the final arbiters of the case. This faculty committee will examine all available information on the dispute, meet with the student and the instructor, members of the instructor's academic department if appropriate, and others as it sees fit.</p><p>The faculty committee, after considering all the evidence and upon concluding that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, may then recommend to the Provost that the grade be changed. The Provost will provide the instructor with a copy of the recommendation and will ask the instructor to implement it. If the instructor continues to decline, the Provost will then change the grade, notifying the instructor and the student of this action. The Provost, following written instructions of the faculty committee, will effect a change in grade over the objection of the instructor who assigned the original grade. If the student remains dissatisfied with the result of the petitioning process, the student may request that the Registrar insert a letter in the academic record, describing the process and the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System and Evaluation Grading System</head><p>Grades carry the following weights in the computation of grade-point averages. An incomplete grade in a course may be granted only with permission from the Academic Standing Board. The student shall petition the Board, giving the reasons for the desired extension of time. The statement must be signed by the instructor of the course and the student's advisor. All such requests must be submitted prior to the last day of scheduled classes for the semester. Should a request for an incomplete grade be granted, completion of the work must be accomplished by the end of the sixth week of the following semester, or any time previous, as prescribed by the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Letter Grade GPA</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfactory (S/Grade) Evaluation</head><p>Courses graded on an S/Grade basis result in an S on the transcript if the grade reported is C or above, and the grade earned if it is C-or below. The grade of Satisfactory (S) does not affect the student's GPA. Letter grades of C-or lower in an S/Grade graded course are included in the student's grade point average. Sophomores, juniors and seniors may elect to take one course per semester on the S/Grade basis. There is a limit of one course per semester which may be taken on the S/Grade basis. This option may not be exercised for courses within a student's major, minor, or concentration fields, including required cognate courses, and it is not an option for any General Education requirement. Via the appropriate form at the Registrar's office, students must request S/Grade grading, or request to switch back from S/Grade grading to a letter grade, by the end of week nine. Neither the instructor's approval nor the instructor's signature is required for a student to opt to take a class S/Grade, nor are instructors notified that a student has elected this option. A few courses are offered to everyone utilizing a "satisfactory" grading format, and such courses are not included in the option described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Courses</head><p>Students may repeat courses in order to develop greater mastery of the subject matter. However, second efforts do not erase original efforts, including failed first attempts, and both grades will be included in the GPA calculations. Should students take and successfully complete a course twice, they must be aware that both grades will be included in the GPA calculations but the credit hours cannot be included twice. You may wish to discuss all potential ramifications with the Registrar if this scenario is a factor for you. Students who want to re-enroll for a course for which they have already received a passing mark must receive permission from the chairperson of that department and the instructor of the course in question. Repeating a previously passed course may present Financial Aid implications.</p><p>assistance, electronic and print reserves, and interlibrary loan/document delivery.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest</head><p>All juniors in Art History and Visual Culture participate in Junior Day. They are required to make a formal presentation of current work or research. The presentation is made to the faculty and to the student's peers as part of the AHVC Symposium annually. Art History and Visual Culture seniors also make a formal presentation of their research to an invited audience at the AHVC Symposium. Art History and Visual Culture: Students in Art History and Visual Culture learn writing skills that are integral to the discipline and the liberal arts. Working closely with faculty, students learn to translate visual observation and evaluation into written language; articulate questions for research; communicate the results of their research discoveries in writing; and develop an informed, critical, and independent written voice. Our courses emphasize the sequential, graduated development of writing skills. These culminate in our required senior thesis and symposium. Denison University works to make study abroad possible for all students. In Art History and Visual Culture, we encourage students to study abroad during their junior year. Most students who major in Art History and Visual Culture and study off-campus transfer two classes for the major, satisfy GE requirements, and/or gain general credits towards graduation. Quite a few students also do independent research or internships as part of their study abroad experience. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study office to explore their options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Art Studio Departmental Guidelines</head><p>In Studio Art we foster independent and creative thought, emphasizing art-making as a means of thinking about not only oneself, but our relationship to the world of ideas from multiple perspectives. We offer two degree programs in Studio Art, a bachelor of arts (BA) and a bachelor of fine arts (BFA). Both degree programs emphasize individuality, interdisciplinary work, collaboration and community. We encourage the fluidity of learning and see art as a bridge to all areas of study and research. The BA and the BFA prepare students in different ways for a variety of post-graduate pursuits, be it graduate school or professional endeavors in art and related fields. Students who plan to major in Studio Art are strongly advised to seek an advisor in Studio Art at the time of their decision to major. Studio Art majors are required to take a series of core courses and students need to work closely with advisors to complete these core courses by end of the first semester in their junior year. Students should expect to work two hours per week outside of class for each credit hour of a course. For students to whom off campus study is an option, we transfer up to 4 courses from an off-campus study experience towards the major, pending approval from the Chair.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studio Art Major (B.A.)</head><p>Our BA students are encouraged to connect their Studio Art major with the curriculum of the college to realize individual approaches to Studio Art that are interwoven with science, social science, humanities and/or other fine arts disciplines. A total of 48 credit hours are required, with ten courses coming from Studio Art and two courses from Art History and Visual Culture, or alternatively, one course from Art History and Visual Culture and one course from Philosophy (see description below).</p><p>• 12 courses (48 Credit Hours) total: 10 Studio Courses: 4 core courses to be completed by the end of first semester Junior Year:</p><p>• ARTS 101 -Studio Art Foundation OR ARTS 110 -Introduction to Drawing (or ARTS 170 -Introduction to Drawing for Majors),</p><p>• one 2D course,</p><p>• one 3D course</p><p>• and one Time-based course (such as photo, video, performance art, animation or a web-based studio course).</p><p>• One 200 level studio elective.</p><p>• One semester of Junior Practicum.</p><p>• Senior Year:</p><p>• ARTS 401 -Visual Arts Practicum plus a 300-level studio course or independent study in the fall semester, Senior year;</p><p>• ARTS 401 -Visual Arts Practicum plus a 300-level studio course or independent study in the spring semester, senior year. (Senior BA Studio Art majors are required to take ARTS 401 -Visual Arts Practicum during each semester of the senior year in conjunction with either a 300-level course or an independent study in an area of studio concentration. All 300-level courses are repeatable.)</p><p>• Art History and Visual Culture/Theory Courses: Art History and Visual Culture/Theory electives should be determined in consultation with the student's advisor. Students may choose any two Art History and Visual Culture courses, or one Art History and Visual Culture course, and PHIL 269 -Philosophy of the Arts: Aesthetics, to fulfill this requirement.</p><p>• All Studio Art majors (B.A. and B.F.A.) are required to participate in the group Senior Exhibition and are required to give a Gallery Talk in conjunction with the Senior Exhibition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studio Art Major (B.F.A.)</head><p>Students pursuing a BFA degree should discuss their intentions with a member of the Studio Art faculty as soon as possible. Students are required to apply to the BFA program in the first semester of their Junior year by presenting artwork made at Denison in an exhibition with fellow applicants. Prospective BFA candidates will then be required to meet at the exhibition with the Studio Art faculty for a discussion of their work and their reasons for pursuing the BFA degree. Upon acceptance into the BFA program, the department will notify the Registrar. BFA students are also subject to periodic review of their studio work by the Studio Art faculty. A total of 72 credit hours are required, with a minimum of fourteen courses coming from Studio Art and three courses from Art History and Visual Culture.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 101 -Studio Art Foundation (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Directed at both majors and non-art majors, Studio Art Foundation (SAF) is a basic introduction to artistic practice in contemporary culture. Through an interdisciplinary approach and a technical understanding of multiple mediums, the course crosses borders between two-dimensional, three-dimensional and time based artistic disciplines. Campus wide events <ref type="bibr">(lectures, concerts, exhibitions)</ref> are used as points of departure in the class to emphasize the critical nature of art making with other content areas of study, theory and research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 110 -Introduction to Drawing (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>A studio course in the fundamentals of drawing in several media. Problems in still life, rendering, and perspective will be covered, along with historical and contemporary approaches to drawing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 115 -Introduction to Painting (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Historical and contemporary approaches to painting technique will be covered in readings and discussions and by working with painting materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 117 -Introduction to Photography (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>An Introductory course concentrating on: the fundamentals of operating a digital single lens reflex camera (SLR), editing software --Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, and output to large format printers. Technical understanding of camera and editing software, lectures on historical context and contemporary practice, as well as readings serve to encourage students to explore photography as a way to look, question and record personal experience through the medium of photography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 121 -Introduction to Ceramics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>A broad introduction to all ceramics potential. Clay working in sculptural as well as vessel-oriented directions. Slide presentations and discussions with references made to ceramic history as well as to contemporary ceramic art. Students are introduced to a variety of hand building techniques and are encouraged to pursue their individual creative potential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 220 -Ceramic History and Contemporary Practice (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The history of ceramics very closely parallels the development of civilization and culture across the planet. In this studio course, students will draw upon this long, rich history as inspiration for their own work and gain a deeper understanding of the context in which they and other contemporary artists are creating ceramic art. The primary emphasis of ceramic history and its impact on contemporary practice will be explored through image presentations, research, discussions and studio work. Students will use a variety of construction techniques and surface treatments to transform their ideas and research into objects and are encouraged to pursue their individual creative potential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 221 -Intermediate Ceramics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Students will hone the skills gained in previous ceramic courses and will focus on refining the application of learned techniques to produce visually and conceptually compelling work. Image presentations and discussions will lead to a deeper understanding of contemporary and historical ceramic art. Students will gain experience in different firing technologies and clay and glaze chemistry. Primary emphasis is on students' individual conceptual and technical development. Prerequisite(s): ARTS 121, ARTS 122 or Ceramic Multiples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 222 -Contemporary Comics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This Studio Art course will examine the relationship of words and pictures through the study and making of autobiographical and nonfiction comics. As other Studio Art courses examine the disciplines of photography, ceramics, sculpture or painting through experiential learning, so too will students realize the potential of this discipline to reveal their creative selves through its unique visual language. Placing practice in context, comics history will be explored with the emphasis on contemporary cartoonists and graphic novelists as artists focused on relevant first person narrative storytelling and comics journalism. Traditional techniques of layout, design and storyboarding will be included along with drawing and writing exercises. Course projects will extend technical exercises to address content concerns through in-class workshops, presentations on cartoonists, critiques, field trips and a range of short and long outside projects that will gradually build to more ambitious creative comic undertakings by semesters end. No previous studio art or drawing experience is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 223 -The Ceramic Surface (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this studio course students will explore the numerous options for surface expression in ceramic art making. One of clay's unique properties is the ability to faithfully record impressions in its surface -from the fingerprint of a potter to patterned designs stamped into the surface. Today, mark making on clay has caught up with technology, incorporating digital processes into the roster of print technique possibilities. Students will learn to make their own glazes, effectively use slips, glazes, china paints, lustres, print-transfers, photo-decals and alternative firing techniques. Students will explore the relationships between content, form and surface through the creative process, group critiques, readings, image presentations and discussions. Prerequisite(s): A Denison University ceramic course or consent of instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 224 -Ceramic Multiples (Ceramics From Molds) (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this studio course students learn to create ceramic objects using plaster molds, how to make casting slip, and the basics of kiln firing. We will explore the relationship between Art, Design, and Craft, and students will be encouraged to push the boundaries of where these categories begin and end. Producing ceramic objects from molds allows for greater refinement of the object, unlimited possibilities of form and the potential of creating multiple replicas or variations on one form. Because of inherent associations with industry, technology, and mass-production, objects produced from molds offer unique conceptual possibilities that students will pursue through the creative process, group critiques, readings and discussions. Prerequisite(s): Any Denison University Studio Art course or consent of the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 231 -Intermediate Printmaking (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Students may work with any printmaking processes in which they have had experience or with the consent of instructor. Processes available to Printmaking II students include: relief, lithography, intaglio or screen printing. Emphasis will be on continued technical and conceptual development. Prerequisite(s): ARTS 131 or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 240 -Installation/Site-Specific Art (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In installation art the space is considered like the blank sheet of paper of a drawing. Its goal is the transformation of spaces through the use of objects, images, color, etc. Site-specific art is art that is created in a certain space, where the place is part of the work and adds meaning to it. This Installation/Site-Specific Art studio class will focus on creating objects that will transform a variety of architectural spaces.</p><p>The major prepares students for careers in science and related fields, as well as graduate and professional schools (including pre-medical, pre-dental and pre-veterinary studies), while allowing students the flexibility to design the program that best suits their specific interests and career goals. In addition, biology majors are offered the opportunity to collaborate with faculty in research and laboratory instruction, to present exceptional work at professional meetings, and to assist in the maintenance of the 350-acre Biological Reserve and other departmental facilities. Information on studies in Pre-Health is provided in the "Special Programs and Opportunities" section of the catalog.</p><p>Writing is an integral component of science, and as such, the Biology Department understands that the development of writing skills is essential for all students who pursue the study of biology. The goal for our students is that they emerge as strong writers, able to construct cohesive bodies of written work in which they express clear, concise and logical arguments, supported by empirical evidence and/or information from appropriate sources. A developmental model of writing skills is tightly woven into the biology curriculum to achieve this goal. Our major core curriculum establishes the foundation of good writing practices. Basic grammatical expression is addressed in BIOL 210 -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, while BIOL 220 -Multicellular Life focuses on understanding the format of biological literature, culminating in BIOL 230 -Ecology and Evolution, where students write multiple fulllength papers. Taken sequentially, BIOL 220 -Multicellular Life and BIOL 230 -Ecology and Evolution serve as one of the W requirements for general education. In our advanced curriculum, students continue to explore more sophisticated levels of writing, including employing distinct disciplinary conventions and engaging with different genres applicable to biological writing. Students who undertake a senior research project write a comprehensive thesis of their work (counting as an additional W requirement), putting into practice the many writing skills that they have developed throughout the curriculum.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology Major</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Biology Majors</head><p>Students can pursue either a B.A. or B.S. degree in Biology (distinctions between the two degrees are outlined below). For either degree, students should aim to complete the three Biology core courses by the end of their second year: BIOL 210 -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, BIOL 220 -Multicellular Life, and BIOL 230 -Ecology and Evolution. Students who have completed comparable course work at other accredited institutions may petition to have such courses transferred to Denison and credited toward the major, at the discretion of the department. In contrast, students with credit-earning scores on Advanced Placement (4 or 5) or International Baccalaureate (6 or 7) tests in Biology will be granted academic credit for BIOL 100 -Modern Topics in Biology, but typically will be required to complete all three major core courses.</p><p>Majors must achieve a grade point average of 2.0 or higher across the three core courses (BIOL 210 -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, BIOL 220 -Multicellular Life, BIOL 230 -Ecology and Evolution) upon completion of the core sequence before proceeding to 300-level elective courses. Students who do not meet the GPA requirement must repeat one or more core courses to achieve the standard; the highest grade awarded for any repeated core course will be exclusively used in calculating the "biology core GPA", but all biology grades will be used to calculate the overall major GPA for graduation, as per university policy. This policy applies only to students pursuing a biology major; it does not apply to students pursuing the biology minor or other non-biology degrees.</p><p>The major additionally requires two semesters of introductory level chemistry (CHEM 131 -Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics and CHEM 132 -Organic Structure and Reactivity; grades of C or better are strongly recommended). CHEM 131 -Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics must be completed before undertaking 300-level electives, but CHEM 132 -Organic Structure and Reactivity can be taken concurrently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology</head><p>Biology majors subsequently complete five 300-level advanced courses. Any combination of advanced courses may be taken, but one of these electives must be designated a "biological diversity" course (see description below). BIOL 452 -Advanced Senior Research is credited as a 300-level course, but BIOL 361 -Directed Study, BIOL 362 -Directed Study), BIOL 363 -Independent Study, BIOL 364 -Independent Study), and BIOL 451 -Senior Research are not counted as 300-level advanced courses toward the requirements for the major. Students are encouraged to consult with an advisor in the Biology Department in order to select the most appropriate suite of advanced courses.</p><p>Biology majors preparing for medical school or most graduate programs are additionally advised to take CHEM 251 -Intermediate Organic Chemistry, and CHEM 258 -Intermediate Biochemistry, PHYS 121 -General Physics I and PHYS 122 -General Physics II), and two semesters of college-level math (e.g., MATH 130 -Essentials of Calculus, MATH 135 -Single Variable Calculus, or MATH 145 -Multi-variable Calculus) or MATH 120 -Elements of Statistics). These courses can count toward the "science cognate" requirement that is part of the B.S. degree (see requirements below).</p><p>Lastly, students majoring in Biology must satisfactorily complete BIOL 300 -Biology Assessment I (core curriculum assessment exam taken during the term immediately following completion of the biology core) and BIOL 301 -Biology Assessment II (senior interview; taken during the final semester prior to graduating) in order to fulfill the requirements for the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Biology</head><p>The requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology include a total of ten courses:</p><p>• three biology core courses (BIOL 210 -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, BIOL 220 -Multicellular Life, BIOL 230 -Ecology and Evolution),</p><p>• five 300-level biology courses (one of which must be a designated as a "biological diversity" course),</p><p>• and one year of introductory level chemistry (CHEM 131 -Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics and CHEM 132 -Organic Structure and Reactivity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Science in Biology</head><p>The requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree in Biology include a total of fourteen courses:</p><p>• three biology core courses (BIOL 210 -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, BIOL 220 -Multicellular Life, BIOL 230 -Ecology and Evolution),</p><p>• five 300-level biology courses (one of which must be designated a "biological diversity" course),</p><p>• one year of introductory level chemistry (CHEM 131 -Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics and CHEM 132 -Organic Structure and Reactivity),</p><p>• and four "science cognate" courses. The science cognate requirement is the lone distinction between the B.A. and B.S. degrees, serving as a means for B.S. majors to become more broadly trained in the sciences. Any non-biology course within the science division will count toward this requirement, as will any environmental studies (ENVS) science course, or Applied Anatomy HESS 202 -Applied Anatomy. Students are encouraged to select courses that "do" science, such as classes that include laboratory sections. No more than two courses within a single department or program can be used to fulfill this requirement (note that CHEM 131 -Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics and CHEM 132 -Organic Structure and Reactivity do not count toward the cognate requirement, nor do they count toward the "two courses per department" stipulation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology Minor</head><p>The requirements for the Biology Minor include a total of seven courses:</p><p>• three biology core courses • (BIOL 210 -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, BIOL 220 -Multicellular Life, BIOL 230 -Ecology and Evolution),</p><p>• three 300-level biology courses (one of which is a "biological diversity" course),</p><p>• and one semester of chemistry (CHEM 131 -Atoms </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest Biological Diversity Courses</head><p>Courses that fulfill the biological diversity requirement emphasize the importance of scientific studies at the level of the whole organism. In these courses students gain a holistic perspective on the study of organisms, explore a variety of living forms through a broad survey of taxa, and evaluate the role of phylogenetic history in taxonomy. Students also use careful observation to learn morphology and diagnostic traits, identify organisms into meaningful taxonomic units, and learn the principles of scientific nomenclature. The biological diversity courses that are regularly offered include: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students may complement their major in biology through off-campus study. Denison University is a member of several consortia that offer course credit through off-campus programs. Those with course offerings relevant to Biology students include:</p><p>• the School for Field Studies,</p><p>• the Organization of Tropical Studies,</p><p>• the Duke University Marine Laboratory,</p><p>• the Semester in Environmental Science,</p><p>• the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,</p><p>• the Institute for Study Abroad,</p><p>• Denmark's International Study <ref type="bibr">Program, and</ref> • the Associated Colleges of the Midwest Wilderness Field Station.</p><p>The Department of Biology is committed to awarding credit for courses offered through these programs that provide a sufficient focus on biological concepts and methods (lecture and laboratory). With prior approval from the department, a maximum of two off-campus courses may be counted toward the requirements of the major. The Richard C. and Linda G. Seale Scholarship provides support to qualified Denison students for participation in summer courses at the Duke University Marine Laboratory. Financial aid may be available for other off-campus programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education Credit in Biology</head><p>Students receive a lab science general education requirement by completing nearly any course offered by the Biology Department. While the 200-level courses are generally recommended for Biology and related majors, non-majors are welcome to take the initial biology major core course (BIOL 210 -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life), and they can also consider taking one of our non-majors courses. The various versions of Modern Topics in Biology (BIOL 100 -Modern Topics in Biology: lab science GE; BIOL 103 -Modern Topics in Biology: lab science and quantitative reasoning GEs; and BIOL 104 -Modern Topics in Biology: lab science and oral communication GEs), and BIOL 110 -Biology and Politics of Women's Health (lab science and oral communication GEs) are designed for students to explore scientific inquiry and biological concepts through specific topics in the instructor's area of expertise. In addition, students who have had extensive biology training in secondary school may petition the Biology department for BIOL 100 -Modern Topics in Biology credit without General Education credit. However, such petitions must be made before the completion of the student's third year at Denison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement</head><p>Students with credit-earning scores on Advanced Placement (4 or 5) or International Baccalaureate (6 or 7) tests in Biology will be granted academic credit for BIOL 100 -Modern Topics in Biology. However, as noted above, students granted such AP/IB credit typically will be required to complete all three major core courses for the major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOL 317 -Diversity of Microorganisms (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course examines the remarkable environmental, physiological, and metabolic diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, protists, algae, &amp; fungi). More specifically, diversity will be studied in terms of taxonomy and phylogeny, the ability of species to live in various environments, and the application of genomics in diversity. Emphasis will be placed on the reading of primary literature, and on using that information to make connections with class material. The structure of the course includes traditional lectures, class activities, and student presentations. Diversity of Microorganisms qualifies as a "biological diversity" course for the major and minor. Students may either take General Microbiology <ref type="bibr">(BIOL 315)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOL 321 -Plant Ecology (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course we will explore how plants interact with their environments and with other organisms, including man. We will begin at the individual level, learning how plants obtain resources from abiotic sources and through mutualistic interactions with bacteria and fungi. We will also consider how the theories of plant community ecology developed in the early 20th century and why they are pertinent today. Students will also have the opportunity to read and critique primary literature from leading journals in the field. Finally, we will develop several projects to be completed at the Denison Biological Reserve during the term for lab projects. These projects will be student-inspired and driven, with the hopes that they will contribute to our understanding of our immediate surroundings at Denison. Prerequisite(s): Biology core or consent, and CHEM 131 and CHEM 132 (or concurrently), or CHEM majors -BIOL 150 or BIOL 220, and BIOL 202 or BIOL 230 and CHEM 300 (or concurrently).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOL 324 -Developmental Biology (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Every multicellular organism begins its life as a single cell. Developmental biology is the study of the progression from this single cell to a complex, multicellular organism. Recently the powerful tools of molecular biology have linked the fields of embryology and genetics to reveal how cells, tissues, organs, and organisms develop. Especially striking is the conservation of molecules and mechanisms that underlie developmental processes in different organisms. This course provides an overview of the major features of early embryonic development in animals, and the mechanisms (molecular mechanism when known) that underlie them. We focus on two major aspects of developmental biology: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> How is the basic body plan established? How does the basic organization of the embryo arise from the fertilized egg? What are the cellular mechanisms underlying morphogenesis and the appearance of pattered structures in the embryo? (2) How do parts become different in the embryo? Prerequisite(s): Biology core or consent, and CHEM 131 and CHEM 132 (or concurrently), or CHEM majors -BIOL 150 or BIOL 220, and BIOL 201 or BIOL 210, and CHEM 300 (or concurrently).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOL 326 -Plant Evolution and Reproduction (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course we will explore the evolutionary relationships and histories among the major groups of plants, both terrestrial and aquatic. We will pay particular attention to their modes of reproduction and the structures that facilitate gamete production and dispersal. We will learn how plant physiology and developmental mechanisms have allowed taxa to persist or make major transitions among different environments over time.</p><p>Class reading material will consist of the primary literature and will be presented by students every week. For the laboratory component we will have one overnight trip to Hocking Hills on a weekend in September to examine and identify plants in their natural habitat, as well as shorter trips to Blackhand Gorge and the Dawes Arboretum. We will also plan together and complete a semester-long project on the effects of environment on the development of reproductive structures in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Plant Evolution and Reproduction qualifies as a "biological diversity" course for the major. Prerequisite(s): Biology core or consent, CHEM 131 and CHEM 132 (or concurrently), or CHEM majors -BIOL 150 or <ref type="bibr">BIOL 220,</ref><ref type="bibr">and BIOL 201 or BIOL 210,</ref><ref type="bibr">and BIOL 202 or BIOL 230,</ref><ref type="bibr">and CHEM 300 (or concurrently)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOL 327 -Biology of Insects (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course we will explore the world of insects and their interactions with other species. Our central focus will be to survey insect diversity and explore how various orders, families, and species are adapted through evolution to their specific environment. But we will also use that diversity as a lens through which we will examine major concepts in biology. Topics of discussion will include the following: plant-insect coevolution, mating systems, anti-predator defenses, eusocial behavior, parasitism, disease transmittance, insect conservation, and control of agricultural pests.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Black Studies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Guidelines</head><p>The Black Studies Program invites students to investigate the Black experience as it manifests in Africa, North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, and other parts of the African diaspora. While the Program's primary focus is the study of the Black experience in North America, fundamental to this enterprise is a recognition of the triangular relationship between Africa, the Caribbean and the United States.</p><p>The Program seeks to serve the general needs of the college by providing course offerings across the full range of academic divisions. At the same time, it is designed to meet the specialized interests of students through an interdisciplinary major and minor. Therefore, many appropriate courses are found under the rubric of other departments. Black Studies majors and minors are encouraged to complete some portion of their undergraduate education abroad; many off-campus study opportunities available through Denison are relevant to Black Studies and help majors and minors gain global perspectives and experiences.</p><p>Through our courses, we teach students to write using various disciplinary frameworks to place Black life, experiences, and culture at the center of their analyses or to interrogate societal dynamics that shape, and are shaped, by Black life and culture. To do this, our students' writing might include personal narratives, formal essays, or theoretical discourses. Our aim is to support students in selecting the mode of written expression and developing the tools to utilize those modes of expression in ways that reveal, articulate, and analyze Black life and culture and the relevant dynamics of society. Other requirements include the completion of one course in which the primary subject matter is Africa or the Caribbean and Latin America. This requirement is designed to encourage students to confront, in a substantial manner, the triangular relationship between the Black experience in Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America, and North America.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Black Studies Minor</head><p>The minor in Black Studies requires a minimum of 24 credit hours.</p><p>Students who wish to be awarded a minor in Black Studies must complete the three core courses:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Code Title</head><p>BLST <ref type="formula">235</ref>  Additionally, students are required to complete one Black Studies course in which the primary subject matter is Africa or the Caribbean and Latin America, plus a senior research project in the form of a directed study that seeks to correlate Black Studies with some aspect of the student's major field. Although it is not required, students are encouraged to include a field experience component in the senior research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLST 102 -Black Women's Lives: Autobiography As Protest (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The purpose of this course is to explore personal narrative and autobiography as texts of resistance in Black women's lives. The course will use the multiple genres of autobiography such as poetry, essay, short narrative, memoir and major autobiographical works to illustrate Black women's resistance to race, class, and gender subordination or other forms of marginalization and oppression in their lives and in society.</p><p>These autobiographical texts will be paired with select readings from women's studies and black studies to provide students with the analytical tools to identify how these texts function as forms of personal, social, political or institutional protest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemistry and Biochemistry</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has two primary goals, which in practice are tightly interrelated. First, we seek to promote a level of scientific literacy and chemical understanding among all students taking courses in the department that will contribute to the University's fundamental mission "to inspire and educate our students to become autonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents and active citizens of a democratic society." Secondly, we will provide a rigorous and comprehensive program in chemistry and biochemistry suitable for those students pursuing careers in science and technology. In its courses the department seeks to progressively develop skills in building qualitative and quantitative interpretation of chemical phenomena, in experimental analysis and design, and in written and oral communication of scientific ideas. Graduates of this program, grounded in a welldeveloped molecular worldview, are expected to explain the behavior of chemical and biological systems based on physical models. The department is also deeply committed to sustaining a vigorous and diverse range of collaborative student-faculty research. A community of mutual support among students, faculty, and staff is a vital element in achieving our goals.</p><p>The Chemistry and Biochemistry curriculum provides courses that are designed to enable students, as contributing professionals and engaged citizens, to deal effectively with a world increasingly dominated by the ideas and methods of modern science. Majors are qualified for immediate employment in industry. However, many elect to attend graduate school in chemistry, biochemistry, and related areas, or enter schools of medicine, dentistry, or engineering. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry Majors</head><p>The department offers three options for degrees in Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry: Bachelor of Science (B.S.) programs in Chemistry and in Biochemistry that provide a rigorous course of study in preparation for professional careers, graduate work in chemistry/biochemistry or related fields, or professional schools (medical, dental, pharmacology, veterinary); and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) program in Chemistry for students intending to pursue fields such as dentistry, medicine, secondary school teaching or other areas requiring a strong chemistry background. Earning a B.A. degree does not preclude a professional scientific career, although an additional year of undergraduate study may be required for admission to some graduate programs. The department also offers a minor in Chemistry.</p><p>Our program requires courses at the introductory (100), intermediate <ref type="bibr">(200 and 300)</ref>, and advanced (400) levels. We expect that majors will complete the required 300-level courses by the end of their junior year. The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry recommends strongly that students earn a C or better in each of the core courses, CHEM 131 -Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics, CHEM 132 -Organic Structure and Reactivity, CHEM 251 -Intermediate Organic Chemistry and CHEM 258 -Intermediate Biochemistry, before proceeding to 300-level courses. 400-level courses, to be counted toward the major, need to be taken after the prerequisites. Any request to waive this requirement must come prior to taking the course. We strongly encourage all majors to have an advisor in the department.</p><p>Students pursuing any of the three majors are required to complete the following nine common courses plus the additional courses listed for each program:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Code Title</head><p>Two introductory courses in the principles of chemistry: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest</head><p>Students interested in teaching should consult with faculty in the Department of Education. Faculty and staff in the Department of Education assist students in creating individually designed plans for obtaining licensure through a range of programs after graduation. Students interested in pursuing a B.A. degree in Chemistry before pursuing a teaching career are strongly encouraged to take all three 300level Chemistry course options (as described below).</p><p>The Chemistry courses listed above must be taken at Denison with the following exception: the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry recognizes the valuable contribution that off-campus study can provide to a broad liberal arts education, so one course in the major at the 300level or higher may be taken at another institution, providing that prior approval is received from the department. Students considering study off-campus are encouraged to discuss these plans with their academic advisor early in their Denison careers. The department understands that transfer students, students who adopt a chemistry or biochemistry major after the first year, and students who study off-campus may have unique needs; we encourage them to contact us so that we can work together to help them achieve their academic objectives.</p><p>Approved eye protection is required in all laboratory courses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, social and intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires us to break away from the notion that our native language is the most natural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience. An education can start with the discovery that all words are purely conventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions, articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning another language contributes to our education by intimately exploring cultural and linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it means to be human in today's world.</p><p>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. When students take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the target language in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of its courses because it believes that students can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode of expression.</p><p>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encourages integrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Courses in cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, also present multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectual experience.</p><p>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroad with programs approved by Denison should consult members of the Department and the Office of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-Campus Programs). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of the language are provided by the Language and Culture Program, language tables, international films, club meetings, and similar activities sponsored by the Department.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communication</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>The Communication Department offers a rigorous and robust curriculum that addresses three overarching areas of study: <ref type="bibr">Relational Communication, Rhetoric, and Media Studies.</ref> In the tradition of the liberal arts, we encourage students to take courses from all three areas of study to appreciate the complexity of communication. It is our commitment to educate autonomous thinkers who use moral discernment when addressing the issues of our time through a curriculum that engages students in intersecting media, texts, and interactions when analyzing meaning-making in any given context.</p><p>Our curriculum emphasizes cognitive complexity in processes of inquiry, analysis, reflection, writing, and speaking.</p><p>• At the 100-level, courses introduce topics relevant to the study of communication and ways of thinking about communication in the world;</p><p>• 200-level courses introduce theoretical perspectives, assisting students in formulating and investigating questions appropriate to the discipline as taught at Denison;</p><p>• 300-level courses explore theory and research that helps students utilize the power of communication perspectives and methodologies on topics important to them and to society;</p><p>• 400-level courses engage students in developing proficiency in the study of communication and producing new knowledge that is socially significant, ethically informed, and fundamental to cultivating one's self as a life-long learner.</p><p>Throughout the curriculum we generate opportunities in many ways for students to practice what they are learning. Students practice the discipline through structured opportunities that promote original research in senior seminars, conference presentations, journal publications, and summer research. In terms of less traditional modes of practice students have multiple opportunities to address publics through speaking and writing, ethically engaging with other students from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, using technology as agents rather than consumers, and interrogating and rethinking the performance of the self. Insofar as "practicing" the discipline involves mindful awareness and reflection on the processes of communication that continually surround students, the department does this as a matter of course. </p></div>

Is "public address"-the art of understanding, composing, and executing ethical oral communication-still relevant in an era of social media, political polarization, and contentious discourse? This course will teach students, through the framework of rhetorical history and theory, the concepts and skills needed to refine their efficacy as oral communicators in a variety of settings. Communication as a liberal art steeped in the traditions of rhetoric will be emphasized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 108 -Introduction to Writing for Print and Online (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course focuses on the fundamentals of reporting and writing nonfiction for print. Topics include storytelling and narrative, lead writing, point of view, information gathering, interviewing, and more. The class aims to help students develop overall research, writing, and thinking skills; questioning, listening, and interviewing skills; and a more sophisticated understanding of print journalism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 111 -Ethics and Society (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course explores communication ethics from philosophical and applied perspectives in a variety of social contexts. Weekly theoretical discussions are grounded in applied cases that revolve around issues such as whistleblowing, free speech, group think, lying, confidentiality, privacy, coercion, and consensus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 115 -Special Topics in Communication (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Special Topics in Communication provides a venue in which to explore in some depth an aspect or issue related to communication study. May be taken more than once by majors or non-majors to address special topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 122 -Argumentation (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course students will explore the art of inquiry and advocacy known as argumentation. In order to become better audiences and practitioners of argument, students will consider the nature of argument, the building blocks of argument and the practice of argument in public debate.</p><p>COMM 125 -Relating Through Narrating (4 Credit Hours) Social interactions saturate our everyday lives-from talking with close friends, family members and acquaintances to engaging in broader publics. Narrative threads tie these interactions together, shaping how individuals negotiate their identities, relational boundaries, expectations, and power differences. This course examines narrative's relational qualities, prompting questions such as: How is narrative embodied, conceived and enacted in our everyday interactions and relationships? Furthermore, how do the meanings constructed through narrative create conditions for cultivating meaningful connections with others? Course readings will explore theoretical understandings and practical implications of narrative across an assortment of relational settings. Assignments, involving both creative and critical practices, will entail introspective inquiry, relational analyses, and storied presentations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 126 -Media Structures (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course is designed to initiate students into critical and intelligent debates surrounding the issue of communication and its pertinence to mass, modern and postmodern societies. We consider specifically how mass communication has been defined from the 19th through to the beginning of the 21st Century and how this history is relevant to issues of mass society today. Given that almost every person in America is affected by mass culture and media, we will discuss through the lectures, discussions and exercises a number of controversial suggestions, critical paradigms and mainstream assumptions. Throughout the course, students will be expected to understand these approaches and be able to both criticize and recognize the legitimacy of these models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 130 -Freedom of Speech (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Freedom of Speech introduces students to the dimensions of oral discourse both as practiced in a community of citizens and theoretically viewed through various legal interpretations. We will examine how the first amendment rights have been defended and impinged within academic settings, throughout historical periods of political unrest and war, and in daily exchanges marked by hate, defamation and obscenity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 140 -The Politics of Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The terrain of popular culture has historically been a site of contentious struggles and debates. For long (as is the case even today) one's cultural "taste" was a significant factor in determining one's standing in the social hierarchy. Debates about "high" vs "low" culture and about what cultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a community have involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.</p><p>Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us with a lens through which to understand historical social changes. It also allows us to appreciate that several contemporary debates (for instance about the cultural meaning of Hip Hop or Reality TV) have historical precedents that inform and precede them. This introductory course seeks to trace those debates from their origins in middle century Europe to their culmination into contemporary battles over popular culture. In so doing it seeks to politicize popular culture and unravel the competing ideologies and worldviews embedded within it. We begin by reading some of the prominent theorists of "high" culture and then problematize their arguments by studying the challenges to them (most stridently posed by the Birmingham school of scholars). We will then use this historical debate to inform our understanding of the contemporary world of popular culture in America. In the process we will also learn various ways to analyze and critique objects of popular culture around us that we often unthinkingly consume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 147 -Introduction to Media Literacy (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>While most of us are proficient consumers of visual electronic mediawe have the speed of symbol-recognition and comprehension skills to be adept "readers" -few of us have learned to bring to that reading the critical skills we learn in the study of literature, music or art. This course examines how sound and images construct the "realities" that media presumably represent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 205 -Global Communication (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The purpose of the course is to acquire an understanding of the key concepts and ideas about globalization and the role the mass media plays in the process. While the term "globalization" has been bandied about among the popular press, academic and the business community, this course will attempt to contextualize and ground the concept by developing a multiperspectival approach to some of the political, economic and social processes that have been associated with the development of a world communication system. Throughout the course, we will examine the growing centrality that the mass media and information technologies play in our daily lives and the ways in which they contribute to or hinder our daily practices of identity, community and culture in a global context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 211 -Thinking with Ethics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course will help students discover how to better recognize ethical questions when they stumble across them and to explore how, when we do, we lean into them rather than turn away. What makes it possible for us to think, listen and speak with ethics? We will explore a range of public and private ethical questions that arise in the everyday lives of college students such as, </p></div>

May be taken more than once by majors or non-majors to address special topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 219 -Environmental Communication (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>"The "green" and "organic" language that is marking everything from our magazine racks to our grocery shelves, the increasing number of farmers' markets throughout urban and rural areas, and the increasing local discussions of the dangers of "fracking" serve as evidence that the current discourses in and around environmental care are not a fad. Rather, environmental awareness and practices comprise a "central issue of our time" that is laden with cultural concerns of ideological and material differences, power, privilege and marginality. This course will begin with an in-depth exploration of the philosophy that communication is the means through which we construct, participate, and convey the cultures we are a part of and therefore, is central to the creation of the kind of world we want to live in. We will then turn our attention to an analysis of current social, organizational and political discourses on the environment and our responsibility, or not, in its protection.".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 345 -Cultural Globalization and Identity (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course will critically engage with the phenomenon of the global circulation of culture. It will seek to understand the consequences of the process whereby texts, ideas and images that for long remained confined to their locations of origin are today increasingly mobile and de-territorialized. Objects of popular culture such as television, cinema and music, are circulating and being consumed around the world and are helping challenge the traditional markers of human identity such as nation, culture and language. While they are allowing individuals to imagine alternatives to existing realities they are also engendering a backlash against a perceived imposition of new ideas, values and culture. This course will seek to familiarize students with these ongoing changes and the conflicts over cultural and national identity that it has given rise to. We will begin with arguments that present a totalizing view of this process (the Cultural Imperialism thesis) and then over the course of the semester complicate and nuance those arguments by introducing agency and empowerment for the consumers of global culture. We will do this by closely studying actual case studies (from reality TV in Saudi Arabia or McDonalds in Japan) in order to understand the stakes involved in the struggle to define and "protect" national and cultural identity. At the end of this semester long course students should have gained a deep understanding of why the process of global flow of culture is a deeply contentious and political phenomenon. Understanding these conflicts through the lens of identity will help students complicate that term as well as interrogate their views about their own identity. Prerequisite(s): COMM 280 and COMM 290, or consent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance Mission Statement</head><p>We believe that vital dance artists and scholars develop from independent thinkers who are committed to cultivating a personal aesthetic and artistic focus, and who resourcefully engage in original research and commit to the construction of knowledge. Our mission supports the development of student artists/scholars who are informed citizens and responsible agents of positive change in a world where the moving arts are essential. Our goal of exposing students to cutting edge and experimental dance practices from diverse cultures and with global perspectives is embedded in our curriculum and ideology. The focus of our movement practices intentionally centralizes Modern/Postmodern Dance and African/African-Diasporan forms, shifting the paradigm of dance education away from a ballet-centered model. The integration of embodied practices with scholarly inquiry is integral to our mission.</p><p>Writing within the Major: Both dance scholars and dance artists come to better understand their ideas and those of others through writing. We focus our teaching of writing on experiential and conceptual ideas prompted by, and about, the body, to generate precise description and sophisticated analysis. Our aim is to hone students' observation and reflection skills, and ability to document these intelligently and concisely through writing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Learning Goals</head><p>Students will be able to:</p><p>• Broaden perspectives through risk taking, embracing ambiguity, and exposure to a range of choreography and performance.</p><p>• Synthesize knowledge and generate new, independent and original theoretical and creative projects.</p><p>• Demonstrate multifaceted practical, analytical, and reflexive understanding of languages, history, and the cultural significance of dance's various bodily-kinesthetic forms.</p><p>• Employ various methods for describing, discerning, analyzing, labeling, and categorizing human movement.</p><p>• Be proficient movers in a combination of aspects of embodied movement practices, at the intermediate level, at a minimum.</p><p>• Demonstrate a fluency in disciplinary vocabularies both orally and written that is evident across coursework and utilized within the body of student's senior research.</p><p>• Use basic 21st century technology including digital equipment and software applications in order to access and document artwork, and to use it appropriately to market or create within those media. 36 credits minimum The Bachelor of Arts degree in Dance reflects a philosophy that integrates principles of theory and practice resulting in the discovery of an original voice. "Movement Practices" courses engage students in dance technique and performance work, and in learning and applying physical skills to the creation and reconstruction of African/Diasporan and modern/postmodern dance. "Dance Studies" courses emphasize creating, moving, recording, reading and writing, exposing the fundamental patterns of skilled movement acquisition, generating close textual analysis of specific movement forms, practicing dance making, and culturally contextualizing the diversity of dance forms. Advanced Studies courses provide opportunities to deepen and integrate through independent research. In all courses, the boundaries between practice and theory are purposefully blurred, indicating our commitment to a liberal arts curriculum rather than a conservatory model. Denison University works to make study abroad possible for all students. Studying dance abroad allows students to experience another culture and way of life through the lens of movement and dance studies. These opportunities integrate the department's mission and make possible a deepening understanding and expansive perspective on movement in a global context. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study office to explore their options.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 284 -Choreographic Investigations (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course focuses on the creation and presentation of assigned short movement studies that focus on principles of dance composition for the concert stage. Past focus has been on the relationship of movement to sound, interrogating the use of music in modern dance history. Through solo, duet and group forms students learn about the compositional elements of space, time, dynamics, flow and shape, discover their own unique movement style, become familiar with how the body works and how it can be expressive, and expand their own definitions of dance. Three fundamental aspects of creative work in movement will be emphasized: movement invention, compositional structure, and creating meaning. A desire to take risks and be transformed, a willingness to use the body as an expressive tool, an eagerness to learn, and willingness to question personal choices are essential for success in this class. An interest, ability and a desire to be physically challenged to work toward expressive clarity in movement, is assumed. Prerequisite(s): 100 level movement course.</p></div>

Through various exercises and assignments, students examine concepts such as: balance, walking, masking, rhythm, repetition, improvisation, standing and sitting as tools for composing. Students investigate the manipulation of space, time and energy, and create source material from personal movement exploration, structured improvisation, master classes, and guided exercises. Other course tools include videos, journals, art and community feedback. Ultimately, the course aims to resource the aesthetics of African movement (kinesthetic, philosophical, linear and nonlinear) as methods for composing solo, duet, and group work. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or permission of instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 286 -Improvisation in Performance (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Improvisation in Performance focuses on the act of spontaneous choreography and composition though solo and ensemble work with the goal of understanding and experiencing improvisation in performance work. Students learn Ensemble Thinking techniques and are exposed to Contact Improvisation. Texts include performances in theatre and dance both here and in Columbus, as well as selected readings. Students discover, through these, what artists and scholars consider to be the perimeters of performance, the definition of improvisation, and the unique potential of movement. Through a consistent practice, students fine-tune their own ideas about these and work to discover their own movement preferences and capabilities. Students risk the act of moving, revealing, performing, and improvising. The semester culminates in an improvised performance work developed by the class. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 287 -Site-Based Composition (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course, students study and research composition for the human body in relation to its environment, placing and shaping the body in juxtaposition or in relation to specific and chosen spaces. We study sitebased performance works by contemporary artists and learn about the issues surrounding this kind of work. The underlying principles of this course are the formal elements that inform the aesthetics of composition, noticing how these basic compositional elements create tension, drama and meaning and can point to content that is inherent in the form and in relation to the environment. The final project is the creation of a sitebased movement/performance work in a chosen site in the Denison Community/Granville Village area that is presented at the end of the semester. An interest in and curiosity about the body as the subject of creative work is essential. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 288 -Text/Voice-based Composition (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course engages text, voice, and theatrical material to investigate dance making and performance. Students explore words, poetry, music and sound to craft and support movement. Through various exercises and assignments, the course examines motifs such as: speaking while moving; chanting while moving; words into movement; and words as music as methods for composing. Work outside the classroom is required. Examples include concert attendance, creative writing, weekly journal writing, and video essays. Ultimately, the course aims to overlap the boundaries of theatre and dance to explore movement composition. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 294 -Special Topics in Dance (2-4 Credit Hours)</head><p>From time to time, according to the expertise of the faculty and the interest of the students, special courses that can address intensive study are arranged and offered.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Guidelines</head><p>Global connectivity and innovative technologies generate vast amounts of information that contribute to our understanding and evaluation of nature, human behavior, institutions, society, and beyond. This explosion of evidence to present and address problems is informing major decisions in academe, government, and the private sector. Those with an ability to work with quantitative and qualitative data, big and small, to identify puzzles, consider probing questions, evaluate claims, make inferences, and posit answers will be well positioned to expand knowledge, influence policy, and to be decision makers of the future.</p><p>The major in data analytics will provide you with a solid core of mathematics and computer science, followed by specially designed data analytics courses. All of these courses are project-based, employing analytic methods, as well as ethics and interdisciplinary research skills, practiced in a variety of application domains. In addition, you will take the skills learned in the classroom and practice them in a research experience or internship in a professional setting, and then pursue a capstone project informed by this experience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analytics Major</head><p>The major in Data Analytics (DA) requires a minimum of 46 credits of coursework and an approved summer experience. The detailed requirements are organized in three parts, as follows.</p><p>(a) First, students must complete the following 34 credits of core coursework: (c) Third, students must acquire some depth in a domain of Data Analytics. They will then carry this disciplinary knowledge into their summer experience and senior seminar. Students may satisfy this requirement in one of two ways. First, they may choose to take the designated set of courses from one of the following departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Code Title</head><p>Anthropology Alternatively, a student may submit an individualized 3-4 course domain elective plan, which must include at least one analytics-intensive course, to be considered for approval by the Data Analytics Program Committee. A successful one-page proposal will clearly describe the student's desired learning goals and how the proposed courses together achieve these goals. The proposal should also demonstrate the feasibility of completing the proposed courses in the time remaining before graduation. Proposals must be submitted prior to the end of the sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest</head><p>Data Analytics majors wishing to study abroad should do so in the spring semester of their junior year. Data Analytics courses are not normally taken at other institutions, although on rare occasions, a suitable substitute may be found for DA 350 -Advanced Methods for Data Analytics.</p><p>If a student uses AP credit to skip a course in their chosen domain area, that course must be replaced with a suitable substitute, determined in cooperation with the appropriate department.</p><p>We recommend that students who wish to acquire deeper technical skills in data analytics and/or prepare for graduate work in data science, take additional courses in <ref type="bibr">Mathematics</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 101 -Introduction to Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Many of the most pressing problems in the world can be addressed with data. We are awash in data and modern citizenship demands that we become literate in how to interpret data, what assumptions and processes are necessary to analyze data, as well as how we might participate in generating our own analyses and presentations of data. Consequently, data analytics is an emerging field with skills applicable to a wide variety of disciplines. This course introduces analysis, computation, and presentation concerns through the investigation of data driven puzzles in wide array of fields -political, economic, historical, social, biological, and others. No previous experience is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 200 -Data Analytics Colloquium (1 Credit Hour)</head><p>The Data Analytics colloquium involves three central learning components. 1) regular engagement with guest presentations and community activities in data analytics, 2) group discussion featuring critical analysis and connection of themes found in the guest presentations and in related data analytics topics, and 3) preparation and refinement of professional communication skills necessary for the required internship component of the data analytics major. This course provides an opportunity for students to connect on data analytics ideas and applications, using a range of perspectives that may or may not be normally encountered in a traditional course. Students will develop the knowledge, skills, and methods they need to progress to more advanced learning, while also creating bridges with members of the data analytics community within and outside of Denison. The course must be taken twice by majors: once as a sophomore, and again as either a junior or senior. Prerequisite(s): DA 101 (may be taken concurrently).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 210 -Data Systems (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course provides a broad perspective on the access, structure, storage, and representation of data. It encompasses traditional database systems, but extends to other structured and unstructured repositories of data and their access/acquisition in a client-server model of Internet computing. Also developed are an understanding of data representations amenable to structured analysis, and the algorithms and techniques for transforming and restructuring data to allow such analysis. Prerequisite(s): CS 109 or CS 110 or CS 111 or CS 112. Crosslisting: CS 181.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 220 -Applied Statistics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Statistics is the science of reasoning from data. This course will introduce the fundamental concepts and methods of statistics using calculus-based probability. Topics include a basic study of probability models, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, categorical data analysis, ANOVA, multivariate regression analysis, logistic regression, and other statistical methods. Scopes of conclusion, model building and validation principles, and common methodological errors are stressed throughout. Prerequisite(s): Either MATH 145 or both MATH 135 and DA 101. Crosslisting: MATH 220.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 301 -Practicum in Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Utilizing Denison as a model of society, this practicum will explore questions of collective import through the analysis of new and existing sources of data. A problem-driven approach will lead to the acquisition of new, appropriate data analytic skills, set in an ethical context that carefully considers the implications of data display and policy recommendations on community members. A significant component of the course is working in teams to collect and analyze new data to address a puzzle or problem for a real client. Groups or organizations that serve as clients may come from the campus community, local non-profits, or businesses and groups across the region or country. The practicum also develops exposure to policymaking, implementing data driven insights, program management theory, interacting with leaders and professionals, and developing presentation skills appropriate for professional communication with the public. Though a significant learning opportunity itself, this course should also be seen as a prelude to a community internship or research experience in the post-junior year summer. Students should be aware that some off-campus travel may be necessary to meet with specific clients as necessary. Final presentations to the client, in lieu of a scheduled exam, requires flexibility and scheduling outside of the exam schedule. Prerequisite(s): DA 101, DA 210 and DA 220, or consent of instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 350 -Advanced Methods for Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course is designed to develop students' understanding of the cutting-edge methods and algorithms of data analytics and how they can be used to answer questions about real-world problems. These methods can learn from existing data to make and evaluate predictions. The course will examine both supervised and unsupervised methods and will include topics such as dimensionality reduction, machine learning techniques, handling missing data, and prescriptive analytics. Denison Short-Term Seminars are typically 2-credit courses (credit applied in the fall semester following completion of a summer or break experience). The short-term seminars are advertised in the fall semester and are enrolled via contacting the instructor. Students pay all costs unless they are determined to have very significant need by the Financial Aid Office. Those with very significant need will pay a deposit fee, normally $500, to enroll in the experience.</p><p>Every effort is made to make Denison Seminars, Denison Short-Term Seminars, and other faculty-led travel seminar opportunities affordable for every student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest</head><p>Preference is given to sophomore and junior students who have not had a prior Denison Seminar and are not concurrently enrolled in a Denison Seminar. Students who have already taken a Denison Seminar or are enrolled in one may take a second or subsequent seminar if there are seats available in it after the close of the registration period. In addition, students may petition the Academic Standing Board to request that they be given, as an exception, the same preference in registration as those students who have not had a seminar even if the petitioner has taken a seminar before.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EAST 211 -Modern East Asia at War (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This seminar covers in depth the history of East Asia (including Vietnam) in 1937-1954, a period characterized by violence, upheaval, suffering, and death on an almost unimaginable scale. The Japanese empire's cataclysmic clash with the Republic of China and (eventually) the United States left Japan in ruins and under American occupation, China and Vietnam in the grip of Communist revolutions, and Korea divided between American and Soviet spheres of influence. The consequences of these events led to America's war in Vietnam and still define and bedevil East Asia's geopolitics today. Our readings will include some of the most significant recent scholarship on five conflicts: the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Pacific War, the Chinese Civil War, the French Indochina War, and the Korean War. Although we will read much about politics, diplomacy, and military campaigns, our focus will just as often be on the experiences and stories of ordinary people caught in extraordinarily harrowing times.</p></div>

Although Japan's occupation of Korea began in 1910, this course will begin its consideration of this topic in 1890 because the Japanese political and social mechanisms that led to fascist militarist control in the 1930s have their origins at least as far back as 1890. This course fulfills the Modern Core requirement for the East Asian Studies major/minor.</p><p>EAST 221 -Contemporary Japan: In Search of the "Real" Japan (4 Credit Hours) Japan often conjures images steeped in tradition such as samurai warriors, sumo wrestlers, and geisha clad in kimono. At the same time, however, contemporary Japan is just as easily associated with businessmen, anime, automobiles, and high technology. How have "tradition" and "change" fueled competing visions of Japan what it means to be "Japanese"? How does one go about reconciling these conflicting views? How have these debates evolved over time? How have variously situated individuals and groups in society negotiated shifting circumstances? These questions will be at the heart of this seminar as we consider case studies from different segments of Japanese society. A range of material will be treated as "texts" for analysis and discussion including anime, manga, literary works, and films as well as ethnographic scholarship on Japanese society.

Indigenous nationalism naturally emerged in each country or region Japan had occupied: China, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In many countries the postcolonial hatred of outside domination was the greatest force at play. The freezing winds of the Cold War generated by the United States and the USSR had to find support within this nationalist anger. The course will end with a look at today's post-Cold War trade networks in East Asia that are less dependent on Japan and its inseparable ally, the United States. In this required course, senior majors will research and prepare the senior thesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>The purpose of the economics curriculum is to educate students in the nature and uses of economic reasoning. We are an economics department that values diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives on economic analysis and its application. We are cognizant of the importance of the other social and natural sciences, the arts, and the humanities to a more complete understanding of human society. Our curriculum introduces students to a core body of economic knowledge and to research skills, integrating disciplinary education with the liberal arts mission of the university. Economics majors develop the ability to think analytically and creatively about complex economic issues and policy choices facing our global society.</p><p>The content of our curriculum is tiered. In introductory courses students learn the basic principles of economics. In intermediate courses students develop their understanding of microeconomic, macroeconomic, and econometric theory. The 200-level electives give students an opportunity early in their careers to use introductory theory to better understand their world. The 400-level electives give students an opportunity to study in depth, a particular field of economics through application of the requisite basic skills, and appropriate theoretical models and empirical methods. These courses primarily focus on national and international concerns, public policies, and controversies in economic theory and policy.</p><p>Good economic writing represents good economic thinking. The Economics Department encourages students to cultivate the habits of good economic writing by requiring students to take one elective course that satisfies the department's writing requirement. Students are expected to use the vocabulary and theories of economics to correctly make cogent evidence-based arguments.</p><p>The Department of Economics supports students who globalize their education by completing some portion of their undergraduate education abroad. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study Office to explore their options. If a student studies abroad then: <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 201 -Economic Justice (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course investigates the various normative yardsticks that economists use when assessing public policy and the appropriate role for government in the economy. We will be concerned with questions like: What is economic freedom? Are individual property rights absolute? What are the differences, in terms of questions of justice, among slave labor, wage labor, and the work of an independent or cooperative partner? What is a fair distribution of economic resources? Is economic justice fulfilled by: any distribution of income and wealth produced by market processes; an equal distribution of income and wealth; or a partially adjusted market distribution? The definitions of economic justice and fairness are perhaps the most controversial questions in political economy, and this course is designed for you to gain some insight into the contending perspectives that economists have advocated. We will examine natural rights theories, the contested meaning of equality of opportunity, and the potential tradeoff between economic efficiency and the redistribution of income and wealth. We will examine perspectives ranging from libertarian to socialist. Prerequisite(s): ECON 101 and ECON 102.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 202 -Economic Growth and Environmental Sustainability (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Economic growth is traditionally perceived as the solution to the socio-economic ills of poverty, unemployment and more generally underdevelopment. However, economic growth is also accompanied by increased pressure on and, over time, deterioration of the natural environment. The objective of this course is to explore the relationship between economic growth and the natural environment. While the concept of economic growth occupies a central place in economic policymaking, we will discuss whether economic growth is compatible with the sustainable-development worldview adopted by the UN and many other global and local economic actors. Sustainable development emphasizes the need to embark upon a development path that not only takes into account the environmental, social and economic needs of the present generation, but also those of future ones. Prerequisite(s): ECON 101 and ECON 102.</p></div>

The first part of the course studies the measurement and context of American income inequality. We will end the first section of the course with an analysis of economic mobility in the US. The second section of the course will look at a variety of explanations for increasing income inequality. We will examine how the key themes of technical change, de-industrialization, immigration and globalization shaped the American economy over the last several decades. The primary focus of the first two sections will be upon income inequalities arising from changes in the ideological, demographic, macroeconomic and institutional context. In addition, we will investigate the impact of these trends on the middle class and different segments of the labor force. Finally, we will discuss why inequality might matter and how the trends discussed in the course could shape America's future and discuss whether and what policy changes might be needed. Prerequisite(s): ECON 101 and ECON 102.</p></div>

The course may also examine the ideas of economists who have criticized the marginalist orientation of economic theory and instead advocated a more social and institutionalist approach to understanding economic phenomena and behavior. Prerequisite(s): ECON 301.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 411 -Monetary Theory (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The role money plays in determining economic outcomes, such as the level of employment, the aggregate price level, and the rate of economic growth, is one of the more controversial issues in economics. To get a handle on these controversies, this course explores the institutional structure of the U.S. monetary system, including the Federal Reserve, the body charged with the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. Then, the course compares and contrasts different perspectives on the role money plays in economic activity. The goal is to combine knowledge of the institutional structure of the U.S. monetary system with an understanding of the various theoretical perspectives on monetary theory in order to gain some insight about the best policy options for achieving full employment, price stability, and financial stability. The course also addresses the various economic challenges faced by central banks around the world, including Japan, China, the European Union, and developing countries. Prerequisite(s): ECON 301.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 417 -The Eurozone: Optimal Currency Area or Incomplete Monetary Union? (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Before 2010, the Eurozone was hailed as the first successful multinational, large-scale model of monetary and currency union. Several countries in many regions of the world (such as South America, the Middle East, West Africa) have been considering following in the steps of the European Union (EU) by creating similar currency areas in the near future. However, the financial crisis of the late 2000s followed by the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s have challenged the perception of the Eurozone has a fully functioning currency area. In this class we will seek to place the creation of the Eurozone in the context of the broader evolution of the EU as a cosmopolitan project. We will examine the socioeconomic theories and political ideologies behind the creation of the Eurozone. This will require an understanding of the macroeconomic models which underlie the concept of 'optimal currency area' and an investigation of the degree to which the Eurozone is a fully completed project. In particular the solutions provided by EU leaders and institutions to the economic crisis in Greece (and other countries in the Eurozone) will give us a chance to reflect upon the future of the Eurozone and to discuss the intellectual and practical implications of two alternatives that member-states may face as they look towards the future of the EU: 1. the pursuit of further EU integration through the creation of a supranational fiscal and political union or 2. the beginning of a process of political and economic devolution towards smaller scale European projects. Prerequisite(s): ECON 301.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 428 -Financial Instability and Economic Crises (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Throughout the history of market economies, financial markets have periodically experienced rapid changes in the prices of financial assets, i.e., booms and crashes. These periods of instability are often connected to rising unemployment, fall in production, and painful economic crises. In spite of this, an influential contingent of economists -sometimes referred to as "free market" economists -continue to argue that all markets are stable and that government regulations are at best unnecessary and at worst counterproductive. This course studies the historical development of the "free market" ideology and explores many of the serious challenges to this ideology that come from both economic theory and economic history. Prerequisite(s): ECON 302.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 461 -Growth, Distribution, and Instability (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course explores what 18-19th century classical political economists -Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo and Karl Marx had to say about economic growth, income distribution and macroeconomic instability in a market economy. The unique aspect of this course is that these ideas are presented and analyzed using modern economic tools such as mathematical modeling, computational simulations and statistical analysis. By doing so, we are able to develop new insights on a set of modern economic phenomena such as uneven development, income inequality, business cycles and financial crisis. Prerequisite(s): ECON 301 and ECON 302.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 465 -Forensic Economics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>After an untimely death or a wrenching divorce, forensic economists are often called upon to estimate the economic worth of a human life or a family business. To make such estimations requires that students have a firm understanding of the underlying micro-and macroeconomic aspects of economic theory, of the relevant demographic and economic data that is available, and of the process of calculating net discounted present value. There are generally accepted ways of calculating economic worth, but there are also grey areas where judgments are made. The latter requires a subtle understanding of the issues behind why one assumption may be better than another and its impact on the final value of economic worth. Students will role-play a movie forensic economist who is a member of a well-respected law firm specializing in wrongful death and divorce. Prerequisite(s): ECON 301 and ECON 302.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>The Department of Education emphasizes the study of education as a social institution and analysis of teaching and learning in interdisciplinary terms. The Educational Studies major is designed for students who wish to prepare for a career in education in elementary or secondary schools, or in the broader community. The curriculum introduces students to learning theory and the social foundations of education, and it allows for experiential learning in the field. This study fits well into a broader Educational Studies liberal arts education and allows time for students to complete a major in an additional field of study, for example, in an area of interest or the discipline one intends to teach. The Educational Studies major does not lead directly to licensure; however, faculty in the Department of Education assist students in creating individually designed plans for obtaining licensure after graduation through a range of graduate and other programs.</p><p>Educational Studies students will have multiple opportunities to communicate original thinking through writing, to explore various genres, and to address diverse audiences through course assignments. Students will learn how to develop a focused, well-supported essay. Also, they will acquire the skills to blend written language with other modes to communicate a message, and how to navigate various formatting guidelines informing the field of education. During their senior year, students will reflect upon a collection of essays they have produced in previous courses through a capstone, portfolio project. The project invites them to assess the themes, areas of growth and quality, and to witness their engagement in writing as a process.</p><p>Educational Studies students are encouraged to consider taking a semester off-campus. This option allows for comparative study of education and often, extended apprenticeships in schools. Educational Studies students have studied, for instance, in Chile, England, Denmark, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and The Philadelphia Center. In addition, students can take advantage of applying for our recently launched collaborative learning initiative with Turku University, Finland. Please contact an Educational Studies faculty member for more details.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Departmental Guidelines</head><p>The English curriculum is intended to serve the general needs of the liberal arts student and also provide discerning programs for the more specialized needs of students who want to major in English with an emphasis in literature, creative writing, or narrative nonfiction writing. In the last thirty years, English literary studies have changed in response to new theoretical and cultural models as well as greater attention to Anglophone international and non-canonical literature and genres. In our courses and major we approach the study of language and literature as a dynamic, living, and lively pursuit, one that integrates political, social, philosophic, cultural, and aesthetic values. We have designed a program that meets a variety of needs and enables students to pursue a variety of personal and professional goals, whether defined by individual or All students may enjoy readings and lectures made possible by the endowed Harriet Ewens Beck Fund, which has brought such writers as Susan Orlean, Ted Kooser, Alice Walker, Bill Bryson, Maxine Hong Kingston, Adrienne Rich, Louise Erdrich, and Antonya Nelson for visits or residencies each year. The curriculum in English is also enhanced by a variety of opportunities for students to pursue publishing their works locally in a variety of student-edited journals. ARTICULĀTE (a forum for cultural and literary criticism) and EXILE (a journal of creative writing) are among the publications associated with students in English.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Major</head><p>Students who major in English must choose an advisor in the English Department to assist them in selecting and sequencing classes to meet their academic and professional goals. All students who major in English must complete a minimum of ten classes in the department, excluding W 101 -First-Year Writing Workshop. The English major and minor each have two options: the literature emphasis and the creative writing emphasis. The two courses of study overlap and complement one another. Both literature and creative writing students should graduate from Denison with a strong knowledge of the history and practice of literary studies.</p><p>Each semester, students who want to take classes in English should read the semester's course descriptions, available online and from the English office, which provide more detailed information about specific classes than what appears below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Emphasis</head><p>Students who major in English with the Literature emphasis must take ten courses. Four courses are chosen from among the five core courses: four of those courses are historical survey courses that cover a variety of periods in English and American literature; the fifth course introduces students to literary theory and critical methods. Critical methods and literary theory are taught in many courses in the major, but ENGL 202 -Literary Theory and Critical Methods provides an overview of literary theoretical debates, familiarity with some primary theoretical texts, and attention to research and critical practices in literary studies. This course is recommended for all students, particularly those who want to take advanced courses in literary theory or plan to pursue graduate studies in English.</p><p>All students with the Literature emphasis are strongly urged to begin their coursework with the required "four-of-five" courses that provide useful historical and theoretical contexts for subsequent, more focused study in the seminars. However, because specific 300-level seminars are probably not offered every semester, students are encouraged to take seminars, even before they have completed the required surveys, if they are interested in the topic. ENGL 400 -Senior Seminar is the English capstone course offered every semester on a variety of topics. Students who major in English with the Literature emphasis may choose to do a year-long senior research project in literary studies (ENGL 451 -Senior Research -ENGL 452 -Senior Research) which can replace one 300level seminar requirement. Students can transfer only two courses to the Major from off-campus.</p><p>English majors with the Literature emphasis must take four of the following five core courses: English majors with the Literature emphasis are also required to take the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula><p>• Four 300-level English seminar courses (or three with a year-long senior research project)</p><p>• One elective at any level • ENGL 400 -Senior Seminar</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creative Writing Emphasis</head><p>Students who major in English with the Creative Writing emphasis must take ten courses. English majors with a Creative Writing emphasis will read and write extensively, learn from practicing published writers, and hone their skills while studying a wide range of literary texts. Students majoring with an emphasis in Creative Writing will choose from a variety of courses divided among workshops and literature courses. The core of the creative writing courses is the workshop. Writing students take a series of increasingly advanced workshops to culminate, in the senior year, in a year-long writing project conducted on campus. The senior capstone is ENGL 453 -Senior Writing Project -ENGL 454 -Senior Writing Project in which students complete a collection of their work (poetry, stories, drama, and/or nonfiction) by year's end.</p><p>English majors with the Creative Writing emphasis must take three of the following five core courses: English majors with the Creative Writing emphasis must take three 300level English seminars. ENGL 400 -Senior Seminar can count as one of these advanced seminars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English majors with the Creative Writing emphasis must take four courses in the series of Creative Writing workshops:</head><p>• ENGL 237 -Introduction to Creative Writing • ENGL 383 -Fiction Writing, ENGL 384 -Creative Nonfiction Writing, or ENGL 385 -Poetry Writing: students choose either Fiction Writing, Nonfiction Writing, or Poetry Writing. (Students may, if their schedules permit, take more than one of these advanced workshops.) Students may not take any of these courses concurrent with the Senior Writing Project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• ENGL 453 -Senior Writing Project and ENGL 454 -Senior Writing Project</head><p>English 453-454 serves as the capstone experience for English majors with the Creative Writing emphasis; this 8-credit course consists of weekly group workshops, individual tutorials, a monthly colloquium and practicum, as well as a series of master classes and workshops with visiting writers. Students must submit a writing sample and show reasonable progress in creative writing courses at the end of their junior year to get permission to take the year-long senior project to complete the major with a Creative Writing emphasis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Minor</head><p>The English minor consists of six courses:</p><p>To minor in English with a Literature emphasis, students must take three of the five required core 200 level courses (see above) and three courses at the 300-level (one may be at the 400 level). A year-long senior research project may replace one 300-level course.</p><p>To minor in English with a Creative Writing emphasis, students must take ENGL 237 -Introduction to Creative Writing, one advanced writing workshop (ENGL 383 -Fiction Writing, ENGL 384 -Creative Nonfiction Writing, or ENGL 385 -Poetry Writing), two of the five required core 200-level courses, and two courses at the 300-level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Studies Program Guidelines</head><p>Environmental Studies is an interdisciplinary inquiry into the relationship between humans and the environment. Both a major and a minor are available to students with an interest in the rigorous study of these issues. The major requires students to develop a specific environmental focus as a concentration in addition to the environmental core and distribution courses. The minor in ENVS allows students to integrate an environmental perspective with their major field of study.</p><p>As an interdisciplinary area, Environmental Studies draws on work in the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. It endeavors to bridge these many intellectual approaches and perspectives in the hope that students will gain a deeper understanding both of the environmental concerns facing the world and of proactive opportunities for change. Among issues of concern and investigation are resource utilization, the impact of technology on ecosystems, relationships between the environment and sociocultural systems, geographic analysis, environmental economics and policy, conservation of biological diversity, nature writing, alternative dispute resolution, environmental psychology, political ecology, environmental photography, sustainable agriculture and environmental ethics, among many others. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENVS 100 -Integrated Environmental Studies (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course the student will consider environmental problems through the lenses of many different academic disciplines. The purpose of this approach is two-fold: 1) to enhance the student's understanding of environmental issues as multi-dimensional dilemmas, and 2) to encourage the student to seek synergistic solutions. The course focuses on three major realms of environmental studies. In the first, students will consider the human relationship with the non-human world, including problems of ethics, social and psychological connections with nature, ecological services, biodiversity, aesthetics and utility. The second section addresses agriculture and aquaculture in the context of ecological limits, economics and policy. The third section explores the global aspects of energy use and climate change, with special emphasis on technology, disparity and human rights. The laboratory component of the course will expose the student to local and regional environmental problems and solutions. Field trips, guest speakers, analysis and discussion will emphasize the necessity of multidisciplinary integration in the design of sustainable environmental systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENVS 236 -Political Ecology (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>What really causes deforestation? How is a fish 'cultural?' Why do Americans spend so much time and money on their lawns? Should we be saving people or endangered species? Why are ecosystem services so hard to privatize? Is obesity truly just a question of consuming too many calories? These are all questions that political ecology can help us to answer. Political ecology is an interdisciplinary field that situates environmental change within broader networks of political, economic, and social relations. It differs from other environmental approaches in that it views power, material nature, everyday struggles and practices, social justice, and discourse to be critical components of human-environment interactions. In this course, we will: (a) study the theoretical foundations of political ecology, (b) evaluate some of the theses it puts forward, and (c) apply political ecology insights to contemporary environmental issues. Course fulfills the Writing (W) GE and ENVS Social Science requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENVS 240 -Environmental Politics and Decision Making (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course gives students a chance to explore the realm of proactive change in the environmental arena. It combines the theories of policy, the tools of problem solving, and the practice of dealing with environmental challenges in the real world of American government. The premise of the course is this: if you want to improve the state of the planet, you have to propose a solution. To make a solution happen, you should understand the process of getting an idea through the decision-making system. Effecting change requires a background in the system(s) that make things happen, whether you ultimately want to work within the system or outside it. This course is divided into two main components: an overview and implementation of problem solving techniques, and an in-depth examination of the U.S. Congress' role in environmental policy formation. The latter section culminates in a "Moot Congress" undertaken by students at the end of the semester. Not recommended for first year students.

Prerequisite(s): ENVS 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENVS 256 -Farmscape: Visual Immersion in the Food System (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Every human being has an intimate relationship with food, often with deep emotional facets. Yet we in the U.S. know very little about the food system that sustains us -it is a mysterious and often invisible set of processes, organizations, and people. This remarkably complex web of inputs, labor, machinery, laws, subsidies, mergers, and so many other components is one that we take largely for granted. This class seeks to align that reality with another: we are an intensely visual species. A critical part of our existence that we experience through all of our senses is one we fail to comprehend through our primary sense. And we have this occasion to use sight in a formalized way -photography -to tell new stories, and to bring an artistic sensibility to our understanding of food, and perhaps ourselves. Through imagery, writing, and the curatorial process of exhibiting our work in a public setting, we have a truly unique opportunity. Our immersion in these critical issues can bring full circle the understanding we gain through many eyes to enhance awareness in other people about the ways in which our food system connects us all together. Course fulfills the ENVS Humanities/Arts requirement, and can fulfill the ENVS Methods requirement for class of 2021 and prior.</p></div>

Students are invited to study fascinating practices of spatial image-making in East Asia from the inside out, by exploring these world-views from the perspective of their makers. You will be asked to pay special attention to how social and economic power structures inflect these representations: to envision and decode spatial imagery as a site of imagination, control and resistance. Artists and patrons in China, Japan, and Korea have for centuries produced elaborate maps and landscape imagery, photographs and film to imagine the world in a variety of ways. This course invites you to approach modern and contemporary representations of space in East Asia both in theoretically and historically informed ways. In the first part of the course, students build a frame of reference for their analysis of post-war case studies, by reading core texts in spatial theory, and exploring important visual representations of space from pre-modern East Asia. In the second part of the course, students apply these theoretical and historical approaches to select cases that exemplify more recent struggles over space and its imagination in East Asia.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>French Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, social and intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires us to break away from the notion that our native language is the most natural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience. An education can start with the discovery that all words are purely conventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions, articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning another language contributes to our education by intimately exploring cultural and linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it means to be human in today's world.</p><p>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. When students take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the target language in subsequent courses dealing with the culture. The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of its courses because it believes that students can best appreciate a culture from within its own mode of expression. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest The Language Lab</head><p>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27 Macs, zone-free Blu-ray player and document camera. It also has a VIA Connect PRO which is a wireless collaboration and presentation solution that makes sharing and presenting easier for all computers in the room. The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside the classroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborative writing projects, as well as discussions of authentic materials published on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualized instruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a variety of digital materials for class discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Department Regulations</head><p>Students planning to major in the Department are advised to begin course work in the first year. Those who wish to fulfill the basic requirement in language by continuing one begun in secondary school will find it advantageous to begin their course work in the first year. Whether students satisfy the language requirement by continuing with their secondary-school language or by taking up a new language, the Department of Modern Languages strongly recommends that students complete their language requirement by the end of their sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural Enrichment</head><p>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunities for cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunities include, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, movies and performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars and performers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become more readily available to our students. These opportunities are made possible through a most generous endowment bestowed on the Department of Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Department maintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denison community members can view upcoming events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Foresman Lounge</head><p>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denison community with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions, classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette with a table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is also equipped with a wide range of technological devices to enrich our students' learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screen TV connected to a zone-free Blu-ray player and a document camera.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>German Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, social and intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires us to break away from the notion that our native language is the most natural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience. An education can start with the discovery that all words are purely conventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions, articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning another language contributes to our education by intimately exploring cultural and linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it means to be human in today's world.</p><p>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. When students take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the target language in subsequent courses dealing with the culture and society. The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of its courses because it believes that students can best appreciate a culture from within its own mode of expression. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>German Minor</head><p>A student minoring in German must take at least five advanced language courses above the 112 level, including one literature course, and one course in area studies. Recommended courses: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest General Departmental Regulations</head><p>Students planning to major in the Department are advised to begin course work in the first year. Those who want to fulfill the basic requirement in language by continuing one begun in secondary school will find it advantageous to begin their course work in the first year. The Department of Modern Languages strongly recommends that students complete their language requirement by the end of their sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language Lab</head><p>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27 Macs, zone-free Blu-ray player and document camera. It also has a VIA Connect PRO which is a wireless collaboration and presentation solution that makes sharing and presenting easier with all computers in the room.</p><p>The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside the classroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborative writing projects, as well as discussions of authenticated materials published on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualized instruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a variety of digital materials for class discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural Enrichment</head><p>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunities for cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunities include, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, movies and performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars and performers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become more readily available to our students. These opportunities are made possible through a most generous endowment bestowed on the Department </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Foresman Lounge</head><p>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denison community with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions, classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a small kitchenette with a table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is also equipped with a wide range of technological devices with which to enrich our students' learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screen TV that is connected to a zone-free Blu-ray player and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted laser projector, which connects to a networked Mac computer, the Blu-ray player, and document camera.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language and Culture Program</head><p>This exciting residential option gives students the opportunity to hone language skills and to participate in special cultural events. Students who choose this residential option will live in close community with their peers who share enthusiasm for language and culture study. Extracurricular activities and programming in the Language House support language acquisition and permit a closer relationship with professors and language assistants from the Department of Modern Languages</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GERM 302 -Special Topics Seminar (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>A seminar with an emphasis on culture and literature focusing on a specific theme or topic. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GERM 311 -Introduction to German Fiction and Non-Fiction (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The goal of the course is to train the students in the techniques of reading, analyzing and responding to literary and non-literary texts such as, short prose fiction, plays, films, poetry, essays, articles, biographies, etc. Short compositions in German throughout the semester constitute an essential element of the course. This course satisfies the upper level</p><p>Language study at least to the intermediate level is fundamental to the Global Commerce major. When students declare the GC major, they must identify their language of study to ensure that they will be in a position to use their developing language skills as they progress through the major. In addition to this language facility, throughout their GC major experience, students develop sophisticated analytical skills in assessing and engaging in a globalized society.</p><p>To that end, the major is built around 8 courses required of all majors: 5 "Commerce Core" courses that are unique to Denison as well as ECON 101 -Introductory Macroeconomics, ECON 102 -Introductory Microeconomics, and MATH 120 -Elements of Statistics. In the introductory GC 101 -Commerce and Society, students explore the relationships between commerce and society in different times and places, through a variety of humanities and social science lenses.</p><p>In GC 200 -Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerce, sophomore majors design a "Global Focus" that will allow them to develop a deep understanding of a particular geographic area by studying its culture, history, social and political context, and language(s). The goal of this global focus is not to make the GC major a specialist in one region of the world but, rather, to develop their capacity to adapt to working in any global region by knowing what kinds of information are required to operate effectively in an unfamiliar society.</p><p>GC 200 -Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerce is paired with GC 201 -Elements of Commerce, which exposes students to a core of applied skills related to the areas of commerce, business, global organizations, and entrepreneurship (i.e., skills related to multiple workplace environments) and fosters students' understanding of how the liberal arts underpin and support these skills. Junior majors take GC 301 -Global Financial Markets, in which they examine the dynamics of global markets, market regulation, and financial institutions. GC 401 -Global Commerce Senior Seminar, the senior capstone course, requires students to articulate and apply their accumulated knowledge from their Global Commerce major experiences, both inside and outside the classroom, in part by producing a final semester-long, team-based assignment in which they create a team plan, collect and analyze data, and craft a proposal for a global commerce-related initiative. In addition to working with experienced and dedicated Denison faculty, these courses offer GC majors opportunities to interact with visiting speakers, including alumni and Columbus-area professionals, in conversations about the dynamics and challenges of globalized commerce.</p><p>In combination with our robust GC co-curricular program (Learn more about Global Commerce Outside the Classroom), these courses offer GC majors opportunities to interact with visiting speakers, including alumni and Columbus-area professionals, in conversations about the dynamics and challenges of globalized commerce.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Commerce</head><p>Learning goals for the Global Commerce major include the development of an advanced understanding of the complex ways in which the economy and trade are connected to culture, social movements, and other global factors; immersion in the study of a particular geographic area-or the connections between multiple regions for the transregional option-emphasizing the study of culture, history, social context, and language; building well-developed cultural fluency skills, including intermediate-level facility with at least one foreign language; the development of a sound understanding of the elements of commerce, including familiarity with basic aspects of financial accounting, spreadsheet proficiency, business language and etiquette, and business ethics; the development of student creativity and autonomy in creating a meaningful and coherent global focus or transregional option; the integration of a significant off-campus experience with the curricular study of commerce and cultural context; and the development of a supportive and engaged student cohort in the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Faculty</head><p>Director: Karen Spierling </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Courses</head><p>Significant language study is essential to understanding the dynamics of a global society, to competing with international candidates for jobs, and to operating to full effect in global businesses and organizations. All Global Commerce majors are required to attain depth in a language other than English, typically by taking at least two language courses beyond the 112 level. Additional language study is strongly encouraged, and any additional language courses can apply toward the Global Focusincluding introductory level courses in a third language relevant to the student's global focus region. If students are already native speakers of a language other than English, they must still fulfill the language requirement of the Global Commerce major by studying at least two semesters of a language other than English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Focus</head><p>The Global Commerce major seeks to integrate the study of commerce with a deep understanding of the cultures and societies of a geographical region beyond North America. Courses in the Global Focus are drawn from the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Majors choose one of the following geographic areas as a Global Focus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• Africa/Middle East • Asia • Europe • Latin America/Caribbean</formula><p>The Global Focus consists of six courses (see list of qualifying courses available from the Global Commerce office each semester), at least four of which must address the particular region of study. Two of the courses can be cognates that relate to global commerce and/or international issues generally but do not necessarily focus on the student's selected region. Up to three of the Global Focus courses may be taken off-campus. Any exceptions must be approved by the Global Commerce Director in consultation with the Global Commerce committee. Students will develop a cohesive curricular plan for their Global Focus in the sophomore seminar class, GC 200 -Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerce.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transregional Option</head><p>The Global Focus component of the major also can be fulfilled through a "transregional option." In this option, students focus on the flow and exchange of a variety of elements-such as information, goods, services, or labor-between two or more geographic regions. The proposal must make a clear case for the pursuit of the transregional option and for the coherence of their six proposed Global Focus courses. Students electing to pursue the transregional option must still meet the Global Commerce language requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>An off-campus experience is required of Global Commerce majors. Ideally, the off-campus experience occurs in the geographical region of the Global Focus or is tied to the Global Focus in terms of topics of study. In the GC 200 -Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerce proposal assignment, students are required to indicate and explain the rationale supporting their choice of an off-campus experience. The types of experiences that would fulfill the Global Commerce off-campus requirement include:</p><p>• Semester (or summer) of participation in a Denison-approved Off-Campus Study program.</p><p>• A Denison Seminar or other academic course with a travel component.</p><p>• An off-campus internship. This may be an international internship or a domestic internship where the student learns about the global connections of a U.S. business or organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health, Exercise, and Sport Studies Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Liberal-arts colleges such as Denison University strive to cultivate an atmosphere in which individuals gain an appreciation and capacity for sustained personal growth. This self-disciplined approach to personal growth will result in autonomous thought, moral discernment, and contributions to a democratic society. Our department offers the community an extensive environment in which individuals pursue these shared values.</p><p>While tradition dictates the department have three aspects -Athletics, Recreation, and Academic Curriculum -the philosophy of the three areas need not be segmented. Put simply, the department pursues the advancement of the individual through the instructional medium of the physical body. We believe that study of the body and its complexity deepens comprehension. Physical exercise improves physical capacity. Performance guides self-referential thought. Competition yields a drive for improvement. And that striving for success within a team enlightens the ties that shape community. At each level, there is agreement that individuals must exercise autonomous thought, act individually within</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History Departmental Guidelines Mission</head><p>History is a way of thinking about the world that teaches us to value and embrace the complexities and ambiguities of life. Students learn to see the multiple layers of causes and effects, changes and continuities, individual experiences and broader social dynamics that shape human societies and cultures across time and place. History questions not only, what happened, but even more importantly, why did something happen the way it did? How were different people engaged and impacted? What did this change mean to people in that time and place? What has it meant to people in other times and places? What does it mean to us now, in our own time and place?</p><p>History students weave answers to these questions into compelling stories and persuasive arguments. These narratives, when well constructed, are moving and beautiful. They prompt thinking about the diversity of human experience, both across the globe and close to home, and about how peoples' ideas and cultural practices vary by period, region, and social circumstance. With classes focused on the United States, Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, history provides students the opportunity to explore the world broadly and deeply. Moreover, history allows us to see the world through the eyes of others as we confront human achievement, struggle, and failure and thus provides the tools for empathy, objective thought, and engaged citizenship.</p><p>History majors graduate prepared to negotiate a complex, uncertain, and often changing world landscape, equipped with unique abilities to discern and integrate multiple perspectives as they engage in creative problem solving.</p><p>History students can... </p></div>

In 1500, the idea of a unified European Christendom, though imperfect, could still be defended. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, while Europeans as a group still believed in God, the influence of the Roman Church and of Christianity more generally had begun to change. This course examines the religious ideas and arguments that burgeoned in the sixteenth century, the social and political contexts in which they developed, and the transformations in European society, culture and religious practices that resulted.

But slavery was not limited to the U.S. and by approaching slavery from a comparative perspective, we will deepen our understanding of slavery as an institution, slaves as historical actors, and therefore the legacies of slavery throughout the Americas. We will explore regional differences within slaves' opportunities to form families, to create cultures, to rebel, and to labor for their own benefits; as well as the interactions of African cultural visions and Christianity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Studies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>The International Studies major asks students to inquire broadly into social, political, economic, and cultural processes, linkages, interdependencies, and power relations that connect individuals, communities, groups, states, and regions across the globe. These crossborder flows and processes are not new, but their increased intensity, complexity, and speed compel us to examine the world with the renewed emphasis on interconnectivity and interdependency as the fundamental human conditions under which we live today. These transnational and transregional cultural, political, and economic phenomena today are not mere outcomes of abstract and structural forces, but actively shaped by concrete human activities and decisions. Therefore, the major in International Studies helps students examine these phenomena within both historical and contemporary frameworks, and tackle shared dilemmas and challenges that tie the world's people together as committed global citizens.</p><p>Denison's International Studies major moves beyond traditional International Relations (IR) in that it transcends nation-state-centered perspective, and involves the use of theoretical tools from sociocultural analysis and political-economy. International Studies majors are also asked to move beyond traditional Area Studies approaches, in that the major problematizes seeing areas as bounded and distinctive historical and cultural zones, and instead stresses ways in which regions are, and historically have been, tied together in complex patterns and processes.</p><p>International Studies is inherently interdisciplinary. While it borrows from and employs theoretical tools and concepts from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities, social sciences and arts, it stresses the need to use these tools and methods in ways that work together and that problematize the limitations of any single disciplinary approach. This interdisciplinary emphasis encourages students to view the processes that tie together and divide the world from multiple perspectives. In doing so, the majors in International Studies synthesize study of global forces with real-world experience of how these forces shape, and are shaped by, the lives of peoples living in their unique sociocultural and politicaleconomic situations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Studies Major</head><p>Students who major in International Studies must take the following courses:</p><p>• 2. In the INTL 201 -Major Proposal for International Studies course students will propose four courses they will use as their "concentration courses" to fulfill their specific concentration area within International Studies. Up to three courses from their OCS program may count towards their concentration.</p><p>3. The language requirement can be fulfilled in a number of ways, and students should consult with the INTL Director or another INTL faculty advisor. Students may include in their off-campus study a language particular to that program and one that is not taught at Denison. Students who enter Denison as multilingual students may have already fulfilled the INTL language requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTL 200 -Themes and Approaches in International Studies (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The main goals of this course are to introduce sophomore students, who have completed INTL100, to some of the key themes and theories within the purview of International Studies to help them shape their individual concentrations in the major. The course also provides opportunities for students to examine various world problems through an interdisciplinary lens, drawing on both political-economic and sociocultural analytical frameworks in various disciplines. Finally, students learn the basics of academic research and writing processes, i.e., formulating a well-defined topic, posing a relevant research question, finding and interrogating appropriate sources, justifying the research's intellectual contribution to a broader scholarly audience and, when applicable, to the efforts to solve real-world problems, through writing and revising a carefully crafted prose. Among numerous debates and issues that International Studies scholars grapple with, the course focuses on four broadly conceived themes: economic development, nationalism and national identity, transnational migration, and mediated and material culture. After learning major scholarly approaches to theorize each of these themes, students develop individual research project and write a scholarly paper, complete with abstract, introduction, literature review, case study, and conclusion. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to formulate, broaden, and contextualize their thematic and topical concentrations within the interdisciplinary scheme of International Studies, and be equipped with academic research skills to pursue their concentrations in the major. Prerequisite(s): INTL 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTL 201 -Major Proposal for International Studies (1 Credit Hour)</head><p>The required mid-level course is for all International Studies majors.</p><p>The goals of this one-credit course are to create a vibrant intellectual community of students, in which they collaboratively formulate individual interests in the field of International Studies through discussion and peer-reviews in class, and consultation with the course coordinator (International Studies Program Director) and faculty advisor assigned by the coordinator. Through these processes, the students are expected to not only develop strong camaraderie among them as the new INTL majors, but also formulate comprehensive plans for how they will pursue their interests in International Studies during their final two years at Denison. This involves charting out their courses in International Studies for the next two years-including coursework from off-campus study programs that they wish to count towards the International Studies major. By the end of the course, students submit the major proposal, in which they synthesize coursework, off-campus study (or an internship), and language training in a way that allows them to develop a coherent area of expertise within International Studies, and they will share their goals and plans with their cohort and a wider International Studies community. The proposals will be evaluated by the course coordinator, who consults with the entire International Studies Program Committee.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Japanese Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, social and intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires us to break away from the notion that our native language is the most natural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience. An education can start with the discovery that all words are purely conventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions, articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning another language contributes to our education by intimately exploring cultural and linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it means to be human in today's world.</p><p>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. When students take full advantage of this opportunity, they can use the target language in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of its courses because it believes that students can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode of expression. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest General Departmental Regulations</head><p>Students who want to fulfill the basic requirement in language by continuing one begun in secondary school will find it advantageous to begin their course work in the first year. The Department of Modern Languages strongly recommends that students complete their language requirement by the end of their sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language Lab</head><p>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27 Macs, zone-free Blu-ray player and document camera. It also has a VIA Connect PRO that is a wireless collaboration and presentation solution that makes sharing and presenting easier for all computers in the room.</p><p>The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside the classroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborative writing projects, as well as discussions of authenticated materials published on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualized instruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a variety of digital materials for class discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural Enrichment</head><p>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunities for cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunities include, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, movies and performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars and performers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become more readily available to our students. These opportunities are made possible through a most generous endowment bestowed on the Department of Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Department maintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where the Denison community can find information about upcoming events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Foresman Lounge</head><p>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denison community with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions, classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette with a table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is also equipped with a wide range of technological devices with which to enrich our students' learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screen TV connected to a zone-free Blu-ray player and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted laser projector, which connects to a networked Mac computer, the Blu-ray player and document camera.</p><p>Although the Department of Modern Languages offers majors in French, German and Spanish, it also offers courses in other languages for the purpose of general education and support of other college programs.

It is founded on the basic pillars of a Liberal Arts education such as understanding the person as a whole, promoting critical thinking and expanding cultural horizons. Its mission is to provide students a strong historical, social and cultural foundation for the understanding of specific components of differing Latin American and Caribbean cultures. Through this approach, we strive to foster critical awareness of the heterogeneity that characterizes the region as well as a critical understanding of the complexities of its relationship with the United States. The curriculum of the Latin American and Caribbean studies concentration expresses our commitment to developing the person as a whole by allowing students to explore, analyze, discuss, read and write about a variety of themes directly related to Latin America, from different theoretical frameworks. This in turn encourages students to reflect upon their own cultural background. </p></div>

In particular, Track Two provides a foundation for graduate study at the Graduate School of International Policy Studies at the Monterey Institute in California, or at similar graduate programs that also require extensive language training. To complete the Track Two program at Denison, students must take two years (four semesters) of coursework in a foreign language. Although French, German, and Spanish are acceptable, students interested in the Monterey option are encouraged to study Arabic, Chinese or Japanese. Some coursework in a language could be undertaken at Monterey or another institution, most likely during the summer. Students must take four courses selected from the Political Science Department offerings in the subfields of Comparative Politics or International Politics. The minimum grade in each of these courses and in every semester of foreign language instruction is a C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research at Denison</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>The department of Mathematics and Computer Science strongly encourages students to globalize their education by completing some portion of their undergraduate education abroad. A majority of Denison students spend a semester abroad during their junior year and many more spend a second summer abroad. Denison offers a wide range of opportunities to study off-campus that are highly relevant to the Denison experience.</p><p>Going abroad allows students to enhance their knowledge while experiencing another culture and way of life. Students gain valuable international experience that will benefit future career goals and/or graduate school opportunities. Math and Computer Science majors who are fluent in another language will have special advantages in the job market.</p><p>Students may take up to two classes outside the department to transfer towards the major at Denison. Additional courses taken outside Denison may accrue credit hours towards graduation, but will not contribute to requirements in the major. Courses taken outside the university must be pre-approved for acceptance towards major requirements. Students should provide the department chair syllabi for the intended courses for department approval. Students may petition the department chair for exceptions to this policy. In particular, transfer students may be eligible to transfer additional courses towards major requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MENA Experience Requirement</head><p>• An Off-campus experience is required from MENA students. This could be fulfilled in one of the following forms:</p><p>• A Study Abroad program that focuses on the Middle East or North Africa in or outside the region;</p><p>• Internship at a non-governmental or governmental organization that focuses on the Middle East or North Africa;</p><p>• Research project, or internship related to or conducted within the MENA region;</p><p>• Community work in areas with predominantly Middle Eastern populations outside the MENA region;</p><p>• All forms of fulfilling this requirement are subject to the approval of the MENA committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. A Note on Prerequisites</head><p>Of the twelve MENA elective courses, only four courses have a prerequisite requirement, as follows: The fewest courses a student would need to take to complete the concentration would be 4, assuming that they were proficient in Arabic when they arrived at Denison. If students had had no Arabic language training at all before coming to Denison, the fewest courses a student would need to take to complete the concentration would be 8 (in which case they would need ARAB 111 and ARAB 112 in addition to the other MENA requirements).</p><p>The most courses a student would need to take would be 8, while noting that Economics and Spanish majors would have had to fill the prerequisites for Econ 463 or Span 420 as part of their majors anyway.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study Overview</head><p>Learning through global experiences is integral to a Denison education. The Office of Off-Campus Study (OCS) provides individualized mentoring to help students craft their off-campus experience and take advantage of learning opportunities that foster global competencies essential in today's world. With more than 200 Denison-accepted off-campus study programs to choose from, students have many opportunities to realize the full potential of their education, hone a language, develop workplace skills, and maximize the learning of global competencies. Denison maintains a list of carefully vetted and accepted off-campus programs that meet the pedagogical and academic standards associated with a Denison liberal arts education. The current list can be found in Global Tools (https://globaltools.denison.edu/index.cfm? FuseAction=Programs.MapSearch). Students who withdraw from the university to attend a program that is not on Denison's list of approved programs are not eligible to receive transfer credit.</p><p>In addition to semester, or year-long study abroad, shorter term opportunities are also possible. Denison Seminars (p. 78), semesterlong credit bearing courses with an off-campus travel component, are another way students can develop global competencies. Students can also participate in summer, short-term, faculty-led credit bearing seminars.</p><p>There are many other opportunities for students to apply and extend their off-campus learning. These include independent research, internships, and lectures that connect students to international educators and peers around the world. OCS works closely with the Knowlton Center and Lisska Center to share information about the many global learning opportunities and resources available to Denison students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Planning for Off-Campus Study Program</head><p>The first step in planning for off-campus study is to attend a Study Abroad 101 session led by student returnees. Next, students schedule an appointment with an OCS advisor. Working with OCS and their academic advisors, students articulate learning goals for an off-campus study experience, explore a range of options among the Denisonaccepted programs, and carefully consider the timing of participation and integration with degree requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposing Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students normally seek approval for one semester and/or a summer of off-campus study during their Denison career, though approval for an academic year of off-campus study is also possible. (Note that institutional financial aid may be applied to a maximum of one semester of study -see Financing Off-Campus Study.)</p><p>To pursue off-campus study for academic credit, students must first select an approved program found in Global Tools (https:// globaltools.denison.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.MapSearch), develop an academic plan around the program, and obtain OCS approval for such study. Once approved by OCS, the student is then responsible for completing an application with the program provider. Students approved for off-campus study must attend a mandatory orientation session facilitated by OCS. Failure to do so may result in revocation of approval. OCS staff assists and advises students with both steps in the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility Guidelines</head><p>Please note that eligibility guidelines for Off-Campus Study are reviewed annually and subject to change.</p><p>Denison approval is granted only if the student is adequately prepared for the proposed off-campus program. The Denison evaluation criteria are as follows:</p><p>• The proposed off-campus study program represents a well-defined continuation of the curricular and pedagogical goals of a Denison liberal arts education and the individual student's academic program.</p><p>• The student's academic record demonstrates clear evidence of curricular preparation and academic achievement appropriate to the proposed off-campus study program and the specific learning goals associated with the student's proposal.</p><p>• The student has completed a minimum of forty-eight credits prior to participation on an off-campus program. Transfer students must complete one year of study at Denison prior to participation on an off-campus program. These residency requirements do not apply to summer study.</p><p>• The student is enrolled at Denison the semester preceding offcampus study participation. A student who applies institutional aid to a program must also enroll at Denison the semester following the program. Failure to do so will result in the student charged for the institutional aid that was awarded for off-campus study.</p><p>• The student must be in good academic standing the semester preceding participation on a program. Denison also reserves the right to withdraw approval if there is a problematic shift in a student's academic performance before the start of a program, even if a student is technically in good standing. See Academic Regulations for Off-Campus Study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Balancing Participation</head><p>Denison strives to accommodate the off-campus study proposals of all qualified students. There are, however, two related points that impact this policy. First, OCS establishes limits on the number of participants in some programs in order to facilitate optimal integration into the range of experiential learning contexts and communities. Second, to facilitate the sustainable management of Denison's on-campus housing resources, slots for off-campus study in the fall semester are awarded on a first come, first served basis based on the date of the student's required OCS appointment, and completion of program-specific interview with an OCS staff member. There are four exceptions to this policy:</p><p>• the student is proposing a program that is only offered during the fall semester;</p><p>• the student will be studying abroad during the senior year;</p><p>• the student has a conflict with a specific course offering in her/his major program, as documented by the Academic Planning Form and confirmed by the appropriate department chair;</p><p>• the student is on the team roster for a spring semester sport, as confirmed by the appropriate coach.</p><p>If studying off-campus in the fall semester is not covered by one of these exceptions, the student should schedule the required advising appointment to start the OCS Proposal process in the second semester of the First-Year (no later than April 1st), or at the very beginning of the fall semester of the sophomore year. The student should carefully review all deadlines and work diligently to complete the planning meetings and forms required for that appointment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financing Off-Campus Study</head><p>To determine whether a given program is affordable, students should consider out-of-pocket expenses as well as the invoiced program fees. A comprehensive cost estimate for any given program on the Denison accepted list is available from the program provider.</p><p>To promote off-campus study, Denison does not require students to pay its tuition or room/board fees during their term off-campus. An administrative fee of $285 for a summer program, $920 for a semester program, and $1,025 for an academic year of study with a single program or provider is charged to cover the administrative support associated with off-campus study.</p><p>Denison students may pursue one semester of off-campus study with institutional aid eligibility if they submit their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by March 1 and provide the required verification of tax data to the Denison Financial Aid Office by April 1. Estimated Financial Aid Awards are made available to students by June 1 (for fall study), and August 1 (for spring study). While Denison does not provide institutional merit-based aid for off-campus study, institutional needbased aid is available for eligible students.</p><p>A student's eligibility is based on the comprehensive estimated cost of participation for the proposed off-campus study program and the estimated family contribution from the FAFSA. Federal grants, State grants, and Federal loans, as well as any other external sources of aid, are the initial sources for meeting financial need for eligible students. If a student's need is not fully met by those funding sources, Denison grant funding is available to assist in meeting a portion of remaining need. For students with unmet need after the Denison financial packaging process, OCS works with program providers to award additional grants to help bridge this gap. OCS collaborates with the Lisska Center to identify and share information about national scholarships for study abroad, and supports students in the application process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Regulations for Off-Campus Study</head><p>Denison requires that students participate fully and responsibly in all academic aspects of the proposed off-campus study program, including required language and area studies courses. Failure to do so will result in a grade of U (Unsatisfactory) for the off-campus study placeholder course listed on the Denison academic record for the term abroad.</p><p>Students are enrolled for a holding place registration of 12 credits for each term of off-campus study in order to report full-time study to the Federal Clearinghouse to facilitate the portability of financial aid and/ or to use of 529 college funds. Students are therefore required to enroll for at least 12 transferable U.S. semester credits for each semester of off-campus study, but may choose to enroll for up to 20 U.S. semester credits per semester. Students are limited to one course on an S/U grade base per semester. The arrangements for such a choice must be made with the program provider at the time of final registration. Students should notify the Registrar's Office of the arrangement as part of the preapproval process for courses.</p><p>To receive transfer credit for an off-campus study experience, students must work with the Registrar's Office and academic advisors to obtain pre-approval for their courses through the OCS course approval process. Students should meet with a representative of the Registrar's Office no later than December 1st for spring semester study away, and May 1st for fall semester study away. The University is under no obligation to transfer coursework or apply transferred coursework toward specific degree requirements unless that coursework has been approved in advance.</p><p>Students wishing to apply a course toward a major, minor, or concentration requirements must receive approval directly from the relevant department/program. Other coursework will be evaluated for its relevance to the Denison curriculum through the combined efforts of the Registrar, OCS, and, as necessary, specific departments/programs.</p><p>All courses reported on the program provider's transcript are posted to the Denison academic record with course titles, credits, and grades. This includes any course for which a student receives a failing grade, even though credit will not be awarded. While the grades for off-campus study coursework are not factored into the Denison cumulative grade point average, it is important to note that they could be factored into a composite grade point average should a student pursue graduate or professional school after graduating from Denison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review of Disciplinary Records</head><p>Recognizing the role of students as ambassadors of Denison, the special privilege of participating in off-campus programs, and the level of maturity required for students to be successful negotiating the challenges and potential risks associated with study away, OCS routinely consults with the Office of Community Values and Conflict Resolution to assess students' disciplinary history as part of the approval process for off-campus study. Frequency, severity, community impact of violations, and student's disciplinary status (e.g., Disciplinary Probation) are the disciplinary variables that may impact eligibility. Students on disciplinary probation or suspension are not eligible to participate in off-campus study during the semester of probation or suspension. Students must be on campus and cleared of any disciplinary sanctions during the semester prior to study away.</p><p>Violations that occur after a student has been approved for study abroad, but before their departure for off-campus study may also influence a student's eligibility to participate. Denison reserves the right to withhold or rescind approval for any student based on their disciplinary history or violations, regardless of the number of incidents on the student's record.</p><p>The program provider may request information from the student about their disciplinary record as part of the admission process. In these cases, the student will be asked to sign a waiver allowing Denison to provide this information to the program. If you have concerns about how your disciplinary history may affect your eligibility for study away, please convey these during the advising process in OCS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Enrichment Leave of Absence</head><p>Students may apply for an Educational Enrichment Leave of Absence (EEL) to pursue experiential learning opportunities that are not credit bearing or structured educational opportunities whose coursework is not applicable to a Denison Baccalaureate degree. Examples of structured educational opportunities whose coursework is not applicable include the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), Outward Bound, Semester at Sea, specialized technical or training programs, religious education, or culinary institutes.</p><p>Students wishing to pursue an EEL are required to meet with and an advisor in OCS, as well as their academic advisor, and then to submit a written rationale to OCS. The rationale must articulate a clear connection between the student's broader educational goals and the proposed enrichment program. A student may opt to pursue study at a local institution as an adjunct activity as part of an EEL. However, this coursework may not exceed eight credits and must be approved in advance through the normal transfer credit evaluation process. The written rationale should address the plan to obtain credit elsewhere. Please note that there are two deadlines for EELs: the last day of registration in the Fall for the following Spring; and the last day of registration in the Spring for the following Fall. Students should carefully refer to the EEL guidelines described in Global Tools (https://globaltools.denison.edu/index.cfm? FuseAction=Programs.MapSearch) for specific elements to include in the written rationale and submit the rationale electronically to the Director of Off-Campus Study.</p><p>During an EEL, the student retains her/his Denison enrollment deposit and information systems privileges. However, the student is considered withdrawn from Denison during her/his period of leave for the purposes of financial aid and loan deferment. EEL's are usually for one semester, but may extend to an academic year. See the Student Handbook for specific details regarding the processes for registration, housing, and financial aid following a leave. If a student does not enroll at Denison following the EEL, the leave reverts to a Withdrawal and the enrollment deposit is forfeited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insurance Coverage</head><p>Most program providers include medical insurance coverage into their program fee. Some programs do not, however, and encourage students and their families to make certain that their private insurance will provide adequate coverage while the student is abroad. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Advisories, Travel Advisories, and Travel Warnings</head><p>All students studying off-campus are required to register with AlertTraveler in Global Tools. OCS staff will assist students in downloading and use of the app. Denison reserves the right to withdraw its approval for study on an offcampus program if a State Department travel warning or a CDC or WHO travel advisory is in place for the program location at the start of the program. Withdrawal of approval for an off-campus study program bars a student from receiving Denison credit for the program and from applying financial aid to the program costs. To make certain that a student may make an informed decision regarding participation on a program, the issue of potential loss of Denison approval for an accepted program will be brought to the student's attention as far in advance of the program start date as is feasible.</p><p>In the case of a State Department travel warning or a CDC or WHO travel advisory arising after a program has started, Denison will work closely with the educational partner and other informed parties to determine an appropriate course of action. In the case of requiring that a student return home, Denison will pursue reasonable steps with the program provider to mitigate the financial and academic impact of such an action. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Guidelines</head><p>The Organizational Studies program is multidisciplinary in intent and grounded in the liberal arts. Developing a theoretical base for organizational participation and leadership requires moving beyond a single area of specialization. Through a multidisciplinary approach, students will begin to develop;</p><p>1. an understanding of the human condition as it is experienced in organizational life;</p><p>2. an understanding of the complex nature of systems and institutions, and;</p><p>3. the capacity for analysis that moves beyond simplistic solutions to explore the interplay of values, responsibility, and the achievement of social goals.</p><p>The goals of this theoretical base are to be supplemented by, and integrally related to, both a significant internship experience in an appropriate organization and the mastering of specific skills not available in the regular curriculum.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Courses</head><p>The three courses -one from Area A, one from Area B, and an additional one from either area -must be taken from at least two different departments. A Directed Study or Senior Research Project may replace one of the courses. Courses and projects that meet this requirement are designed to focus on an aspect of organizational studies that is particularly appropriate to the student's vocational aspirations, the integrity of the program, and/or the major. Students have the following options:</p><p>i. An integrative directed study (or)</p><p>ii. A senior research/honors project in the major that integrates the program into a new research project (or)</p><p>iii. An elective course approved by the director.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Session</head><p>The premise guiding this four-week session is that organizations need persons capable of examining problems with a critical and imaginative eye and of responding in an ever-changing environment with policies, actions, and decisions derived from a broad knowledge base. A major strength of Denison's liberal arts program is that it fosters the development of this broad knowledge base, as well as criticalthinking and problem-solving skills. The summer seminar focuses on the application of those skills in organizations. Working primarily with Denison alumni/ae, students are introduced to the language and fundamental principles of organizational management, decision-making, marketing, finance, and accounting. Equipped with this information, students serve as consultants for local nonprofit and commercial enterprises, taking on the tasks of researching and analyzing problems, formulating solutions, and presenting findings to clients. In addition, students travel to cities such as New York, Chicago, and Washington to learn first-hand the nature of operations in advertising agencies, investment banks, manufacturing plants, and other organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internship and Integrative Paper</head><p>The internship should take place during the months following the summer session. The internship will become the venue where coursework and the summer seminar are brought into play. The completion of the internship shall result in a major, integrative paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy Departmental Guidelines</head><p>To do philosophy is to encounter some of the most fundamental questions that can be asked about human existence. Philosophical investigation leads students to recognize the potentially unnoticed assumptions that underpin even our most ordinary ways of interacting with other persons and engaging in human projects. Such assumptions concern, for example, the nature of human knowledge, action, and value. Philosophy challenges students to move beyond uncritical patterns of thought, to recognize problems, and to exchange a more naive worldview for a more considered and justifiable one. In doing so, students learn to think in ways that are simultaneously disciplined and imaginative. Philosophy Department faculty members cooperatively approach these concerns from diverse perspectives, both in studying the works of major philosophers and in their own creative activity. Students are encouraged to join with the faculty in this inquiry and to philosophize creatively on their own. The courses and seminars in the Department are intended to develop the abilities necessary for these activities.</p><p>Typically students without previous experience with philosophy will enroll in PHIL 101 -Introduction to Philosophy, PHIL 121 -Ethics: Philosophical Considerations of Morality or PHIL 126 -Social and Political Philosophy.</p><p>Students who wish to continue in Philosophy and perhaps to major or minor in it will often take PHIL 231 -Greek and Medieval Philosophy or PHIL 232 -Modern Philosophy as their second course. These are required courses for the major and prerequisites for some of our upper-level courses. However, there are many ways to move through our curriculum depending on a student's particular interests and departmental offerings in any given semester.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy Minor</head><p>Philosophy, by its very nature, is ideally suited to assist a student in integrating and articulating knowledge gained in other areas. For this reason we attempt to tailor a student's minor program in Philosophy around the specific course of studies being pursued in the selected major subject. This means that our minor program places a premium upon departmental advising.</p><p>Each Philosophy minor is required to choose a department member as a Philosophy advisor. The Philosophy advisor will not replace the student's primary academic advisor. However, the Philosophy advisor will have responsibility for guiding the student in designing the minor program in Philosophy. A minor in Philosophy requires five courses in the department. Among these courses must be PHIL 231 -Greek and Medieval Philosophy or PHIL 232 -Modern Philosophy and at least one course numbered 300 or higher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest</head><p>Additional information about Philosophy courses and a course guide with more detailed descriptions of current courses may be obtained from the Philosophy Department, and is available on the department's website (https://denison.edu/academics/philosophy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Titus-Hepp Lecture Series</head><p>Each year the department sponsors a colloquium series, bringing to campus nationally and internationally known philosophers who present their current work and meet with students and faculty. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Philosophy Activities</head><p>The Philosophy Department annually publishes a national undergraduate philosophy journal, Episteme. This journal is edited and produced by philosophy majors and minors in consultation with a faculty advisor. Episteme encourages and receives submissions from undergraduate philosophy students throughout the country and internationally. In addition, philosophy students organize Philosophy Coffees, informal discussions of philosophical topics, about three times each semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 232 -Modern Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Thinkers such as Rene Descartes, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant are currently referred to so often, in so many different contexts, that their names have been transformed into immediately recognizable adjectives (Cartesian, Humean, Kantian). But what did these philosophers actually believe? And why did they believe it? This course is an intermediate-level survey of western philosophy from their period (now known as the "Early Modern" or "Modern" era, which runs roughly from 1600-1800). While these and other thinkers (such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley) in this era dealt with a wide variety of subjects, we will focus mostly on their contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. We will address their writings with three different aims: a) to appreciate the sense in which they were, at one time, fresh and radical; b) to understand how, for better or for worse, they set the foundation for much of the modern-western, anyway-worldview; and c) to determine if what they say is either true or false. Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 250 -Philosophy of Law (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Does law have an intrinsic connection with the moral order, or is it whatever a legislature or judge says it is? This course will analyze the concept of law, with particular attention given to the conflict between the natural law tradition and legal positivism. The justification of legal authority and the nature of legal reasoning will be considered. Normative issues, including the relation between law and concepts of justice, equality, liberty, responsibility, and punishment will also be addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisite(s):</head><p>One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 260 -Environmental Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course investigates the question of our ethical relations and responsibility to objects and systems in the natural world, including animals, other living beings, non-living entities, ecosystems, and "nature" as a whole. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 275 -Philosophy of Feminism (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Feminism and philosophy both make the invisible visible, the implicit explicit. Both make us aware of assumptions we make in our everyday lives and challenge us to justify them. This course examines ways in which feminist theory enriches philosophy and vice versa. Feminist criticism probes some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions about our knowledge of and interaction with the world and other people. How does feminism destabilize philosophy and affect philosophical conceptions of knowledge, reality, metaphysics, agency, or morality? How does philosophy enrich feminist understandings of oppression, privilege, or equality? We will consider a range of forms of oppression and privilege, particularly as they affect women, and conceptions of sex, gender, and race in the context of debates about gender violence, work and family, as well as feminist discussions of epistemology, ethics, and science. Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or Women's and Gender Studies, or consent. Crosslisting: QS 275, WGST 275.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 280 -Philosophy of Mind (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course addresses fundamental questions regarding the nature of the human mind and thought. Students will be introduced to the leading contemporary theories of mind as well as critical responses to these theories. They will become acquainted with the works of philosophers such as Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Daniel Dennett, Patricia Churchland, Fred Dretske, Ruth Millikan, Hillary Putnam, and others. We will address questions such as whether we can know there are other minds, whether mental states are identical or reducible to brain states, how it is that our thoughts can be about anything at all, whether there is a "language of thought", and whether our ordinary talk about mental events genuinely explains human actions. Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, Neuroscience concentrator, or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 440 -Senior Symposium (1 Credit Hour)</head><p>In the spring semester, senior philosophy majors orally present a paper in a symposium format to their peers and to philosophy faculty.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Senior Research (one semester)</head><p>Core courses are chosen to provide students with a basic understanding in each of the three disciplines. Electives allow students to concentrate on a specific area or topic of interest and the senior research project offers a capstone experience where students integrate their work in the three disciplines. In effect, the PPE major is a double major distributed across three departments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Courses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives</head><p>A student must select five additional advanced courses in at least two of the three departments. The courses which satisfy this requirement must be approved by the PPE Committee. Under special circumstances, and with the approval of the PPE Committee, a student may be permitted to fulfill up to two elective requirements with courses outside of the Political Science, Economics, and Philosophy departments. It is the responsibility of each student's PPE advisor and ultimately, the PPE Committee, to see that the student's course of study realizes the overall goals of the PPE Program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Research</head><p>In addition to completing the course sequence indicated above, each PPE student must complete at least one semester of senior research culminating in a senior research project linking the three areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PPE Course of Study Proposal</head><p>Each prospective PPE major must submit a formal PPE course of study proposal (COSP) by mid-March of their sophomore year, indicating a general topic or theme that will serve as the focus of the major and proposing a program of more focused courses for their elective. The COSP must include an account of the student's progress toward completion of the core courses and an argument regarding why the proposed elective courses prepare them for senior research. This course of study proposal must be approved by the PPE committee before the student registers for the junior year.</p></div>

Political Science, as a discipline, is divided into four subfields:</p><p>1. Political Theory -focus on normative issues such as the purpose of government and notions of liberty, justice, and governance;</p><p>2. American Politics -seeks to explain political phenomena in the United States;</p><p>3. Comparative Politics -the study of domestic-level politics around the world;</p><p>4. International Relations -concentrates on the interaction between and among states, as well as with transnational non-state actors.</p><p>We strongly encourage students to take courses in each of the four subfields for breadth, and to develop a depth of knowledge by choosing elective courses that create an area of expertise in one of the subfields.</p><p>All majors must take:</p><p>• one course in American Politics (course numbers ending with 01-19);</p><p>• one course in Political Theory (course numbers ending with 80-89);</p><p>• one course in either: Comparative Politics (course numbers ending with 20-39) or International Relations (course numbers ending with 40-59);</p><p>• POSC 201 -Analyzing Politics. This is the research methods course for the department and should be taken in the sophomore year.</p><p>• A second 200-level course. In order to further refine students' research and writing skills in political science, we have designated a number of courses to follow on and expand the skills taught in POSC 201 -Analyzing Politics. These courses have a substantive area in one of the four subfields of the discipline as well as a stronger focus on skills such as reading, writing, critical thinking, and research methodology/approaches. This course should be taken in the semester following POSC 201 -Analyzing Politics.</p><p>• POSC 491 -Senior Seminar. Senior seminars are offered in the fall semester each year and should be taken in the senior year; juniors may take a senior seminar if space allows.</p><p>Additional rules:</p><p>• A maximum of three 100-level courses may count towards the major;</p><p>• Students studying off campus may transfer a maximum of two major courses for a one semester off-campus experience and three for a year long off-campus experience;</p><p>• Neither directed study nor independent study courses may be used to fulfill major requirements;</p><p>• The two-semester senior research sequence counts as one course for the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Political Science Minor</head><p>A minor in Political Science is six courses and must include:</p><p>• one course in American Politics (course numbers ending with 01-19);</p><p>• one course in Political Theory (course numbers ending with 80-89);</p><p>• one course in either: Comparative Politics (course numbers ending with 20-39) or International Relations (course numbers ending with 40-59).</p><p>Additional rules:</p><p>• Neither directed study nor independent study courses may be used to fulfill minor requirements;</p><p>• Only two 100-level courses may count towards the minor.</p></div>

The 200 level "doing political science classes" are designed to focus on issues of method and writing skills expanding on what you learned about skills and methods in 201 and preparing you for upper division work in political science while also focusing on one of the major subfields of political science. This course focuses on the involvement of the public in American political processes. We will address such questions as: Why do citizens vote? For whom do they vote? How else do citizens involve themselves in the political process and why? What does the public think about political issues? What forces can change the nature, concerns, and behavior of the electorate? What are the prospects for a workable participatory democracy in America? The course is geared toward the conduct of statistically-based research on substantive problems in American political behavior. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110 and POSC 201.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 214 -Doing Political Science: Foreign Policy Formulation (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Foreign policy formulation is concerned with how internal factors shape a state's policy toward the outside world. Traditionally, foreign policy analysts considered the state as a unitary actor. Today, we are more appreciative of the multiple domestic inputs in foreign policy making, and more sophisticated in the use of analytic tools to facilitate our understanding of the foreign policy formulation process. The class is structured around four distinct "sources" of US foreign policy formulation: institutional; role; societal; and, individual. While we cover each source in distinct units for purposes of analytic clarity, throughout our study we will observe that no one decision can be explained fully without some overlap of sources.</p></div>

Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 307 -The Politics of Congress (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The U.S. Congress is often considered the 'First Branch" of the federal government, and by its construction is easily the most complex. In this course we will consider the politics that underlie the development and operation of the contemporary Congress, detail the legislative process and its organization. We will consider how various institutions such as parties, committees, and procedures help legislators reach their goals and help solve problems such as collective action, voting cycles, and ambition. While we begin by looking at Congress at its inception and the electoral goals of members, the course will quickly move to the development of these institutions and in the early Twentieth Century <ref type="bibr">(pre-1974)</ref> and their use today. Over the course of the semester, we will apply our institutional study of Congress to current events and through a multi-week simulation of the legislative process. Since many of the readings make use of existing quantitative data and existing research prior experience with this type of material at the level of POSC 201 or an equivalent is recommended. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 309 -Campaigns and Elections (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course examines the structure, strategy, and influence of federal campaigns and elections in the United States. With a focus on both Congressional and Presidential campaign contests the course explores topics such as primary and nominating politics, the role of money in elections, candidate selection, incumbency advantage, the influence of elections on voting behavior, campaign strategy, advertising, and election reform. Throughout the course we will apply the readings to analyze the current election cycle, historical trends, and election forecasting. In addition, students will participate in a simulated campaign exercise. By the end of the semester students will complete a research paper investigating data related to congressional campaigns centered on questions raised by one or more of the topics covered in class. POSC 110 is a prerequisite for the course and POSC 201 is highly recommended. The course counts towards the fulfillment of Lugar Track I program requirements. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>

The course will trace the development of U.S. military and diplomatic policy regarding Vietnam, assess the various lessons attributed to the Vietnam experience, and consider how application of these lessons has altered American's attitudes toward interventionism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 326 -Radical Right Parties and Politics in Europe (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>What accounts for the emergence, persistence and demise of "radical" or "far right" political parties in Europe? After a period of post-war stability, European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led to several new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation; a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; and the emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This course focuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in Western Europe during the 1980's and 1990's. Specifically we focus on what many scholars label the "far" or "radical" right. These parties tend to be organized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizing nationalism, exclusion of "foreigners, " a strong state, welfare chauvinism and, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semester students will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties and their politics across Europe and discern the differences between what scholars describe as "populist radical" or "populist far" right parties from other parties on the extreme right, namely neofascist or neo-Nazis parties which are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 328 -Politics of the Environment (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course is about the theoretical, political, and practical problems associated with environmental action. Course materials analyze various theoretical perspectives on the relationship between humans and nature, and they illustrate how different ethics lead to widely different prescriptions for personal and political action. Course materials also offer examples of how environmental problems have in fact been addressed or not by governmental, non-governmental, and international institutions. This is not a course on the physical processes of environmental problems, but rather it emphasizes the political, economic, and theoretical contexts within which efforts are made to act on environmental threats. No prior knowledge of environmental or political science is required. However, students should be prepared to read and interpret detailed social science texts, to formulate and articulate cogent arguments, and to conduct independent research. Course fulfills the ENVS Social Science requirement. Crosslisting: ENVS 328.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 332 -Politics in Latin America, Africa, and Asia (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course explores the politics of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America in their historical socioeconomic contexts. The goals of the course include familiarizing students with the details of politics in selected countries and understanding important concepts of political science by applying them to the case study countries. Emphasis will be placed on using concepts and theories to analyze and critique arguments. No prior knowledge of the developing world is required. However, students will be expected to identify and analyze issues germane to the developing world, read and critique systematically, form and defend arguments and opinions, conduct independent library research, pose researchable questions, and discuss readings and research findings in class.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 341 -The Conduct of American Foreign Policy (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course explores the evolution of U.S. foreign policy from the beginning of the Cold War to the present day. The course focuses on the responses of successive American administrations to potential or actual threats to the national interests of the U.S. Emphasis will be placed on the containment doctrine, its application in Vietnam, and subsequent efforts to replace containment following the end of the Vietnam war and the end of the Cold War.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 344 -The United Nations and World Problems (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The founding of public international organizations represent an attempt to bring order to an unruly international system. International organizations are formal institutions established by states to address global problems. They include not only the United Nations, but also many other public or private, international, national or local, formal or informal institutions. Collectively, these institutions engage in global governance. Our goals in this course are to understand the theoretical and practical approaches to international organizations and global governance, the limitations under which global governance operates, and the future prospects for a system of global governance. This course has a substantial oral component and oral skills work and so satisfies the University's oral general education requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 345 -Human Rights in Global Perspective (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course analyzes the emergence, expansion and enforcement of international human rights norms. Students taking the course will acquire an enhanced understanding of the United Nations, national governments, nongovernmental organizations, customary international law, treaty law, regional courts, and international tribunals in articulating and enforcing human rights. Students will acquire a broad understanding of human rights as a topic of both intellectual inquiry and political action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 346 -The European Union (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The course explores the peculiarities of the EU and what makes it a unique organization, sharing characteristics of a state and characteristics of a traditional international organization. First, we will place the study of European integration in a historical context. Then we will make sense of the various decision-making processes and institutional actors of the EU. We will also examine theories of European integration to understand competing explanations for the integration process. Fourth, various policy areas will be studied to show how the power of the EU is distributed unevenly across areas. During the final two weeks of the course we will simulate a gathering of the European Council. This course has a substantial oral component and oral skills work and so satisfies the University's oral general education requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 347 -The Middle East in World Affairs (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the political history, international significance, and the dimensions of political life in the Middle East. Owing to the ever-present potential for conflict, the seeming intractability of disputes, and the oil factor, what happens in the Middle East is of vital importance to international politics. We examine the role that politics in the Middle East has played in world affairs as well as the region's importance in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 348 -Foreign and Security Policy in Western Europe (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course aims to compare key post Cold War foreign policy behaviors during crisis situations concerning the three "big" states in Western Europe: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (also referred to as the EU3, as they all are members of the European Union (EU). Why is it that we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries which have been the most important allies for the US in the past fifty years? Are these countries "middle powers" or "big powers"? What role do they play in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europe also conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU, or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviate from the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lack the means and influence to project their power beyond the confines of Europe. Thus, the "three big" can be put in a special category because of their status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors we first establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreign policy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guides our analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-making processes, the domestic and international environment, and foreign policy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, state and systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparing the foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Specific areas of inquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making, group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national role conception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes in the international system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 349 -Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since the beginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorism dates only from <ref type="bibr">the French Revolution (1789</ref><ref type="bibr">-1799</ref>. In this course, we will explore what terrorism is, whether it is new (and why some analysts argue it is), who uses terrorist tactics, why they do so, and how terrorism differs from other forms of political violence such as war, insurgency, and so on. We will investigate various definitions of terrorism. Most scholars think that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorism as planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lot of disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how it can be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We will compare the various definitions and perspectives to determine which might work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, we will focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science and how they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, and the media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 353 -Russian Foreign and Military Policy (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course we will seek to understand the motives and objectives of Russian foreign and military policies. We will look at Russian interests throughout the world with particular attention to the 'near abroad' (countries that were part of the Soviet Union), China, and Europe as well as the US-Russian relationship. Issues of arms sales, military power, and the politics of energy (oil and gas) will form a significant portion of the course.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, social and intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires us to break away from the notion that our native language is the most natural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience. An education can start with the discovery that all words are purely conventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions, articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning another language contributes to our education by intimately exploring cultural and linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it means to be human in today's world.</p><p>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. When students take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the target language in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of its courses because it believes that students can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode of expression. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest General Departmental Regulations</head><p>Students who want to fulfill the basic requirement in language by continuing one begun in secondary school will find it advantageous to begin their course work in the first year. The Department of Modern Languages strongly recommends that students complete their language requirement by the end of their sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language Lab</head><p>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27 Macs, zone-free Blu-ray player and document camera. It also has a VIA Connect PRO, which is a wireless collaboration and presentation solution that makes sharing and presenting easier for all computers in the room. The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside the classroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborative writing projects, as well as discussions of authenticated materials published on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualized instruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a variety of digital materials for class discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural Enrichment</head><p>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunities for cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunities include, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, movies and performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars and performers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become more readily available to our students. These opportunities are made possible through a most generous endowment bestowed on the Department </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Foresman Lounge</head><p>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denison community with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions, classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette with a table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is also equipped with a wide range of technological devices with which to enrich our students' learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screen TV connected to a zone-free Blu-ray player and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted laser projector that connects to a networked Mac computer, the Blu-ray player and document camera.</p><p>Although the Department of Modern Languages offers majors in French, German and Spanish, it also offers courses in other languages for the purpose of general education and support of other college programs. Courses in Portuguese are listed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language and Culture Program</head><p>This exciting residential option gives students the opportunity to hone their language skills and to participate in special cultural events. Students who choose this residential option will live in a small community of their peers who share their enthusiasm for languages and cultures. Extracurricular activities and programming in the Language House support language acquisition and permit a closer relationship with professors and language assistants from the Department of Modern Languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychology Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Some of the major goals of our course offerings in the Department include:</p><p>• Presenting overviews of contemporary psychology, thus providing students with knowledge of what psychologists do;</p><p>• Stimulating interest and curiosity about human and animal phenomena;</p><p>• Indicating applications of psychology to personal and social issues. Some examples of these applications concern study techniques and academic performance, the effects of anxiety or stress on performance, and the role of prejudice in society;</p><p>• Developing an understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry and methodology;</p><p>• Facilitating and encouraging the discovery of connections between psychology and other disciplines.</p><p>Some examples include connections between psychology and biology (e.g., neuroscience), computer science, and philosophy (e.g., cognitive science), psychological questions raised in the humanities and arts, and psychological assumptions in political, social, and economic theories.</p><p>The first priority for all majors should be to obtain a firm foundation in the basic topic areas of psychology and in research methodologies. For this reason, psychology majors are urged to select a broad range of courses in addition to those offerings that are particularly relevant to their primary interests. Students of psychology should aim for both breadth and depth of knowledge in the discipline. The requirements for a major in psychology at Denison are relatively flexible in order to provide students with the opportunity to select those courses and experiences that best complement their personal goals. At the same time, the flexibility of these requirements necessitates that psychology majors work closely with their academic advisors to develop an appropriate plan of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing Program Statement:</head><p>Psychology students will demonstrate competence in reviewing, developing, conducting, and analyzing psychological research, and crucially, in communicating scientific research to diverse audiences. Writing manuscripts describing their empirical psychological research will be one core-learning goal. Students will write formal research reports that are modeled on the major components of the American Psychological Association's Publication Manual. The development of these essential scientific writing skills will be coordinated across the department's research courses; those are developmentally and systematically linked at the 200 and 300-levels. Writing critical analyses or literature reviews of research will be a second core-learning goal. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychology Majors</head><p>Students should select a psychology department faculty member as their primary or secondary advisor when they declare a major or minor in psychology. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychology Minor</head><p>Students with a major in another department will find a minor in psychology to be a significant contribution to their education. To best complement the major area of study, students should carefully select those psychology courses that have the most direct relevance to that major. These choices should be made in consultation with a member of the psychology faculty.</p><p>A minor in psychology requires the completion of seven courses in Psychology. Required courses for the minor include the following: </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">•</formula></div>

These issues include mind-body relations; processes of knowledge acquisition such as perception and learning; nature and nurture; the nature of mind and consciousness; characteristics of human motivation and personality; and the nature of thought and memory. The philosophy of scientific inquiry in relation to the field of psychology is also considered. Many issues considered connect to the current states of modern psychology. The course is a unifying experience for psychology majors. Prerequisite(s): PSYC 100 or PSYC 199, junior or senior status or consent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Queer Studies (Concentration) Program Guidelines</head><p>An evolving and expanding discipline, Queer Studies encompasses theories and thinkers from many fields: cultural studies, gay and lesbian studies, transgender studies, race studies, women's and gender studies, literature, history, film, media, postmodernism, post-colonialism, and more. By engaging with this diverse range of fields, the work of Queer Studies distinguishes itself in that it focuses on issues surrounding sexuality and gender (and other axes of marginalized identity) and the way(s) that the questions raised in these other arenas might be modulated through that central lens. The Queer Studies Program seeks to legitimate academic inquiry into sexuality, sex, and gender, to pose questions of normativity and power, and to foster community with and for historically marginalized groups. In queer studies courses, students will consider the lived experience and intersecting histories and identities of diverse populations of queer people. Students will examine critically the social, cultural, and scientific constructs of sexuality and gender as well as acquire a working knowledge of the history, issues, and theories of queer studies. Students will make connections between queer studies as an interdisciplinary program and the broader liberal arts curriculum. Queer Studies aims to empower and equip students to engage with communities-both local and global-as agents of social change.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Queer Studies Concentration</head><p>The Queer Studies concentration requires a total of six courses. Three of these are core requirements, and three are electives that typically are offered by other programs or departments and are cross-listed with Queer Studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Requirements</head><p>The required core courses are:</p><p>• QS 101 -Introduction to Queer Studies</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• QS 227 -Queer Theory</head><p>• QS 400 -Senior Seminar</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives</head><p>The Queer Studies concentration requires students to complete three elective courses from among those approved by the Queer Studies</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Queer Studies (Concentration)</head><p>Committee based on the following criteria, or through petition to the Committee:</p><p>At least two-thirds of the course should focus on: some aspect of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender experience, culture, and history; and/or relevant issues or themes (privilege, oppression, sexual behavior, identity, performance, social movements, etc.); and/or conceptual categories (gender, sexuality, etc.) central to the field of Queer Studies.</p><p>Any course in the concentration should address the relationship between the normative and the transgressive. Through these courses students should gain an understanding of, and respect for, differences in human identity such as age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexuality, race, and religion. Courses that already meet the criteria for Queer Studies electives, or that can be readily adapted to meet the above criteria through negotiations between instructor and student, include (but are not limited to) the following: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QS 227 -Queer Theory (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Queer Theory is an interdisciplinary course designed to introduce students to historical and theoretical treatments of topics such as the essentialism vs. constructionism debate; intersections of race/gender/ class and sexual orientation; science and representation; performativity and normativity; and ethics, politics, and law. At some point in the past it was cross-listed with WGST 379, but recent iterations have not been cross-listed, and currently we have no plans to cross-list the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QS 229 -Mediating Gender and Sexuality (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this class we will examine and evaluate the cultural construction and representation of gender and sexuality in contemporary American mass media, and trace their development throughout the 20th century. We will focus on a variety of mass-produced commercial media texts, surveying television, magazines, advertising, and popular music. Although gender is the primary identity construction examined in the course, we will also pay close attention to other aspects of identity that define American women, such as ethnicity, class, and sexuality. We will investigate representational issues in relation to their political repercussion, and draw from a broad range of academic literature, including feminist television criticism, film theory, cultural studies, communication theory, and popular music criticism. Crosslisting: COMM 229.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QS 235 -Introduction to Black Studies (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>An introductory study of the Black experience in America, this course will survey the field by examining in series, the various social institutions that comprise Black American life.

One of the purposes of this course is to provide students a venue in which to discuss the meanings of sex, gender identity, gender performance, gender roles, and sexual orientation-both in their relationships to each other and their intersections with race, ethnicity, class, religion, culture, and location. Such relationships are central to the themes of the topics course materials selected each semester. The course further seeks to bring a diverse group of faculty and staff together with students to engage in conversation and to learn collaboratively about concepts and themes in Queer Studies. Students may enroll in Queer Night multiple times since the films screened and materials assigned will be different each semester.</p></div>

In asking why women and women's experience seem to be missing from the tradition of philosophy, it implicitly questions philosophy's claim to objectivity, universality, and truth. Thus, feminist criticism probes some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions about our knowledge of and interaction with the world and other people. Are there philosophically significant differences between men and women? This course examines this and other questions, emphasizing contemporary feminist discussions of epistemology, ethics, and science. Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or Women's and Gender Studies or consent. Crosslisting: PHIL 275, WGST 275.</p></div>

Students will be encouraged to become reflective about their own theoretical stances and to consider how societies can move closer to justice for both women and men. Prerequisite(s): One Women's and Gender Studies course or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QS 323 -Transgender Studies/Transgender Issues (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course offers an introduction to the growing interdisciplinary field of Transgender Studies, focusing on key figures and writings that contributed to its development. Transgender Studies is primarily concerned with directing critical concentration on the diversity and politics of gender, the embodied experience of transgender people, as well as the material conditions and representational strategies that surround, enable, and constrain trans* lives. We will consider relevant selections of scholarship in feminist, queer, and transgender studies; first-person and autobiographical writings by transgender people; and media representations of transgender people and politics that are shaping perspectives of gender within our contemporary cultural moment. Transgender scholarship and perspectives made available by transgender lives provide opportunities to consider and critique the range of apparatuses and systems of regulations that produce the limits and frontiers of embodying sex and gender.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Guidelines</head><p>The academic study of religion is a multi-disciplinary exploration of the many ways in which religion functions in the lives of individuals, American society, and the global community. It critically examines the role of religion as an active force that has social, ethical, and ideological consequences. Students learn to assess how religion has shaped their cultures, their family lives, their suppositions of what matters and what is ethical, and their sense of who they are. Students thus gain the analytical, relational, and expressive skills essential to a liberal arts education.</p><p>One need not be religious to study religion. The academic study is a lens through which the persistence of religion in the social sphere becomes evident and the personal sphere is enriched. This academic exercise confirms and contests the prevailing sense of reality. What is considered normal in our society is subject to critical review. In the process it enhances skill-sets with transfer value in the vocational sphere as well as deepened awareness of what defines us as individuals and nations. Critical consciousness on moral issues, global relationships, and the existence of community is a result of this academic exercise.</p><p>Therefore, the questions raised may be more important than the answers constructed. Students who study religion learn how to ask these critical questions. 2. a concentration of at least three courses in designated areas, designed in consultation with the student's Religion Department advisor;</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points of Interest Off Campus Study</head><p>Denison University works to make study abroad and other off-campus study possible for all students, typically during their junior year. Most students who major in Religion transfer one or two courses for the concentration within the Religion major, satisfy a GE requirement or two, and gain general credits towards graduation. Quite a few do independent research or internships as part of their study abroad experience. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study office to explore options, and to meet with a faculty advisor in the Religion Department to discuss how study abroad can best be integrated into the student's major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spanish Departmental Guidelines</head><p>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, social and intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires us to break away from the notion that our native language is the most natural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience. An education can start with the realization that all words are purely conventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions, articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning another language contributes to our education by intimately exploring cultural and linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. When students take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the target language in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of its courses because it believes that students can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode of expression.</p><p>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encourages integrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Courses in cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, also present multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectual experience.</p><p>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroad with programs approved by Denison should consult members of the Department and the Office of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-Campus Programs). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of the language are provided by the Language and Culture Program, language tables, international films, club meetings, and similar activities sponsored by the Department. There are as well subsidized field trips to museums and pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some cases international travel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spanish Program Mission</head><p>Our mission is to enrich students' views on life by learning Spanish and crossing cultures in an intellectually challenging context.

Our program is a rigorous, intellectually stimulating and fulfilling endeavor, responding to an ever-changing world. It integrates culture, language, and literature through, and across, multiple perspectives and methodologies. It also forges ties with many other departments throughout the university so that our discipline can facilitate research and the acquisition of knowledge across the curriculum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals for the Major</head><p>In our courses students cultivate functional language abilities and develop knowledge of the cultures and literature of Spanishspeaking peoples.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural Enrichment</head><p>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunities for cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunities include, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, movies and performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars and performers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become more readily available to our students. These opportunities are made possible through a most generous endowment bestowed on the Department of Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Department maintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denison community members can view upcoming events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Foresman Lounge</head><p>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denison community with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions, classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette with a table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is also equipped with a wide range of technological devices with which to enrich students' learning experiences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>Spanish major and minor students are highly encouraged to study in a Spanish-speaking country through an approved academic program. Courses must be approved by the departmental coordinator before going abroad in order to be considered for Spanish credit. The Spanish section will not evaluate a study-abroad course for transfer without evidence (syllabus, course description, reading list, etc.) of the content of the course. To receive Spanish language credit, study abroad courses must be pursued in Spanish, be content based, and be similar in quality and content to a Spanish course at Denison. Students are encouraged to take courses that enrich the Denison curriculum; neither technical courses nor orientation sessions can receive academic credit. Summer programs: Students may study in an approved summer program that is at least 6 weeks long and 45 hours, minimum. One course will transfer towards a major/minor from summer study. </p></div>

This is not just a question of content but also of method; Women's and Gender Studies scholarship uses methods that are inflected by interdisciplinarity and transnationalism. Students explore how Women's and Gender Studies treats gender issues from the perspectives of different disciplines, such as anthropology, biology,black studies, communication, international studies, philosophy,political science, sociology, etc. and how these issues manifest differently in different national and transnational contexts. Students thus develop their understanding of these issues by taking into account the intersections among this array of disciplines and sociocultural and geographic locations.</p><p>Third, we aim to show students the real-life and everyday implications of their academic engagement. That is, we challenge students to see the relationship between theory and practice: to see how the academic study of race, class, and gender locally and globally is informed by and has the power to transform real lives, both others' and our own.</p></div>

Students select additional, usually cross-listed courses according to Women's and Gender Studies Program guidelines and their own interests.</p><p>The required courses in the major and minor explore gender and justice issues, provide the methods and information to conduct rigorous analysis, engage our students in ways that challenge them to expand their thinking about the material they meet in the world, and give them the opportunity to embody feminist pedagogies. The elective courses will do the same in the context of their fields of study. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WGST 327 -Women and Social Ethics in the Global Context (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>"The personal is internationally political!" Whether we are aware or not, we live in the globalized world and our actions here and now affect the lives of millions of people whom we may never meet face to face. Through the religious concept of "interdependence" with the secular understanding of "women's rights as human rights, " this course will analyze and explore globalized issues of poverty, war, sex-trafficking, migration, reproductive rights, and religious conflict as well as ethically consider how diverse social groups are interconnected to each other beyond national and religious boundaries; and how we study, analyze, and practice transnational feminist activism for all humanity. This course In its examination of current critical issues in U.S. education, the central concern throughout this course is the relationship between teachers and students; schools and society; and people and the world. Particular attention is given to critical and feminist pedagogies informed by critical theory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Guidelines</head><p>The Writing Program affirms the importance Denison places on inculcating in our students the importance of learning to write, not only as a means of expressing themselves, but also as a way of learning. We believe that good writers take intellectual risks, explore ideas, make connections, and participate in broader, on-going conversations through writing. Our program aims to develop these habits of mind. We expect students to be able to make cogent arguments, anticipate and meet the needs of their audience, gather and synthesize evidence, and apply the conventions of style and grammar. By repeated experiences in writingintensive courses situated within the context of academic programs across the university, students will develop writing skills and deepen their liberal arts education.</p><p>This program consists of three parts:</p><p>1. W 101 -First-Year Writing Workshop taken during the first year, 2. two writing-intensive courses (W-overlays), one of which must be completed by the end of the sophomore year, and 3. any writing requirement specific to each student's major (as applicable).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses W 101 -First-Year Writing Workshop (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Required of all students during their first year, the W101 course introduces students to the rigors of college-level writing and provides practice in formulating and presenting a significant argument in a cogent essay; in finding, evaluating, and incorporating research into their writing; and in assessing their own work and that of their peers. W101 can be used only to satisfy the "S" Writing GE requirement. Open to First Year students only. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advising Circles (AC)</head><p>AC 101 -Advising Circles (1 Credit Hour) This is a 1 credit discussion based course limited to twelve students and led by a faculty member who is also the academic advisor for these students. The class meets once per week for roughly an hour each session. The course is graded S/U (satisfactory, unsatisfactory) which is based largely on class participation. External work (reading and writing) is kept small to reflect the 1 credit nature of the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropology and Sociology (ANSO)</head><p>ANSO 100 -People, Culture and Society (4 Credit Hours) An examination of fundamental questions concerning the nature and foundations of sociocultural behavior.

This course is required of all majors and minors in Anthropology/Sociology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 199 -Introductory Topics in Anthropology and Sociology (1-4 Credit Hours)</head><p>A general category used only in the evaluation of transfer credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 210 -Sex and Gender in Society (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course compares and evaluates a variety of theories which attempt to explain the origins, persistence and effects of gender in American society. In particular, it explores a number of settings that may include: the family, the work place, the political arena, religious activity, violence against women, and face-to-face interactional contexts. Special attention is given to the ways in which race, ethnicity, class and sexual orientation shape gender experiences. Although its primary focus is American society, the course compares problems of sexual inequality in American society with other, quite different, societies in order to gain a comparative understanding of how discrimination, prejudice, and structural inequality, wherever they are found, create special problems for women. Throughout, the focus is on learning to use structural, historical, and theoretical information as guides to understanding social change and the choices facing women and men. Crosslisting: WGST 210.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 212 -Race and Ethnicity (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Contrary to the expectations of many modern social theorists, race and ethnicity continue to be important elements in the lives of contemporary people, serving as frameworks through which individual identities, community actions, and cultural meanings are interpreted. This course will introduce students to the sociocultural analysis of racial and ethnic identities. How did ethnic and racial identities and communities develop over time? Why does race, though now understood to be a social rather than a biological category, continue to be (mis)understood as a biological category? How do aspects of political, class, gender, and sexual identities influence racial and ethnic identities? We will use a global perspective to understand the conception of race and ethnicity. We will explore these topics among others including cultural and historical variability of ethnic and racial categories, the dialectical formation of identity, and the persistence of certain forms of racial and ethnic prejudice. Students will be expected to examine critically their own common assumptions and presuppositions about race and ethnicity, and to begin developing the theoretical tools for interpreting life in an ethnically diverse world. Crosslisting: BLST 212.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 217 -Religion and Society (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course investigates the relationship between religion and society, and the social dimension of religious truth-claims. The central theme entails a cross-cultural study of religious influences on both social stability and change or revolution. In exploring this tension between religion and existing socioeconomic and political orders, we will consider examples such as religious movements, as well as the ritual life of both the individual's life cycle and wider social and political institutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 221 -Contemporary Japan (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Japan often conjures images steeped in tradition such as samurai warriors, sumo wrestlers, and geisha clad in kimono. At the same time, however, contemporary Japan is just as easily associated with businessmen, anime, automobiles, and high technology. How have "tradition" and "change" fueled competing visions of Japan what it means to be "Japanese"? How does one go about reconciling these conflicting views? How have these debates evolved over time? How have variously situated individuals and groups in society negotiated shifting circumstances? These questions will be at the heart of this seminar as we consider case studies from different segments of Japanese society. A range of material will be treated as "texts" for analysis and discussion including anime, manga, literary works, and films as well as ethnographic scholarship on Japanese society. Crosslisting: EAST 221.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 224 -Human Origins and Prehistory (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course begins with a review of biological anthropology's view of humanity. How do humans appear when studied with the tools biologists have developed to understand other species?</p><p>We then explore what we know about the lives of our earliest ancestors and the clusters of new human-like species emerging over the next few million years, including our own about 200,000 years ago. The last part of the class turns to archaeological views of humanity. We survey the diversity of human experiences as our ancestors spread around the globe, creating art, starting farms, and building cities. Throughout, our emphasis will be on how researchers know what they know and what assumptions are built into different narratives of human origins.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 321 -Anthropology of Human Rights (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This seminar interrogates the social life of rights by situating human rights within critical analyses of law, society, and culture. A brief examination of key human rights documents and institutions will be followed by an analysis of topics and case studies selected to juxtapose Asian and Western contexts. A primary concern of this seminar will be to scrutinize how human rights get reworked and refashioned in a range of local settings by various actors on the ground pursing social justice. Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100 or consent.</p><p>ANSO 331 -Culture, Society and the Individual (4 Credit Hours) This course examines the relationship between individuals, their society and culture. This involves looking at differing cultural conceptions of "human nature", and the way in which both "intelligence" and the emotions are "cultural performances." The nature of the "self", indeed, the structure of perception and cognition, are not separable from specific patterns of sociocultural life. Finally, Western and cross-cultural examples will be used to assess different models of social determinism and the cultural impact of human decisions and action. Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100 or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 338 -Social Structure and Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Under study here are the production and distribution, form and content, and artists and audiences of popular culture internationally. We will consider prominent social theories, from the Frankfort School's critique of popular culture, through the writings on mass culture in the United States, to the recent rehabilitation of popular culture by British writers like Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy. Some of the major questions addressed will include: How do the social arrangements and the technologies of production shape the messages conveyed in popular media? What is the relationship between popular culture and "high" culture? Under what conditions does popular culture distract people from the struggles for equality and social justice, lulling them to passivity, and when can it inspire protest, or even transform people's behavior? Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100 or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 339 -Culture, Identity and Politics in Caribbean Society (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course focuses on the social, cultural and political life of the Caribbean area, especially the English and French speaking areas. A fragmented group of nations decidedly on the periphery of the global economy, the Caribbean was once one of the richest areas of the world. Its riches then depended on the labor of enslaved Africans; the fruits of the plantation economy were enjoyed mainly by European planters. What is the legacy of such a history? We review the variety of Caribbean policies, from the strong democratic traditions of Jamaica to the autocratic rulers of Haiti, and explore how the Caribbean's unique combination of cultural influences affect the political processes, ways of life, class divisions and ethnic stratification evident in the Caribbean today. Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100 or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 340 -Social Movements (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course we explore social movements as a primary means of social change. We attempt to understand the conditions which precede, accompany and follow collective action. Particular case studies for analysis will be drawn from the United States and cross-cultural contexts to illustrate that social movements are human products that have both intended and unintended consequences. Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100 or consent.</p></div>

Power relationships between NGOs and states, particularly in the southern hemisphere, as well as with bilateral and multi-lateral institutions are pivotal to our examination. The ideological, programmatic and conceptual differences among NGOs are examined within the broader context of theories of development. We ask why growing numbers of people see NGOs as the answer to ameliorating poverty, disease, violations of human rights and environmental degradation, among others. Some of the organizations that we examine include Greenpeace, Amnesty International, the Grameen Bank and Working Women's Forum. Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100 or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANSO 343 -Demography of Africa (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course, we begin by reviewing current literature to clearly define the term, Demography.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 219 -Photo: Writing with Light (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This class will be an in depth exploration of light as material, and its relationship to photography. Because of photography's presence in both the art and commercial world, it has always been a slippery medium to place definitively as art, craft, document or commercial enterprise. This is ironic, because never have we been more surrounded by photos and asked to ingest them as signs of truth from topics as diverse as journalism to images of what a beautiful body should/could look like. During this course, we will try to slow down our visual consumption by being specific about the medium that makes the image possible -light. We will begin in the night, travel to day, and then to the indoor and portable lighting kits (strobe, flash, tungsten). Prerequisite(s): ARTS 117 or consent of instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 220 -Ceramic History and Contemporary Practice (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The history of ceramics very closely parallels the development of civilization and culture across the planet.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 222 -Contemporary Comics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This Studio Art course will examine the relationship of words and pictures through the study and making of autobiographical and nonfiction comics. As other Studio Art courses examine the disciplines of photography, ceramics, sculpture or painting through experiential learning, so too will students realize the potential of this discipline to reveal their creative selves through its unique visual language. Placing practice in context, comics history will be explored with the emphasis on contemporary cartoonists and graphic novelists as artists focused on relevant first person narrative storytelling and comics journalism. Traditional techniques of layout, design and storyboarding will be included along with drawing and writing exercises. Course projects will extend technical exercises to address content concerns through in-class workshops, presentations on cartoonists, critiques, field trips and a range of short and long outside projects that will gradually build to more ambitious creative comic undertakings by semesters end. No previous studio art or drawing experience is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 223 -The Ceramic Surface (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this studio course students will explore the numerous options for surface expression in ceramic art making. One of clay's unique properties is the ability to faithfully record impressions in its surface -from the fingerprint of a potter to patterned designs stamped into the surface. Today, mark making on clay has caught up with technology, incorporating digital processes into the roster of print technique possibilities. Students will learn to make their own glazes, effectively use slips, glazes, china paints, lustres, print-transfers, photo-decals and alternative firing techniques. Students will explore the relationships between content, form and surface through the creative process, group critiques, readings, image presentations and discussions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 224 -Ceramic Multiples (Ceramics From Molds) (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this studio course students learn to create ceramic objects using plaster molds, how to make casting slip, and the basics of kiln firing. We will explore the relationship between Art, Design, and Craft, and students will be encouraged to push the boundaries of where these categories begin and end. Producing ceramic objects from molds allows for greater refinement of the object, unlimited possibilities of form and the potential of creating multiple replicas or variations on one form. Because of inherent associations with industry, technology, and mass-production, objects produced from molds offer unique conceptual possibilities that students will pursue through the creative process, group critiques, readings and discussions.

Its goal is the transformation of spaces through the use of objects, images, color, etc. Site-specific art is art that is created in a certain space, where the place is part of the work and adds meaning to it. This Installation/Site-Specific Art studio class will focus on creating objects that will transform a variety of architectural spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 241 -Intermediate Sculpture (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course focuses on the search for art practices. The students have to develop projects starting out with specific themes that are discussed by the group, but the end product is personal depending on the individual conceptual and aesthetic development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 243 -Mixed Media Sculpture (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Combining theory and practice in the sculpture studio, this topical intermediate sculpture course focuses its central objective around an overarching relevant interdisciplinary theme that varies per semester. Along with theoretical readings and presentations, a series of sculpture projects will be developed by each student to explore the selected research theme created with a range of techniques and materials. Course materials may include plaster, wax, fabric, found objects, wood, and metal. The works will acquire meaning based not only on the form, but also on the material the work is made out of and its connotations. Importance will be given to the investigation on the theme, to the process of sculptural creation and to the end products, the final sculpture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS 244 -Fiber Arts (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This studio art course is an introduction to the basic expressive potential to create two-and three-dimensional works.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 140 -The Politics of Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The terrain of popular culture has historically been a site of contentious struggles and debates. For long (as is the case even today) one's cultural "taste" was a significant factor in determining one's standing in the social hierarchy. Debates about "high" vs "low" culture and about what cultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a community have involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.</p><p>Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us with a lens through which to understand historical social changes. It also allows us to appreciate that several contemporary debates (for instance about the cultural meaning of Hip Hop or Reality TV) have historical precedents that inform and precede them. This introductory course seeks to trace those debates from their origins in middle century Europe to their culmination into contemporary battles over popular culture. In so doing it seeks to politicize popular culture and unravel the competing ideologies and worldviews embedded within it. We begin by reading some of the prominent theorists of "high" culture and then problematize their arguments by studying the challenges to them (most stridently posed by the Birmingham school of scholars). We will then use this historical debate to inform our understanding of the contemporary world of popular culture in America. In the process we will also learn various ways to analyze and critique objects of popular culture around us that we often unthinkingly consume.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 205 -Global Communication (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The purpose of the course is to acquire an understanding of the key concepts and ideas about globalization and the role the mass media plays in the process. While the term "globalization" has been bandied about among the popular press, academic and the business community, this course will attempt to contextualize and ground the concept by developing a multiperspectival approach to some of the political, economic and social processes that have been associated with the development of a world communication system. Throughout the course, we will examine the growing centrality that the mass media and information technologies play in our daily lives and the ways in which they contribute to or hinder our daily practices of identity, community and culture in a global context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 211 -Thinking with Ethics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course will help students discover how to better recognize ethical questions when they stumble across them and to explore how, when we do, we lean into them rather than turn away. What makes it possible for us to think, listen and speak with ethics? We will explore a range of public and private ethical questions that arise in the everyday lives of college students such as, </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMM 345 -Cultural Globalization and Identity (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course will critically engage with the phenomenon of the global circulation of culture. It will seek to understand the consequences of the process whereby texts, ideas and images that for long remained confined to their locations of origin are today increasingly mobile and de-territorialized. Objects of popular culture such as television, cinema and music, are circulating and being consumed around the world and are helping challenge the traditional markers of human identity such as nation, culture and language. While they are allowing individuals to imagine alternatives to existing realities they are also engendering a backlash against a perceived imposition of new ideas, values and culture. This course will seek to familiarize students with these ongoing changes and the conflicts over cultural and national identity that it has given rise to. We will begin with arguments that present a totalizing view of this process (the Cultural Imperialism thesis) and then over the course of the semester complicate and nuance those arguments by introducing agency and empowerment for the consumers of global culture. We will do this by closely studying actual case studies (from reality TV in Saudi Arabia or McDonalds in Japan) in order to understand the stakes involved in the struggle to define and "protect" national and cultural identity. At the end of this semester long course students should have gained a deep understanding of why the process of global flow of culture is a deeply contentious and political phenomenon. Understanding these conflicts through the lens of identity will help students complicate that term as well as interrogate their views about their own identity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CS 335 -Probability, Computing and Graph Theory (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course is about the design and analysis of randomized algorithms (i.e. algorithms that compute probabilistically). Such algorithms are often robust and fast, though there is a small probability that they return the wrong answer. Examples include Google's PageRank algorithm, load balancing in computer networks, coping with Big Data via random sampling, navigation of unknown terrains by autonomous mobile entities, and matching medical students to residencies. The analysis of such algorithms requires tools from probability theory, which will be introduced as needed. This course also covers the basics of graph theory, and several randomized algorithms on graphs. Graphs are often used to mathematically model phenomena of interest to computer scientists, including the internet, social networks graphs, and computer networks. Lastly, this course demonstrates the powerful Probabilistic Method to non-constructively prove the existence of certain prescribed graph structures, how to turn such proofs into randomized algorithms, and how to derandomize such algorithms into deterministic algorithms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 274 -Cultural Studies (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course frames Western concert dance as a complex political activity made public through various agendas of race, creed, national origin, sexuality, and gender. Students may simultaneously be exposed to poststructuralist epistemology, feminist theory, and power &amp; justice ideology while they are meeting a survey of historical works. In this way, the course is less about coming to know a canon of "masterworks" and more about learning how to interrogate dance in many cultures from multiple perspectives. Students will be expected to engage in movement activities as a method toward an embodied understanding of theory, but will not be evaluated on their movement performance or ability. No dance experience necessary. Course may crosslist with: WGST, BLST, ENVS, QS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 284 -Choreographic Investigations (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course focuses on the creation and presentation of assigned short movement studies that focus on principles of dance composition for the concert stage. Past focus has been on the relationship of movement to sound, interrogating the use of music in modern dance history. Through solo, duet and group forms students learn about the compositional elements of space, time, dynamics, flow and shape, discover their own unique movement style, become familiar with how the body works and how it can be expressive, and expand their own definitions of dance. Three fundamental aspects of creative work in movement will be emphasized: movement invention, compositional structure, and creating meaning. A desire to take risks and be transformed, a willingness to use the body as an expressive tool, an eagerness to learn, and willingness to question personal choices are essential for success in this class. An interest, ability and a desire to be physically challenged to work toward expressive clarity in movement, is assumed. Prerequisite(s): 100 level movement course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 285 -African Movement Aesthetics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course engages characteristics and values of African movement to investigate compositional structure. Through various exercises and assignments, students examine concepts such as: balance, walking, masking, rhythm, repetition, improvisation, standing and sitting as tools for composing. Students investigate the manipulation of space, time and energy, and create source material from personal movement exploration, structured improvisation, master classes, and guided exercises. Other course tools include videos, journals, art and community feedback. Ultimately, the course aims to resource the aesthetics of African movement (kinesthetic, philosophical, linear and nonlinear) as methods for composing solo, duet, and group work. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or permission of instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 286 -Improvisation in Performance (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Improvisation in Performance focuses on the act of spontaneous choreography and composition though solo and ensemble work with the goal of understanding and experiencing improvisation in performance work. Students learn Ensemble Thinking techniques and are exposed to Contact Improvisation. Texts include performances in theatre and dance both here and in Columbus, as well as selected readings. Students discover, through these, what artists and scholars consider to be the perimeters of performance, the definition of improvisation, and the unique potential of movement. Through a consistent practice, students fine-tune their own ideas about these and work to discover their own movement preferences and capabilities. Students risk the act of moving, revealing, performing, and improvising. The semester culminates in an improvised performance work developed by the class. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 287 -Site-Based Composition (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course, students study and research composition for the human body in relation to its environment, placing and shaping the body in juxtaposition or in relation to specific and chosen spaces. We study sitebased performance works by contemporary artists and learn about the issues surrounding this kind of work. The underlying principles of this course are the formal elements that inform the aesthetics of composition, noticing how these basic compositional elements create tension, drama and meaning and can point to content that is inherent in the form and in relation to the environment. The final project is the creation of a sitebased movement/performance work in a chosen site in the Denison Community/Granville Village area that is presented at the end of the semester. An interest in and curiosity about the body as the subject of creative work is essential. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 288 -Text/Voice-based Composition (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course engages text, voice, and theatrical material to investigate dance making and performance. Students explore words, poetry, music and sound to craft and support movement. Through various exercises and assignments, the course examines motifs such as: speaking while moving; chanting while moving; words into movement; and words as music as methods for composing. Work outside the classroom is required. Examples include concert attendance, creative writing, weekly journal writing, and video essays. Ultimately, the course aims to overlap the boundaries of theatre and dance to explore movement composition. Prerequisite(s): Any 100 level or above movement course or consent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analytics (DA)</head><p>DA 101 -Introduction to Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours) Many of the most pressing problems in the world can be addressed with data. We are awash in data and modern citizenship demands that we become literate in how to interpret data, what assumptions and processes are necessary to analyze data, as well as how we might participate in generating our own analyses and presentations of data. Consequently, data analytics is an emerging field with skills applicable to a wide variety of disciplines. This course introduces analysis, computation, and presentation concerns through the investigation of data driven puzzles in wide array of fields -political, economic, historical, social, biological, and others. No previous experience is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 200 -Data Analytics Colloquium (1 Credit Hour)</head><p>The Data Analytics colloquium involves three central learning components. 1) regular engagement with guest presentations and community activities in data analytics, 2) group discussion featuring critical analysis and connection of themes found in the guest presentations and in related data analytics topics, and 3) preparation and refinement of professional communication skills necessary for the required internship component of the data analytics major. This course provides an opportunity for students to connect on data analytics ideas and applications, using a range of perspectives that may or may not be normally encountered in a traditional course. Students will develop the knowledge, skills, and methods they need to progress to more advanced learning, while also creating bridges with members of the data analytics community within and outside of Denison. The course must be taken twice by majors: once as a sophomore, and again as either a junior or senior. Prerequisite(s): DA 101 (may be taken concurrently).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 210 -Data Systems (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course provides a broad perspective on the access, structure, storage, and representation of data. It encompasses traditional database systems, but extends to other structured and unstructured repositories of data and their access/acquisition in a client-server model of Internet computing. Also developed are an understanding of data representations amenable to structured analysis, and the algorithms and techniques for transforming and restructuring data to allow such analysis. Prerequisite(s): CS 109 or CS 110 or CS 111 or CS 112. Crosslisting: CS 181.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 220 -Applied Statistics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Statistics is the science of reasoning from data. This course will introduce the fundamental concepts and methods of statistics using calculus-based probability. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 301 -Practicum in Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Utilizing Denison as a model of society, this practicum will explore questions of collective import through the analysis of new and existing sources of data. A problem-driven approach will lead to the acquisition of new, appropriate data analytic skills, set in an ethical context that carefully considers the implications of data display and policy recommendations on community members. A significant component of the course is working in teams to collect and analyze new data to address a puzzle or problem for a real client. Groups or organizations that serve as clients may come from the campus community, local non-profits, or businesses and groups across the region or country. The practicum also develops exposure to policymaking, implementing data driven insights, program management theory, interacting with leaders and professionals, and developing presentation skills appropriate for professional communication with the public. Though a significant learning opportunity itself, this course should also be seen as a prelude to a community internship or research experience in the post-junior year summer. Students should be aware that some off-campus travel may be necessary to meet with specific clients as necessary. Final presentations to the client, in lieu of a scheduled exam, requires flexibility and scheduling outside of the exam schedule. Prerequisite(s): DA 101, DA 210 and DA 220, or consent of instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DA 350 -Advanced Methods for Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course is designed to develop students' understanding of the cutting-edge methods and algorithms of data analytics and how they can be used to answer questions about real-world problems.

Although Japan's occupation of Korea began in 1910, this course will begin its consideration of this topic in 1890 because the Japanese political and social mechanisms that led to fascist militarist control in the 1930s have their origins at least as far back as 1890. This course fulfills the Modern Core requirement for the East Asian Studies major/minor.</p><p>EAST 221 -Contemporary Japan: In Search of the "Real" Japan (4 Credit Hours) Japan often conjures images steeped in tradition such as samurai warriors, sumo wrestlers, and geisha clad in kimono. At the same time, however, contemporary Japan is just as easily associated with businessmen, anime, automobiles, and high technology. How have "tradition" and "change" fueled competing visions of Japan what it means to be "Japanese"? How does one go about reconciling these conflicting views? How have these debates evolved over time? How have variously situated individuals and groups in society negotiated shifting circumstances? These questions will be at the heart of this seminar as we consider case studies from different segments of Japanese society. A range of material will be treated as "texts" for analysis and discussion including anime, manga, literary works, and films as well as ethnographic scholarship on Japanese society. Crosslisting: ANSO 221.</p></div>

We will study the structural transformation of these economies and the dynamics of their colonial and post-colonial structures. This course examines the different stages of economic development starting with the early post-colonial period, followed by the period of import substitution industrialization of the 1960s, export-led growth of the 1970s, the debt crisis of the 1980s, the structural adjustment programs of the 1990s, and the Arab uprisings of 2011. We will examine the political economy of the region as it relates to unemployment, poverty, inequality, migration, food insecurity, water stress, climate change, class conflict, gender dynamics, cultural norms, as well as regional and global geopolitical power struggles over the control of key markets such as oil and natural gas. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 417 -The Eurozone: Optimal Currency Area or Incomplete Monetary Union? (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Before 2010, the Eurozone was hailed as the first successful multinational, large-scale model of monetary and currency union. Several countries in many regions of the world (such as South America, the Middle East, West Africa) have been considering following in the steps of the European Union (EU) by creating similar currency areas in the near future. However, the financial crisis of the late 2000s followed by the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s have challenged the perception of the Eurozone has a fully functioning currency area. In this class we will seek to place the creation of the Eurozone in the context of the broader evolution of the EU as a cosmopolitan project. We will examine the socioeconomic theories and political ideologies behind the creation of the Eurozone. This will require an understanding of the macroeconomic models which underlie the concept of 'optimal currency area' and an investigation of the degree to which the Eurozone is a fully completed project. In particular the solutions provided by EU leaders and institutions to the economic crisis in Greece (and other countries in the Eurozone) will give us a chance to reflect upon the future of the Eurozone and to discuss the intellectual and practical implications of two alternatives that member-states may face as they look towards the future of the EU: 1. the pursuit of further EU integration through the creation of a supranational fiscal and political union or 2. the beginning of a process of political and economic devolution towards smaller scale European projects. Prerequisite(s): ECON 301.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 418 -Personal Finance (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course focuses upon the application of economic theory to major issues faced by consumers in our modern economy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 428 -Financial Instability and Economic Crises (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Throughout the history of market economies, financial markets have periodically experienced rapid changes in the prices of financial assets, i.e., booms and crashes. These periods of instability are often connected to rising unemployment, fall in production, and painful economic crises. In spite of this, an influential contingent of economists -sometimes referred to as "free market" economists -continue to argue that all markets are stable and that government regulations are at best unnecessary and at worst counterproductive. This course studies the historical development of the "free market" ideology and explores many of the serious challenges to this ideology that come from both economic theory and economic history. Prerequisite(s): ECON 302.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECON 465 -Forensic Economics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>After an untimely death or a wrenching divorce, forensic economists are often called upon to estimate the economic worth of a human life or a family business. To make such estimations requires that students have a firm understanding of the underlying micro-and macroeconomic aspects of economic theory, of the relevant demographic and economic data that is available, and of the process of calculating net discounted present value. There are generally accepted ways of calculating economic worth, but there are also grey areas where judgments are made. The latter requires a subtle understanding of the issues behind why one assumption may be better than another and its impact on the final value of economic worth. Students will role-play a movie forensic economist who is a member of a well-respected law firm specializing in wrongful death and divorce. Prerequisite(s): ECON 301 and ECON 302.</p></div>

Rather, environmental awareness and practices comprise a "central issue of our time" that is laden with cultural concerns of ideological and material differences, power, privilege and marginality. This course will begin with an in-depth exploration of the philosophy that communication is the means through which we construct, participate, and convey the cultures we are a part of and therefore, is central to the creation of the kind of world we want to live in. We will then turn our attention to an analysis of current social, organizational and political discourses on the environment and our responsibility, or not, in its protection.".</p></div>

It combines the theories of policy, the tools of problem solving, and the practice of dealing with environmental challenges in the real world of American government. The premise of the course is this: if you want to improve the state of the planet, you have to propose a solution. To make a solution happen, you should understand the process of getting an idea through the decision-making system. Effecting change requires a background in the system(s) that make things happen, whether you ultimately want to work within the system or outside it. This course is divided into two main components: an overview and implementation of problem solving techniques, and an in-depth examination of the U.S. Congress' role in environmental policy formation. The latter section culminates in a "Moot Congress" undertaken by students at the end of the semester. Not recommended for first year students. Course fulfills the Oracl Communication (R) requirement and the ENVS Social Science requirement, and can fulfill the ENVS Methods requirement for class of 2021 and prior. Prerequisite(s): ENVS 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENVS 256 -Farmscape: Visual Immersion in the Food System (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Every human being has an intimate relationship with food, often with deep emotional facets. Yet we in the U.S. know very little about the food system that sustains us -it is a mysterious and often invisible set of processes, organizations, and people. This remarkably complex web of inputs, labor, machinery, laws, subsidies, mergers, and so many other components is one that we take largely for granted. This class seeks to align that reality with another: we are an intensely visual species. A critical part of our existence that we experience through all of our senses is one we fail to comprehend through our primary sense. And we have this occasion to use sight in a formalized way -photography -to tell new stories, and to bring an artistic sensibility to our understanding of food, and perhaps ourselves. Through imagery, writing, and the curatorial process of exhibiting our work in a public setting, we have a truly unique opportunity. Our immersion in these critical issues can bring full circle the understanding we gain through many eyes to enhance awareness in other people about the ways in which our food system connects us all together. Course fulfills the ENVS Humanities/Arts requirement, and can fulfill the ENVS Methods requirement for class of 2021 and prior. </p></div>

Students are invited to study fascinating practices of spatial image-making in East Asia from the inside out, by exploring these world-views from the perspective of their makers. You will be asked to pay special attention to how social and economic power structures inflect these representations: to envision and decode spatial imagery as a site of imagination, control and resistance. Artists and patrons in China, Japan, and Korea have for centuries produced elaborate maps and landscape imagery, photographs and film to imagine the world in a variety of ways. This course invites you to approach modern and contemporary representations of space in East Asia both in theoretically and historically informed ways. In the first part of the course, students build a frame of reference for their analysis of post-war case studies, by reading core texts in spatial theory, and exploring important visual representations of space from pre-modern East Asia. In the second part of the course, students apply these theoretical and historical approaches to select cases that exemplify more recent struggles over space and its imagination in East Asia. Course fulfills the ENVS Humanities/Arts requirement. Crosslisting: AHVC 263.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIST 256 -The Reformation (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The Protestant and Catholic Reformations were major movements in early modern Europe with far-reaching effects still felt globally today.</p><p>In the sixteenth century, religious arguments interacted with political concerns, economic fluctuations, and social tensions to transform European states and societies. In 1500, the idea of a unified European Christendom, though imperfect, could still be defended. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, while Europeans as a group still believed in God, the influence of the Roman Church and of Christianity more generally had begun to change. This course examines the religious ideas and arguments that burgeoned in the sixteenth century, the social and political contexts in which they developed, and the transformations in European society, culture and religious practices that resulted. Course materials focus especially on examining the relationships between ideas and actions/practices in order to understand the wide-ranging social impacts of the religious changes during the Reformation.</p></div>

Traditionally, foreign policy analysts considered the state as a unitary actor. Today, we are more appreciative of the multiple domestic inputs in foreign policy making, and more sophisticated in the use of analytic tools to facilitate our understanding of the foreign policy formulation process. The class is structured around four distinct "sources" of US foreign policy formulation: institutional; role; societal; and, individual. While we cover each source in distinct units for purposes of analytic clarity, throughout our study we will observe that no one decision can be explained fully without some overlap of sources.</p></div>

The 200 level "doing political science classes" are designed to focus on issues of method and writing skills expanding on what you learned about skills and methods in 201 and preparing you for upper division work in political science while also focusing on one of the major subfields of political science. This course will help students analyze the nature of ethnic conflict, as well as understand why some multiethnic states avoid ethnic wars while other do not. We will primarily focus on ethnicities that inhabit the former Soviet space but will look at other groups as well as for a more nuanced view of "ethnic" conflict. </p></div>

We also examine writings on the character, policies, reputation, and rhetoric of individual presidents; presidential management of the executive branch; and presidential leadership of Congress. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 307 -The Politics of Congress (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The U.S. Congress is often considered the 'First Branch" of the federal government, and by its construction is easily the most complex. In this course we will consider the politics that underlie the development and operation of the contemporary Congress, detail the legislative process and its organization. We will consider how various institutions such as parties, committees, and procedures help legislators reach their goals and help solve problems such as collective action, voting cycles, and ambition. While we begin by looking at Congress at its inception and the electoral goals of members, the course will quickly move to the development of these institutions and in the early Twentieth Century <ref type="bibr">(pre-1974)</ref> and their use today. Over the course of the semester, we will apply our institutional study of Congress to current events and through a multi-week simulation of the legislative process. Since many of the readings make use of existing quantitative data and existing research prior experience with this type of material at the level of POSC 201 or an equivalent is recommended. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 309 -Campaigns and Elections (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course examines the structure, strategy, and influence of federal campaigns and elections in the United States. With a focus on both Congressional and Presidential campaign contests the course explores topics such as primary and nominating politics, the role of money in elections, candidate selection, incumbency advantage, the influence of elections on voting behavior, campaign strategy, advertising, and election reform. Throughout the course we will apply the readings to analyze the current election cycle, historical trends, and election forecasting. In addition, students will participate in a simulated campaign exercise. By the end of the semester students will complete a research paper investigating data related to congressional campaigns centered on questions raised by one or more of the topics covered in class. POSC 110 is a prerequisite for the course and POSC 201 is highly recommended. The course counts towards the fulfillment of Lugar Track I program requirements. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>

The course will trace the development of U.S. military and diplomatic policy regarding Vietnam, assess the various lessons attributed to the Vietnam experience, and consider how application of these lessons has altered American's attitudes toward interventionism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 311 -Political Organizations in the U.S (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>"Democracy is unthinkable save in terms of the parties." Yet, some, including the Founding Fathers, have been less sure of Schattschneider's truism, warning of the mischiefs of faction. Political organization, however, by most accounts has been the engine and structure of American democracy throughout its two centuries. Parties, interest groups, and social movements have formed and acted to create and insure that American democracy truly is of, by, and for the people. In the course, we will investigate the formation, maintenance, and death of political organizations, the effectiveness and representative nature of political organizations, the strategies and resources of organizations, as well as recent challenges by such factors as increased individualism, media, technology and money. Organizations considered may include: the Republican, Democratic, and third parties; major interest groups such as the Sierra Club, AARP, NRA, Christian Coalition, Chamber of Commerce, and unions; and social movements such as the women's, civil rights, and Christian conservative movements. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 312 -Religion and Politics in U.S. (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course offers an intensive analysis of the many connections between the American religious and political systems. Questions considered include whether religion is fulfilling its democratic responsibilities, the constitutional bounds of the relationship between church and state, the religious dimensions of American political behavior, religious influences on political institutions and decision makers, and religious interest group activity. Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 315 -Power and Gender (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Despite considerable progress, gender remains an essential dividing line in politics. Gender gaps in opinion, the double-bound treatment of public officials, the exercise of power, political opportunities, and imbalances in role models, not to mention differences in socialization and psychology all shape what amounts to the political "gender system." In this course, we will dig into how political power is sought and utilized through a gendered lens that lays bare essential questions of equality in developed societies. To gain an appreciation for equal representation and our role in achieving it, we need to understand the nature of bias and the individual, social, and institutional forces that contribute to and help alleviate that bias. Students will conduct a range of original empirical research to contribute to these important debates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 319 -Topics in the Study of American Politics (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course provides a venue in which to explore topics in American Politics at the advanced level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 322 -Politics of Russia (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course focuses on contemporary Russian politics. Because Russian politics cannot be understood in the absence of historical context, the course will devote some time to the Tsarist and Soviet periods. At least half of the course deals with the Russian Federation under presidents Yeltsin, Putin, and Medvedev. Constitutional debates, federalism, ethnic issues, political struggles, the Chechen war, changing relations with the U.S. and NATO, and more will be covered, as well as executive, legislative, and judicial institutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 323 -Issues and Politics in Europe (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course will focus on contemporary issues and policy debates in European politics. We will look at a broader range of countries than POSC 120 including countries such as Poland, Spain, Denmark, the Czech Republic, and others. Some of the issues discussed could include: health care policies, minority rights and minority communities, energy politics, and more. The exact issues, policies, and countries will vary over time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 326 -Radical Right Parties and Politics in Europe (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>What accounts for the emergence, persistence and demise of "radical" or "far right" political parties in Europe? After a period of post-war stability, European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led to several new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation; a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; and the emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This course focuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in Western Europe during the 1980's and 1990's. Specifically we focus on what many scholars label the "far" or "radical" right. These parties tend to be organized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizing nationalism, exclusion of "foreigners, " a strong state, welfare chauvinism and, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semester students will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties and their politics across Europe and discern the differences between what scholars describe as "populist radical" or "populist far" right parties from other parties on the extreme right, namely neofascist or neo-Nazis parties which are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 328 -Politics of the Environment (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course is about the theoretical, political, and practical problems associated with environmental action. Course materials analyze various theoretical perspectives on the relationship between humans and nature, and they illustrate how different ethics lead to widely different prescriptions for personal and political action. Course materials also offer examples of how environmental problems have in fact been addressed or not by governmental, non-governmental, and international institutions. This is not a course on the physical processes of environmental problems, but rather it emphasizes the political, economic, and theoretical contexts within which efforts are made to act on environmental threats. No prior knowledge of environmental or political science is required. However, students should be prepared to read and interpret detailed social science texts, to formulate and articulate cogent arguments, and to conduct independent research. Course fulfills the ENVS Social Science requirement. Crosslisting: ENVS 328.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 344 -The United Nations and World Problems (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The founding of public international organizations represent an attempt to bring order to an unruly international system. International organizations are formal institutions established by states to address global problems. They include not only the United Nations, but also many other public or private, international, national or local, formal or informal institutions. Collectively, these institutions engage in global governance. Our goals in this course are to understand the theoretical and practical approaches to international organizations and global governance, the limitations under which global governance operates, and the future prospects for a system of global governance. This course has a substantial oral component and oral skills work and so satisfies the University's oral general education requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 345 -Human Rights in Global Perspective (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course analyzes the emergence, expansion and enforcement of international human rights norms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 346 -The European Union (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The course explores the peculiarities of the EU and what makes it a unique organization, sharing characteristics of a state and characteristics of a traditional international organization. First, we will place the study of European integration in a historical context. Then we will make sense of the various decision-making processes and institutional actors of the EU. We will also examine theories of European integration to understand competing explanations for the integration process. Fourth, various policy areas will be studied to show how the power of the EU is distributed unevenly across areas. During the final two weeks of the course we will simulate a gathering of the European Council. This course has a substantial oral component and oral skills work and so satisfies the University's oral general education requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 347 -The Middle East in World Affairs (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the political history, international significance, and the dimensions of political life in the Middle East. Owing to the ever-present potential for conflict, the seeming intractability of disputes, and the oil factor, what happens in the Middle East is of vital importance to international politics. We examine the role that politics in the Middle East has played in world affairs as well as the region's importance in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 348 -Foreign and Security Policy in Western Europe (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course aims to compare key post Cold War foreign policy behaviors during crisis situations concerning the three "big" states in Western Europe: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (also referred to as the EU3, as they all are members of the European Union (EU). Why is it that we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries which have been the most important allies for the US in the past fifty years? Are these countries "middle powers" or "big powers"? What role do they play in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europe also conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU, or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviate from the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lack the means and influence to project their power beyond the confines of Europe. Thus, the "three big" can be put in a special category because of their status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors we first establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreign policy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guides our analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-making processes, the domestic and international environment, and foreign policy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, state and systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparing the foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Specific areas of inquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making, group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national role conception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes in the international system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 349 -Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since the beginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorism dates only from <ref type="bibr">the French Revolution (1789</ref><ref type="bibr">-1799</ref>. In this course, we will explore what terrorism is, whether it is new (and why some analysts argue it is), who uses terrorist tactics, why they do so, and how terrorism differs from other forms of political violence such as war, insurgency, and so on. We will investigate various definitions of terrorism. Most scholars think that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorism as planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lot of disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how it can be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We will compare the various definitions and perspectives to determine which might work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, we will focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science and how they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, and the media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 353 -Russian Foreign and Military Policy (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>In this course we will seek to understand the motives and objectives of Russian foreign and military policies. We will look at Russian interests throughout the world with particular attention to the 'near abroad' (countries that were part of the Soviet Union), China, and Europe as well as the US-Russian relationship. Issues of arms sales, military power, and the politics of energy (oil and gas) will form a significant portion of the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 355 -International Political Economy (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>This course introduces the theory and practice of international political economy. It is a blend of the study of both economics and politics in that it explores the interaction of power or authority (the subject matter of politics) and markets (the subject matter of economics). The prior study of economics may be helpful, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient to do well in this course. The course follows a topical and a historical approach. The selection of topics includes trade, monetary systems, international finances, and at least one current global economic issue.</p></div>

What is the purpose and function of law in society? How does the legal process work through precedents, legal reasoning and case law? What are civil rights and civil liberties? Where are the lines or boundaries to be drawn between an individual's freedom and the public good or the rights of the community? Which liberties does the Court consider worth protecting and which liberties are circumscribed by the public interest? What might be the difference between liberty as a legal concept, and freedom? This course examines important political and theoretical questions regarding the rule of law, interpreting the Constitution, and the role of the Supreme Court in the U.S. system of politics and government.</p></div>

By setting internship goals at the onset of the experience, students are empowered to declare what they hope to learn, achieve, and contribute. Midway through the internship experience, students will review their progress towards their goals and near the end of the term, students are prompted to reflect on the experience through a self-evaluation and reflection process. Through the Denison Internship Program (https://my.denison.edu/node/5171), students will earn academic transcript notation for their internship experience once all requirements are met successfully and approved by the Knowlton Center.</p></div>

Each semester, Denison Museum staff works with faculty, students, and other campus organizations to provide integrative learning opportunities through changing exhibitions and the more than 9,000 objects in the permanent collection. Every year, the Denison Museum also hires 8-10 year-long interns and 2-6 summer interns from all four liberal arts divisions through the MyDenison portal or Handshake. Student interns gain extensive transferable skills by participating in exhibition preparation and research, creating promotional materials using "InDesign" and other technologies, creating videos and podcasts of Museum events,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Programs and Opportunities</head><p>the careful handling of objects, research, and documentation, and through assisting in the creation of educational materials for class and community visits. Denison Museum interns are frequently successful in securing professional internships or advancing careers in related fields or admission to graduate programs in museum studies and professional writing based on work at the Museum. More information on the Denison Museum is available (https://denison.edu/campus/museum).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service-Learning</head><p>The J.W. Alford Center for Service Learning collaborates with students, faculty, and staff to experience active citizenship through service and interaction with the Licking County community and beyond. Service learning enables students to creatively think about society, question its possible inequalities and inequities, and to develop ways of evoking positive social change. Three main functions comprise the work of the Alford Center:</p><p>• Curricular Service learning courses in which students and faculty partner with schools, agencies, and organizations to contribute and to experience the course content through hands-on experience.</p><p>• The Denison Community Association, in which students organize themselves into more than 20 committees that contribute in excess of 19,000 hours of volunteer service annually; and</p><p>• America Reads, that sends work-study students to 10 area schools to provide literacy education.</p><p>In all of these functions, students have opportunities to learn to work within a sustainable experiential cycle of defining an issue, researching it, creating and implementing an action plan, and then reflecting on their work through evaluation, and reconsideration of the issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advising Circles</head><p>The advising relationship is an important place for conversations that connect the dots between academic work and the learning that occurs beyond the classroom walls. AC 101 -Advising Circles: Engaging the Mission is a structured, weekly opportunity for a small group of first-year students to come together to talk about their experiences, to learn more about the university and the community, to explore how our community is shaped by the diversity of perspectives, and to think productively about how to plan for four years of a meaningful, educational experience.</p><p>Students who have participated in this course have been overwhelmingly positive about their experience; 90% of students who have taken an AC 101 -Advising Circles would strongly recommend it to entering students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Center for Learning and Teaching</head><p>The primary goal of Denison's Center for Learning and Teaching is to support and collaborate with faculty at all career stages, considering questions, ideas, activities, and research on teaching and learning. The Center provides support for faculty development and mentoring related to the practice of effective teaching. Specific goals include:</p><p>1. Conduct teaching and learning seminars for first-year and early-career faculty.</p><p>2. Develop or sponsor workshops, brown-bag lunches, reading and discussion groups, and other programs (e.g., Teaching Matters!) that address specific teaching approaches, strategies, activities, and pedagogies including digital technology.</p><p>3. Provide a structured program for one-on-one consultations and classroom teaching observations as a way of delivering formative feedback for faculty at all experience levels and providing mentoring relationships for early-career faculty.</p><p>4. Coordinate and enhance collaboration among faculty, faculty groups, professional staff, and administrative offices in order to initiate and promote a variety of faculty development programs and resources that address teaching, learning, scholarship, and mentoring for our college.</p><p>5. Support the development of faculty pedagogy and curricular projects focused on the intersection of innovative teaching, integrated learning, and scholarship of teaching and learning.</p><p>6. Participate and provide leadership in forging relationships and collaborations between Denison's faculty development programs and other professional organizations that address issues in teaching, learning, and curriculum in higher education.</p><p>7. Foster use of the Center's meeting spaces in the Library's atrium level for workshops, discussions, meetings, and any type of program relevant to teaching, learning, advising, mentoring, the curriculum, and other higher education forums.</p><p>The Center is located on the atrium level of the Library. Jeffrey Kurtz (Department of Communication) is the Center's director.</p></div>

The university provides an environment that supports and promotes academic achievement and personal growth. Denison values its faculty, academic programs, and students who have come to learn and contribute. Denison's Office of Admission (https:// denison.edu/campus/admission) coordinates admission programs and reviews all applications to the university.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary School Preparation</head><p>Because a Denison academic education is a blend of electives, general education, core courses, and departmental requirements, a broad, rigorous secondary school preparation is highly desirable. The university strongly recommends that, by the time you graduate from secondary school, you complete the following: four years of English; three years of mathematics, science, social studies, and a foreign language (at least two of which should be in the same language).</p><p>The admission committee takes particular note of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, PSEO, honors, and enriched courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission Criteria</head><p>The quality of your academic performance and the rigor of courses selected are the most important factors considered by the admission committee. Submission of standardized test scores (ACT or SAT) is optional. SAT II subject tests are also not required, although you may provide these scores as additional information in support of your application for admission. International applicants must demonstrate adequate English proficiency (considerations include, but are not limited to the following: English as the primary language of school instruction; English as the first/native language; TOEFL of 80+; IELTS of 6.5+; Duolingo English Test of 65+; SAT Reading of 600+; ACT English Language Arts of 26+; an admission interview); English proficiency waivers are considered on a case-by-case basis after a student applies for admission. Your application essay, as well as written statements from your college/guidance counselor and an academic teacher, give us a greater understanding of your personal character and motivation. Important also is the quality, rather than the quantity, of your extracurricular accomplishments, whether school-, community-, or jobrelated. An offer of admission is always pending the receipt of the final transcript and its confirmation that the coursework has been completed in good standing and that no disciplinary issues have been added to the record. All offers of admission are conditional based on Denison's policy on rescinding an offer of admission (https://denison.edu/forms/policyon-rescinding-an-offer-of-admission).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Campus Visit and Interview</head><p>As you go through your college selection process, you will discover the value of a campus visit and interview. When you visit Denison, plan to spend a few hours (depending on the time of year that you visit): 30 minutes for an information session, one hour for a campus tour, 30 minutes for an interview, and another hour to visit a class of your choosing.</p><p>The Office of Admission, located in the Burton D. Morgan Center, schedules interviews from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. on weekdays, and most Saturday mornings at 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., when school is in session.</p><p>Because our admission staff travels extensively, we annually select and train a small group of outstanding Denison seniors to assist in interviewing candidates. You are likely to meet with one of these senior interviewers if you visit campus. Senior interviewers share with our regular staff the responsibility for describing the university to you and assessing your candidacy for admission. Interviews are intended to be conversational.</p><p>You are encouraged to schedule your visit online (https://denison.edu/ campus/admission/visit-campus). You may also call the Office of Admission at 740-587-6276.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alumni Interviews</head><p>Denison alumni located in many metropolitan areas across the country and overseas can serve as valuable resources and can often interview you if you are unable to visit campus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Fees</head><p>An additional fee is assessed for courses such as ceramics, sculpture, printmaking, drawing/life drawing, and photography when the student becomes the owner of tangible items created. Additional course fees also apply to certain courses, including Intermediate Cinema Production, Taekwondo, Skin and Scuba Diving, and certain Denison Seminar courses. A fee is also charged for moot court and Model U.N. participation. This is subject to change from semester to semester.</p><p>Some fine arts studio courses and science courses may have additional expenses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Deposit</head><p>A $300 enrollment deposit ($50 for certain low income students) is required of all students prior to enrollment at Denison. It is due by May 1 for entering first-year students. This deposit is held during the full term of a student's enrollment. Upon withdrawal or graduation from Denison, the deposit is first applied to any outstanding balance on the student's account, and the remainder is refunded. The deposit is forfeited if a continuing student withdraws after June 1 for the ensuing fall semester or after November 1 for the ensuing spring semester. For any new or transfer student (a student who has not attended Denison during at least one semester), the deposit is forfeited if the student withdraws after May 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semester Bills and Late Payments</head><p>Denison bills electronically. Semester bills are available in MyDenison Self-Service in early July for Fall Semester and in early December for Spring Semester. Bills are due approximately three weeks after the bill date. Bills may be paid in advance. Bills not paid by the due date are subject to a late payment fee of 1% per month or any portion thereof on the unpaid balance until the bill is paid in full. Registration for a semester is not permitted unless all fees are paid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PAYMENT OF BILLS</head><p>All bills are payable in Student Accounts. To help develop a sense of responsibility and a greater appreciation of the educational opportunity, the university has a policy of collecting payment from the student rather than from his or her parents. The student, however, may grant another party direct access to their bill.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Course and Housing Registration</head><p>The university conducts advanced course registration each semester for the ensuing semester, and housing registration each spring for the following academic year.</p><p>All fees must be paid to permit advanced courses and housing registration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Miscellaneous Bills</head><p>Invoices for miscellaneous items such as lost keys, identification cards, residence hall damages, lock core changes, medications and other health services, and driving and parking infractions are issued by the department authorizing the bill, with a copy mailed to the student at his/ her Slayter Box and a copy sent to Student Accounts. All charges (except as noted below) are included on the comprehensive billing statement, which is available electronically in Denison Self-Service. Confidential health center services are added to the account only if not paid within 10 days. Unpaid library fines and other miscellaneous charges are also periodically added to the billing statement.</p><p>The university reserves the right to notify parents when scheduled payments are not met by the student. Students may want to grant others direct access to all bills, both semester and miscellaneous. The student can accomplish this by completing the steps outlined in the "Grant Access" link in their Denison Self-Service account.</p><p>A student is ineligible to attend classes unless his or her bills are paid when due. A student is denied an honorable separation, an official record of credits, or a diploma until all university bills are paid in full.</p><p>The policy on breakage fees applies to all supplies and equipment issued in any lab course in chemistry (including directed studies, senior research, and individual work for honors) or through the Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation Department. In addition to breakage fees, the Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation Department also charges for lost equipment if the student is negligent in returning borrowed equipment by the date requested.</p><p>Although a record is kept of all breakage, students are not ordinarily charged for breakage amounting to less than $5 per semester. However, when the breakage in any one semester is $5 or more, students will be billed directly by Student Accounts for the total amount of all breakage, including the first $5.</p><p>Additionally, students who fail to check out of a laboratory or locker properly (either when dropping a course during a semester or at the regular check-out time at the end of a semester) will be charged a fee of $25, plus the cost of any breakage, regardless of the amount.</p><p>Where applicable, refunds are automatically issued upon withdrawal or graduation. Continuing students may request refunds any time their account has a credit balance of $25 or greater, or at the end of the academic year if the credit balance is less than $25.</p><p>The university accepts checks for payment of bills; however, a $30 charge is assessed on all payments returned by the bank. The university does not provide check-cashing privileges for students at Student Accounts. Granville has numerous banking and savings institutions that offer a variety of checking and savings plans. It is recommended that students establish an account with a local financial institution to facilitate their bill-paying and cash needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payment Plans</head><p>Several monthly payment plans and long-term loans are available to parents of Denison students. Details of these plans are sent to students each spring for the following year of enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VETERANS BENEFITS AND TRANSITION ACT OF 2018</head><p>In accordance with the VBTA, Denison agrees to make certain concessions to existing policy for covered individuals. A covered individual is any individual who is entitled to educational assistance under chapter 31, Vocational Rehabilitation, or chapter 33, Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. These concessions, outlined below, are limited to the portion of funds paid by the Veterans Administration.</p><p>We will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement of funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs under chapter 31 or 33.</p><p>We will permit any covered individual to attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a Certificate of Eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 and ending on the earlier of the following dates:</p><p>1.

For further information, please consult Withdrawal from the College.</p><p>In the event of an official withdrawal after the first day of classes, a student may receive a partial refund. The withdrawal process begins when a student meets with the dean of students or his/her designee for an exit interview. A student will not be considered withdrawn without an exit interview. Upon official withdrawal or suspension, any adjustments to the account are automatically made in accordance with university policy and a refund or bill will be sent as needed.

Contact the Office of Financial Aid (https:// denison.edu/campus/admission/financial-aid) by phone (740-587-6276) or email (finaid@denison.edu).</p><p>The enrollment deposit will be forfeited if a withdrawal is made after June 1 for the ensuing fall semester or after November 1 for the ensuing spring semester (for continuing students), or after May 1 (for entering first-year or transfer students).</p><p>A student will receive a refund of tuition, activity fee, and health center fee based upon withdrawal before the end of the respective full week of classes. The room refund (including personal possessions) will be based on the date the student is determined to have vacated university premises and returned their room key. Please see chart below. No refunds are granted after the 8th week (9th week for medical withdrawal). In the event of withdrawal of a student because of dismissal, the medical withdrawal schedule will apply. A student who stops attendance without completing an exit interview or notifying the dean of students of their withdrawal is not entitled to a refund of charges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal</head><p>A pro rata refund of the board charge will be made following official withdrawal or dismissal from Denison as of the date the student vacates university premises and discontinues use of university facilities and services. The dean of students will determine this date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Conditions</head><p>If a student withdraws after the deadline and before the first day of classes because of illness or other approved extenuating circumstance, the enrollment deposit may be temporarily held. (Extenuating circumstances must be approved in advance by the Office of Student Development or Admission, whichever is appropriate.) If the student does not register during the following two semesters, the deposit is forfeited. The withdrawal deadline is June 1 for the ensuing fall semester and November 1 for the ensuing spring semester for continuing students, and May 1 for entering first-year or transfer students.</p><p>Fees for applied music lessons or other course fees are not refunded after the fourth week in the case of a student withdrawing for any reason from a course or from the university.</p><p>In the unlikely event that a public health agency requires Denison University to halt operations--including the cancellation of classes-as the result of a pandemic or some similar occurrence, Denison will reopen and continue the semester as soon as public authorities permit it. Prepaid tuition, fees, room, and board would not be refunded under this circumstance. Prepayments will be held and applied to the continued semester as though there were no interruption of services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motor Vehicle Policy</head><p>All students are required to register any vehicle present on the Denison campus. A Denison registration sticker is not only a parking permit, but is also required for roadway use of a motor vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Glasses Requirement</head><p>In accordance with the provisions of the state law (i. All students enrolled in specified laboratory and studio courses in art, biology, chemistry, geosciences, physical education, physics, theatre, and cinema MUST wear industrial-quality eye protective devices at all times while participating or observing any of the laboratory or studio work.</p><p>The Ohio law (a copy of which is on file in the departments named above) is written in such a way that "industrial-quality eye protective devices" means devices meeting the standards of the American National Standard Practice for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection (Z87.  approved by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and subsequent revisions thereof, provided such revisions are approved and adopted by the State of Ohio Industrial Commission. In particular, the law specifies that "all impact resistant lenses must be capable of withstanding an impact test in which a five-eighths inch steel ball weighing approximately fifty-six hundredths of an ounce is dropped from a height of fifty inches upon the horizontal upper surface of the lens in the manner prescribed under the code of federal regulations, Title 21, Section 3.84."</p><p>Please note that eyeglasses normally supplied by your optician, optometrist, or ophthalmologist may be specified to be "impact-resistant" and still not meet the specifications of the Ohio law, as quoted above.</p><p>Accordingly, students enrolled in the above departmental courses and who do not ordinarily wear glasses will, without exception, be required to purchase a pair of safety glasses meeting the above specifications. Such glasses will ordinarily be available in the Denison bookstore, but they may be purchased elsewhere. Students who already wear prescription lenses (either contact or otherwise) will also be required to wear safety glasses when in the laboratory, studio, or work areas. These may be of a variety that cover their ordinary glasses, or they may be a pair prepared according to the student's prescription and meeting the safety standards. The university has arrangements with a local supplier to furnish both kinds at prices that are both fair and competitive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Information</head><p>Denison is strongly committed to enrolling highly qualified students, regardless of their financial means. Because qualified, committed, and involved students are the lifeblood of our university, we regard each one as an invaluable asset to Denison. Denison meets 100% of the institutionally determined financial need of all students who apply for need-based financial aid.</p><p>If you have any doubts about your family's ability to pay for a Denison education without help, don't hesitate to apply for financial aid (https:// denison.edu/campus/admission/apply-for-financial-aid). The Office of Financial Aid welcomes the opportunity to help you and your family plan for college.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying for Financial Aid</head><p>To apply for need-based financial aid at Denison University, domestic students must file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by November 15 (for Early Decision 1 applicants) or by January 15 (for Early Decision 2 and Regular Decision applicants). All need-based aid applicants must also submit the CSS Profile by those same deadlines. International applicants who do not wish to apply for financial aid must submit a Certification of Finances. Denison's FAFSA code is 003042 and Denison's CSS Profile code is 1164.</p><p>If you are admitted, we want you to have a realistic opportunity to enroll at Denison. When we make an offer of financial assistance, we offer funds from federal, state, and institutional sources to help meet your need.</p><p>Denison students intending to apply for financial aid while enrolled elsewhere must consult with the Office of Financial Aid. Individual circumstances will vary, but accepting aid elsewhere may impact a student's ability to receive aid after returning to Denison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of Financial Aid</head><p>Financial aid awarded is designed to help meet a student's financial need, if the student has applied for need-based financial aid. Financial packages will usually consist of up to four types of aid: scholarships, grants, student employment, and/or loans.</p><p>Denison's endowment supports the awarding of all Denison merit scholarships and Denison need-based grant aid each year, totaling over $60 million.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scholarships</head><p>Denison annually offers several merit scholarships to first-year students, and scholarships generally range from $5,000 to full tuition. Students who wish to be considered for merit-based scholarships must submit a completed application for admission by the deadline for their chosen admission round, unless otherwise noted. All of Denison's merit scholarships and awards are given for four years (eight semesters), and they cannot be applied toward off-campus study tuition charges. Merit scholarships require recipients to maintain a 2.0 GPA, unless otherwise stipulated in the donor agreement.</p><p>A limited number of departmental scholarships are also available to selected students, based on factors such as outstanding academic achievement and fine arts talent. If you are eligible to be considered for such a scholarship, you will be either considered automatically or invited to apply by the appropriate academic department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grants</head><p>Grant aid is typically based on financial need, as determined by your FAFSA and CSS Profile, if you filed these for your first year at Denison. Denison awards grants from our own funds and from outside sources. We participate in the Federal Pell Grant program, the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) program, and certain state grant programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Employment</head><p>Every student at Denison may have an opportunity to work. Students are not required to work; however, if they have been awarded a work program in their award letter, they may earn up to the amount listed for the academic year. Student employment earnings are NOT deducted from your tuition bill, because they must be earned from work. Students are responsible for finding their own job and contacting the supervisor to arrange interviews. Available jobs can be found on myDenison in the HR and Employees tab. Students must submit all paperwork requirements to the HR office before they begin working. Students and supervisors can find the supervisor and student employee manuals on myDenison for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loans</head><p>Your financial aid award may contain a Denison Scholar Loan, a Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The Denison Scholar Loan and Federal Direct Subsidized loans are similar in that there is no interest or repayment on the principal while the student is in school at least half-time, and interest begins to accumulate following graduation or upon ceasing to be enrolled half-time.

Conducted in French. This course satisfies the upperlevel writing requirement. Advanced study of special topics in language, literature or culture. Conducted in French. This course satisfies the upper-level writing requirement. Must be taken in senior year. the Department of Geosciences we investigate the Earth in the broadest sense: how it formed, how it evolved and continues to evolve, how Earth systems interact to produce the environment in which we live, and how present and future changes may affect the habitability of Earth. The central goal of the department is to educate students about the nature and history of the Earth, the processes that shape the Earth, and the impacts those processes have on human populations.An understanding of the Earth is an important component of global citizenship. Many critical environmental issues face humanity, including global climate change, water shortages, loss of arable land, natural hazards such as earthquakes and flooding, and the availability of petroleum and other energy resources. Citizens and professionals with training in the geosciences will contribute to addressing these and other problems, while increasing opportunities for humans to live sustainably on the Earth.The department provides non-majors with a basic knowledge of the Earth and Earth processes that will serve their needs as future citizens and community leaders. Geoscience majors and minors develop a strong background in the geosciences in preparation for employment opportunities in fields such as environmental science, geotechnical engineering, exploration for natural resources, geologic research, environmental law, and earth science teaching. Many geoscience graduates continue their training in graduate school; others enter the work force directly.</figDesc><table><row><cell>FREN FREN 312 -Survey of Literature of French Expression: 19th-21st</cell></row><row><cell>Centuries (4 Credit Hours)</cell></row><row><cell>Introduction to major literary and cultural movements and figures with</cell></row><row><cell>readings from representative authors.

Current topics include: Rare Earth -Building a Habitable Planet. What does it take to build a planet that harbors intelligent life? Are habitable planets common in the Universe, or is Earth the only one? In this course we will examine the development of planet Earth in light of the hypothesis that conditions necessary for a habitable planet are extremely rare in the universe. While emphasizing geology, this examination will involve us in aspects of biology and paleontology, astronomy and astrogeology, philosophy and even theology. Laboratory exercises will allow hands-on investigation of rocks, fossils, geologic maps, and other data important to our understanding of the development of planet Earth.

The Japanese empire's cataclysmic clash with the Republic of China and (eventually) the United States left Japan in ruins and under American occupation, China and Vietnam in the grip of Communist revolutions, and Korea divided between American and Soviet spheres of influence.The consequences of these events led to America's war in Vietnam and still define and bedevil East Asia's geopolitics today. Our readings will include some of the most significant recent scholarship on five conflicts: the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Pacific War, the Chinese Civil War, the French Indochina War, and the Korean War. Although we will read much about politics, diplomacy, and military campaigns, our focus will just as often be on the experiences and stories of ordinary people caught in extraordinarily harrowing times.

This region experienced a tumultuous history during this time period, afflicted by war, occupation, dictatorship, and the displacement of populations. The late twentieth-century also witnessed a period of revolution and was at the centerpiece of the demise of the Cold War. In this context, questions of national belonging loomed large. Ethnicity played and continues to play a central role in the development of nationalism and historical memory. This course explores the experience and meaning of ethnicity in the context of shifting political realities and national contexts. Course topics include the impact of World War II on Central and Eastern European ethnic groups, the experience of ethnic minorities in USSR-dominated Cold War Europe, late twentieth-century revolutions in the region, and the dissolution of Yugoslavia.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_158"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This course examines the primary research methods and data analysis procedures used by psychologists to describe, predict, interpret and/ or explain psychological phenomena and behavior. Observational, experimental, and quasi-experimental methods are studied along with principles of research design, control, validity, reliability, and ethical practice. Throughout the course, methodological procedures are considered in conjunction with principles and methods of data analysis, presentation, and interpretation. The logic and procedures of descriptive and inferential statistics are emphasized. This course prepares students to design, conduct, analyze and evaluate psychological research and is a prerequisite for all psychology research courses at the 200 and 300-level. The learning processes of instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning, and the interactions of those learning processes, comprise the main focus of the course. Theory, research, implications and applications pertaining to the basic principles of behavior are emphasized. The course, and learning/conditioning research traditionally, is valuable because of the use of models to understand learning about biologically and emotionally significant experiences. Unconscious learning and seemingly irrational reactions are considered in depth. Much of the course content is relevant to applied topics such as behavior modification, substance abuse problems, anxiety, depression, other behavior disorders, education and parenting practices. This course does not cover techniques for improving academic learning skills for students. Feminism and philosophy both make the invisible visible, the implicit explicit. Both make us aware of assumptions we make in our everyday lives and challenge us to justify them. This course examines ways in which feminist theory enriches philosophy and vice versa. Feminist criticism probes some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions about our knowledge of and interaction with the world and other people. How does feminism destabilize philosophy and affect philosophical conceptions of knowledge, reality, metaphysics, agency, or morality? How does philosophy enrich feminist understandings of oppression, privilege, or equality? We will consider a range of forms of oppression and privilege, particularly as they affect women, and conceptions of sex, gender, and race in the context of debates about gender violence, work and family, as well as feminist discussions of epistemology, ethics, and science. Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or Women's and Gender Studies, or consent. This course addresses fundamental questions regarding the nature of the human mind and thought. Students will be introduced to the leading contemporary theories of mind as well as critical responses to these theories. They will become acquainted with the works of philosophers such as Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Daniel Dennett, Patricia Churchland, Fred Dretske, Ruth Millikan, Hillary Putnam, and others. We will address questions such as whether we can know there are other minds, whether mental states are identical or reducible to brain states, how it is that our thoughts can be about anything at all, whether there is a "language of thought", and whether our ordinary talk about mental events genuinely explains human actions.</figDesc><table><row><cell>PSYC 200 -Research Methods and Statistics (4 Credit Hours) PHIL 275 -Philosophy of Feminism (4 Credit Hours)</cell></row><row><cell>To promote research ethics, all PSYC 200 students must successfully</cell></row><row><cell>complete the Citi Program's Research Ethics &amp; Compliance training.</cell></row><row><cell>Prerequisite(s): PSYC 100 or PSYC 199.</cell></row><row><cell>PSYC 310 -Psychology of Learning (4 Credit Hours) An intensive survey of experimental research on fundamental emotional Crosslisting: QS 275, WGST 275.</cell></row><row><cell>cognitive processes of learning and memory, with a focus on how those PHIL 280 -Philosophy of Mind (4 Credit Hours)</cell></row><row><cell>processes manifest themselves in, influence, and determine behavior.</cell></row><row><cell>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, Neuroscience</cell></row><row><cell>concentrator, or consent.</cell></row><row><cell>Prerequisite(s): PSYC 100 or PSYC 199.</cell></row><row><cell>late beginning/</cell></row><row><cell>early intermediate level) repertoire.

We spend much of our time trying to answer such questions as: How ought we to act? What should we value? and What type of person should we be? Yet, it seems right that we can evaluate our answers to these questions and decide among them only if we correctly answer another set of questions first. For instance, how can we know what we should value unless we understand what values are, whether they exist and whether we can know them if they do? How can we know how we ought to act if we do not know what it means for an act to be morally good or why we are even obligated to do what is morally good in the first place? This course pursues answers to this other set of questions. It inquires into the nature of ethical statements, properties, judgments and attitudes. As such, it draws on many other areas of philosophy, including epistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language.

We will examine questions such as: What is justice? Can it be defined independently of consideration of what the "good" is for human beings? Is justice possible in a society marked by significant religious, ethnic, cultural or other sorts of pluralisms? What is the relation between justice and nationhood, and what can be said about justice between nations? How is justice connected to social equality, and to liberty? What is meant by economic justice? What is the relation between justice and democracy? The course will examine contemporary philosophical debates about these questions, in order to help students think critically about the issue of justice in the context of the pressing real world issues in which such questions play a crucial role. </p></div>

This tradition can be distinguished in a number of ways. Methodologically, it tends to employ careful argumentation and formal tools like logic and mathematics to provide analyses of scientific, psychological, and linguistic data. Historically, it is usually traced back to a group of Anglo-European philosophers-Frege, Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein-writing around the beginning of the twentieth century. Thematically, it is primarily driven by the ambition of providing a systematic account of the relationship between language, thought, and the world. This course explores early and recent contributions of the analytic tradition to epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and ethics.

What is the relation between language and thought? This course will address topics such as reference, the role of speaker intentions, and the indeterminacy of translation. Students will be introduced to several strands of philosophy of language such as formal semantics and ordinary language philosophy, and will become familiar with the writings of philosophers ranging from Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein to Quine, Austin, Putnam, Searle, Chomsky, Davidson, and others.

The Japanese empire's cataclysmic clash with the Republic of China and (eventually) the United States left Japan in ruins and under American occupation, China and Vietnam in the grip of Communist revolutions, and Korea divided between American and Soviet spheres of influence. The consequences of these events led to America's war in Vietnam and still define and bedevil East Asia's geopolitics today. Our readings will include some of the most significant recent scholarship on five conflicts: the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Pacific War, the Chinese Civil War, the French Indochina War, and the Korean War. Although we will read much about politics, diplomacy, and military campaigns, our focus will just as often be on the experiences and stories of ordinary people caught in extraordinarily harrowing times.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTL 200 -Themes and Approaches in International Studies (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The main goals of this course are to introduce sophomore students, who have completed INTL100, to some of the key themes and theories within the purview of International Studies to help them shape their individual concentrations in the major. The course also provides opportunities for students to examine various world problems through an interdisciplinary lens, drawing on both political-economic and sociocultural analytical frameworks in various disciplines. Finally, students learn the basics of academic research and writing processes, i.e., formulating a well-defined topic, posing a relevant research question, finding and interrogating appropriate sources, justifying the research's intellectual contribution to a broader scholarly audience and, when applicable, to the efforts to solve real-world problems, through writing and revising a carefully crafted prose. Among numerous debates and issues that International Studies scholars grapple with, the course focuses on four broadly conceived themes: economic development, nationalism and national identity, transnational migration, and mediated and material culture. After learning major scholarly approaches to theorize each of these themes, students develop individual research project and write a scholarly paper, complete with abstract, introduction, literature review, case study, and conclusion. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to formulate, broaden, and contextualize their thematic and topical concentrations within the interdisciplinary scheme of International Studies, and be equipped with academic research skills to pursue their concentrations in the major.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTL 201 -Major Proposal for International Studies (1 Credit Hour)</head><p>The required mid-level course is for all International Studies majors. The goals of this one-credit course are to create a vibrant intellectual community of students, in which they collaboratively formulate individual interests in the field of International Studies through discussion and peer-reviews in class, and consultation with the course coordinator (International Studies Program Director) and faculty advisor assigned by the coordinator. Through these processes, the students are expected to not only develop strong camaraderie among them as the new INTL majors, but also formulate comprehensive plans for how they will pursue their interests in International Studies during their final two years at Denison. This involves charting out their courses in International Studies for the next two years-including coursework from off-campus study programs that they wish to count towards the International Studies major. By the end of the course, students submit the major proposal, in which they synthesize coursework, off-campus study (or an internship), and language training in a way that allows them to develop a coherent area of expertise within International Studies, and they will share their goals and plans with their cohort and a wider International Studies community. The proposals will be evaluated by the course coordinator, who consults with the entire International Studies Program Committee.</p></div>

This course is an intermediate-level survey of western philosophy from their period (now known as the "Early Modern" or "Modern" era, which runs roughly from 1600-1800). While these and other thinkers (such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley) in this era dealt with a wide variety of subjects, we will focus mostly on their contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. We will address their writings with three different aims: a) to appreciate the sense in which they were, at one time, fresh and radical; b) to understand how, for better or for worse, they set the foundation for much of the modern-western, anyway-worldview; and c) to determine if what they say is either true or false.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REL 211 -Introduction to the Bible (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The Bible is a book --or rather, a collection of books --produced and assembled over long stretches of time, worked and re-worked by various groups within the relatively small and usually crisis-ridden community of Israel. In other words, it is a history of revisions, as Israel attempted to make sense of itself amidst changing times and new empires. This course introduces students not only to the historical contexts, literary variety, and major narrative traditions of the Bible, but the social forces guiding its eventual composition as a book. Thus the New Testament will be engaged not as the founding documents of Christianity, but as one of many ongoing Jewish interpretations of Israelite traditions in the context of the Roman Empire.</p></div>

How did the New Testament become what it is now, the foundational documents of a dominant tradition? How does reading with deep historical attention to Israel's history under Rome change what we think New Testament texts say? We will also be reading some "early Christian" texts that did not make it into the New Testament (The Gospel of Mary, The Gospel of Thomas, The Acts of Paul and Thecla), and asking how the New Testament came to be a collection that rendered the very Hebrew traditions composing it an "old" testament.</p></div>

This course will explore various religious traditions' responses to the social issues on both domestic and global level, including American foreign policy, Israel-Palestine relations, ecological crisis, racism, economic disparity, and sexual violence. The key moral principles drawn from multiple traditions are love, justice, and compassion. In light of these key principles, students will analyze complex social issues and delineate resolutions for the issues.</p></div>

What can we learn from those who have struggled to bring gender equality and peace in human society? Is religion anti-feminist or feminism antireligious? In spite of cultural, racial and religious diversity among women across the globe, women often share the similar stories of physical and psychological suffering caused by their institutionalized religions and societies. Many of these women also testify that their religions enabled them to resist injustice and to build up solidarity with others including men. This course invites the students to explore the spiritual journeys of the feminist activists---their struggles for justice for all humanity. Crosslisting: WGST 227.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REL 230 -Creation Narratives and Power Relations (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>Writing and re-writing the story of the creation of the world was a common ancient practice, especially as people experienced new or increasingly difficult political and social circumstances. In fact, ancient people regularly used descriptions of the creation of the world to express their dissatisfaction with the world in which they lived, to reimagine it, or to justify or critique the powers-that-be. This course reads a breadth of ancient literature describing the creation of the cosmos for not only their literary beauty and philosophical influences/distinctions, but their social and political implications. How do ideas of what is "human" support forms of ideal citizenship? How do these texts imagine and naturalize gender differences, the differences and affiliations between animals and humans, and the reason for pain and suffering in the world? How do they understand the world's beauty alongside the ugliness of war? How do they try to transform the chaotic realities of the world into an ordered whole?

(4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The premise of the course is that America functions in the world and in our lives as an empire. While some would argue that we are "the indispensable nation, " others contend that America uses its power in its own interests, even the interests of an elite segment of the country. Consideration is given to the role of capitalism as a distributor of goods and services and the ways in which it forges identity and addresses issues of equity. While there is a discreet focus on class, race, and gender, those issues emerge in other contexts. Attention is given to the biblical tradition as a model for responding to empire, and the ways in which it is exploitive. This course fulfills the Power and Justice (P) GE requirement.</p></div>

The goals are to better understand how and why race often remains a taboo subject in the study of religion and the ways in which race and ethnicity are relevant to religious studies scholarship. To do this, the class examines the development of categories of race, ethnicity, nation, and religion in the context of American religious history and sociology. We then turn our attention to landmark texts and problems in contemporary scholarship. These texts engage with a variety of racial and religious identities.</p></div>

Why were early Christians described as a "new race" of people? Why did early Christians use the language of race and ethnicity to describe themselves, and how does that fit together with Christians' universal theological claims about inclusion and being "for all people"? What does ancient Israel as a broken nation, conquered by the Romans, have to do with understanding who Jesus was and what Jesus and his death might have meant in the first century?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REL 312 -The Holocaust: Where Was God (4 Credit Hours)</head><p>The course intends to provoke an awareness of the Holocaust as a historical event, with particular attention to the death camps, and an agenda to eliminate Jews. Consideration will be given to the ways in which individuals were co-opted or resisted, and institutions accommodated or were oppositional. As a religion course it will consider alternative theological responses to the deadly event and the understanding of God. The range of positions will be from the death of god to the preservation of orthodoxy. Finally, attention will be given to the presence of women in the death camps and the designation of God as Mother.</p></div>
