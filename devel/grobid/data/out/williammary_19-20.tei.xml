<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>laws, regulations, policies and ethical norms applicable to them. More generally, we are to be honest, fair, and trustworthy ourselves and to take care that other members of the university community are also.</p><p>We, as members of the William &amp; Mary community, will:</p><p>1. Obey the laws, regulations and policies applicable to our university activities.</p><p>2. Protect and preserve university resources and ensure their proper use.</p><p>3. Avoid both conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b972">4</ref>. Safeguard confidential information.</p><p>5. Make procurement decisions impartially and objectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b877">6</ref>. Maintain effective internal controls to safeguard the regularity and integrity of our activities.</p><p>7. Treat other people with dignity and respect, ensuring there is no discrimination or harassment at William &amp; Mary.</p><p>8. Report any illegal or unethical action that comes to our attention, so the university can investigate and take corrective steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals</head><p>In fulfilling its mission,William &amp; Mary adopts the following specific goals:</p><p>• to attract outstanding students from diverse backgrounds;</p><p>• to develop a diverse faculty which is nationally and internationally recognized for excellence in both teaching and research;</p><p>• to provide a challenging undergraduate program with a liberal arts and sciences curriculum that encourages creativity, independent thought, and intellectual depth, breadth and curiosity;</p><p>• to offer high quality graduate and professional programs that prepare students for intellectual, professional and public leadership;</p><p>• to instill in its students an appreciation for the human condition, a concern for the public wellbeing and a life-long commitment to learning; and the effective operation of all the institutions under its control. The Board consists of seventeen members appointed by and accountable to the Governor of Virginia and confirmed by the General Assembly. Within the limits of its facilities and its obligations as a state university, William &amp; Mary offers the possibility of admission to all qualified students without regard to sex, race, color, age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Admission</head><p>Seeking students with diverse backgrounds, interests and abilities, and welcoming applications from all interested students, the university evaluates each application on its own merits. Application materials, including detailed information regarding undergraduate admission, may be obtained by consulting the university's website www.wm.edu. Applications for the freshman class are due by November 1 for Early Decision candidates and January 1 for Early Decision II and Regular Decision candidates. Acceptance under Early Decision or Early Decision II is binding. Transfer applicants should apply by November 1 for the spring semester and March 1 for the fall semester. Acceptance of an application submitted after these dates will be considered on a case by case basis. No transfer applicant will be admitted as a degree candidate later than two weeks prior to the start of classes. No freshman applicant will be admitted from the waitlist later than August 1. University policy prohibits the awarding of a second baccalaureate degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notification to Applicants</head><p>Early Decision notifications are sent by early December, Early Decision II notifications by mid-February and Regular Decision notifications are sent by April 1. Spring semester transfer applicants are sent decisions in early December, and fall semester transfers are sent decisions by early May. Prior to enrollment, all students must submit official copies of their final transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary School Preparation</head><p>Since more students apply than can be accommodated, the university uses a selective process of admission. Through this holistic process, the applicant's total educational record is considered in relation to other students applying in an attempt to admit those with the strongest academic and personal credentials. Most candidates have pursued as strong a college preparatory program as is available to them. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, honors and accelerated courses are strongly weighted in the evaluation process. Candidates for admission typically have completed the following courses at the secondary level:</p><p>• English: Four years (literature and strong training in writing) • Mathematics: Four years • Foreign Language (Ancient or Modern): At least four years of one foreign language recommended • History and Social Science: At least three years • Science (with laboratory): At least three years • Elective Courses: Advanced mathematics, history, natural science, English, music, art, drama and other humanities.</p><p>Candidates from Virginia high schools are encouraged to take a program leading to the Advanced Studies Diploma as a minimum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standardized Tests</head><p>Freshman applicants are required to take either the SAT or the ACT. SAT Subject Tests are not required to complete an application, but may be submitted for consideration as an optional part of the application. Students can meet the university's foreign language requirement either by completing the fourth level of one foreign language in secondary school or by scoring 600 or above in the subject test in a modern foreign language or 650 or above in Latin. Students intending to continue a foreign language should see the "Foreign Language Proficiency" section for placement information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission of Undergraduate Transfer Students</head><p>A transfer student is anyone who wishes to enroll in an undergraduate degree program at William &amp; Mary and has attended another college or university after graduation from high school. Students admitted as freshmen do not receive college credit according to the same rules and agreements that apply to transfer students. Transfer students are admitted for both the fall and the spring semesters. In order to enroll at the university, transfer applicants must be in good standing and eligible to return to their last institution of full-time attendance. Students who have completed less than a full year of college coursework at the time of application must submit SAT or ACT scores, unless the student has been out of high school for more than five years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission Prior to the Completion of High School</head><p>The university may admit as freshmen a limited number of students with outstanding records at the end of their junior year in high school. The Admission Committee expects that these students have exhausted their high school curriculum. Such students are encouraged to seek diplomas from their secondary schools after completing their freshman year, and they may be required to visit the campus for a personal interview as part of the admission process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent Courses</head><p>The university allows qualified local students to take courses for college credit concurrently with their secondary school program. Initial approval should be requested through the high school administration prior to the filing of the application for non-degree status, which may be secured from the website of the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Admission as a concurrent student does not guarantee subsequent admission as a degree-seeking student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flexible Degree Track (Flex Track) Admission for Nontraditional Students</head><p>Transfer and Freshman applicants may be eligible for admission as FlexTrack students if they live in the Williamsburg area, meet the usual admission standards of the university and can show compelling reasons why full-time status is not feasible. In determining whether FlexTrack status is warranted, consideration will be given to the applicant's background. A FlexTrack student must earn a minimum of 12 hours each year (two semesters and a summer term) from the date of enrollment and must complete all degree requirements in effect at the time of enrollment, and all major requirements in effect at the time of the declaration of major. FlexTrack students are limited to no more than 10 credit hours in their first semester at the university. Students who believe they meet these standards because their status has changed since matriculation as a full-time student may petition the Committee on Academic Status for FlexTrack student status. Any FlexTrack students who wish to have their status changed to full-time may also petition the Committee on Academic Status. The Dean of Students Office must be notified in advance of semesters away, and students who do not comply must reapply for FlexTrack status when they wish to return. A maximum of 20 FlexTrack students will be admitted in any one year, each assigned to an advisor who will stress the importance of building a coherent program. FlexTrack students will not be eligible for residence hall accommodations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deferred Enrollment for Admitted Freshmen</head><p>Students who are offered admission to the freshman class may request a deferral of their enrollment for one year by notifying the Office of Undergraduate Admission of their intentions in writing. Students admitted during Early Decision or admitted from the waitlist are ineligible for deferred enrollment.</p><p>Admitted freshmen who are approved for this option must commit to enrolling the following fall and must submit a re-activate admission application by November 1. These students will be guaranteed space if they satisfy the requirements made as conditions of their original admission and do not enroll as a degree-seeking student at another institution. They must have an honorable record in the intervening year. Assurance of future admission does not apply to students who enroll as degree-seeking at another institution; in such cases, it will be necessary to consider the student as a transfer applicant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Non-Degree Status</head><p>During the Fall and Spring semesters, non-degree-seeking status is limited to: 1) students who have already earned baccalaureate degrees (official transcript required), 2) students on official visiting status from another domestic four-year college or university, and 3) concurrent high school students. Students in the first two categories should apply for non-degree status through the Office of the University Registrar. Current high school students seeking concurrent enrollment should inquire through their counseling offices to the Office of Undergraduate Admission.</p><p>Non-degree status is granted for one semester only; therefore, students must reapply every semester.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Financial Aid</head><p>The Office of Student Financial Aid coordinates all financial assistance to undergraduate students. Most assistance is based on financial need, with a limited number of academic and talent scholarships available. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Assistance</head><p>Financial assistance is available to undergraduates who need additional resources to meet the cost of education at the university. Demonstrated financial need and eligibility for federal financial aid is established through an analysis of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Entering freshmen and transfer applicants must also submit the College Board's (CSS), Profile application to be considered for institutional need-based financial aid. In most cases, in-state Virginia undergraduates may expect sufficient support to meet financial need, while out-of-state undergraduates may receive partial support. All need-based assistance, is dependent upon demonstrated financial need and the availability of funds.</p><p>Assistance is offered on an annual basis, but may be renewed if demonstrated financial need continues and the student otherwise qualifies. Renewal requires the completion of the FAFSA for each succeeding year. The university's standard of satisfactory academic progress, which is generally the same as that required for continuance at the university, is outlined in the Guide to Financial Aid, available at http://www.wm.edu/admission/financialaid/information/guides/index.php.</p><p>Most financial assistance programs for undergraduates require full-time enrollment during the fall and spring semesters. For federal aid purposes, only courses counting toward a student's degree plan may be used to determine a student's enrollment level. Federal Loans require half-time enrollment. Federal Pell Grants require full-time enrollment to receive 100% of a student's annual eligibility. Partial Pell Grants may be received as long as the student is enrolled in courses that count as part of the student's degree.</p><p>Application and Notification timeline: Entering students are classified as early decision, early decision 2, regular decision, and transfers. Early Decision applicants wanting a tentative determination of aid eligibility should submit the FASFA and CSS Profile by December 11. All other entering students should file the FAFSA by March 1. Entering freshmen and transfers should also submit the CSS Profile application by March 1. Returning students should file the FAFSA by March 15. Applications submitted after the deadline may not receive full grant consideration (depending on fund availability). Entering students receive award notifications shortly after notified of their admission decision. Continuing students receive renewal aid notifications once spring grades are finalized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Financial Assistance Package</head><p>The financial assistance offer may include a scholarship, grant, Federal Direct Student Loan, and/or Federal Work-Study.

A statutory schedule is used to determine the amount of Title IV funds a student has earned as of the date the student withdraws or ceases attendance. Please be advised that the Federal return of funds calculation has a different percent of attendance schedule than the university's withdrawal policy.</p><p>If a student withdraws from college prior to completing 60% of a semester, the Financial Aid Office must recalculate the students eligibility for all funds received, including Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on a percent of earned aid using the following Federal Return of Title IV funds formula:</p><p>Percent of aid earned = the number of days completed up to the withdrawal date, divided by the total days in the semester. (Any break of five days or more is not counted as part of the days in the semester.)</p><p>For Title IV purposes, the withdrawal date will be the date of notification of intent to withdraw, which may be earlier than the withdrawal date for the purpose of tuition reimbursement. If a student does not formally withdraw but ceases to attend classes, the withdrawal date under Title IV will be the mid-point of the semester.</p><p>Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percent of unearned aid using the following formula:</p><p>Aid to be returned = (100% minus the percent earned) multiplied by the amount of aid disbursed toward institutional charges.</p><p>Keep in mind that, when funds are returned, the student borrower may owe a balance to the university. If that is the case, the student should contact the Student Accounts/Bursars Office to make payment arrangements.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility for In-State Tuition Rate</head><p>To be eligible for in-state tuition, a student must meet the statutory test for domicile as set forth in Section 23-7.4 of the Code of Virginia. Domicile is a technical legal concept. In general, to establish domicile, students must be able to prove permanent residency in Virginia for at least one continuous year immediately the first official day of classes, and intend to remain in Virginia indefinitely after graduation. Residence in Virginia for the primary purpose of attending college does not provide eligibility for in-state tuition. Applicants seeking in-state status must complete and submit the "Application for Virginia In-State Tuition Privileges" by the first day of classes of the semester for which In-state eligibility is sought. The application is evaluated and the student is notified in writing if the request for in-state tuition is denied. Under Virginia law, students under age 24 are rebuttably presumed to be dependent on a parent/guardian, and, unless an exception is identified, the parent/guardian's domicile status determines the student's tuition rate.</p><p>Special rules apply to veteran, active-duty, and military dependent students and non-U.S. citizens; contact the Registrar's Office for details or visit www.wm.edu/registrar.</p><p>A matriculating student whose domicile has changed may request reclassification from out-of-state to instate. Students seeking reclassification must complete and submit the "Application for Virginia In-State Tuition Privileges" to the Office of the University Registrar. The Office of the University Registrar evaluates the application and notifies the student only if the request for in-state tuition is denied. Any student may submit in writing an appeal to the decision made, however, a change in classification will only be made when justified by clear and convincing evidence. All questions about eligibility for domiciliary status should be addressed to the Office of the University Registrar, (757) 221-2808. In determining domicile the school will consider the following factors for the student and parent/guardian/spouse: Credit hour surcharge-Students who qualify for in-state tuition privileges must pay a surcharge (generally calculated at out-of-state tuition rates) for courses taken after completion of 125% of the credit hours required for the degree. For example, for a bachelor's degree requiring 120 credit hours, this would mean that any credits taken beyond 150 (or 125% of 120) would be charged at the out-of-state rate. Certain exceptions apply, including AP/IB credits; see Section 23-7.4:F of the Code of Virginia for more information.</p><p>Additional information may be obtained from the William &amp; Mary website at http://www.wm.edu/registrar or directly from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) at http://www.schev.edu/.</p></div>

Academic advising is recognized at William &amp; Mary as a natural extension of the teaching responsibilities of faculty members because it is crucial to the educational development of students. With sound academic advising, students can plan an exciting and coherent liberal arts education that prepares them to reach their personal and professional goals.</p><p>The Office of Academic Advising (OAA), located in Swem Library, assigns faculty advisors to incoming students. New students, including entering transfer students, meet with their faculty advisors three times in their first year at William &amp; Mary; at these meetings they plan a program of study that suits their interests and that meets the university's academic regulations and requirements. Students must attend these meetings in order to register for the following semester.</p><p>Although students may change their advisor by submitting a request to the OAA, most retain their initial advisor until they declare their major, which is usually in the sophomore year. When students declare, they are assigned an advisor by the department, program or school in which they are completing a major. Students declaring two majors are assigned an advisor in both majors. For details on when students can or must declare a major, see the Catalog section, "Majors &amp; Minors." Students preparing for careers in medicine, veterinary science, pharmacy, dentistry, physical therapy, law, engineering, education or business should consult with the pre-professional faculty advisors for these programs. In addition, all students can supplement the guidance of their faculty advisor by consulting the professional advisors who staff the OAA. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Library Hours</head><p>Virginia state law requires all full-time students who are enrolling in a four-year public institution to provide a health history and an official immunization record. The university further requires all full-time students (including previously matriculated students) as well as any other student eligible for services as determined by their department (i.e. Language House tutors, students with an approved underload, or transfer students) to provide documentation of the same immunization requirements and health history. This form will not be accepted if the physician completing and signing the form is a family member. Previously enrolled students who are reentering as full-time students after an absence of 2 years or more must update their forms to meet current requirements. Additionally, enrolled students who are reentering as full-time students after an absence from campus of 6 years or more must resubmit the entire form. This information MUST be submitted on William &amp; Mary's Health Evaluation Form (refer to: https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/healthcenter/documents/healthevaluationform.pdf). In order to be eligible for medical care, students must have paid a Health Fee for the current semester and completed the Health Evaluation Form. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the following actions: prevention from registering for classes, ineligibility for non-urgent medical care at the Student Health Center, the assessment of a fine on your student account, and may also result in eviction from the residence halls and/or removal from campus (depending on the medical issue).</p><p>The university requires all full-time undergraduate and graduate students admitted Fall 2006 or after and all F-1 and J-1 international students to have health insurance coverage throughout the school year as a condition of enrollment. These students will be enrolled in the university-endorsed Student Health Insurance Plan and the cost will be billed to their student account in two installments (fall and spring semester) UNLESS proof of other adequate health insurance coverage is furnished. Students who already have health insurance for the entire academic year must submit a waiver request by the posted deadline each academic year and the waiver request must be approved to avoid being enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan. All other full-time undergraduate and graduate students admitted prior to Fall 2006 are not required by the university to have health insurance coverage but are eligible to enroll in the college-endorsed Student Health Insurance Plan on a voluntary basis. It is the student's responsibility to verify whether or not the charge has been billed to your student account. If there is a billing error, you should contact the Student Insurance Coordinator immediately. To access the waiver or enrollment request forms and for more information about the insurance requirement or the university-endorsed insurance plan, please visit www.wm.edu/health/insurance. The Dean of Students Office advocates for student needs, acts as liaison between students and academic departments, and provides support designed to enhance personal growth and instill a sense of personal authority and responsibility in each student. Their dedicated team of professionals assist students with any aspect of college life and provide programs and services that develop students intellectually, socially, and ethically. The Counseling Center offers a range of brief services for William &amp; Mary students in order to address psychological issues, personal concerns, interpersonal issues, and crisis intervention. Staff members are available to discuss any important personal concerns a student may be facing and work with that student to provide resources to address those concerns.</p></div>

The Student Accessibility Services Team considers reasonable accommodation on an individual and flexible basis in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The decision to request accommodation is voluntary and a matter of individual choice. Students seeking accommodation are strongly encouraged to contact Student Accessibility Services and submit all supporting documentation early to allow adequate time for planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Documentation of a Diagnosed Condition</head><p>Documentation serves two primary purposes. First, it establishes that the individual has a diagnosed condition, and therefore is protected from discrimination. Second, documentation must describe the current functional impact of the diagnosed condition so that potential accommodations can be identified.</p><p>All documentation of diagnosed conditions should consist of an evaluation by an appropriate professional that is not older than three years from the date of the first accommodation request. Included must be a clear statement of the diagnosis, the basis for the diagnosis, and the current impact of the diagnosed condition as it relates to the accommodation request. As appropriate to the diagnosed condition, the documentation should also include the following elements:</p><p>• A diagnostic statement identifying the condition, date of the most current diagnostic evaluation, and the date of the original diagnosis. • A description of the diagnostic tests, methods, and/or criteria used including specific test results and standardized test scores, as well as the examiner's narrative interpretation. • A description of the current functional impact of the diagnosed condition. This may be in the form of an examiner's narrative, and/or an interview, but must have a rational relationship to diagnostic assessments. For learning disabilities, current documentation is defined using adult norms. • A statement indicating treatments, medications, or assistive devices/services currently prescribed or in use, with a description of the mediating effects and potential side effects from such treatments. • A description of the expected progression or stability of the impact of the diagnosed condition over time, particularly the next five years. • A history of previous accommodations and their impact. <ref type="bibr">•</ref> The credentials of the diagnosing professional(s), if not clear from the letterhead or other forms.</p><p>Please note that diagnosing professionals cannot be family members or others with a close personal relationship with the individual being evaluated.</p><p>Documentation of cognitive impairment such as Specific Learning Disability, Attention Deficit Disorder, or physical, medical, and psychological disorders affecting learning must include a comprehensive report of psycho-educational or neuropsychological evaluation meeting specified documentation criteria. (Please see the Student Accessibility Services website for a list of criteria.) IEP or 504 plans will not be considered sufficient documentation unless also accompanied by a current and complete comprehensive report.</p><p>Documentation prepared for specific non-educational venues such as the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs may not meet these criteria. Records from school divisions concerning students exiting from special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will be given due consideration in determining the presence of a qualifying disability and making accommodation decisions. All documentation of disability is considered confidential and will not be released without a student's prior written consent.</p><p>Beyond the more objective determination of a diagnosed condition and its impact provided by external documentation, the university recognizes that input from the individual with this diagnosed condition is also a rich and important source of information on the impact of the condition and on the effectiveness of accommodations. Accommodation decisions are made on a case by case basis, considering the impact of a particular student's diagnosed condition within the specific context of a college-level academic environment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad/Global Education Office</head><p>William &amp; Mary has long recognized its responsibility to provide a global perspective to its curriculum so students gain the international understanding necessary to be informed citizens. The university encourages students to view study abroad as an educational objective. When planned in advance and integrated into a student's on-campus academic plan, study abroad can be integral to the liberal arts education, providing cultural enrichment, personal development and intellectual challenge. Approximately 56% of undergraduate students participate in study abroad by the time they graduate.</p><p>The Global Education Office (GEO) assists students with every stage of the study abroad process, collaborates with faculty and departments to develop study abroad programs in line with the educational mission of W&amp;M, and serves as the home for incoming exchange students. Located on the second floor of the Reves Center, the GEO facilitates the university's study abroad programs including undergraduate academic year/semester exchange and assisted enrollment study abroad programs, as well as W&amp;M faculty-led summer and short-term study abroad programs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honor System</head><p>Among the most significant traditions of William &amp; Mary is the student-administered honor system. The honor system is based upon the premise that a person's honor is his or her most cherished attribute. The Honor Code outlines the conduct that cannot be tolerated within a community of trust. Prohibited conduct is limited to three specific areas of lying, cheating and stealing. The Honor Code is an agreement among all students taking classes at the school or participating in the educational programs of the university (e.g., study abroad or internship activities) not to lie, cheat or steal. This agreement is made effective upon matriculation at the university and through the student's enrollment even though that enrollment may not be continuous. A complete description of rights and responsibilities can be found in the Student Handbook (https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/ .) An education system centered upon classroom instruction is obviously predicated on the concept of regular class attendance. In support of this concept, the following principles are to be observed:</p><p>• Except for reasonable cause, students are expected to be present at all regularly scheduled class meetings, including their last scheduled class in each of their courses preceding and their first scheduled class in each of their courses following the fall break, Thanksgiving, semester break, and spring holidays. • Students whose attendance becomes unsatisfactory to the extent that their course performance is affected adversely should be so informed by their instructor and reported to the Dean of Students. • Each student is responsible for notifying professors of absences. In view of the Honor Code, a student's explanation of class absence should be sufficient in most instances. • Students who will miss classes due to personal difficulties or family emergencies should contact the Dean of Students Office as soon as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Emergency Notification</head><p>Students are expected to be present at all regularly scheduled class meetings and abide by their faculty member's attendance policy as stated in their syllabus. The Dean of Students Office serves as a resource to help students notify faculty members of extenuating circumstances. The Dean of Students Office requires supporting documentation for the extenuating circumstance.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the extenuating circumstance, a Dean of Students Office staff member may follow-up with the student to provide support resources. Emergency notifications to the appropriate faculty member will include general and discrete language to describe the extenuating circumstance and request support for the student.</p><p>The emergency notification does not excuse the student from course material, assignments, or examinations. It is the student's responsibility to follow-up with the faculty member about the emergency notification and opportunities to complete missed work as soon as feasible (e.g. within 3-7 days).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Examinations</head><p>A final examination is an important part of the evaluation of each student's work and is expected in all courses except seminars, colloquia, studio, or writing courses where final examinations may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The final examination schedule can be viewed at www.wm.edu/registrar.</p><p>The time allocated for in-class final examinations is three hours, unless a shorter time is specified in the course syllabus. The deadline for returning take-home final examinations is the scheduled examination date for that class.</p><p>Except in narrowly defined circumstances, changes in the examination schedule are not allowed. Individual faculty members may not grant permission to reschedule or defer a final examination.</p><p>Requests to reschedule a final examination may be made when a student has three scheduled final examinations in four consecutive exam periods on consecutive days, when there is a conflict between a student's scheduled examinations, or when a student wishes to take an examination with a different section of the same course. Such requests to reschedule a final examination within the examination period should be filed with the Dean of Undergraduate Studies via the Office of Academic Advising in Room 169 of Swem Library. Requests must be made by the last day of classes for the semester.</p><p>All other requests for exceptions to the examination schedule should be filed with the Dean of Students Office and may be made on the basis of extenuating circumstances such as:</p><p>• Medical circumstances (physical and psychological) verified by a healthcare professional • International student travel complications without alternatives • Family emergency, such as death of a close family member • Conflict with a religious holiday/service • Interview or training for a permanent job that cannot be rescheduled • Interview for graduate or professional school • Activities in which the student is formally representing the university Supporting documentation must be provided with the request. Students should not assume that a request is approved until they receive written approval from the appropriate dean.</p><p>Final examinations that are deferred will be scheduled for the first full week of classes of the following regular semester. Students with deferred examinations will receive an initial grade of "I," incomplete. In this case, the "I" grade should be changed as early in the following semester as possible.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Scope</head><p>This policy applies to all students in attendance at the College of William &amp; Mary, including the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (the university).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Policy</head><p>The university protects the privacy of student records in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Virginia Health Records Privacy Act, and provides students with access to their own records in accordance with FERPA. For questions about FERPA, please email the University Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Student Records Rights.</head><p>FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records, and defines situations in which the university may release information from student records with student consent. Education records, under FERPA, are documents, files, and other materials that contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by the university or a university agent. Student rights include:</p><p>1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the university receives a request for access. A student should submit to the University Registrar's Office a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.</p><p>Students who are citizens of Virginia also have rights to their records under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Information about the process for requesting records under the Act, and the university's obligations, is provided in the university's Freedom of Information Act Policy.</p><p>2. The right to request the amendment of an element of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA.</p><p>A student who wishes to request an amendment should write the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.</p><p>If the university decides not to amend the record as requested, the student will be notified in writing of the decision and of the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.</p><p>3. The right to provide written consent before the university discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.</p><p>1. To other school officials whom the school has determined to have legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of visitors; or a student serving on an official committee, such as the Honor Council. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the university who performs an institutional service or function for which the university would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the university with respect to the use and maintenance of personally identifiable information from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks.</p><p>A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the university.( §99.31(a)(1)) 2. To officials of another school where the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled if the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment or transfer, subject to the requirements of §99.34. ( §99.31(a)(2)) 3. To authorized representatives of the U. S. Comptroller General, the U. S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or State and local educational authorities, such as a State postsecondary authority that is responsible for supervising the university's State-supported education programs. Disclosures under this provision may be made, subject to the requirements of §99.35, in connection with an audit or evaluation of Federal or State-supported education programs, or for the enforcement of or compliance with Federal legal requirements that relate to those programs. These entities may make further disclosures of PII to outside entities that are designated by them as their authorized representatives to conduct any audit, evaluation, or enforcement or compliance activity on their behalf. ( § §99.31(a) <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> and 99.35) <ref type="bibr" target="#b972">4</ref>. In connection with financial aid for which the student has applied or which the student has received, if the information is necessary to determine eligibility for the aid, determine the amount of the aid, determine the conditions of the aid, or enforce the terms and conditions of the aid. ( §99.31(a)(4)) 5. To organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, the university, in order to: (a) develop, validate, or administer predictive tests; (b) administer student aid programs; or (c) improve instruction. ( §99.31(a)(6)) 6. To accrediting organizations to carry out their accrediting functions. (( §99.31(a) <ref type="formula">(7))</ref> 7. To parents of an eligible student if the student is a dependent for IRS tax purposes. ( §99.31(a) <ref type="bibr" target="#b882">(8)</ref>). Pursuant to Virginia law, the university will disclose such information, if certain conditions are satisfied, as described under Section C(2) below.</p><p>8. To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. ( §99.31(a)(9)) 9. To appropriate officials in connection with a health or safety emergency, subject to §99.36. Under this exception, William &amp; Mary may disclose PII if the university determines that the person to whom the PII is to be disclosed needs the information to protect the student or other individual(s) from an articulable and significant threat to their health or safety ( §99.31(a)(10)) 10. To a victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense, subject to the requirements of §99.39. The disclosure may only include the final results of the disciplinary proceeding with respect to that alleged crime or offense, regardless of the finding. ( §99.31(a)(13)) 11. To the general public, the final results of a disciplinary proceeding, subject to the requirements of §99.39, if the university determines the student is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense and the student has committed a violation of the university's rules or policies with respect to the allegation made against him or her. ( §99.31(a)(14)) 12. To parents of a student regarding the student's violation of any Federal, State, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the university, governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if the university determines the student committed a disciplinary violation and the student is under the age of 21. ( §99.31(a)(15)) 13. Directory Information: In addition, FERPA permits the disclosure of information deemed by the university to be "Directory Information" without written consent. ( §99.31(a)(11)) This information includes: Students may prohibit the release of Directory Information by completing a "Request for Confidentiality" form, located on the University Registrar's website at https://www.wm.edu/offices/registrar/documents/other/request_for_confidentiality.pdf. This request must be submitted in person to the Office of the University Registrar and will remain on file indefinitely until written notice is submitted by the student to remove it.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Student</formula><p>In accordance with Va. Code Section 23. <ref type="bibr">1-405 (C)</ref>, the university shall not disclose the address, telephone number, or email address of a student unless the student has consented in writing to such disclosure. Disclosure of a student's address, telephone number, and/or email address to other students through the online student directory shall be made only to individuals with university log-in credentials and with affirmative consent of the student.</p><p>14. In addition, recent federal guidelines permit release of student information for the purpose of data collection and analysis.</p><p>i. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (Federal and State Authorities) may allow access to your records and private information without your consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal-or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is principally engaged in the provision of education, such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution.</p><p>ii. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to your education records and private information without your consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, such as Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, in certain cases even when the university objects to or does not request such research.</p><p>15. The Solomon Amendment (10 U.S.C. § 983) is a federal law that requires institutions to provide directory-type information on students, at least 17 years of age who are registered for at least one credit, upon request from representatives of the Department of Defense for military recruiting purposes. This information, referred to as "student recruiting information," includes: student name, addresses, telephone listings, age or year of birth, place of birth, level of education or degrees received, academic major, and the most recent previous educational institution in which the student was enrolled. A request for student recruiting information under Solomon must be honored unless the student has completed the Request for Confidentiality Form (pdf) and submitted the completed form to the Office of the University Registrar.</p><p>that are protected by the Virginia Health Records Privacy Act.</p><p>The Act generally prohibits the disclosure of a student's health information without the student's consent, unless an exception applies. The Health Records Privacy Act does not have a provision that permits sharing of health records within the institution similar to the "school officials" FERPA exception, but it does allow disclosure of records (other than psychotherapy notes) by the Student Health Center and Counseling Center to the university's Threat Assessment Team. The Act also contains numerous other exceptions, including disclosures in response to a subpoena satisfying specific statutory requirements.</p><p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) does not apply to education records, even if these records contain medical information; HIPAA exempts education records from its privacy regulations, because these records are protected by FERPA.</p><p>2. Other Policies. For additional information regarding students' rights related to the release of personally identifiable information, see the University Registrar's website at http://www.wm.edu/registrar or the section entitled 'Statement of Rights and Responsibilities' in the Student Handbook. Additional university policies include the following:</p><p>• Release of Academic, Student Conduct, and Financial Information to Parents: Students who wish their parents, guardians, and/or spouse to have access to academic, financial or student conduct information protected by FERPA may provide consent by completing the Personal Information tab in Banner self-service. Students have the right to revoke this consent at any time. Parents of dependent students have the right to information about their children; however, they must provide tax documents if there is no release already on file with the university.</p><p>• Student Assessment: William &amp; Mary conducts periodic reviews of its curricular and co-curricular programs as part of the university's state-mandated responsibility to monitor student outcomes and assure the continuing quality of a William &amp; Mary degree. Surveys, course portfolios (including examples of student work), and other procedures are used to gather information about student achievement and experiences. Information collected as part of the assessment program will not be used to evaluate individual performance, and assessment results will not be released in a form that is personally identifiable. Students who do not want their work to be used in institutional or program assessments must submit a letter indicating that reference to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.</p><p>1. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (Federal and State Authorities) may allow access to your records and private information without your consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal-or state-supported education program.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification of Students</head><p>Academic Classification: A student's academic classification is based on total credits earned toward a William &amp; Mary degree. These credits include both institutional and transfer hours.</p><p>Freshman 0 -23 credits earned Sophomore 24 -53 credits earned Junior 54 -84 credits earned Senior 85 or more credits earned</p><p>William &amp; Mary recognizes that many students arrive having completed college credits through a variety of programs including the Advanced Placement Program of the College Board, the International Baccalaureate Program, or concurrent enrollment programs offered through their high school. These credits are reflected in the student's academic classification.</p><p>Social Classification: Definition of a degree-seeking undergraduate according to the year in which the student could be expected to graduate assuming a 4-year program following high school graduation (e.g., a new freshman in 2019 is designated as "Class of 2023"). For transfer or older students, the social class is defined by calculating or extrapolating eight semesters of full-time-equivalent postsecondary enrollment. Social Class is used for a variety of purposes, including priority registration, housing, athletic tickets, parking, meal plans, and other activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Statuses</head><p>Full Time Status: Students at William &amp; Mary are expected to remain enrolled full-time throughout their academic career. A full-time degree-seeking student must register for at least 12 and not more than 18 credits each semester. (Audits do NOT count toward the 12 credit hour minimum required for undergraduate students.) The normal load for a student planning to graduate with a degree in four years is 15 credit hours per semester, or 30 credits each academic year. An academic year is comprised of the Fall semester and the Spring semester but does not include the Summer Session. Work successfully completed during a Summer Session is counted toward the 120 academic credits required for graduation, as is the case with transfer or advanced placement credit. Students on academic probation are limited to a maximum of 16 credits per semester.</p><p>Petitions for underloads or overloads, when warranted by special circumstances, may be granted by the Committee on Academic Status; these petitions should be made to the Dean of Students Office. For details regarding Overloads or Underloads, and the deadlines for petitioning, contact the Dean of Students Office. Students submitting petitions for academic exceptions should continue to attend all classes until notified that the exception has been granted.</p><p>Medical Underload: Students unable to undertake a full academic schedule for medical and/or mental health reasons may petition for a medical underload. Petitions for medical underloads must be submitted to the Medical Review Committee (a sub-committee of the Committee on Academic Status) through the Dean of Students Office. The granting of a medical underload may be contingent upon additional restrictions or requirements. If granted, medical underloads normally do not result in any refund of tuition or fees. Inquiries regarding refunds should be directed to the Office of the Bursar. Students carrying a medical underload will be expected to meet the continuance regulations in this catalog.</p><p>Underload: Students must request approval from the Committee on Academic Status through the Dean of Students Office to carry fewer than 12 earned hours during a regular semester. Audited classes do not count toward the 12 earned hours, but do count toward the 18 credit hour maximum allowed for undergraduate students. Students carrying an unauthorized underload are subject to withdrawal after the add/drop period, can be placed on probation by the Committee on Academic Status, and/or can be referred to the Community Values &amp; Restorative Practices Office for failure to comply with university rules and regulations. Students must pay full tuition and fees if they are carrying an unauthorized underload. An unauthorized underload counts as a full semester toward the 10-semester rule. Students carrying an underload approved before the end of add/drop may receive a reduction in tuition, but pay full student fees. Students who are considering a petition for underload should consult with scholarship/financial aid and insurance providers to make certain they understand all the financial implications of a reduction in load. Students carrying an underload will be expected to meet the continuance regulations in this catalog. Petitions to underload should be submitted through the Dean of Students Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration and Withdrawal</head><p>Continuing students should register for their courses in April for the Fall semester and in November for the Spring semester. Complete registration instructions are available on the University Registrar's web site at http://www.wm.edu/registrar in October for the Spring semester and in March for summer school and Fall semester. The Office of the University Registrar also coordinates registration for incoming freshmen and transfer students. Withdrawal from the University: A student who desires to withdraw completely from the university after the semester begins must apply to the Dean of Students Office for permission to withdraw before the end of the ninth week of the semester. After the ninth week, withdrawal is allowed only for extenuating circumstances. Students who wish to withdraw after the deadline should consult with the Dean of Students Office. Students may provide either oral or written notification of the intent to withdraw, but must also complete the application for withdrawal process to formally withdraw. Failure to be officially withdrawn can result in grades of 'F' for all courses carried in that semester. Students who withdraw from the university in the first five full weeks of the semester are generally eligible for a partial refund of tuition and fees. Students on financial aid should always consult with the Office of Financial Aid, and students using VA benefits should always consult with the Office of the University Registrar, before withdrawing. Questions about refunds should be directed to the Office of the Bursar. For information regarding refund deadlines see Tuition and Other Expenses, Withdrawal Schedule.</p><p>Students who wish to withdraw from the university for the upcoming semester must complete the withdrawal form and an exit interview with the Dean of Students Office prior to the beginning of that semester. Such action results in cancellation of registration and housing for the following semester. It also assures that no charges will be assessed for the following term.</p><p>Medical Withdrawal from the University: Students unable to complete the requirements for registered classes in a semester due to medical or mental health reasons may petition for a full medical withdrawal from the university before the last day of classes through the Dean of Students Office. The Medical Review Committee (a sub-committee of the Committee on Academic Status) reviews this request and supporting documentation. If approved, the full medical withdrawal does not count towards the university's 10 semester rule. Such action results in cancellation of registration and housing for the following semester.</p><p>Re-enrollment following a full medical withdrawal is not automatic and involves a clearance procedure which includes submission by the student of all necessary documentation addressing the behaviors or conditions which caused the original withdrawal. The student is expected to begin the clearance process not later than July 15 for Fall Semester, November 15 for Spring Semester, and April 15 for Summer Session. Reenrollment may be contingent upon additional restrictions or requirements for the student's safety and success. Repeated Courses: Certain courses are specifically designated in the university catalog as courses that may be repeated for credit. With the exception of these specially designated courses, no course in which a student receives a grade of "A", "B", "C", "D", "G", "I" or "P" may be repeated except as an audit. Any course in which a student receives a grade of "F", "R" or "W" may be repeated for a grade; if a course with a grade of "F" is repeated, both the original grade of "F" and the grade earned in the repeated course will be included in calculating the student's Grade Point Average. Students are responsible for ensuring they do not register for a non-repeatable course more than once.</p><p>Incomplete Grades: An incomplete grade indicates that an individual student has not completed essential course work because of illness or other extenuating circumstances. This includes absence from the final examination and postponement of required work with approval of the instructor. It is the student's responsibility to make arrangements with the instructor to complete the work by a specified date (first full week of the upcoming semester for deferred examinations). "I" automatically becomes "F" if the work is not completed by the last day of classes of the following regular semester, or if the postponed work has not been completed satisfactorily by the date specified by the professor. Incomplete grades granted because of a deferred exam should be changed early in the following semester. The instructor may grant a one-semester extension under exceptional circumstances; after this extension, the "I" reverts to an "F" if sufficient work is not completed to warrant assignment of another letter grade by the instructor. A degree will not be conferred if an incomplete ("I") grade is on the student's record.</p><p>Pass/Fail: Degree-seeking academic juniors and seniors may elect to take one normally-graded course in Arts &amp;Sciences or Education for undergraduate credit on a Pass/Fail basis during each of the Fall and Spring semesters (Pass/Fail option is not available during the summer or winter sessions). This option must be selected during the add/drop period. Selecting Pass/Fail is irrevocable after the add/drop period has ended. In unusual circumstances, students may submit petitions to request a change in the grading option after the add/drop period to the Committee on Degrees.</p><p>Courses taken on a Pass/Fail basis may not be used to satisfy general education (COLL), proficiency, minor or major requirements (including electives that are counted toward major and minor requirements), except where courses have been designated Pass/Fail by the university. However, courses taken Pass/Fail in a student's major and failed will be calculated as part of the student's major GPA and all courses taken Pass/Fail and failed will be calculated as part of the student's cumulative GPA. Courses used to fulfill the Foreign Language Proficiency, including the language prerequisite courses taken since matriculation at the university, may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. A student may elect to designate one normally graded course as Pass/ Fail in addition to any classes that are designated as Pass/Fail only. Non-degreeseeking students may not select the Pass/Fail option. Pass/Fail credits do not count towards the minimum 12 credit hours Dean's List requirements. For instructions on how to select Pass/Fail for a course via Banner Self Service, visit the University Registrar's web site at http://www.wm.edu/registrar.</p><p>Audit: Degree seeking students may audit a course after obtaining permission of the instructor on the Permission to Audit form, which is available at http://www.wm.edu/registrar. Students may not select a course for audit via web registration. Audited courses receive grades. If the student meets the requirements for auditors prescribed by the instructor, the course will be included on the transcript with the grade "O" (satisfactory audit). Where those requirements have not been met, the course will be included on the transcript with the grade "U" (unsatisfactory audit). No credit nor quality points are earned. Audits do not count toward the 12 earned credit hour minimum required for undergraduate students.</p><p>Class Rank: The College does not calculate nor report class rank for undergraduate students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Review Procedures</head><p>A student who believes that a final course grade has been unfairly assigned may request a review of the grade by the end of the sixth week of the fall or spring semester that follows the semester or summer session for which the grade was recorded. The student must first discuss the grade with the instructor. If the instructor agrees that a grade change is warranted, he or she will propose the new grade within one year of the issuance of the original grade to the appropriate dean for consideration and, if it is approved, the new grade will be entered on the student's record. No grades will be changed more than one year after initial issuance or after a student's degree is conferred, whichever comes first. If, after the discussion between instructor and student, the issue has not been resolved, the student must file a formal written statement requesting a grade review and give a full explanation of the reasons for the request. The student must send the statement to the instructor and to the chair of the department or director of the program in which the course was taught. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the chair's or director's review, the next step to be taken differs by School. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dean's List</head><p>The Dean's List refers to those full-time degree-seeking undergraduate students who have completed at least 12 (standard letter graded, not including "P" or "G") credit hours and earned a 3.6 Grade Point Average in one semester. Courses taken on a pass/fail or audit basis do not count in the minimum 12 credit hours. This recognition is noted on the student's academic transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuance Standards</head><p>In order to graduate, students must have completed 120 credits in academic subjects with a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 both overall and in their major. After each semester of full-time enrollment, the student must meet the minimum levels of academic progress established by the university and applied by the Committee on Academic Status. The minimum requirements for continuance for undergraduates are the following cumulative grade points and credits earned at William &amp; Mary, including grade point and credits earned at William &amp; Mary summer school: 9 2.0 108 10 2.0 120</p><p>The following regulations apply to the University's Continuance policy:</p><p>• Only William &amp; Mary credit will count in determining whether students are meeting Continuance Standards. Transfer, Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) credit will not count for this purpose, although as specified by regulations in the Catalog these credits may count toward 120 credits required for graduation and toward general education and major requirements.</p><p>• Transfer students as well as freshmen begin at the university under the Continuance Standards for semester 1 in the above table.</p><p>• Students whose GPA falls below 2.0 in any semester will be placed on Academic Warning.</p><p>• Students whose academic work falls below the minimum GPA and/or earned credit Continuance Standards will be placed on probation for the following semester.</p><p>• Students on probation may not enroll in more than 16 credit hours per semester. Students who are on probation may not receive any incompletes for coursework during the semester(s) of probation.</p><p>• While on probation, students must earn a 2.0 semester GPA or better and pass at least 12 credits. Failure to do so will result in academic suspension.</p><p>• Students on probation must participate in the Academic Intervention Program administered by the Academic Enrichment Programs during their probationary semester. Students on probation also must meet with their Academic Advisor before registering for the subsequent semester. Registration for the following semester will not be permitted until these requirements are met.</p><p>• Students on probation have two regular semesters to bring their academic work up to or beyond the Continuance Standards so long as they earn a 2.0 and pass at least 12 credits each semester. If they are unsuccessful in meeting or surpassing the Continuance Standards during their first probation semester, they remain on probation during the second semester and must participate in the Aspire Program.</p><p>• Students who are placed on probation or are continuing on probation at the end of a semester but earned at least a 2.0 GPA and 12 credits during that semester will be removed from probation if they meet their Continuance Standards by the end of summer school. This applies only for work at W&amp;M summer school. Determination of eligibility for removal from probation will be done at the end of that summer school.</p><p>• Students who do not meet the conditions for probation will be suspended from the university for academic deficiencies. Those suspended for academic deficiencies are not in good standing with the university and are not automatically eligible for reenrollment. The Dean of Students Office will not process an application for reenrollment from a student who has been suspended unless the student has been reinstated to good standing by the Committee on Academic Status.</p><p>• Students may petition the Committee on Academic Status for individual exceptions to the above Continuance Standards.</p><p>• Coursework taken elsewhere while not in good standing will not be transferred.</p><p>• An unclassified student enrolled for 12 or more academic hours must meet the Continuance Standards applicable to the regularly enrolled student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuance Standards for Flexible Track (FlexTrack) Degree-Seeking Students: The minimum requirements for Continuance for flexible track students are as follows:</head><p>• A minimum of 12 credits must be passed in a 12 month period.</p><p>• Students must complete within 10 years all degree requirements in effect at the time of entrance and all major requirements in effect at the time of the declaration of major.</p><p>• The Ten Semester Rule applies to all FlexTrack students.</p><p>• A 1.7 cumulative GPA must be achieved by the end of the term in which nine credits have been completed.</p><p>• A 1.7 cumulative GPA must be achieved by the end of the term in which 21 credits have been completed.</p><p>• A 1.85 cumulative GPA must be achieved by the end of the term in which 33 credits have been completed.</p><p>• A 2.0 cumulative GPA must be achieved by the end of the term in which 48 credits have been completed.</p><p>• A 2.0 cumulative GPA must be achieved by the end of each term of enrollment after 48 credits have been completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinstatement to Good Standing</head><p>Students who have been academically suspended and are not in good academic standing with the university, but who wish to seek reenrollment to William &amp; Mary, must submit a petition for reinstatement to good standing to the Committee on Academic Status. Petitions should be made in advance of the semester of intended return (July 15 for Fall, November 15 for Spring, or April 15 for Summer). For information on specific procedures, contact the Dean of Students Office. Reinstatement to good standing and reenrollment to the university are not automatic, but at the end of certain specified periods the student is eligible to seek these considerations from the Committee on Academic Status and the Dean of Students Office, respectively. A student who is suspended in January for academic deficiency may apply no earlier than April of the same year for reinstatement and reenrollment for Fall. A student who is suspended in May is eligible to apply no earlier than October for reinstatement and reenrollment to be effective in the Spring semester. It is extremely unlikely that a student who is suspended twice from the university for academic deficiencies by the Committee on Academic Status will ever be reinstated to good standing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religious Accommodations Guidelines</head><p>William &amp; Mary urges its administrators, faculty members, and staff to be sensitive to the religious holidays of organized religions. All persons should be able to participate in the essential practices of their faith without conflict with academic requirements, as long as such practices are in accordance with state and federal regulations and consistent with safety regulations of the university. The university offers the following guidelines:</p><p>1. As soon as possible and no later than the end of the drop/add period, each student has the responsibility to inform his or her instructor of religious observances that are likely to conflict directly with classes and other required academic activities. Each student has the responsibility to arrange his or her course schedule to minimize conflicts. It is understood that when scheduling options exist for religious observances, the student has the responsibility to minimize conflicts.</p><p>2. Based upon prior agreement between the instructor and student, a student who misses a class meeting because of a scheduling conflict with religious observances should be allowed, whenever possible, to complete without penalty the work missed because of such absences. A student who is absent from a test or presentation because of the observance of a religious holiday should be able to reschedule it without penalty. Absence from a final examination requires that the examination be rescheduled through the established process for rescheduling of final examinations by the Dean of Students. Graduate students should contact the Dean of the School or his or her designee.</p><p>3. If a scheduling conflict with a student's planned absence cannot be resolved between the instructor and the student, undergraduates should inform the department chair or program director, who will follow the established procedure for a class absence. Graduate students should contact the Dean of the School or his or her designee.</p><p>4. Faculty members and administrators in charge of scheduling campus-wide events should avoid conflicts with religious holidays as much as possible.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>School of Marine Science</head><p>Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).</p><p>The undergraduate degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science are liberal arts degrees. The term "liberal arts" refers to the sort of education that sets the mind free. A liberal education, although it has no single fixed definition, is more than a haphazard accumulation of courses. Its essential purpose is to liberate and broaden the mind, to produce people with vision and perspective as well as specific practical skills and knowledge. Undertaking a liberal arts education entails a commitment to experimentation. It means building on your talents and interests, but also venturing into unfamiliar subjects out of intellectual curiosity. The liberal arts ask us to think, talk, and write about diverse topics; to see questions from various angles; to challenge our assumptions, and to become acquainted with different ways of seeing the world.</p><p>A liberal education also presupposes certain proficiencies. Foremost among these is clear expression in both speech and writing, for clear thinking is useless without the ability to express those thoughts coherently and persuasively. Two more invaluable foundations of a liberal education are experience with a foreign language, and an understanding of quantitative reasoning. The proficiency requirements of the university establish basic minimums for writing, oral communication, foreign language, and quantitative reasoning. Students are encouraged to go beyond these minimums to whatever extent their ambitions and interests suggest.</p><p>Finally, every student chooses a major to pursue in depth the exploration of a specific academic discipline or interdisciplinary area. Here, students have opportunities for independent study and, if they qualify, work on an honors project.</p><p>The Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences of the university determines the degree requirements for the B.A. and B.S. degrees, including the determination of the regulations governing academic standards, grading and class attendance. Obligation to its educational mission gives to the university the right and responsibility, subject to the employment of fair procedures, to suspend, dismiss or deny continuance of a student whose academic achievement does not meet established university standards.</p><p>Requirements for degrees are stated in terms of credit hours that are based upon the satisfactory completion of courses of instruction. Usually one credit hour is given for each class hour a week through a semester. A minimum of two hours of laboratory work a week throughout a semester will be required for a credit hour. A continuous course covers a field of closely related material and may not be entered at the beginning of the second semester without approval of the instructor. graded by the International Baccalaureate Organization on a 7 point scale. Credits are granted only based on examination results; no credit or waivers are granted for the diploma itself, although the diploma programme is recognized as a strong college preparatory curriculum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A-Levels (A/AS):</head><p>Entering students who took A-Level examinations as part of their high school experience may present their scores for credit consideration. These examinations are administered and graded by three agencies: University of Cambridge, AQA and Edexcel on a graded scale of A through C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Level Examination Program (CLEP):</head><p>Examinations are graded on a scale from 20 to 80. Based on faculty review of examination content, the university offers equivalent course credit for those CLEP exams identified below, when a score equivalent to a "B" is earned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DSST (formerly DANTES):</head><p>Examinations are graded on varying scales. Based on faculty review of examination content, the university offers equivalent course credit for limited DSST exams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excelsior (UExcel) examinations:</head><p>Entering students must provide Excelsior transcripts during the admission process and no later than the end of the first semester in residence at the university. Examinations are scored on a grading scale of A through F. The university does not grant credit for upper-level Excelsior examinations.</p><p>General Rules: AP, IB, and A-Level examinations must have been taken prior to high school graduation or within six months thereafter, but in all cases before entering William &amp; Mary. CLEP, DSST, and Excelsior examinations must have been completed and scored prior to matriculation at William &amp; Mary. Entering students must provide CLEP and DSST score reports during the matriculation process and no later than the end of the first semester in residence at the university. Credit is not granted for examinations taken after matriculation at the university nor during leaves of absence.</p><p>The policies in each department governing credit and/or advanced placement for scores on these examinations vary according to how the material covered by examinations fits the curriculum of the department. Members of the William &amp; Mary faculty regularly review curricular documents to update the examination equivalencies.</p><p>Credit received through these pre-matriculation examinations may be applied toward proficiency, minor, and major requirements, and additional credits in the Knowledge Domains; however, they do not satisfy COLL 100, 150, 200, 300, or 400 requirements, as those courses must be taken at the university. Further, exemptions from courses may not be applied toward General Education Requirements.</p><p>William &amp; Mary grants credit or course exemptions as noted on the Pre-Matriculation Grid for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and A-Level Examinations, CLEP, DSST, and Excelsior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit by Examination</head><p>Students at William &amp; Mary may request academic credit for courses by examination based on prior learning. Interested students should petition the Committee on Degrees for permission to take an examination for credit. If the petition is granted, the department at the university in which the course is normally offered sets an appropriate examination and certifies the results to the registrar. The department may, at its discretion, conduct a review of course portfolio documents as part of the examination process. Students may not receive credit by examination after registration for their final semester under any of the following circumstances: a. they are enrolled in the course at the time of the request, b. they have previously revoked credit for the same course, c. upper level course work in the same subject has already begun, d. the same course has previously been failed, or e. for any foreign language course at or below the 202 level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit for Military Training</head><p>Students with prior service in the Armed Forces of the United States may present the Joint Services Transcript or other documentation to the Office of the University Registrar. Equivalencies to William &amp; Mary courses rarely exist, but where they do, credit may be granted with departmental approval. The ACE Guide will be consulted, but its recommendations do not automatically apply.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Revoking Credits earned before Matriculation</head><p>The Committee on Degrees will allow students to revoke college credits earned in high school (including AP, IB, and dual enrollment), in the military, or at a previous college, if the department believes that the preparation received was inadequate to succeed in subsequent coursework. No petitions will be considered without departmental approval. Students who have revoked credit for a course may not subsequently receive credit by examination for the course. The decision to revoke credit is final. The revocation of credits renders a student ineligible to receive GI Bill® benefits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>General Rules for Transfer Credit 1. A grade of "C" (2.0) or higher is required ("C-" is not acceptable). In the case of a course taken on a Pass/Fail basis, a grade of "P" is acceptable only when the student provides a letter from the faculty member who taught the course certifying that the student's work was at the level of C or above. 2. The course generally must have been taken at a regionally accredited institution. Consult the Registrar's Office regarding exceptions. 3. Transfer credits from institutions on the quarter system or other systems will be translated into semester credits. 4. "Equivalent" course credit is granted when the course is similar to a course presently offered for academic credit at the university. "Equivalent" transfer credits may satisfy proficiency, minor, and major requirements only when they are earned pre-matriculation, or with the express preapproval of the Committee on Degrees. One exception is that modern language courses at the 101, 102 and 201 levels may count toward satisfying the language proficiency requirement even though taken at another domestic institution. This exception applies solely to these three language course levels. 5. "Elective" course credit is granted when the course is not similar to an existing William &amp; Mary course, but is recommended for credit by an existing academic program or department at the university. Courses granted elective transfer credit will count toward the total number of academic credits required for the baccalaureate degree, but they may not be used to meet proficiency, minor, or major requirements unless approval has been granted by the Committee on Degrees. 6. Transfer credit will not be granted for courses that belong in one or more of the following categories: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit for Newly Admitted Students</head><p>The Office of the University Registrar is responsible for evaluating transfer credit for newly admitted transfer students. Evaluation of transfer credit begins after a student has been selected for admission and has indicated an intention to enroll. Students should not assume that credit will be granted for all courses completed at their transfer institution. These students are considered to have completed lower-division general education requirements but still are expected to fulfill the university's foreign language proficiency requirement; COLL 150, COLL 200 (3 credits), and the ARTS Proficiency; upper-division COLL requirements (e.g., 300 and 400), and all major requirements (See "General Education Requirements" section below). The Guide for Transfer Students from Virginia Community Colleges provides additional information and is located on the University Registrar's Office's website. Performance information concerning these transfer students will be shared confidentially with the two-year colleges from which they transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit from Virginia Community Colleges and Richard Bland College of William and Mary</head><p>New Freshmen who enter with an associate's degree earned primarily through dual enrollment credit will not be granted automatic junior status or general education requirement exemption, but they will receive credit for courses as noted in the "General Rules" section above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer of Credit from Foreign Institutions</head><p>William &amp; Mary recognizes that international students may arrive on campus having completed studies equivalent to college courses. To be eligible for possible transfer credit, all students who have completed a 13-year secondary program or who have attended a university outside of the United States must submit translated syllabi for each thirteenth year or university course with their application for admission. Once these students have been admitted to the university and have declared their intention to enroll, they must submit an official copy, from the testing agency, of the student's final results/scores to: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">William</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studying Away from the University after Matriculation</head><p>Once a student matriculates at William &amp; Mary, transfer credit for work taken elsewhere (post-William &amp; Mary matriculation) is only granted with pre-approval and under very special circumstances. Students must be in good standing at William &amp; Mary, both academically and judicially, in order to request or receive approval of transfer credit. Courses taken elsewhere post-matriculation at William &amp; Mary may not be used to satisfy major, minor, proficiency, COLL requirements without specific pre-authorization from the Committee on Degrees. As a result, they appear on the transcript as elective credit. One exception is that modern language courses at the 101, 102 and 201 levels may count toward satisfying the language proficiency requirement even though taken at another domestic institution. This exception applies solely to these three language course levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>William &amp; Mary students who wish to participate in a Study Abroad program must register with the Global Education Office in the Reves Center for International Studies. Special circumstances apply: 1. Pre-approval of transfer credits by the academic departments is required for all study abroad programs except the William &amp; Mary "faculty-led" or "faculty-assisted" programs. The transfer credit pre-approval process should be completed before the student's participation in the program abroad; find the form on the Reves Center's website.</p><p>2. While abroad, students must enroll in at least 12 credits per semester (full-time status is required). A maximum of 18 credit hours per semester may be earned. 7. For non-William &amp; Mary study abroad programs during university breaks, students returning to W&amp;M for the semester may only register and transfer credit for programs which end at least two days prior to the start of the semester to ensure that students are able to return to campus by the first day of classes. Studying abroad on non-William &amp; Mary programs is not a universityexcused reason to miss class.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domestic Study Away</head><p>William &amp; Mary students who wish to enroll full-time in a specific academic experience (e.g., "New York City Term") offered by another U.S. institution may request certification as "Domestic Study Away." In this status, the student remains an active William &amp; Mary student and may be able to use financial aid for tuition if a "consortium agreement" can be created (consult the Financial Aid Office for information). The approval process must be completed by the last day of classes for the term before the Domestic Study Away. See the Registrar's Office website for the form and instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Take Courses Elsewhere-Summer</head><p>During the summer, students may take courses at another institution while between academic terms at William &amp; Mary. Before enrolling at the other institution, the student must complete the "Permission to Take Courses Elsewhere" form on the University Registrar's Office website. It must be approved and submitted prior to the last day of spring classes. A maximum of 16 credits may be transferred for work taken during one summer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Take Courses Elsewhere-Fall/Spring</head><p>During the regular academic term (Fall, Spring), students are expected to enroll full-time (unless otherwise approved) at William &amp; Mary with a minimum of 12 credits. If personal circumstances or opportunities require the student to leave Williamsburg, but the student wishes to take courses while away, the student must first withdraw from the university through the Dean of Students Office, and then complete the "Permission to Take Courses Elsewhere" form.</p><p>In addition to completing the form, students seeking major, minor, proficiency, or COLL credit must petition the Committee on Degrees, and students seeking internship credit must petition the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Students who wish to take transfer credits while on a medical leave are cautioned to take no more than 6-8 credits, due to the expectation that the student will be addressing medical needs while on leave.</p><p>Pre-approval must be received before the student enrolls at the other institution. Links to the pre-approval form can be found on the University Registrar's Office's website. The student must be readmitted to the college by the Dean of Students Office before transfer credit is posted to the record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Baccalaureate Degree</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. General Requirements</head><p>One hundred and twenty credit hours are required for graduation. Students must earn a minimum grade point average of 2.0 for all courses at William &amp; Mary for which they receive grades of A, B, C, D or F. Students also must earn a minimum grade point average of 2.0 for all courses in their major(s).</p><p>Students must fulfill the general degree requirements in effect at the time of their matriculation at the university and the major requirements set forth in the catalog when the major is declared. Students who fail to graduate within six calendar years of the date of entrance to the university relinquish the right to graduate under the requirements set forth in the catalog at the time of entrance and major declaration, and must fulfill the requirements set forth in the catalog under which they re-enter the university as a degree candidate for the final time prior to graduation. If a student has not been enrolled at the university for five calendar years or more since the end of the last semester of registration at William &amp; Mary, the student's record is subject to re-evaluation under regulations available in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.</p><p>Once a student's degree has been conferred, the academic record is closed and it cannot be changed or amended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Hour Residency Requirement</head><p>No degree will be granted by the university until the applicant has completed a minimum of 60 credit hours in residence at William &amp; Mary. This period must include the last two full-time semesters in which credits counted toward the degree are earned. A minimum of 15 credit hours in the major and 9 credit hours in the minor must be taken in residence at William &amp; Mary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ten Semester Rule</head><p>A student must complete degree requirements within 10 semesters. A fall or spring semester during which a student attempts 12 or more academic credits counts as one semester under the 10 semester rule. The number of credits attempted through summer session (at W&amp;M or elsewhere), transfer credits earned since graduation from high school, and approved underloads are added together and divided by 15, the normal course load during a regular semester. For example, six hours attempted during Summer Session count as 6/15 of a semester. Credits earned through grades of "W", "I", and "G" are included in this calculation. AP, IB, and dual enrollment credits, as well as courses for which a student received an approved medical withdrawal, do not apply toward the 10 semester rule. As long as 10 full semesters have not been completed, a student may take a regular academic load (as well as an approved overload) in fall or spring or up to 16 credits in summer session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seventy-Two Hour Rule</head><p>Of the 120 credit hours required for graduation for a B.A. or B.S. degree with an Arts &amp; Sciences major, a minimum of 72 credit hours must be earned in subject fields outside the student's primary major. In other words, no more than 48 credit hours in a single subject field may be applied toward the 120 credit hours required for graduation. Although students may earn more than 48 credit hours in a single subject, a minimum of 72 credit hours must be earned in other subject fields. For example, if an English major has 55 credit hours in English, then she or he will have to earn a total of 127 credits to graduate.</p><p>[Exceptions to the 72 hour rule occur in the East Asian Studies concentration within the Asian and Middle East Studies major (consult the "Global Studies" section); for students declaring a major in Art, not Art History (consult the "Art and Art History" section); for students pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration, for whom at least 60 credit hours must come from Arts &amp; Sciences academic subjects (consult the "School of Business Administration" section); and for students pursuing a secondary curriculum in Education, for whom no more than 35 credits in Elementary Education or 30 credits in Secondary Education may be applied toward the 120 credits required for a degree (one exception to this rule can be found under the School of Education Study Abroad Program).</p></div>

For students minoring in Dance, a maximum of 16 credits of these courses may count toward the 120 credits. This limit does not include other Dance Program courses, such as dance history, freshman seminars, composition, practicum, independent projects, or Alexander Technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applied Music</head><p>While students may take as many credits as they wish of applied music lessons and ensemble, a maximum of 14 credits may be applied toward the 120 credits required for a degree for those not majoring in Music.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Military Science</head><p>Students may not apply more than twelve Military Science credits toward the 120 credits needed for graduation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requests for Exemption</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Course Specific Requirements</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Foreign Language Proficiency</head><p>All William &amp; Mary students are required to demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language commensurate with the 202/203 level at William &amp; Mary before they graduate. A foreign language is understood to mean a natural language other than English. Completion of the foreign language requirement is accomplished in any of the following ways:</p><p>1. completion of Level IV in high school of an ancient or modern foreign language;</p><p>2. a score of at least 600 in a modern foreign language or 650 in Latin on the College Board SAT II subject test taken prior to matriculation at the university;</p><p>3. completion of a college language course taught in the original language at or above the <ref type="bibr" target="#b453">202</ref> Unless students have completed the fourth year level in high school of a single ancient or modern foreign language, or demonstrate proficiency by achieving scores of 600 on the College Board SAT II Subject Test in French, German, Russian or Spanish, or scores of 650 on the Test in Latin, they must satisfactorily complete a fourth semester course (or above) and all necessary prerequisites in a language in college. The fourth semester course, as well as prerequisite courses taken since matriculation at the university, may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. The student may fulfill the foreign language proficiency through study abroad if 1) prior approval for the course has been obtained from the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures, and 2) the course is taken in a country where the language is the official language. The following additional placement rules apply to modern languages:</p><p>Students should fulfill their Foreign Language Proficiency requirement in their first or second year at the university.</p><p>I. If you never studied any foreign language, you should enroll in 101 or 103 of the language of your choice. ii. Major Writing Requirement: In addition, all students must satisfy the Major Writing Requirement described by each department, program, or school. Students must satisfy the lower division writing proficiency requirement before attempting the Major Writing Requirement. If the department, program, or school specifies a graded course or courses to satisfy the requirement, the student's grade(s) in that course or those courses must be C-or better. The purpose of the Major Writing Requirement is to ensure that students continue to develop their ability to write in clear, effective prose, which contains sustained and well-developed thought. The Major Writing Requirement must provide students with a series of opportunities to practice their writing, especially as commented upon by an instructor. Each student is expected to complete the writing requirement before the beginning of the graduating semester, normally during the junior and senior years; where the requirement may be met through a Major Honors paper, a senior paper, or the like, it may be completed as late as the end of the graduating semester. When a student has a double major, the requirement applies in each major.</p><p>The purpose of the Digital Information Literacy (DIL) proficiency is to ensure that all students, upon matriculation at the university, have a basic understanding of digital information, how it is processed, and how to use it judiciously. Students will demonstrate understanding through the College Studies online summer module and COLL 100 courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Mathematics Proficiency</head><p>This one-course requirement will be satisfied by: </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">• pre-</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Creative and Performing Arts Proficiency</head><p>This requirement will be satisfied by two credits with an Arts Proficiency attribute in the same creative or performing art. The purpose of this proficiency is to understand the artistic process. Accordingly, by actively involving students in exercises that require artistic choices, these courses aim for an experiencebased understanding of how the artist communicates. A course that satisfies this proficiency requires a student to begin to understand an art at the foundation level through artistic activities involving each of the following: developing their artistic skills; and applying the principles of the art through projects and/or exercises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. The General Education Curriculum</head><p>In keeping with its educational objectives, the university requires its undergraduates to experience a broad array of General Education courses from the first through the fourth year, and to plan a major field of study suited to their needs and interests, which are expected to shift and grow over time. The general degree requirements specified below allow students to share a common intellectual experience, to explore new interests, and to recognize and pursue intellectual talents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The College Curriculum (COLL)</head><p>General Education at William &amp; Mary is known as "COLL", for College Curriculum.</p><p>These general education requirements can be completed via a wide array of courses, because COLL classes are spread across the departments and programs in Arts &amp; Sciences. COLL 100 and COLL 150 must be completed in the first year. Work toward COLL 200 requirements may begin in the first year, and one course must be taken in the second year. COLL 300 typically takes place in the third year. COLL 400 is a capstone experience that typically occurs in the fourth year. Unless specifically offered as Pass/Fail courses, courses used to satisfy COLL requirements may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overlap in requirements.</head><p>A single course may fulfill only one COLL requirement (COLL 100, COLL 150, COLL 200, COLL 300, COLL 400, or one of the extra courses in the domains); a course may fulfill one COLL requirement and a proficiency. A maximum of three courses may be counted toward the COLL requirements and toward the major(s).</p><p>COLL 100 courses are devoted to "big ideas:" significant questions and concepts, beliefs and creative visions, theories and discoveries that have shaped our understanding of the world. COLL 100 courses challenge students to think rigorously, and to develop and practice communication skills beyond the written word. COLL 100 courses introduce students to the university's library and other academic resources, and to the ways in which information is accessed, evaluated, and communicated. All COLL 100s carry 4 credits. One COLL 100 is required for each freshman. All COLL 100s fulfill the statemandated digital information literacy requirement. Students must receive a C-or better in COLL 100 for the course to apply to the degree.</p><p>COLL 150 courses are small seminars that explore deeply a particular topic via close readings of texts, data, or methods of inquiry. The goal of COLL 150 is to initiate students into the culture of critical thinking, persuasive writing, and independent inquiry that is at the core of the undergraduate program. COLL 150 seminars highlight student discussion. All COLL 150s carry 4 credits. Students must receive a C-or better in COLL 150 for the course to apply to the degree. One COLL 150 is required of each freshman and all transfer students regardless of credits already earned.</p><p>COLL 200 courses may be offered by any academic unit at the university. COLL 200 courses are anchored in one of three knowledge domains, and deliberately look outward to one or both of the other two knowledge domains. The knowledge domains are:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arts, Letters, and Values (ALV)</head><p>Courses in this domain examine the expression and evaluation of values and attitudes. Courses may develop the ability of students to express their own values and attitudes or to develop their own evaluations using literature, art, music, performance, or philosophy. Others may examine the expressions and evaluations themselves historically, cross-culturally, or via the social and cognitive processes that produce them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultures, Societies, and Individuals (CSI)</head><p>Courses in this domain examine the realm of human cultures, societies, and individuals through their development, organization, and interaction. Some courses employ mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and scientific experimentation; some, the analysis of artifacts and texts; and others, observation, inference, and extrapolation. Students learn to describe, theorize, and explain human cultures, societies, and individuals in their variety over time and space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Natural and Quantitative Reasoning (NQR)</head><p>Courses in this domain examine the natural world and physical universe and the means by which humans observe, measure, model, and interpret it. Courses explore the process of scientific discovery, including the methods required to gather and assess empirical data, investigate the predictions of existing theories, and develop experimentally testable hypotheses. Courses may also focus on mathematical or computational methods as applied to these investigations. Students develop their understanding not only of the foundations, implications, and uses of scientific knowledge but also how scientific approaches can be used to create tangible products.</p><p>Each COLL 200 course significantly enhances student knowledge of a specific topic and also calls upon students to think about how its discipline fits into the broader framework of the Liberal Arts. Thus, each course emphasizes ideas and methods central to its domain(s) while also looking outward to one or both of the other domains. To the extent possible, COLL 200 courses also give students the opportunity to put methodologies represented in the course into practice. Every student must take a total of twelve credits explicitly labelled COLL 200, with at least one course in each of the three domains of not less than three credits. One COLL 200 must be taken in year 2. Transfer students must take one COLL 200 during their first year at William &amp; Mary. COLL 200 courses may or may not have prerequisites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional credits in the Knowledge Domains:</head><p>General education also requires undergraduates to take at least six more credits in the three knowledge domains of ALV, CSI, and NQR, with at least two credits in each domain.</p><p>Appropriate courses in the Undergraduate Catalog thus will be explicitly labelled as fulfilling COLL 200 credit, with specific mention of their anchor domain (12 credits required, with at least three credits in each domain). Appropriate courses may also be labelled as ALV, CSI, or NQR (6 credits required, with at least two credits in each domain.)</p><p>The COLL 300 requirement typically takes place in year 3. COLL 300 joins students with people, places, and ideas that lift them out of their familiar surroundings and deepen the way they see themselves in the world. COLL 300 asks students to use their knowledge, their emerging expertise in framing questions, and their communication skills to engage the world in a self-reflective, cross-cultural way. Students may fulfill COLL 300 either through a single course of 3 credits or a sequence of courses totaling 3 credits with C300 attribute(s). William &amp; Mary sponsored, international programs carry COLL 300 credit, irrespective of the courses taken while studying abroad. Regular academic courses may also carry the C300 attribute as the result of a study-away experience. Finally, certain COLL 300 courses remain on campus and bring together undergraduates and experts on cross-cultural and/or international topics.</p><p>The COLL 400 requirement is a capstone experience which typically takes place in year 4, and usually in the student's major. These capstone experiences require students to take initiative in synthesis and critical analysis, to solve problems in an applied and/or academic setting, to create original material or original scholarship, and to communicate effectively with a diversity of audiences. Students can fulfill this requirement through upper-level seminars, independent study and research projects, and Honors projects, as deemed appropriate by departments, programs, or schools. COLL 400 may but need not have an interdisciplinary focus as students can synthesize material within as well as across disciplines. COLL 400 capstone experiences must be at least 3 credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. The Major and Minor</head><p>Declaring a major assures students of an advisor in their department or program (and thus important advice on course selection), as well as an advantage in registering for courses in some majors.</p><p>Students may declare a major after completion of 39 credits (including AP, IB, and other transfer credit; see "Overall Credits" at bottom of Banner transcript).</p><p>Students must declare a major after completion of 54 credits (including AP, IB, and other transfer credit; see "Overall Credits" at bottom of Banner transcript).</p><p>EXCEPTIONS: Students who matriculated as social freshmen with 15 or more AP, IB, or dual enrollment credits must declare once they have earned 39 credits post-high school at W&amp;M (see "Institutional Credits" on the Banner transcript). Transfer students who entered with 54 or more credits must declare at the end of their first semester at the university.</p><p>A major in Interdisciplinary Studies must be declared before pre-registration in the final semester of the junior year.</p><p>The Declaration of Major for a changed or second major must be filed with the Office of the University Registrar no later than the last day of add/drop in the semester of graduation.</p><p>Students intending Arts &amp; Sciences majors officially record a major through their academic department/program and the Office of the University Registrar. A student may change a major at any time by using the same process. Students planning majors in the Schools of Business or Education must apply and be admitted. Check the Business and Education sections of the catalog for prerequisites and admissions criteria.</p><p>Students may declare one major, or two majors, or one major and one minor. If there are two majors, one must be designated as primary. Degrees are based on the primary major. College policy prohibits the awarding of a second baccalaureate degree; completion of two majors does not constitute completion of two degrees. A maximum of two courses can be counted toward both of two majors or toward a major and a minor. A minimum of 15 credit hours in the major must be taken at William &amp; Mary. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minors</head><p>In addition to the required major, a student may elect to pursue a program of studies designated as a minor. A minor consists of 18-22 credit hours of courses approved by a department or program, and at least 9 credits must be earned at William &amp; Mary. Courses completed for a minor may also satisfy COLL requirements. None of these courses may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. A student must earn at least a 2.0 grade point average in the minor. Information about specific minors can be obtained from the appropriate department or program. A maximum of two courses may be counted toward both a major and a minor. A student who intends to complete a minor must officially declare the minor with the department or program, then submit the Declaration of Minor form to the University Registrar. The Declaration of Minor request may be filed after completion of a minimum of 39 credit hours and must be filed with the Office of the University Registrar no later than the last day of add/drop in the semester of graduation (if you plan to graduate in the summer, the deadline is the last day of add/drop in the spring). A student who declares two majors may not declare a minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Honors and Special Programs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Honors</head><p>The Department Honors program, administered by the Roy R. Charles Center, provides special opportunities through independent study for the intellectual stimulation and development of superior students in certain departments and interdisciplinary programs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration for Honors 495 and 496</head><p>Charles Center staff will create all of the appropriate Honors sections and register students for both 495 and 496. Students will receive a confirmation email from the Charles Center once they have been registered for their specific Honors section. For questions concerning registration for Department Honors please call 221-2460.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examining Committee Appointment</head><p>A Charles Center staff member will request Honors committee recommendations from department chairs and program directors. Committee recommendations must be submitted by the appropriate person (department Chair, program Director, etc.) to the Charles Center. Committee recommendations must be submitted by the department chair or program director (or their designated representative); recommendations from students or individual Honors advisors will not be accepted.</p><p>Once the committee recommendations are submitted the formal committee appointments will be made by the Charles Center through an email to the committee chair with copies to the remaining committee members and the Honors student. Each examining committee must consist of three or more faculty members, with representation from at least two academic departments. Any current William &amp; Mary faculty member who is eligible to assign grades may serve on an Honors committee, including visiting and adjunct faculty. Departments / programs have different methods of selecting faculty for committees. For example, in some departments the selection is centralized, in others the selection is up to the thesis advisor and student. Students should ask their Honors advisor and / or department about the procedure for selecting faculty in their department or program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thesis Submission and Oral Examination</head><p>Two weeks before the last day of classes of the student's graduating semester (or the next class day if this date falls on a holiday or vacation day) a copy of the completed thesis must be submitted to each member of the examining committee.</p><p>If, after reading the thesis, the members of the committee find it provisionally acceptable, the oral examination may be scheduled. It is up to the student to schedule the defense date and time in coordination with all of the committee members and to arrange for a location for the defense. It is also the student's responsibility to remind the committee members of the date, time, and location of the defense.</p><p>The exam will consist of an oral examination lasting at least one hour. The main purpose of the examination will be to ask questions about the honors thesis, but the candidate may also be asked to discuss other topics that are related to the thesis. Students should check with their advisors about the protocol for oral exams within the department or program. Reporting of each student's level of Honors must be made to the Charles Center immediately following the completion of the oral exam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Successful Honors Projects</head><p>A candidate who successfully completes Honors 495 will receive a grade of "G" at the end of the first term of the project. Following the honors defense in the second term of the project, a final grade for both Honors 495 and 496 will be determined by the examining committee. The Honors advisor is responsible for submitting the grade for 496 and the University Registrar's Office will then change the grade for 495 to match the 496 grade. If the 495 grade should be different from the grade assigned for 496 the advisor will have to submit a grade change form to the University Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unsuccessful Honors Projects</head><p>Under no circumstances may Honors 495 and/or 496 remain on the transcript of a student who is not awarded honors by the examining committee. 1. If it becomes evident before the end of the first term that the student will not complete the project, either a. the student must withdraw from Honors 495 with the approval of the thesis advisor (the advisor must notify the Charles Center by email; or b. if it is too late for the student to withdraw from the course, the project advisor must change the Honors 495 designation to an appropriate alternative, such as independent study, by sending an email to the Charles Center indicating both the course number and number of credits (if variable). The Charles Center will then make the change in the student's registration.</p><p>2. If the project continues into the second semester and it then becomes evident that the project will not be completed by the submission deadline (two weeks before the last day of classes of the student's graduating semester), the faculty advisor must either:</p><p>a. change Honors 495 and 496 to appropriate alternatives (in most cases, independent study) by emailing the Charles Center and indicating both the course numbers and number of credits; or b. declare an incomplete, which can only be done in extraordinary circumstances and with departmental approval. The student and advisor must agree to firm new deadlines for the thesis and the defense and must submit these deadlines to the Charles Center.</p><p>3. If upon reading the thesis the members of the examining committee decide that the thesis does not merit honors and elect not to examine the student, or if, upon completion of the oral defense the examination committee determines that the thesis does not merit honors, the advisor must change Honors 495 and 496 to appropriate alternatives (by email to the Charles Center) and award the student grades for these courses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internships for Credit</head><p>An internship agreement must be completed with signatures of the student, evaluating faculty member, and any external supervisor. These are to be filed in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies before the student begins the internship. There will be no consideration of academic credit without an internship agreement.</p><p>Qualified students, usually in their junior or senior year, may receive credit from cooperating departments for an approved program that provides an opportunity to apply and expand knowledge under expert supervision in an on-or off-campus position. These internships should provide a structured learning experience and must be approved in advance by the department and evaluated by a William &amp; Mary faculty member. Academic credit is awarded for a project that incorporates the hands-on experience of the internship, but also includes an analytic or research component, and a final, written report. Individual departments determine the number of credits in an academic internship that may count toward the minimum number of credits required in a major. Normally three credits are awarded, but in exceptional and approved cases a department may award more. No more than six credits in academic internships may be applied to the 120 credits required for graduation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Credit Internships</head><p>Students interested in pursuing non-credit internships may apply through the Office of Career Services for participation in the Local Internship Program. Placements are available in law firms, medical offices, museums, social service agencies, businesses, schools, investment firms, publishing groups, public relations offices, technology companies, and science labs. Opportunities for summer internships are also available through the Office of Career Services. Some internships are listed directly with Career Services and the office provides students access to a database of nearly 20,000 opportunities in a broad range of fields and locations. Staff members in the Office of Career Services are available to counsel students concerning internship and other career-related opportunities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Professional Programs</head><p>Students may follow programs at William &amp; Mary within a liberal arts framework that will prepare them for study in dentistry, engineering, forestry, medical technology, medicine and veterinary medicine. Students who are interested in pre-professional programs should plan their programs in consultation with their advisors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Medical and Pre-Dental Programs</head><p>There are no formal pre-medical or pre-dental programs for which students must register at William &amp; Mary. Students preparing for admission to medical or dental school may choose to major in any department. Still, students must have a strong foundation in the sciences. Most medical schools and dental schools include in their admission requirements a number of laboratory Because medical schools begin to reach decisions on applicants for admission early in the fall of the application year, and because the required premedical science courses are essential for success on the MCAT, these science courses should be completed before June of the year in which the student intends to start applying to medical school. All pre-medical students are encouraged to seek academic guidance early in their careers through scheduled consultations with Prof. Beverly Sher in the Department of Chemistry. Students should contact her directly via email at btsher@wm.edu to schedule appointments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Degree Programs</head><p>Academic programs of students who participate in any combined degree program must be approved in advance by the Committee on Degrees. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Africana Studies The Africana Studies Program</head><p>The interdisciplinary major in Africana Studies (AFST) employs rigorous interdisciplinary and comparative approaches for the study of over one billion people of African descent, a fifth whom are in the Diaspora. The central mission of the program is to prepare students for lifelong learning, graduate study in various fields, and careers in private and public organizations across the globe.</p><p>The AFST curriculum engages students in a critical examination of the intellectual, political, economic and cultural challenges and achievements of Africans and African-descended peoples. The study of these diverse and dynamic traditions does much more than embracing the centrality of race. It also encompasses imperial, national, ethnic, linguistic, and religious currents and intersections in such far-flung settings as Africa, North America, the Caribbean Basin, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe.</p><p>The Program draws on wide-ranging fields of inquiry that include history, sociology, economics, anthropology, political science, religion, literature, music, drama, dance, film, and the visual arts. Through coursework that integrates and at often transcends disciplinary knowledge, students will learn to appreciate the specificity of Africa and its offshoots, the ways in which local and global forces interacted to shape a shared identity of Blackness as well as community-specific identities, and the trajectories of syncretism and other forms of intercultural exchange.</p><p>Students are encouraged to combine their scholarly study with service learning, study away, or study abroad. Course work in each of the three tracks must encompass at least three disciplines to ensure a genuinely interdisciplinary grounding in historical and contemporary issues along with practical applications of such knowledge (internships, civic engagement, and independent research).</p><p>Details on the structure of the major are provided below. Full descriptions of courses and requirements are available from faculty advisors and the program's website. Africana majors are encouraged to look into allied Interdisciplinary programs such as American Studies, Women's Studies, Global Studies, and International Relations for complementary courses and intellectual exchange.</p><p>Engaged Scholarship and Service Learning. Students are encouraged to engage in service-learning or engaged-scholarship opportunities to supplement classroom study of such issues as racial inequality, cultural exchange, and identity politics.</p><p>Study Abroad. Students are strongly encouraged to seek overseas opportunities, especially in Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America that complement the major. Contact the Global Education Office at the Reves Center for more information. With prior approval, courses taken abroad may be applied to the major or other requirements.</p><p>Study Away. Majors are also encouraged to seek out study away opportunities in the U.S. in approved Centers or Institutes, Colleges, or Universities. For example, students may arrange to take language courses elsewhere in the summer, or devote a semester to undertake a pre-approved program of study and research. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies The American Studies Program</head><p>The American Studies program engages students in examination of the culture and society of the United States, past and present, and asks students to consider the United States of "America comparatively in the Americas. As a nation born of immigration and encounter, the United States has always embraced diverse racial and ethnic groups in mutual encounter and conflict. It has also undergone endless change, through transformations wrought by geographical expansion, democracy, industrialization, urbanization, and the pressures of war and international politics. These forces ranged from the removal of Native Americans from their lands, and enslavement of Africans, to the most intimate realms of life, such as the relations between men and women in the home and attitudes toward the body, gender, and sexuality.</p><p>Yet, in the midst of these large movements of history, many Americans have forged distinctive cultures-ways of thinking, feeling and acting--that express their basic values and give meaning to their institutions and everyday social practices. Such cultures reflect, in part, the different experiences of people, according to their race, gender, and class. But they may also attest to Americans' participation in a larger ideological heritage, shaped by ideals of democracy and equality that have been affirmed in major political movements, such as the American Revolution and the civil rights movements of the 20th and 21st centuries, and articulated in art, literature, music, and films.</p><p>The American Studies program offers an opportunity to explore the commonalities and differences among Americans through an interdisciplinary course of studies. Working closely with their advisor, students will assemble a set of courses, designed both to represent the diversity of cultures and social forms within the United States and across the Americas and to pursue significant themes or questions in depth. In developing the major, students may also take up comparative perspectives on the United States, considering, for example, African American life within the context of the black diaspora, or the American experience of industrial capitalism as a variant on a general model around the world. </p></div>

"Movement/Mobility/Migration" is a seminar in which we aim to reveal and challenge the assumptions we associate with movement. We examine how anthropologists, historians, philosophers, physicists, artists, and scholars in interdisciplinary fields such as disability studies and indigenous studies have examined movement both as a practice that humans and nonhumans do(or are limited in doing) and also as a concept that we construct. As a practice, we will consider various forms of small and large-scale movement, including migration, pilgrimage, dance, trade, and navigation. As a concept, we will examine both the qualities associated with movement, such as dynamism, fluidity, flexibility, ephemerality, impermanence, rootlessness, vagrancy, etc. and also how these qualities are constructed as positive and/or negative depending on the socio-political, cultural, and historical context. <ref type="bibr">Credits: (3)</ref> College Curriculum: COLL 200 Domain (Anchored): CSI Domain (Reaching Out): ALV According to Michel Foucault, our era's fundamental preoccupation is space <ref type="bibr">(1998 [1967]</ref>). Space and spatial practice are key themes in the study of modernity and the academic disciplines of anthropology, sociology, and geography, for example, have been central in driving these research efforts. This course adopts a multidisciplinary perspective to construct a theoretical understanding of alternate, often insurgent, social geographies. Instead of simply focusing on insurgent geographies practiced during extreme conditions or at the "margins" of governmental reach, we will examine divergent and sustainable spatial modalities practiced in everyday life. This course considers how these spatial practices map onto, shadow, and/or challenge official colonial and capitalist conceptual and material cartographies as well as create new site ontologies. Students will think through case studies ranging in time and space and include the experiences of colonial black slaves and undocumented residents of modern nation-states.</p></div>

The course will build a foundation for understanding the use of lasers in biology and medicine. There will be particular emphasis on laser beam interactions with human tissue for diagnosis, therapy, and surgery, with additional attention to optical coherence tomography, two-photon microscopy, fluorescent imaging, optical tweezers, and refractive surgery. The ability to engineer smaller and smaller structures and devices has enabled great progress across many disciplines ranging from microelectronics to biomedicine. Scanning probe techniques, including scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy, have been transformational and inspiring tools to visualize, study, and govern the nanocosmos: they have allowed us not only to image structures of atomic dimensions but also helped us to measure molecular-scale forces and interactions, and they have enabled manipulation, building, and milling of things at the nanoscale. This class covers the fundamental relationships governing the interactions of objects and structures at such small length scales. Connections are made between nanoscale behavior of materials and their practical consequences for everyday macroscale phenomena. Designs, imaging modes and capabilities of the scanning probe microscopes are discussed, as well as their application for nanoengineering and sensing. The class includes hands-on computer simulations and a hands-on tour of a state-of-the-art scanning probe microscopy laboratory. We examine respiration and the neural circuits that generate and control it. We investigate the physical plant (organs, muscles, etc.) that produces breathing movements to ventilate the lungs, as well as the fundamental tenets of respiratory physiology. Next we move from the physical plant for breathing to its underlying neural circuitry in the brainstem, which predominantly controls the behavior. We examine brainstem respiratory microcircuits at molecular, cellular, and network levels of analysis. Additional material includes sensorimotor integration particularly associated with blood-gas homeostasis, pH regulation, and lung-mechanoreceptor feedback on respiratory control microcircuits. Finally, we examine how the breathing neural control centers interface with the emotional brain, which underlies both the calming and arousing effects of breathing.</p></div>

The program aims at developing greater visual awareness through a rigorously structured educational experience based on intensive studio training. All course offerings, from beginning to advanced, emphasize working from observation to provide a common language and firm visual foundation. At more advanced levels, students develop a more personal sensitivity to visual modes, leading to an informed and specific artistic voice.</p><p>The Art History program offers concentrations in Art History, Critical Curatorial Studies, and Built Environment Studies. Each concentration contributes to the liberal arts education of undergraduates while preparing students for a variety of future careers and educational paths. Art History majors are required to take introductory and intermediate level courses, advanced seminars, one studio art course, a course on critical curatorial studies, and a senior research colloquium. The Art History program promotes critical understanding of the development and diversity of visual arts in various historical and global contexts while familiarizing students with current disciplinary concerns.</p><p>In each Art History concentration, the student is required to complete three foundational ARTH courses and one foundational ART course. It is to the advantage of the student to complete these courses by the end of the sophomore year. A wide variety of programs can be developed from the offerings of the department to suit the individual needs of majors. Students in Art and Art History have developed careers in art, architecture, art history, landscape design, urban studies, historic preservation, museum work, teaching, and applied arts in business. For purposes of double majoring, Art and Art History combines well with history, anthropology, literature, comparative literature, music and music history, classical studies, philosophy, psychology, and the sciences to give a student a breadth of knowledge and experience in comparable methodologies that leads to mutually reinforcing insights in both majors. Students interested in elementary and secondary school teaching of art should elect the major in art.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives (6 or More Credits)</head><p>Students must select two additional courses from those listed below which are not offered by their major department; students majoring in neither Biology nor Chemistry must select one Biology course and one Chemistry course. Some electives have an optional or required laboratory component.</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Guidelines:</head><p>If a student with an AP Biology score of 5 elects not to take BIOL 220, the 4 credit Biology elective may count towards the Biochemistry minor. If the student takes BIOL 220, the Biology elective does not count towards the minor. Students with an exemption from BIOL 225 may either elect to take it for credit or take an additional Biochemistry minor Biology elective to obtain sufficient credits for the minor.</p><p>Non-chemistry majors considering the Biochemistry minor may also wish to consider the Chemistry Minor, which takes only two courses beyond the two-year introductory sequence (with labs) in Chemistry rather than three. Since the Chemistry Minor electives include CHEM 309 , CHEM 341 and CHEM 314, students anticipating scheduling difficulties that may preclude them from completing the Biochemistry Minor may want to fulfill the requirements for a Chemistry Minor first.</p><p>Semester course scheduling may vary depending on staff availability, and in some cases there are time conflicts.</p><p>Be certain you will have met course prerequisites by the time you plan to enroll in a course.</p><p>Declaration of the Biochemistry Minor should be submitted to the Registrar's office before the beginning of preregistration for the final semester of the student's senior year.</p><p>A student with two majors may not declare a minor. Only one minor may be declared.</p><p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required in the courses which are to be counted toward the minor, and none may have been taken pass/fail.</p><p>You may count up to two courses toward both a major and a minor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission Statement</head><p>The mission of the Mason School of Business of the College of William &amp; Mary is to serve the Commonwealth, the nation, and the global community both by offering high-quality educational programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels and by creating and communicating new knowledge. We fulfill this mission through:</p><p>Building a faculty whose research, teaching, and service influence students, business leaders, policy makers, and other scholars; Engaging students in innovative educational experiences to nurture creativity, to mentor high ideals, and to accelerate ambitions of leadership that they will imagine the business opportunities of the day and seize them. The undergraduate degree program normally leads to a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA). Students who double major in a Business and an Arts and Sciences discipline may choose either as their primary major. Students will receive the degree that corresponds to their primary major (BBA for Business, BA or BS for Arts and Sciences).</p><p>Graduate programs lead to a Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Accounting (MAcc), or Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA). Detailed information about these programs is provided online at http://mason.wm.edu. All programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB International).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Business Program</head><p>The Undergraduate Business Program offers an individualized approach to business education. Each student is challenged to design an Individual Program of Study (IPS) that uniquely addresses their particular goals and interests including post-graduate plans. Business majors are offered in four areas: Accounting; Business Analytics; Finance; Marketing. To promote breadth of study students may complement their major field of study by electing to pursue a concentration in a second business area. Concentrations are offered in the following ten areas: Accounting; Business Analytics; Consulting; Entrepreneurship; Finance; Innovation and Design; Management and Organizational Leadership; Marketing; Supply Chain Analytics; Sustainability.</p><p>The first semester in the Undergraduate Business Program students complete the Integrated Foundation Semester (known informally as "the Block"). Students work in the same teams across classes, and take a cluster of courses including: business analytics, finance, marketing, computer applications, and business perspectives. Teams gain experience in making presentations in several courses in the Block. Ethical issues are addressed in various contexts. In addition, for a week positioned near the end of the semester, student teams participate in a simulation where students integrate the knowledge they have acquired and make a final presentation to business executives. By the end of the semester all students have gained exposure to the majors (Accounting; Business Analytics; Finance; Marketing) offered within the Undergraduate Business Program.</p><p>Many students in the Undergraduate Business Program combine their studies in business with a major or a minor in a department outside of the Mason School of Business. We also strongly encourage students to include an internship experience in their Individual Program of Study.</p><p>The Mason School of Business believes every student should have an international experience. We have designed our curricula so all majors are able to earn their degree with an "International Emphasis." Our curricula permit flexibility allowing students to study abroad in the spring of their junior year; however, this goal may conflict with other goals such as a completing a double major or an internship. Students interested in studying abroad should contact the Undergraduate Business Program and the Global Education Office in the Reves Center for International Studies for more information.</p><p>Students are encouraged to begin planning their Individual Program of Study in the Business School as soon as they determine that they have an interest in business.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to the Majors Program</head><p>The Mason School of Business offers majors in the following four areas: Accounting; Business Analytics; Finance; Marketing. All students who wish to major in Business (whether as a primary or secondary major) must apply for admission to the Mason School of Business. Our competitive admissions process is designed to identify students who will thrive academically and professionally, and who will contribute to our learning community through their unique background of talents and experiences.

These are important strengths that distinguish our programs. All majors complete an integrated core program that emphasizes exposure to the underlying business disciplines. In addition, many students will find it desirable to pursue a multidisciplinary curriculum that will include advanced study in a business discipline other than their major field. The concentration option is designed for students who wish to complete six to nine credit hours of advanced coursework in a business discipline other than their major field. Concentrations are available in the following ten areas: Accounting; Business Analytics; Consulting; Entrepreneurship; Finance; Innovation and Design Thinking; Management and Organizational Leadership; Marketing; Supply Chain Analytics; Sustainability.</p></div>

Students fulfilling the requirements set forth below will be described as completing an Individual Program of Study with an International Emphasis. This designation provides recognition for students who seek an international perspective.</p><p>The requirements for an International Emphasis include: (1) a course in international business; (2) an elective with an international emphasis that is related to your major or concentration, with a provision for exceptions as noted below; (3) a language and/or culture requirement; and (4) a study abroad experience. These requirements are discussed in detail below:</p><p>1. You must complete BUAD 410 -International Business Management, BUAD 412 -Global Business Analysis, BUAD 413 -Global Business Immersion, or the equivalent. 2. If you are majoring or concentrating in a discipline that offers an international course, you must successfully complete one course that has an international emphasis. In the event that for a particular Individual Program of Study no course with an international emphasis is offered, a student who has a minor may satisfy this requirement by successfully completing an international course in the discipline of the minor. For all other cases, you must seek approval for a course with an international emphasis that is appropriate for your Individual Program of Study. 3. You must successfully complete an approved elective that focuses on foreign language or culture.</p><p>A course offered by the Department of Modern Languages at the College that focuses on commercial applications of a foreign language satisfies this requirement. This requirement is also satisfied by completing six semester hours of credit of language study beyond the 202 level.</p><p>Other courses must be submitted for approval to the Undergraduate Business Program. No course will be approved unless the focus on language or the focus on culture is fundamental to the design of the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>You must successfully complete a minimum of twelve semester hours of credit in a study abroad program(s). Only credits earned in a study abroad program(s) that are transferred back to William &amp; Mary and appear on the official College transcript can be applied to satisfy this requirement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CAMS Program</head><p>The CAMS (Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics) program is by nature interdisciplinary. In CAMS, applications are the primary driver of the research agenda for scholarly activity. The CAMS program supports a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, and integrative approach to teaching and research in applied and computational mathematics, operations research, mathematical biology and statistics. Course work and research experiences in CAMS provide a strong base in both the knowledge and practical skills necessary to make important contributions to mathematics, industry and the sciences. There are two tracks within the CAMS program: Mathematical Biology and Applied Statistics.</p><p>Mathematical Biology aims at modeling natural, biological processes using mathematical techniques and tools. It has both practical and theoretical applications in biological research. Applying mathematics to biology has a long history, but only relatively recently has there been an explosion of interest in the field. Some reasons for this include: the explosion of data-rich information sets, due to the genomics revolution, which are difficult to understand without the use of analytical tools; recent development of mathematical tools such as chaos theory to help understand complex, nonlinear mechanisms in biology; an increase in computing power which enables calculations and simulations to be performed that were not previously possible; and an increasing interest in computer experimentation due to the complications involved in human and animal research.</p><p>The Applied Statistics Track provides a major option for undergraduates with an interest in statistics, "big data", and actuarial science. As humans have developed cheaper and smaller sensors, web cameras and other data collection devices, the amount of data available to be analyzed and understood has exploded. Statistics is the mathematical science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation, explanation, and presentation of data. Because of its empirical roots and its focus on applications, statistics is typically considered a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics.</p></div>

Given the enormous difficulty of writing large programs, what kinds of computer languages can be easily specified, easily understood, and yet mechanically translated? What concepts govern information processing? What are the most advantageous ways of distributing computing loads over a collection of distributed processors? How are graphical images best stored and processed? Are some functions inherently harder to compute than others? Do functions exist which cannot be computed? How is knowledge best represented in a computer?</p><p>The department's programs prepare students for graduate study in computer science and for employment as computer science professionals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Science</head><p>Students trained in Data Science will study a blend of topics from many subdomains of communications, philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and information science. A data scientist has a breadth of experience across all of these fields, but may not have as much knowledge as a specialist in any particular field. Furthermore, a data scientist trained at William &amp; Mary is equipped to consider the philosophical and moral implications of algorithm development and data collection, and the societal ramifications that new approaches to data manipulation could have. This combination allows William and Mary Data Science students to (a) efficiently conduct computational analyses within their own knowledge domain, (b) manage teams of more specialized individuals to answer far-ranging questions, and (c) communicate technical findings to new types of audiences. Individuals with this set of knowledge are revolutionizing a wide set of domains, and are in very high demand not just by faculty researchers at William and Mary, but also by the public and private sector.</p><p>The College of William and Mary offers a minor in Data Science, which draws on faculty expertise from many departments. There are four key pedagogic pillars students will be expected to engage with during their time in the program: Computation, Application, Communication, and Deliberation.</p><p>Computation -the computer science and mathematics required to responsibly use large datasets to create new knowledge. This is a focus of the introductory coursework, as well as the elective data specialties. Application -the skills and creative thinking required to identify novel ways to apply computation to new problems. Application is present in all core courses within the Data Science program, including CSCI 140, CSCI 146, and APSC 490 Data Driven Decision making.</p><p>Communication -the confidence to present in front of a crowd, and creativity to communicate or visualize technical concepts for new, likely non-technical audiences. Courses such as public speaking and art help promote such confidence and creativity; while many students will naturally receive some communications training as a part of their time at William and Mary, the Data Science program promotes an additional depth of skill due to the challenges in communicating large sets of data. Communication is a strong theme within all Data Science core courses.</p><p>Deliberation -the ability to consider the societal, moral, and ethical implications of Data Science. Data Science minors are required to take either a College 150 examining these topics or broader philosophy coursework.</p><p>The Data Science minor is designed to be paired with a wide variety of majors across William &amp; Mary, so there are no restrictions on the primary major pursued in conjunction with the Data Science minor. Under most circumstances the Data Science minor should be declared no later than the second semester of the Junior year to ensure the minor can be completed. Two courses may be counted toward both your primary major and minor; some courses may be substituted with permission from the director. In addition to the required work, various other courses as well as non-classroom training (such as internships, research projects with faculty, participation in study abroad programs, or off-campus study) are strongly recommended. For further questions, contact the program Director (Prof Dan Runfola; Applied Science -danr@wm.edu), or reach out to one of the Faculty Affiliates listed at ds.wm.edu. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Advisement</head><p>Students are urged to take full advantage of the advisement services in the School of Education. During their freshman and sophomore years, they are encouraged to talk with education faculty about potential careers in teaching. Upon admission to an education program, individual students are assigned academic advisors in the School of Education. Before registering for education courses, students should meet with their advisors to discuss academic, personal and professional goals; to review both the academic regulations of William &amp; Mary and the specific course requirements for teacher licensure; and to plan a program of studies in education. Advisors work with the students throughout their programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field Experience and Continuation Policy</head><p>Any undergraduate student with more than one unacceptable grade of D, F, or I in a required School of Education course on their academic record will not be able to participate in their field experiences. To be eligible to student teach, students must successfully complete all education program courses with passing grades and complete or provide an acceptable substitution for the Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators test. A student with extenuating circumstances may petition to the School of Education Academic Status Committee for special approval to participate in field experiences. Prior to the beginning of their first field experience, it is the student's responsibility to show verification of a current tubercular examination or risk assessment. In addition, students must complete a background check as indicated by the school division in which they are placed. Additional policies and procedures that govern students in the teacher preparation programs during their field experiences are included in the Handbook for Teacher Candidate Clinical Experiences, which is available on the Office of Teacher Education and Community Engagement website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transportation</head><p>All field experiences take place in K-12 classroom settings. Students are placed in schools within a 60 mile radius of the School of Education, which could be up to a 45 minute drive from campus. Students are responsible for getting to practicum and student teaching placements. Students should provide their own transportation. Taking public transportation is an option, but not always practical, and will only work if placed in the Williamsburg-James City County school division. Relying on others for rides is never an optimum arrangement.</p></div>

During this time, we have developed our own thoughts about how best to teach and learn. But the larger question we tackle in this class is this: Is what you know TRUE? How can you be sure? Because education is such a hot topic, we all have our opinions. This class provides students with the space to interrogate their long-held assumptions by rigorously examining the nature of human knowledge, and to critically trace the underlying epistemological assumptions driving discussion and policy-making in education today. This examination is critical because our assumptions regarding what we know and how we justify what we know drives the questions we ask, the methods we employ to answer those questions, the results we establish, and ultimately the policies we establish.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Science and Policy The Environmental Science and Policy Program</head><p>The environmental problems that threaten the planet on which our society depends are complex, requiring us to integrate insights across the disciplines. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of these problems, students pursuing careers in the environment require significant breadth of training in the natural and social sciences and the humanities. At the same time, students must have an area of expertise, and so should develop effective skills based on depth of training in a specific area. In light of the need for an appropriate balance between breadth and depth of training, the Environmental Science and Policy (ENSP) program has been designed as a secondary major and a minor, each to be pursued in conjunction with a primary major in a complementary subject field. Every ENSP major/minor must major in another discipline.</p><p>The Environmental Science and Policy major provides breadth in basic course work as well as familiarization with the specific scientific and social considerations related to a wide range of environmental issues. Participation in the program requires an initial consultation with the Director, and a formal declaration of major no later than the second semester of the junior year. Students pursuing a primary major in Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics, or other natural science field will normally have their secondary major designated as Environmental Science and they will receive the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree. Others--often students pursuing a primary major in Economics, Global Studies, Government, International Relations, Public Policy, or Sociology--will receive a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) with an Environmental Policy designation. There are two slightly different programs for the B.A. and B.S. majors: the Science Track and the Policy Track.</p><p>There are no formal restrictions on the primary major pursued in conjunction with the Environmental Science and Policy major. However, the primary should both supplement and complement the student's environmental training, while providing the necessary additional depth. Therefore, students are expected to develop a program with an appropriate rationale based on interconnections among subjects as well as the student's long-term career interests. Two courses may be counted toward both majors; therefore, depending on the primary major, the number of additional courses required to complete the Environmental Science and Policy major may total less than 36 hours.</p><p>For both the B.A. and B.S., limited substitution of other courses for some of these requirements may be possible with the approval of the Director. In addition to the required work, various other courses as well as non-classroom training (such as internships, research projects with faculty, participation in study abroad programs, or off-campus study and research, such as participation in an REU program) are strongly recommended.</p><p>For advice, further information, updates, and additional descriptive material, contact the Director (Prof. Andrew Fisher, History Dept., ahfis2@wm.edu) and visit www.wm.edu/environment. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Studies The Global Studies Programs</head><p>Students who major in Global Studies (GBST) work together with an advisor to design an interdisciplinary sequence of courses in one of the following area concentrations: Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, Asian and Pacific Islander American Studies, European Studies, Latin American Studies, and Russian and Post-Soviet Studies. Through coursework in the culture, history, languages, literature, politics, and religions of major world regions, students explore the specificity of a given region, the ways in which global forces are realized in and through local contexts, and the interconnections between global regions. Majors often combine their program of study with service learning, internships, or study abroad. Familiarity with a specific region provides a foundation for grappling with the emerging possibilities and the ethical responsibilities of living in an globally interconnected world.</p><p>In general, a major in Global Studies involves the selection of an area concentration that includes courses from at least three departments. Detailed descriptions of the degree programs are provided below. Additional information about courses and requirements is available from area concentration faculty advisors.</p><p>Language Requirement. Degrees in Global Studies include a modern foreign language component which exceeds the College's proficiency requirement. Students meet the requirement by completing a specific level of language instruction as detailed in their concentration. <ref type="figure">Requirement (MWR)</ref>. The major writing requirement may be satisfied in Global Studies by <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>  Senior Honors. Students who wish to conduct an honors project must apply for admission to the Departmental Honors program, which is administered by the Charles Center. As part of the application, students must get the approval of an honors project by a faculty member in their area concentration (AMES, APIA, EURS, LAS, or RPSS). Application, which includes a faculty signature and a prospectus, should be made to the Charles Center by the end of classes in the academic semester before the project is to begin. A prospectus includes: (1) a clear statement of the problem to be researched; (2) a brief, critical review of scholarly literature on the research topic; (3) a description of the methodology to be employed; <ref type="bibr" target="#b972">(4)</ref> and an approximate schedule of work. Eligible applicants must carry a 3.2 grade point average in Global Studies and must also meet the College eligibility standard of 3.0 overall or in their junior year. For further information and an application, contact the Charles Center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Writing</head><p>Students admitted into the Honors program in Global Studies will enroll in the honors courses (495-496) appropriate to their area concentration during both semesters of their senior year. Honors candidates are responsible for (1) formulating and completing a program of study in consultation with a faculty advisor;</p><p>(2) preparation and presentation, by two weeks before the last day of classes in the spring semester, of an honors essay; and (3) satisfactory performance in a comprehensive oral examination which focuses on the subject matter of the honors essay. For College provisions governing admission to the Senior Honors program, see the discussion of major honors elsewhere in this catalog and the Charles Center web site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asian and Middle Eastern Studies</head><p>Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (AMES) is a multidisciplinary program that aims to enrich the understanding of a broadly conceived "Asia" in relation to other parts of the world. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asian and Pacific Islander American Studies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>European Studies</head><p>A concentration in European Studies provides interdisciplinary exposure to Europe's history, culture, and politics, emphasizing both Europe's regional specificity and its historical and contemporary interactions with other global regions. The concentration prepares students culturally and linguistically for professions in the public and private spheres in the US and Europe. Majors must have the following prerequisites, which do not count toward the <ref type="formula">18</ref>  Course prerequisites are indicated in brackets after the appropriate course titles (slashes between course numbers indicate that students must take one of the listed courses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latin American Studies</head><p>Latin American Studies (LAS) is a multidisciplinary program that aims to help students make connections across different scholarly approaches to "the Americas" and to make sense of interdisciplinary frameworks for understanding the people, economies, cultures and politics of one of the world's most dynamic and diverse regions. The LAS curriculum includes the study of history, political economy, sociology, literature, fine and media arts, culture, and major languages of the region. Course offerings cover a wide range of topics and geographical focuses in departments including Anthropology, Art and Art History, Economics, Government, Hispanic Studies, History, Religious Studies, and Sociology.</p><p>Requirements for the major are listed below. (Total credits for the major: 33)</p><p>Major Declaration: Prospective majors in LAS should discuss their plans for study with an affiliated faculty by the end of the sophomore year. Upon declaring the major students will select two fields of emphasis that will serve as "concentrations" within the multi-disciplinary major, which will enable them to pursue an in depth course of study within a focused area. Disciplinary concentration fields include: Anthropology, Art and Art History, Economics, Government, Hispanic Studies, History, Sociology. Students can also, in consultation with the LAS program director, design a thematic or global field relevant to the region, choosing courses (at least 9 credits) from any discipline or program that together allow for in-depth study of a chosen topic relevant to Latin America. Declaration forms and instructions for majors and minors are available on the Global Studies website and at the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immersion Experience:</head><p>The immersion experience is defined as an experience beyond the William &amp; Mary classroom clearly linked to Latin America or Latinos residing in other parts of the world. Its purpose is to develop students' awareness of issues impacting Latin American countries and people. The immersion experience is designed to give students an opportunity to apply their in-class learning to realworld situations and develop frameworks for engaging real-world issues affecting Latin American cultures, nations, and communities. The immersion experience may be tied to a service learning opportunity or study abroad. Students can also satisfy this requirement through an internship that focuses on Latin American or Latino issues in the United States. This is a non-credit bearing requirement. Students who fulfill this requirement by participating in a William &amp; Mary study abroad program or through a LAS-affiliated program such as the Border Studies Program, SOMOS, MANOS or the National Security Archives programs should complete a pre-approval form (available on the LAS web-site) and enroll in LAS 400. In other cases fulfillment of the immersion requirement is subject to the approval of the student's major advisor or the LAS program director.</p><p>Language Requirement: The concentration in Latin American Studies includes a language requirement that exceeds the College-wide proficiency requirement. The requirement can be met with three credits at the 300-level or above taught in a target language spoken in the region. Although the College is not currently able to offer languages beyond Spanish, a student could count another language (for example, Portuguese or Nahuatl) provided they can demonstrate proficiency through accredited academic courses taken domestically or abroad. In special cases this requirement can also be satisfied by an equivalent language immersion experience subject to approval by the LAS program director.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Russian and Post-Soviet Studies</head><p>Russian and Post-Soviet Studies (RPSS) is an interdisciplinary program that introduces students to culture, history and politics of a vast region spanning from East-Central Europe to Siberia and Central Asia. The curriculum for the RPSS concentration and the RPSS minor includes courses in politics, history, literature, film, and media of the region, and the Russian language. Russian and Post-Soviet Studies concentrators and minors are strongly encouraged to combine their academic study at William &amp; Mary with study abroad. The concentration prepares students culturally and linguistically for professions in the public and private spheres in the US and in Eurasia, as well as for graduate study.</p><p>Majors are required to complete 33 credit hours. All courses with the RPSS designator (see below) fulfill major and minor requirements for the concentration. Please consult with a faculty advisor about specific lines the course fulfills. The rest of the courses for the major and minor are selected from those available in the curriculum of the various departments. See the requirements for the RPSS major and RPSS minor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APIA 495 -Honors Credits: (3)</head><p>Students meeting the requirements to pursue Honors study design their scholarly inquiry or creative engagement of a thesis or theme previously approved and supervised by an approving faculty supervisor. Solicited faculty will only consider written proposals with project descriptions and preliminary timelines for completion. To successfully receive credit for APIA 495, students must have completed the first draft of their research output, be it a creative work or scholarly paper by the end of examination week. Faculty will decide whether the student will continue on to APIA 496 on the basis of their assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APIA 496 -Honors Credits: (3)</head><p>Students pursuing Honors study only enroll in APIA 496 upon approval from supervising faculty of their successful completion of APIA 495. The main thrust of this course is for revision, refinement, and elaboration on the first draft. The candidate for Honors will present their body of work to the public and will be examined by their faculty committee at least two weeks before the end of the semester. In the event that faculty and/or student discern that the current progress of the work is not at full completion or if the faculty committee makes the same decision, APIA 495 and 496 will be converted into APIA 480: Independent Studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Fields (18 Credits Total)</head><p>Students will select two fields that will guide their studies in LAS. At least one of these must be a disciplinary field, and students will take at least 9 credits in that discipline focused on Latin America. Available LAS disciplinary fields include: The optional thematic or global field must be designed in consultation with and approved by the LAS Program.</p><p>At least 9 of the 18 credits required to meet the Major Fields requirement must be taken at the 300-level or above.</p><p>See below for course listings by discipline. Other courses in topics in Latin American and Latino Studies not listed below may count and are subject to approval by the Program Director.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immersion Experience</head><p>The immersion experience is defined as an experience beyond the William and Mary classroom clearly linked to Latin America or Latinos residing in other parts of the world. It is designed to give students an opportunity to apply their in-class learning to real-world situations, and develop frameworks for engaging the issues affecting Latin American cultures, nations, and communities. The immersion experience may be tied to a service learning opportunity or study abroad. Students can also satisfy this requirement through an internship that focuses on Latin American or Latino issues in the United States. This is a noncredit bearing requirement. Students who fulfill this requirement by participating in a William and Mary study abroad program or through an LAS-affiliated program such the Borderlands or the National Security Archives programs should complete a pre-approval form (available on the LAS web-site) and enroll in LAS 400. In other cases fulfillment of the immersion requirement is subject to the approval of the LAS program director.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Requirement</head><p>The concentration in Latin American Studies includes a language requirement that exceeds the Collegewide proficiency requirement. The requirement can be met with three credits at the 300-level or above taught in a target language spoken in the region. Although William and Mary is not currently able to offer regional languages besides Spanish, a student could count another language (for example, Portuguese or Nahuatl) if they can demonstrate proficiency through accredited academic courses taken domestically or abroad. In special cases this requirement can be satisfied by an equivalent language immersion experience subject to approval by the LAS Program Director.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Seminar:</head><p>This requirement is met by taking a 400-level seminar (3 or 4 credits) from the courses listed in the Latin American curriculum. Senior seminars often will be cross-listed as LAS 450. It is suggested that the senior seminar be fulfilled with a course from one of the student's disciplinary or thematic fields, though any LAS 450 or senior seminar on Latin America from one of the LAS disciplines will fulfill the requirement. The senior seminar requirement can also be fulfilled through the pursuit of honors in Latin American Studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives:</head><p>The elective requirement can be met by taking additional credits from course offerings in Latin American Studies, to bring total credits up to 33.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of the Curriculum</head><p>History courses are generally divided into two main categories: seminars and lecture courses. There are different levels of difficulty within each category.</p><p>Seminars in History are generally capped at 15 students and tend to be reading and writing intensive. Many seminars have a research component. Faculty rarely lecture in seminars, so students should expect to participate regularly. In the History Department, seminars range from freshman seminars at the 100level to capstone courses at the 400-level. 200-level seminars fall in between in terms of their level of difficulty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>100-level seminars</head><p>The 150 Freshman Seminars are required of all incoming first-year students. Freshmen are given priority for these classes, although other students may take them if there is space. These classes delve deeply into a relatively narrow topic, so students can discuss, interpret, and write about that topic intensively. Freshman seminars can be on a broad range of topics in any department at the College, and topics vary by semester. Freshmen who think they may become history majors are urged to take a freshman seminar in History (HIST 150), although not taking one in history does not preclude majoring in history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>200-level seminars</head><p>The 200 designation is reserved for intermediate seminars that are somewhat more difficult than freshman seminars. Some are special topics courses offered by visiting instructors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>400-level seminars</head><p>400-level seminars are small courses that involve intensive reading, writing, discussion, and often research.</p><p>HIST 490c/491c ("Capstone Seminar"). In these intensive colloquia, students produce a substantial paper and grapple with evidentiary and historiographical issues at a sophisticated level. These courses are open to all students with some background in the subject-matter of the course. Majors are required to take at least one HIST 490c/491c, and must receive a C or better in it. These courses are excellent preparation for writing a senior honors thesis, and majors are urged to consider taking one in their junior year. The "Capstone Seminar" meets both the major writing and the major computing requirement. Topics vary by semester.</p><p>Lecture courses in History are generally capped at 35. The one major exception is Global History, which is much larger and has discussion sections led by graduate teaching assistants. Lecture courses range from introductory surveys to demanding 300-level courses. Lecture courses may involve class discussions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>100-level lectures</head><p>These are introductory surveys that acquaint students with a broad geographic area over an extended chronological period. They assume little or no prior knowledge of the topic covered, and aim to build a foundation for future study. Students who are new to the study of history at the college level should start here. Students who expect to take upper-level courses in a new area are encouraged to take the 100-level survey that covers that region first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>200-level lectures</head><p>These are intermediate lecture courses designed for students with some background in history, either through AP courses or lower level survey courses taken at the College. Many are geographically or topically narrower than the introductory surveys.</p><p>HIST 299 is the designation for history courses taken abroad and approved for William and Mary history credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>300-level lectures</head><p>These are advanced lecture courses. They assume prior familiarity with the basics of the subject, assign larger quantities of more challenging readings, and expect a greater degree of intellectual sophistication and compositional expertise on students' part. 300-level courses generally pay serious attention to primary sources and to historiographical issues (that is, debates among historians in the field).</p><p>HIST 301 ("The Historian's Craft") is designed for history majors or for students who intend to be history majors. Ideally, they will take this class either in the semester in which they declare their history major, or in the following term. The class will familiarize students with historiographical schools and with the idea of history as a discipline while also covering the arts and techniques of historical writing. It will typically require a final paper demonstrating the use of reason, evidence, compositional skills, and scholarly apparatus. HIST 214 -The Era of Jamestown Credits: <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> The seventeenth century in the Chesapeake Region.

The region's past helped shape and was shaped by many of the contradictory themes defining modern history: slavery and freedom, racism and equality, empire and independence, despotism and democracy, and migration and transnationalism. Focusing on Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and especially Haiti and Cuba, we will explore these themes in Caribbean history from the Haitian Revolution to the present. The course is structured around class discussion. Grading will be based on brief papers and class participation. Given the immense diversity of Asian Pacific American communities, we cannot offer an exhaustive history in one semester.

Students will learn to use freely-available phonetics software to examine, measure, and analyze human speech sounds. The acoustic differences between different speech sounds, such as what distinguishes consonants from vowels, will be introduced and explored. We'll look at how both the length and the articulation of a sound can often be different in ways we're not conscious of but that we can find, measure, and then quantify using statistical software that's free through W&amp;M. We'll examine what influences people's perceptions of sounds: that in some cases humans can perceive two very different sounds as the same and in other cases can perceive two very similar sounds as quite different. There are no prerequisites for this course.</p></div>

Students will learn about the different components of the ocean including its sea floor, chemical constituents, physical dynamics, and organisms -through discipline-specific and interdisciplinary courses. The minor is jointly offered and administered by the School of Marine Science (SMS)/Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS) and Arts &amp; Sciences. As one of the leading marine research and education institutions in the United States, SMS/VIMS has a critical role and responsibility to provide high-quality information and educational resources concerning the marine environment to all segments of society in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the U.S. The undergraduate minor in marine science addresses the growing national demand for undergraduate education in the earth and environmental sciences in general, and in the marine sciences specifically.</p><p>Students pursuing a minor in Marine Science are required to take 18 credits of coursework. Two introductory courses (6 credits total) are required: MSCI 330 and MSCI 331. The remaining credits are divided between electives and upper level courses in the sub-disciplines of marine sciences. An alternative field-based marine science course can be substituted for this field studies course with permission from the Program Co-Directors. We recommend that marine science minors take the Field Studies course during the summer following their freshman or sophomore year and before taking any of the Fundamentals of Marine Science courses. A menu of elective courses provides opportunities for students to explore their specific interests in marine science, and the fundamentals courses provide an indepth study of three of the biological and physical subdisciplines of marine sciences. Students pursuing the minor in Marine Science are encouraged to take some electives courses before enrolling in the fundamentals courses.</p><p>Declaration Process: To be eligible for a minor in Marine Science, students must have completed, or currently be taking, the required introductory course, MSCI 330. To declare, students must meet with one of the co-directors of the Marine Science Minor Program and submit a declaration form to the Registrar's office.</p></div>

For option 1 in MATH 400, the student just needs to register for this course. For options 2 and 3, the student should first communicate with a faculty member about supervising the honors thesis or writing project. The student can then register for the course in a section corresponding to the faculty member who has agreed to supervise the student. Note that the MATH 400 option above is a standard course which meets regularly, while the other two options are individually supervised and do not have a lecture component. For students In the Pre-College Mathematics Teaching Concentration, the writing requirement must incorporate some element of the history of mathematics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Proficiency Requirements:</head><p>A student in any Mathematics major concentration must show proficiency in some high-level computer programming language at the level of CSCI 140 or CSCI 141. This is normally done by receiving a grade of at least C-in CSCI 140 or CSCI 141. Exceptions require the department chair's permission.</p><p>In addition, students in the Applied Concentration must demonstrate proficiency at the level of CSCI 241. This is normally done by taking and passing this course.</p><p>Enriching the Mathematics Major:</p><p>The requirements described below are the minimal requirements for the mathematics major, and most mathematics majors take courses beyond that minimum. Students wishing to obtain a deeper understanding of mathematics (e.g., in preparation for graduate school) should take additional upperdivision courses. Second courses to make year-long sequences in linear algebra, analysis, abstract algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, or operations research are particularly recommended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Standard Mathematics Concentration</head><p>This is the most flexible of the three concentrations, allowing the widest choice of electives. Students who are considering graduate study often pursue this concentration, as do some students aiming for pre-college teaching, but the flexible requirements of the concentration are also appropriate for students with other goals. The major requirements of the Standard Concentration are:</p><p>A Core Consisting Of:</p><p>• MATH 111 -Calculus I Credits: <ref type="formula">(4)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements:</head><p>Completing the major writing requirement and computer proficiency requirement as described above;</p><p>• MATH 307 -Abstract Algebra Credits: <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> • MATH 311 -Elementary Analysis Credits: <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> • MATH 495 -Honors Credits: <ref type="formula">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Standing</head><p>Entering students may receive credit for mathematics courses through AP or IB and transfer credit. In each of the mathematics major concentrations, well-prepared students may begin their studies beyond MATH 111 without receiving credit for earlier courses listed in the core requirements section of each concentration. Each skipped course for which the student does not receive credit must be replaced by an additional three-credit 300-400 level mathematics course. <ref type="bibr">Credits: (4)</ref> College Curriculum: COLL 100 The courses will explore ideas central to the evolution of mathematics and its application. Students will actively participate in the development of ideas explored in the courses. Some courses will require good high-school mathematics background. Sample topics might include Limits and Infinity, Linearity, Coding and Cryptanalysis, Geometry and Physics of Archimedes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Commissioning</head><p>The Department of Military Science and Leadership offers two, three, and four year programs that will qualify students for commissioning as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. General requirements for commissioning include: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obligations</head><p>A non-scholarship student incurs no obligation to the military by participating in freshman or sophomore Military Science and Leadership courses (MLSC 100 and 200-level courses). These courses offer a student the opportunity to evaluate the prospect of military service and to qualify for the Advanced Course beginning in the junior year. When a cadet enters the Advanced Course, he or she contracts and is obligated to accept a commission, if offered, as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army upon graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Career Placement: Active Duty and Reserve Forces Duty</head><p>All commissioned officers incur an initial eight-year obligation. ROTC cadets have a choice of requesting Active Duty or Reserve Forces Duty. The difference between the two options is listed below:</p><p>1. Active Duty. The first three to four years are served on active duty, with the remaining four to five years served in the Reserves. 2. Reserve Forces Duty (Army National Guard or U.S. Army Reserve). Newly commissioned officers may enter active duty for approximately 90 days to attend a branch-specific Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC) and serve out the remainder of their eight year obligation in the Reserves while pursuing a civilian career. Cadets may choose to guarantee this option prior to entrance into the junior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of Courses</head><p>Note: No more than eight of the Military Science credits count toward the 120 credits needed for graduation. The remaining four credits will appear on the student's official transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Courses</head><p>The following Military Science Basic Courses are designed for freshmen and sophomores: MLSC 101, MLSC 102, MLSC 201 and MLSC 202. The Basic Courses introduce freshmen and sophomores to the fundamentals of leadership and management while they learn about the opportunities and prospects of ROTC and commissioned service. Students complete these courses without service obligation (except Languages (TESOL). In addition to beginning, intermediate and advanced language courses, MDLL also offers instruction in the analysis of literature, film and culture taught both in the foreign languages and in English. In collaboration with the Global Education office in the Reves Center, MDLL sponsors summer, semester and yearlong study abroad programs in more than ten countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. On campus, interested students may choose to live in one of eight Language Houses, where native speaker Resident Tutors provide an opportunity for informal language learning, organize an active schedule of cultural events conducted in the target language and serve as a source of information on their native countries.</p><p>While the study of modern languages, literatures and cultures has always been a cornerstone of the liberal arts experience, the mission of MDLL at William and Mary includes preparing students for graduate and professional training in a wide range of disciplines, among which are foreign and comparative literature, cultural studies, language teaching, international studies and relations, business, law and government service. Many of our students combine the study of one or more modern languages with majors such as Art History, Biology, Government, Global Studies, History, International Relations, Linguistics or Business. </p></div>

For more information regarding study abroad, see the Reves Center website.  <ref type="bibr">Domain (Reaching Out)</ref>: ALV Students will examine the relationship between the sounds of words and phrases and their meanings. Starting with an examination of Saussure's claim that the relation between sound and meaning is "arbitrary" (one of the foundational principles of modern linguistics), the course will examine data which seem to contradict this claim, and will explore the implications of this for linguistics and language study, as well as its treatment in several different fields and theoretical frameworks including psychology, anthropology, and phenomenology. Following this, the course will examine the cultural effects of this phenomenon, including the exploitation of sound-meaning correspondences in a wide variety of cultural activities: classical poetry (both English and Arabic), mysticism, magic, modern literary practice (both English language (Joyce, Manley-Hopkins) and popular Arabic songs and poetry, as well as its possible application in industry related activities. The ultimate goal of the course is to give students a more nuanced view of sound-meaning correspondences, and to develop a sense of the power of sound in influencing the comprehension of meaning in a wide variety of contexts. Any student who has studied 3 years or more of Arabic as a first or second language or who has studied in an Arabic University in which the language of classes was in Arabic, will need the instructor's permission to enroll.

Therefore, the U.S. government has identified Chinese as a "critical-need language" that is crucial to maintaining the interests of peace and prosperity both here and abroad.</p><p>However, China and its Sinophone communities around the world are also home to one of the longest continuing civilizations, a heritage that has been kept alive through a love of and reverence for received texts and culture. This engagement with tradition has contributed to an unbroken sense of cultural identity despite periods of war, foreign conquest and turmoil. China is thus an entryway to one of humanity's richest troves of cultural, literary and philosophical ideas, artifacts and debates.</p><p>Our undergraduate program in Chinese trains students in all levels of Chinese language so they can become proficient and freely use the language in conversation, research and professional communication.</p><p>In addition, our content courses aim to immerse students in all facets of Chinese culture and civilization, both across the deep time of millennia and in the pressing challenges of the modern era. We believe that students who wish to engage with China, either economically, politically or academically, are best served when they have been trained in both language and culture.</p><p>Our undergraduate major has steadily grown with each passing year, and many of our students combine a concentration in Chinese with a major in another field, such as International Relations, Business, Government and the sciences. We also offer a minor, and many of our offerings fulfill requirements for the East Asian Studies major.</p><p>To broaden face-to-face cultural understanding, we facilitate study abroad programs to China for both the summer and the year. Our Chinese Language House, a residence for students interested in practicing Chinese year round, hosts a number of cultural events for the campus community at large.</p><p>We are a growing, vibrant and increasingly vital component of academic and cultural life here at William &amp; Mary.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Hispanic Studies Program</head><p>Our approach to Hispanic Studies transcends the traditional courses of Spanish studies that are limited to only literature and language. Our faculty believe that it is through the study of diverse forms of cultural production (film, art, popular culture, journalism) that students become fluent and learn about significant political and historical events, complex socio-cultural issues, and community engagement.</p><p>Our program also offers a number of opportunities for students to conduct faculty-mentored field research. Some students choose to do so through study abroad through our faculty-led summer program in Cadiz, Spain. For this program, students develop projects supervised by W&amp;M faculty and take courses at a local university. Additional programming includes walking along Spain's famed Camino de Santiago as part of Pilgrimage Studies or enrolling in a service-learning course to Teach English in elementary schools in Nicaragua. We also offer two semester-long William &amp; Mary programs, one in Seville, Spain, and another in La Plata, Argentina, that include internships and service-learning opportunities along with courses in literature, art, contemporary culture, and language. These are signature programs developed by William and Mary faculty for our students in collaboration with our international partners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major in Hispanic Studies</head><p>Students may declare a major at W&amp;M after completion of 39 credit hours. To declare a Hispanic Studies concentration (major), you should download a Declaration of Major Form and request a meeting with the Hispanic Studies professor you would like to serve as your advisor. Prior to your advising meeting, complete the first page of the major form. Your professor will assist you in completing the rest of the form and sign off on your academic plan of study. You will then turn in the completed copy to the Office of the Registrar, Blow Hall.</p><p>Many Hispanic Studies concentrators declare two majors, often combining their Spanish language skills and their research background in Hispanic literary and cultural studies with a second major in another area. Combining Hispanic Studies with majors in the sciences, social sciences, business, education, or international relations can prove to be particularly useful for our students -well-trained in linguistic proficiency and cultural competency -who are interested in careers related to global markets, public service in either government-sponsored or NGO programs, the fine arts, teaching and research, law, and medical and health-related fields.</p></div>

This course introduces students to one of the most significant developments in Italian arts and etters in recent decades: the emergence of postcolonial, migrant, second-generation and otherwise newly intercultural Italian literature. Throughout the semester we will trace the history of this ever-growing body of work, often broadly (and, as we will explore, problematically) referred to as letteratura migrante in Italian. We will start with its introductory phase in the 1990s, then focus on post-millenial texts. We will also necessarily ground our study in Italy's colonial history, its transition throughout the twentieth-century from a country of emigration to one of immigration, and its emerging identity as a multicultural nation. While we will read select essays on postcolonial theory and Italian migration in English, all primary course readings and discussions will be in Italian. course, we will try to answer these and other questions by looking at the cultural, social, and political phenomenon of Italian Fascism from its origin in the late 1910s to its demise in the mid 1940s. We will study the genesis of Fascism as an Italian phenomenon by looking at the literary sources (propaganda essays, novels, pamphlets, journal articles), films <ref type="bibr">(The old guard 1934</ref><ref type="bibr">, The Conformist 1961</ref> and documentaries produced at the time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy Program</head><p>The department, through a varied and extensive program of courses, presents students with past and present attempts to think critically and reflectively about fundamental questions of knowledge and value in order that they will be led to examine their own views. The study of philosophical problems in the spirit of free inquiry requires the student to develop and exercise the powers of precise discrimination, creative imagination, logical organization and evaluative judgment.</p><p>Several sections of the introductory course are offered. A large number of middle-level courses are offered to meet the needs of students who wish to take courses that might be particularly relevant to their own field or major. (Many philosophy courses are particularly suited to the needs of students with interdisciplinary majors.) The department also offers specialized and intensive courses of a historical, methodological and systematic character for those students who wish to major in philosophy. A major may serve as a preparation for graduate study, or, as is more usually the case, as a sound foundation for a liberal education. Many majors go into professions such as law, where training in philosophical analysis is particularly advantageous.  <ref type="table">)</ref>: CSI, NQR This course is an introduction to some of the ethical and societal problems that are posed by recent developments in data science, artificial intelligence, and the pervasiveness of the Internet in everyday life. The course begins by introducing students to the nature of information and data, to two major normative ethical theories (consequentialism and deontology), and to some common biases and fallacies concerning probability and statistics. We will then explore moral issues concerning privacy and freedom in connection with big data and the Internet. What, if anything, justifies the right to privacy? How does privacy relate to autonomy and to property rights? Are traditional justifications of the right to privacy still adequate in the age of big data and social media? How does the right to freedom of speech interact with "echo chambers" and the spread of disinformation online? The course concludes by surveying a number of ethical problems posed by machine learning and artificial intelligence, such as: Should machine learning algorithms be transparent or interpretable by humans? How do biases arise in algorithms, and how can they be prevented or corrected? How do we make sense of questions of moral accountability in cases in which machines are autonomous? How will automation affect the nature of human labor, and how will it affect inequality? Should we be worried about the creation of a "superintelligence" that could destroy humanity? </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physics Program</head><p>Traditionally, many physics undergraduates continue in graduate school in pursuit of Ph.D. degrees in physics or engineering. Previous students who have completed a physics major also enter a variety of other fields, including among many others, archaeology, astronomy and astrophysics, biology, mathematics, computer science, high school teaching, law, medicine, environmental sciences, operations research, technical sales, industrial management, engineering and oceanography. Because physicists are scientific generalists, undergraduate work in physics followed by specialization in other areas has become one of the preferred preparations for many activities that are setting new directions in society. The requirements for major in physics are relatively flexible, and are designed to prepare people for either graduate work in physics or for later specialization in other areas.</p><p>Information on the program can be obtained through the World Wide Web at the address www.wm.edu/physics.</p></div>

It emphasizes quantitative and economic analysis, the study of political institutions that produce policy, and the examination of specific policy areas such as environment and health. The Public Policy major draws on coursework primarily from Economics and Government, but also on courses in Psychology, Sociology, Law, Philosophy, and others. Graduates from the undergraduate Public Policy program pursue a wide array of careers in public service, policymaking and politics, finding employment in governments at all levels, consulting firms that work with governmental clients, regulated industries as well as non-profits. Public Policy graduates regularly pursue graduate studies in business administration, economics, environmental studies, health policy and administration, law, political science, psychology, public administration, public policy analysis, social work, sociology and urban affairs. In addition to preparing Public Policy majors to be participants in the policy process, an important goal is also to teach students to be well-informed, capable citizens.</p><p>In addition to the interdisciplinary major, the Public Policy offers other opportunities for students interested in public policy, such as:</p></div>

The course's aim is to use comparison across cultures, traditions, and methodologies to arrive at a deepened understanding of religion that challenges both rationalist reductionism and dogmatic fundamentalism. We will explore key themes across world religious traditions (e.g., myth, ritual, belief, religious experience, gender and sexuality, ethics, and understandings of salvation, scripture, and the natural world) while also learning about the distinctly Western and colonial origins of modern understandings of religion(s). The specific religious traditions and themes explored may vary from semester to semester. No prerequisites. : CSI This course is designed to engage students with some of the key topics and seminal moments in the history of Christianity. We will begin with the life of Jesus and the competing stories that surrounded it. We will end with contemporary issues that involve Christianity and will discuss some of the grand theories of religion in the broad context of modern globalization. Thus, the course will move through two consecutive parts. In the first part, we will cover early forms of Christianity, major theological disputes that involved emperors, bishops, and monks throughout the Mediterranean and into the far East. In the following part, we will bring the story of Christianity to current times and will discuss the relevance of Christianity to such highly contested topics as the future of Europe, American political life and culture, progressive secularization, and unification of culture throughout the world.  <ref type="table">)</ref>: CSI This is an introductory level, lecture-based, yet interactive, course that explores the complex, everyday intersections between religious beliefs and ideas on the one hand and ethical reasoning and behavior on the other, across a variety of religious traditions. The course examines ethical issues cross-culturally and from a variety of disciplinary approaches including philosophical, theological, anthropological, psychological, philological and others. While this is not a comparative religions class, we will try our best, given constraints of time, to familiarize ourselves with some of the core beliefs, practices and ethical foundations of some of the major (most widely followed) religious traditions of the world.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELG 211 -Introduction to the History of Jewish</head><p>Throughout the course, we will examine texts, interpretations, arguments and cultural practices of various religious communities and reflect about what they offer us as resources, and challenges, for thinking about the best way to live a happy and meaningful human life. The ethical teachings of religious traditions will invite and challenge us to carefully, critically and emphatically examine the different ways in which religious traditions have shaped everyday human life across the globe in the past and continue to do so today.

In short, this class is a window onto the range of ways in which Muslims in different cultural and social settings have reasoned about a good life. We will read a wide range of primary and scholarly sources to examine how Muslims justify particular moral positions, the values they hold dear and the variety of ways in which, and methods by which, they conceptualize a flourishing human life at the personal, social, cultural and political levels. We will try to understand how Muslims argue about things that matter to them as religious and moral beings. We shall learn about the legal, philosophical, moral, political and exegetical dimensions of their individual and communal lives. We will do this by focusing on a limited range of important ethical topics such as war and conflict, political governance, the environment, gender, sex and marriage, biomedical issues, inter-faith relations and others. Throughout, we will think comparatively about how Muslim understandings and behaviors about such issues challenge, contradict or deepen other ways of reasoning about the good life. ALV This seminar will examine some of the most profound and influential writings about love from the Islamic intellectual and poetic traditions. Perhaps more than any other civilization, the literary and philosophical traditions of Islamic civilization have been "love-centric." In this course we will closely read and discuss various philosophies and theories of love from the mundane to the mystical. Through readings and discussions of the works of Ibn Hazm, 'Attar, al-Ghazali, Ibn al-Farid, Rumi, Amir Khusro, Ibn 'Arabi, Hafez and more, students will become familiar with the various "schools of love" of human consciousness; issues surrounding the method, practice, and ideology of science; and intersections of religion, magic, and science in neuroscience, quantum physics, paranormal phenomenon, and popular culture. We will discuss contemporary debates and controversies surrounding Yoga and Tantra, while also investigating the origins of these traditions and how they came to be perceived and practiced in the way they are today. Special attention will be given to: key primary texts of the Hindu yogic traditions; the different historical forms of yogic and tantric meditation, asceticism, and "magic;" colonial/orientalist perceptions of these traditions; and the intertwined roles of consumer culture, scientism, and "spirituality" in modern yoga. The course is anchored in an investigation of larger theoretical questions regarding the (ritual) use of the body and altered forms of consciousness in religious-spiritual practices of disciplining and transforming the self. Additional topics may include: traditional Buddhist and modern-day secular practices of mindfulness; sexuality and transgression in yogic-tantric practice; the role of the guru in South Asian yogic and tantric traditions; the influence of Yoga and Tantra in modern occultism and the Human Potential Movement; psychedelic drugs and mystical experience; and the links between yoga and Hindu nationalism in modern-day India.  <ref type="bibr">Domain (Reaching Out)</ref>: NQR This course will examine modern Buddhists' claims on cosmology, the individual, and the nature of consciousness, investigating the strategies Buddhists utilize to construct and negotiate the boundaries between Religion and Science. We will draw material from across the Asian Buddhist world, analyzing debates between Śri Lankan monks and Christian missionaries on the structure of the universe, Tibetan and western efforts to demonstrate the compatibility between the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness and quantum physics, and the contemporary attempt to map Buddhist meditators' brains. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Buddhism; we will study classical Buddhist perspectives at every turn.</p></div>

Course may be repeated for credit Mission. The Joint Programme melds the best aspects of two academic traditions, while offering to students a greater range of academic choices and the opportunity to acquire direct knowledge of two distinct intellectual and national cultures. Existing degree programs in each institution are designed according to contrasting principles: William &amp; Mary offers a broad Liberal Arts education with a majority of study hours devoted to subjects outside the major; St Andrews offers less breadth in a degree characterized by increasing depth in a single discipline. The aim of the curricula in each of the six disciplines will be to offer more breadth than a traditional St Andrews degree as well as more specialization than is usual at William &amp; Mary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University of St. Andrews Joint Degree Programme</head><p>Programs. The six participating disciplines at William &amp; Mary have identified significant complementarities with St Andrews. By effectively pooling faculty and courses in Classical Studies, Economics, English, Film Studies, History, and International Relations, the two institutions can offer students a broad range of new academic options unavailable at either institution alone or on traditional study abroad programs. Individual program requirements and William &amp; Mary course offerings are explained below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to the Joint Programme</head><p>Students apply to the Joint Programme through either William &amp; Mary or St Andrews; they may not apply to the Joint Programme through both institutions. Students apply simultaneously for general admission to William &amp; Mary and for specific admission to the Joint Programme. Applications are due by January 1.</p><p>Students may apply early decision to William &amp; Mary, but there is no early admission application to the Joint Degree Programme. Early decision applicants who would also like to be considered for admission to the Joint Degree Programme may submit the Supplement, but the decision for the Joint Degree Programme will not be made until April. Any applicant who accepts an early decision offer will be committed to William &amp; Mary, but may still enroll later in the Joint Degree Programme if admitted.</p><p>Because students must spend two full years at each institution and because of the continuance standards specified below, transfer credits from other universities will not be accepted, nor will credits from IB, AP, etc. (but see below). There can be no concurrent courses, admission during senior year of high school, FlexTrack, or admission as a non-degree seeking student.</p><p>The institution to which the student is admitted is the home institution and the one at which the student will spend year one; the other institution is the host institution and the one at which the student will spend year two. Students' interests and courses of study will determine at which institution they spend years three and four, but they must spend one of those years at each institution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer from William &amp; Mary into the Joint Programme:</head><p>First-year students at William &amp; Mary may apply to transfer into the Joint Programme no later than March 1st of Spring semester. Students applying for a first-year transfer will have to demonstrate that they are on track to complete 30 credit hours at William &amp; Mary (not counting AP, IB, transfer, etc.) before they begin their second year at St Andrews; and they must consult with the appropriate major advisor about enrolling in the appropriate first-year courses in the major during both semesters.</p><p>William &amp; Mary students who apply to the Joint Programme after their first year will be admitted only under extraordinary circumstances and with the consent of both W&amp;M and St Andrews; such students will still have to complete two years each at William &amp; Mary and St Andrews, and so will very likely require five years to complete their requirements. Students transferring from William &amp; Mary into the Joint Programme may have to pay an additional entrance fee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer from the Joint Programme into William &amp; Mary or St Andrews:</head><p>• Students admitted into the Joint Programme through William &amp; Mary (i.e., whose "home" institution is William &amp; Mary) may, at their request, become regular degree-seeking students at the university provided they meet the normal requirements for continuance. • Students admitted through William &amp; Mary or through St Andrews who wish to become regular degree-seeking students at St Andrews must petition to transfer, and they will be required to apply via St Andrews' normal admissions process. • All transfers of W&amp;M home students from the Joint Programme to either William &amp; Mary or <ref type="bibr">St</ref> Andrews become effective at the beginning of the semester after the student receives permission or admission to transfer. to discuss their transfer plans. This meeting can be scheduled prior to applying to transfer or after the application is submitted. 3. In order for St. Andrews home students to be competitive in William &amp; Mary's transfer applicant pool, it is recommended that students have a minimum cumulative program GPA of 3.0.</p><p>Readmission: Students whose home institution is William &amp; Mary, who are in good standing in the Programme per the continuance standards below, but who have not been in attendance for one or more semesters must submit an application for readmission to the Dean of Students Office. Normal deadlines apply; however, readmission is contingent upon discussion with and the recommendation of the Academic Director and the consent of both institutions.</p><p>Summer School: Joint Programme students may take summer school courses for credit only at William &amp; Mary (including W&amp;M Summer Study Abroad).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Financial Aid.</head><p>Financial aid for Joint Programme students is administered in the same way as it is for regular W&amp;M students. In most cases, we are able to meet the full need of Virginia students. The maximum grant for nonresident students is capped at one-quarter of the full cost of education.</p><p>Tuition and Other Expenses. The fee for the Joint Degree Programme is $40,990 for the academic year 2019-20, to be charged at $20,495 each semester. This amount covers tuition and fees with the exception of the following:</p><p>Residence Hall fees and room damage deposit Meal Plan fees Orientation fee(s) Special instructional fees (music, labs, art, activity courses) Books and printing fees Fines, returned check, and other penalty fees Parking Transportation Summer School tuition Personal Expenses</p><p>Because of the nature of this Joint Programme, there is no tuition differential based on domicile (for example, there is no in-state tuition rate for Virginia residents). Detailed information on these fees and other tuition policies can be found in the "Tuition and Other Expenses" chapter of this catalog or on the Bursar's Office website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Regulations</head><p>Academic Advising. Students whose home institution is William &amp; Mary (and host students once they arrive at William &amp; Mary) will be assigned to the Joint Programme advisor in their major; the individual program's designated major advisor will advise the student during both years in residence at the W&amp;M and, via email, when the student is at St Andrews. First-year students are required to attend three advising meetings during each registration period and before they will be permitted to register. Second-year students (i.e., those for whom William &amp; Mary is the host institution) are also required to attend three advising meetings: one when they arrive, one before they register for their second semester, and one at the start of the second semester to determine where they will spend their third and fourth years. Students must also meet with their major advisor at the start of the academic year in which they return to William &amp; Mary, and, if they return for their third year, again before they register for their second semester and before they register for their fourth year. These are minimal requirements; students are encouraged to meet regularly with their Joint Programme major advisor when they are in residence and to communicate via email when they are at St Andrews. Repeated courses: Any course in which a student receives an "F" or a "W" or a "V" may be repeated for a grade (grades of "W" are given only at W&amp;M); however, students should be aware that these grades will make it very difficult to meet continuance standards.</p><p>Incomplete Grades: Grades of "Incomplete" (or "D" at St Andrews) require the approval of the instructor; students must complete outstanding essential coursework while they are still in residence at the institution at which they took the course.</p><p>Pass/Fail and Audit: Although Joint Programme students may elect to audit a William and Mary course or to take one Pass/Fail, such courses will not count toward credits for the Joint Degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuance Standards</head><p>The following are the recommended standards for continuance for Joint Programme students: *Normally, students may take below 15 credits per semester only when they are in residence at William &amp; Mary and when they have devised a plan with their major advisor to make up the credits before beginning the next academic year. Students in residence at St. Andrews are expected to complete 120 (30) credits each year (but see Appeal to Progression to the Third Year below).</p><p>**By the end of their fourth semester, students must have accumulated 60 (240) credits, must have passed with a D <ref type="bibr" target="#b881">(7)</ref> or better, on their first attempt, all courses in their major subject or required for the major, and earned an average of a C+ (or an 11 at St Andrews) on their first attempt in the following 2nd year courses (Honours Entry courses at St Andrews and their WM equivalents:</p><p>Classical Studies.

Students in residence at W&amp;M who have not met the continuance standards for the regular track at the end of a semester will be required to participate in the Academic Intervention Program.</p><p>*Nevertheless, students in residence whose performance at the end of the semester falls below the continuance standards listed above will receive notice from the Academic Director and will be required to meet with the major advisor and the Dean of Students Office to discuss strategies and services available.</p><p>Students on probation who do not meet the continuance standards by the end of the academic year will be suspended from William &amp; Mary and asked to leave the Joint Programme; if they are home students, they may apply for reinstatement to William &amp; Mary but they may not be reinstated into the Joint Programme. See policies for "Continuance" and "Reinstatement" at the front of this Catalog.</p><p>Continuance Standard, Successful Completion of Studies: If, at the end of the add-drop period in any given semester at William &amp; Mary, a student has dropped or failed to enroll in (a) prerequisite(s) necessary for that student to continue in his or her program, or in the final semester a course required to graduate, that student may be administratively dropped from the Joint Programme.</p><p>If, at the end of any given semester, a student's performance makes continuance in the Joint Programme impossible (for example, because the student lacks the prerequisites to advance, or fails in the final semester a course required to graduate), that student may be administratively dropped from the Joint Programme.</p><p>(An exception may be made if the student plans to attend summer school and has a note from the major advisor agreeing to the plan and assuring that the necessary courses will be offered, OR if the student receives an exemption per the procedures in " Exemptions from Degrees" below.)</p><p>Continuance Standards, progression, Years 1 and 2: During the first two ("sub-honours") years, students are expected to carry at least 30 WM/120 StA hours per year. Of those, 25 WM/100 StA hours must be earned at each institution. The remaining 10 WM/40 StA hours may be taken at either institution, including William &amp; Mary summer school or summer study abroad. Courses chosen in Year 2 should show progression: students studying at St. Andrews in Year 2 will typically take at least 80 (StA) credits at the 2000 level, and students studying at William &amp; Mary will typically take at least 20 (W&amp;M) credits at or above the 200 level.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Joint Degree Program in English</head><p>The Joint Degree Program in English Language and Literature allows students to gain from both the St Andrews in-depth and progressive approach to the study of English and the more broad-based and interdisciplinary William &amp; Mary approach. The joint degree program in English provides distinctive opportunities for the development of writing skills, increased sensitivity to language, awareness of the aesthetic and intellectual enjoyments of literature, and an understanding of the cultural values reflected in literature. Students will be exposed to a range of historical periods and critical approaches to literature. They can also take creative writing classes. The program serves students who are seeking to teach; students who are preparing for graduate study in English; students who desire a rich intellectual and aesthetic experience in advance of professional study in fields such as law, medicine and business; and students who choose English simply because they enjoy the disciplined study of literature and language. All English majors in the joint program have the opportunity to work on an independent research project as part of their degree, either by writing a dissertation at <ref type="bibr">St Andrews</ref>  </p></div>

However, our collaboration will also allow students to explore the interrelated fields of television, print, radio, and other media as aesthetic and cultural practices and forms. This study of contemporary and historical media will allow students to understand the way representation affects our understanding of gender, sexuality, national identity, racial and ethnic identities, and the influence of global markets and politics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Facilities</head><p>School of Marine Science students participate in graduate studies at an active, year round research facility with approximately 450 scientists, support technicians and staff. The 35-acre main campus of the School of Marine Science/Virginia Institute of Marine Science (SMS/VIMS) is located in Gloucester Point at the mouth of the York River, a major tributary and natural passageway to the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean. Various service centers and special programs complement and enhance the student's experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Study Programs</head><p>Research at SMS/VIMS emphasizes the study of marine environments from estuaries to the open ocean, with special emphasis on coastal systems. Interdisciplinary programs are encouraged. In addition to teaching and conducting basic research, many faculty members are engaged in applied research of concern to industry and management agencies. Students often find that their assistantship duties and/or research activities offer opportunities that bring them in close contact with other departments at SMS and William &amp; Mary, marine related industries, and state, regional, and federal management agencies.</p><p>Based on the primary academic and research disciplines represented at SMS/VIMS, graduate studies are offered in four major areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Opportunities</head><p>he undergraduate minor in Marine Science, which is jointly offered and administered by the School of Marine Science (SMS)/Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS) and Arts &amp; Sciences, provides interested students a coherent experience in this interdisciplinary field. For additional information, as well as the requirements for this minor, please refer to the Marine Science Minor section of this catalog. Though the courses offered by the School are primarily for graduate students, advanced undergraduates (juniors and seniors) may participate. For instance, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, and Physics majors may enroll in suitable 500-549 lower-level courses with the permission of the instructor. Undergraduates majoring in Chemistry, Geology, Physics, or Biology may work on a marine problem in his or her field of specialization. Consent of the chair of the student's major department is required to take problems courses in marine science.</p><p>As in most marine institutions, field research activities are accelerated in the summer. An opportunity exists, for example, for qualified rising junior and seniors to experience the intellectual stimulations and challenges of marine research through the School's Research and Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, which runs from June through early August. During that period, interns live in a William &amp; Mary residence hall and conduct research at the Gloucester Point campus. Information on applying for the REU program or other summer opportunities at SMS/VIMS is available at the following web address: https://www.vims.edu/education/college/summer_intern/index.php</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparatory Studies</head><p>Students who are interested in pursuing marine science as a profession should consult with their academic advisor or the Associate Dean of Academic Studies, School of Marine Science, early in their college careers to identify an academic program that will prepare them for graduate study in marine science. Students interested in Biological Sciences, Aquatic Health Sciences, or Fisheries Science should have a strong background in basic science, including a suite of contemporary biology courses, physics and chemistry (through organic), and mathematics through calculus and differential equations. The prospective Chemical, Geological or Physical Oceanography student should have an undergraduate degree with appropriate course work in chemistry, geology or related geophysical science, physics, meteorology, mathematics or engineering, and a solid quantitative background. Course work in statistics and competence with computers are particularly important.</p></div>

The research seminar explores the remarkable consequences of technological change for catchup industrialization, multilateral governance, and inter-country and intra-country economic inequality.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Prerequisite(s): (ECON 303 and ECON 304 and ECON 308)</cell></row><row><cell>College Curriculum: ECON 474 -Regional Economic Integration</cell></row><row><cell>Credits: (3)</cell></row><row><cell>Prerequisite(s): ECON 303, ECON 304, ECON 308, and ECON 475.</cell></row><row><cell>College Curriculum: COLL 400</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_167"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>ALV This is an interdisciplinary study of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, including their histories, communities, cultures, socioeconomic development, political organizations, and their relationships with ancestral homelands, other Asian and Pacific Islander diasporas, and their unique roles as Americans on the world stage. CSI Beginning actor training for students who will perform from scripts dramatizing the Asian American community. Scene study involves research and analysis of the script's socio-historical background. The scripts may cover themes such as immigration, colonialism, discriminatory laws, gender stereotypes and hyper-sexualization, the fetish and sex trade, the Japanese American internment, the farm-workers labor movement, the Vietnam War, and Terrorism. Graded course work includes monologue and scene work, analytical and reflective essays, and a public performance celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage. ALV This course offers a broad survey of Asian Pacific American history. Given the immense diversity of Asian Pacific American communities, we cannot offer an exhaustive history in one semester. Instead, we cover a number of major events in Asian Pacific American history and focus on many key concepts in Asian Pacific American Studies. Furthermore, we are interested in Asian Pacific American identity as a social construct, and spend a large amount of time focusing on race discourse. Many of the readings address the ways in which Asian Pacific American racial identity was constructed in American popular culture and law. Other key topics include immigration, exclusion, citizenship, class, and gender. ALV This class examines the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments (Islamophobia) in the United States and compares it to Orientalism, the ideology used to justify Western colonialism during the 19th and 20th centuries. We analyze the relationship between United States' foreign and domestic policies, popular culture, and the mainstreaming of Muslim-baiting rhetoric. In doing so, we will ask whether Islamophobia is new? Is it only the purview of the fringe right-wing in the United States or are Islamophobic stereotypes and precepts shared throughout the political spectrum from liberal to conservative wings of each party? Is it an issue of race linked to American culture and racial history or does it have to do exclusively with American global power, security, and/or a misunderstanding of Islam? To answer whether Islamophobia in the Unites States is something new or just a refurbished paradigm of a bygone-political era, we will also keep a journal noting examples of Islamophobia, Orientalism, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim racism but also ways that it is being rejected. ALV This course is an interdisciplinary survey of the cultural expressions of the Asian American experience in the United States from 1965 to the present. Through literature and film, this course explores the history of immigration in the contexts of the United States' intervention in Southeast Asia and the cultural and social revolution of the 1960s at home. Writers include: Richard Kim, Teresa Cha, Gish Jin and Jhumpa Lahiri. We will also view documentary and feature films. COLL 300 This course focuses on allowing the students to academically process within a classroom setting and build on the experiences, expertise, and cultural knowledge that they acquired during their internship, study abroad, and experience in Asia and the Middle East. CSI Through the use of fictional and other texts, this course will examine how the Asian American is constructed in literary settings that situate this subject in multiple worlds. At several turns the model minority, the perpetual foreigner, or terrorist, how does the Asian American figure in various transnational contexts as represented by fiction? This course will analyze the intersectional constructs of race, gender, class, and sexuality in investigating how Asian Americanness is constituted within and against the concept of the nation. In so doing, the focus will be on texts that engage with colonialism, (im)migration, diaspora, and globalization as markers of identity in perpetual flux. Accordingly, we will attend to how literature characterizes the subjectivity of Asian Americans within the United States as simultaneously American and Other. At the same time, we will also scrutinize how Asian Americanness functions transnationally in literary depictions of racial and national identity at the margins of, and across, notions of inclusion and exclusion. (This course is anchored in the ALV and CSI domains.) Study of colonialism and post-colonialism in literature and cultural contexts ranging from the early modern period to the contemporary moment. Topics vary but may include literary representations of nationalism, transnationalism, diaspora, displacement, identity politics, and political activism in metropole and colony. If there is no duplication of topic, may be repeated for credit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance</head><p>The Dance Program emphasizes the creative process within a liberal arts setting by providing an environment to stimulate inventive thinking through the language of dance. Students are provided with major opportunities to produce original choreographic work through two main stage concerts and one studio concert each year. Dance offerings include cross-listings in Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian Studies, and Film Studies. Many students study dance for the first time at William and Mary, while others build on previous training. Students pursue studies in dance to develop artistry, performance skills, leadership ability, and critical thinking skills which are essential in many professions and provide a foundation for graduate work and careers in dance.</p><p>A Placement Evaluation to determine technique level is offered during orientation week in the fall. Students will be assigned to the technique level for which they are qualified on the basis of previous background and demonstrated technical ability. Those students who place at the 300-level or above will receive exemption for GER 6 (No credit). Enrollment Statuses. All Joint Programme students must maintain full-time status, with the extraordinary exception of a student forced to take a medical underload (see below). "Full time" at William &amp; Mary is defined as a minimum of 12 credits per semester (15 credits is the norm). "Full-time" at St Andrews is in most cases 60 credits (15 W&amp;M credits) per semester. While at William and Mary, Joint Programme students are permitted to take as few as 12 credits per semester, but only in consultation with their Advisor, as Joint Programme students must have earned 60 W&amp;M credits (240 St Andrews credits) by the end of their second-year Spring semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs and Course Descriptions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs</head><p>In exceptional circumstances, a student may petition for a medical underload; such petitions will also require the approval of the Academic Director, the Medical Review Committee, and the consent of both institutions. Because underloads might make it difficult to meet continuance standards, only underloads for medical reasons will be possible in the Joint Programme.</p><p>Withdrawal or Medical Withdrawal (or Leave) from the Programme is possible consistent with the procedures at the institution in which the student is in residence (students in residence at W&amp;M can find those procedures under "Registration and Withdrawal " in this Catalog). The student shall, if at all possible, first discuss the withdrawal with the Academic Director and the Dean of Students Office and should be aware that withdrawal might make it difficult to meet continuance standards. Students awarded withdrawal or leave can only be readmitted/reinstated to the institution where the student plans to recommence studies in the Joint Programme, per that institution's requirements; only then may readmission/reinstatement to the Joint Programme be granted per agreement of both institutions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>W&amp;M to St Andrews</head><p>William &amp; Mary Letter Grade Quality Points (W&amp;M)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>St Andrews Numeric Grade</head><p>Joint Programme students may count only two introductory statistics courses from either institution toward the Joint Degree.</p><p>Joint Programme students may apply 3 credits of internship toward the degree.</p><p>Exemption from degree requirements: Requests for exemption from any Joint Programme degree requirements must be presented to and approved by the student's major advisor, and must be supported by documentation (for example, by a letter from a physician). Requests will go to the Committee on Degrees at William &amp; Mary and must also be approved by the relevant administrators at St Andrews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Specific Requirements</head><p>Joint Programme students are required to complete the university's foreign language, writing, and major computing proficiencies and a first-year seminar (COLL 150). All William &amp; Mary home students in their first year, and host students from StA at W&amp;M in their second year, will take a 1-credit course in the Fall that will prepare them for the academic culture at W&amp;M. W&amp;M first year home students will also take, in the Spring semester of their first year, a 1-credit course that will prepare them for their first year abroad.</p><p>Joint Programme students will work with their major advisors to choose courses that satisfy the knowledge objectives that underlie William &amp; Mary's existing general education requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge objectives:</head><p>An understanding of the world of nature; An understanding of individual and social behavior; A general historical knowledge of Western civilization; An acquaintance with a non-Western cultural tradition; A general knowledge of masterworks, genres and movements in art, music, and literature; A general knowledge of major philosophical and religious systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Requirements: First Year at W&amp;M</head><p>• CLCV 217 -Greek Archaeology and Art Credits: <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> • CLCV 218 -Roman Archaeology and Art Credits: <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> • CLCV 227 -History of Ancient Greece Credits: <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Joint Degree Program in Film Studies</head><p>Note: FMST is the prefix for Film &amp; Media Studies courses at W&amp;M; FM is the prefix for Film Studies courses at St Andrews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required Credit Hours:</head><p>• 58 credits toward the major, at least 21 of which are completed at W&amp;M • Progression in Years 3 and 4: Students must earn 60 (WM)/240 (StA) credits, at least 45 (WM)/180 (StA) in Honours courses -that is, courses in the major at the 300(0) -400(0) level. Students must take 30/120 credits at each university. Of the total 60/240, 22.5/90 should be at the 4000 level at St. Andrews, or at the equivalent level at W&amp;M.* Normally, no more than 7.5/30 credits below the 300 level may be taken in a single Honours year. *Some 300 level courses at W&amp;M will count towards this requirement. See your major advisor for a list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Computing Requirement:</head><p>The major computing requirement is satisfied by FM 2002 at St Andrews or FMST 302 at W&amp;M.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Writing Requirement:</head><p>A student who satisfies all requirements for the Film Studies major will also satisfy the Major Writing Requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Requirements:</head><p>All Film Studies majors in the joint program are required to take the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Year</head><p>At William &amp; Mary:</p><p>• FMST 250 -Introduction to Film and Media Studies Credits: <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> • FMST 310 -World Cinema before TV <ref type="formula">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Years Three and Four</head><p>In years 3 &amp; 4, students must satisfy the following distribution requirements in the major (some of these distribution requirements may be satisfied in year 2 at W&amp;M, but students will still need to meet the 45 credit total required in years <ref type="bibr">3 &amp; 4)</ref>:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Language Information</head><p>• Students must complete successfully at least four courses in a single language: two courses in year 1 of the program, and two courses in year 2 at the partner institution (all courses must be taught in the target language-no courses in translation). • Language courses taken prior to matriculation into the Joint Degree Programme do not count toward this requirement. • Courses must build on each other and, if students are continuing with a language studied in high school, must begin at/above the level completed prior to matriculation into the Joint Degree Programme. • Students are strongly encouraged, though not required, to continue language study beyond the required courses in order to build toward genuine linguistic and cultural fluency, and are particularly encouraged to explore courses at and above the 300-/3000 level. Honours-level language courses taken during years 3 and/or 4 of the program may be counted toward the required honours-level courses in the major. • In rare cases, students may be permitted to switch to a new language during or after year 1 of the program. In such cases they must complete four progressive courses in the new language. Students who have not been able to complete the requirement by the end of year 2 may be able to complete any remaining modules/courses during year 3.</p><p>At St Andrews, students will typically take sub-honors courses in years 1 or 2, and honors-level courses in years 3 or 4. Students will discuss the level of courses they take at W&amp;M with the advisor, depending on their backgrounds in history and language, and to ensure that they complete the requisite number of upper-division courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Relations, BA (International Honours)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Joint Degree Program in International Relations</head><p>The International Relations major in the Joint Degree Programme at the University of St Andrews and the College of William &amp; Mary builds on the distinctive strengths of both universities. Students will master the most important theoretical approaches to the study of world politics, and they will learn how the international system operates as well as the major challenges it faces. Majors in the program will take courses from a range of disciplines--in particular, politics, economics, and history--and they will learn how to integrate insights from these diverse approaches to the study of international relations. Topics and issues covered include international security, world trade and finance, environmental politics, human rights, terrorism, regional and ethnic conflict, and the impact of globalization. Students will benefit in particular from exposure to the different modes of analysis pursued at the two universities--more scientific at William &amp; Mary, more philosophical at St Andrews. Together the two universities offer the broad spectrum of courses needed for a solid foundation in the study of world politics. All International Relations majors in the joint program will pursue an independent study project as part of their degree, either by writing a dissertation at St Andrews or by taking a senior research seminar at William &amp; Mary.</p></div>

William &amp; Mary has a robust concentration in the history of early America, nineteenth and twentieth-century America and Europe, with strong offerings in early modern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In addition to the opportunity to concentrate intensively in a particular field at our two universities, students in the joint degree program find their experience enhanced by exposure to two different pedagogical approaches, as the lecture-and discussion-based courses at William &amp; Mary contrast effectively with the quite traditional approach of small seminar-based courses at St Andrews.
