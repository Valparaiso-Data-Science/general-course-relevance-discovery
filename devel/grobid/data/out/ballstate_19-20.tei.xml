The information in this catalog is subject to change and should not be considered a contract. Catalog changes are possible for a number of reasons, including changes in certification or licensing standards for certain programs of study, or because of periodic review of academic programs, curricula, and course offerings by the university governance system. The university, through its academic advising system, will make every effort to help students adapt to changes in the catalog. However, the final responsibility for meeting academic and graduation requirements rests with each student. Students are encouraged to consult frequently with their faculty or academic advisors and to remain in regular contact with major departments in order to stay informed about possible changes in this catalog.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIVERSITY</head><p>Ball State University is a comprehensive, publicly assisted institution of higher learning whose mission is to provide excellent education. It is located in Muncie, Indiana, a city of 70,000, fifty-six miles northeast of Indianapolis. Although its primary concern is for the citizens of Indiana, it offers programs with appeal to regional, national, and international audiences. Ball State University offers a strong undergraduate liberal and professional education and selected graduate programs of high quality. Ball State students can choose from a comprehensive range of academic programs at the associate, baccalaureate, and master's levels, as well as doctoral programs in areas where the university has special competence. The university has a selective admissions policy; in some areas, such as architecture, the university is very selective. Exceptionally well-qualified undergraduate students may enroll in the Honors College for more intellectually demanding programs of study. Students who have not decided on a major or who may need to strengthen their learning skills can take advantage of the special academic assistance and intensive educational advising offered by University College. As part of Ball State's commitment to excellence in education, the university offers students a friendly, collegial atmosphere; a full range of out-of-class activities; and excellent, well-planned academic, residential, and recreational facilities. An impressive array of student support services contributes to the personal, social, and intellectual development of all students. Although Ball State University is primarily a residential academic community, it also supports programs that reach students well beyond the immediate campus. Through interactive telecommunications, Internet courses, and onsite courses, Ball State distance learning students are able to take courses and entire degree programs. The university has a strong commitment to cultural diversity and international programs. It offers exchange programs with universities throughout the world and a wide variety of opportunities for students to study abroad.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Information</head><p>By statute, the Ball State University Board of Trustees is authorized to "prescribe the conditions for admission of students to the university, provided that graduation from a commissioned secondary school or its equivalent shall be required." Specific admissions policies and practices are subject to change as the institution adjusts to enrollment patterns. In order to maintain high academic standards and to ensure that students receive the best education possible at Ball State, the university limits enrollment to students meeting specific admissions requirements. In addition, the university reserves the right to determine the semester to which students are admitted on the basis of students' academic qualifications as well as availability of space. The university also reserves the right to limit the number of nonresident students. To be considered for admission to Ball State, a student must have graduated or be on track to graduate from an accredited secondary school or have earned a General Education Development (GED) and/or Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) and/or HiSET (High School Equivalency Test) certificate. Students who are not high school graduates may be considered for admission to the university after they have presented evidence that they have earned GED/TASC/HiSET certificates. Both the quality and the content of secondary school academic programs are important in admission decisions. Students graduating from high school in Indiana are required to complete the academic component of the Core 40 high school curriculum. Students from other states should pursue strong college prep curricula. All students are encouraged to complete state academic honors diplomas where available. For questions related to curricula, email us at askus@bsu.edu or call the Office of Admissions at <ref type="bibr">800-482-4BSU;</ref><ref type="bibr">765-285-8300;</ref><ref type="bibr">or TTY users only, 765-285-2205.</ref> Applicants should obtain the most recent edition of Ball State University's Admissions Viewbook which may available from their high school guidance offices or from Ball State's Office of Admissions. Interested applicants should apply online at bsu.edu/admissions/apply. Ball State University is not responsible for problems that may arise if students fail to submit complete admissions materials, including official transcripts from other institutions. Ball State class placement and registration may be impacted if complete transcripts of course work are not received in a timely manner to evaluate. All admission materials submitted, including transcripts, become the property of Ball State University. Note: Ball State University practices rolling admissions. Admission to a particular semester may depend on date of application and space available. When enrollment goals are met for each term, admissions will close. Admission to the university does not guarantee admission to a particular academic program. Consult the section of this catalog that applies to the appropriate department to determine admission requirements for specific programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROCEDURES FOR APPLICANTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Students with No Previous College Experience</head><p>Students who have had no previous college experience, after high school graduation, will be considered for admission to Ball State University after the Office of Admissions has received the following:</p><p>1. An application for admission. Applicants submit a completed application for admission before March 1 for priority consideration for fall semester, before December 1 for spring semester, and before April 1 for summer semester. Applications submitted later than the priority deadlines will be considered as space is available. Applications may be submitted up to one year in advance.</p><p>Students seeking admission to academic programs in art, dance, music, theatre, or the first-year program in the College of Architecture and Planning (CAP) will be required to provide additional information within the online application to be considered for admission to those programs. Students will also be required to provide additional information within the admission application to be considered for admission to the Honors College. For information about the supplemental application process, students should contact the Office of Admissions. Students are strongly encouraged to apply early, as a limited number of students are admitted to these programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>A $60 nonrefundable application fee. Applicants must pay a $60 application fee before they will be considered for admission. The fee can be paid by a credit card or electronic check process included in the online application for admission. In cases of financial difficulties or other approved reasons, a request can be made to have the application fee waived. Supporting documentation must be sent to Ball State University Office of Admissions documenting the reason for the fee waiver request on behalf of the applicant. 3.Secondary school record (official transcript) or GED/TASC/HiSET certificate. Students should ask their high schools to send official copies of the secondary transcripts to the Office of Admissions, Admissions <ref type="bibr">6| BALL STATE UNIVERSITY 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">-2020</ref> including lists of courses in progress. Students who have been home schooled or who have attended unaccredited high schools may be required to submit an official General Education Development (GED) and/or Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) and/or High School Equivalency Test (HiSET) certificate. Transcripts or GED/TASC/HiSET certificates must show that applicants meet the standards for certification as secondary school graduates. If schools send partial transcripts, students must make certain that complete official transcripts showing the specific date of graduation are submitted as soon as possible after graduation. Failure to do so will result in a registration barrier and university hold placed on the student's record. Students who have not produced certification of high school graduation are not eligible to receive federal financial aid. If admitted, the quality of students' academic achievement must remain the same or improve, or the admission classification may be changed or admission rescinded. 4.Standardized test scores. Ball State is a test optional institution. Applicants may elect to provide the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) or American College Testing Assessment (ACT) score. The test scores should be sent directly to the university. Some students 23 years old or older may also be required to take the SAT or ACT. For additional information, visit bsu.edu/admissions. 5.Dual credit/college credit. Students taking collegelevel courses at an accredited institution while enrolled in high school must submit official college transcript(s) to the Office of Admissions in order to receive credit for completed courses. For advanced standing information, please see Advanced Standing section (p. 9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Students with Previous College Experience (Transfer Students)</head><p>Applicants who have previously attended post-secondary institutions, and not already earned a postsecondary degree after high school graduation, should follow the same application procedures and observe the same deadlines as students with no college experience. If you have earned a postsecondary degree after high school then the high school transcript requirement may be waived.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission Requirements for Transfer Applicants</head><p>Admission decisions will be based upon applicants' academic records at all educational institutions attended. Applicants must be in good academic standing and eligible to return immediately to the institution last attended.</p><p>To be considered for admission, applicants must have cumulative grade-point averages of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale for all transferable course work attempted. Remedial, vocational, and courses from institutions that are not regionally accredited (Middle States Association, North Central Association, New England Association, Northwest Association, Southern Association, Western Association) are not transferable. Although credit earned from unaccredited colleges and universities is not accepted at Ball State University as transfer credit, transcripts from all such institutions attended are still required. Students who apply for admission to Ball State University while currently enrolled at other colleges and universities may be admitted with condition to Ball State on incomplete transcripts based on their current college or university cumulative grade-point averages. Admission granted under such circumstances will be withdrawn if the cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.0. Students who were not admissible to Ball State out of high school and not offered another pathway into Ball State will be asked to complete a minimum of 24 credits of collegelevel course work (remedial or skill building classes do not count) and earn a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) at an accredited two-or four-year college or university before being considered for admission to Ball State as a transfer student. Acceptance of Transfer Credit. Generally, all nonremedial, nonvocational courses in which a student earns a 2.0 or better at colleges and universities accredited by regional accrediting agencies are accepted by Ball State University. Students may petition the appropriate academic department for the acceptance of vocational courses. Only course credit transfers to Ball State University; no grades transfer. Information about how credits will transfer to Ball State may be obtained through transferin.net or contact the office of admissions at 765-285-8300 or transfer@bsu.edu. Courses at Ball State University are offered on a semester and term basis, and credits earned are in semester hours. To convert quarter hours to semester hours, multiply the number of quarter hours by 2/3. Two semester hours are generally equivalent to three quarter hours. Ball State University has procedures in place to accommodate conversions. Application of Transfer Credit. For admitted students, the application of transfer credit toward a degree at Ball State University will be articulated based on rules defined by University Academic Affairs. Official Ball State University course equivalents are established by University Academic Affairs in consultation with the appropriate academic department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer of Credit Earned in Vocational Degree</head><p>Programs. Vocational degree programs are designed to prepare students for immediate employment rather than for further study at other colleges or universities; therefore, such credits are not directly transferable. For example, degree programs in automotive repair, cosmetology, commercial driving, etc., are considered to be vocational studies. Exceptions to this rule are made when the providers of occupational programs and Ball State University have agreements for transferring credits. IVY Tech Community College of Indiana credits. Ball State will accept the Ivy Tech credits articulated with Indiana's public universities if they were taken in the fall of 1993 or later. All other credits earned in the fall of 1995 or later will be accepted in transfer except those courses that are primarily vocational in nature. Transfer Student Housing Policy. All transfer students who have 24 or fewer credits must live in university housing unless they are 21 years of age, married, living with their parents in the parents' primary residence which is no more than 60 miles from the Ball State campus, or have completed two semesters at Ball State. Admission to the university guarantees housing to transfer students in this category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Former Ball State University Undergraduate Students</head><p>Former Ball State students who stop out, for a year or longer time period, and wish to re-enter the university must submit a reenrollment application to the Office of Admissions. This application can be found at bsu.edu/apply. The deadline for reenrollment consideration is seven days before the official start of each term. Students who have a break in continuous semester attendance or who have attended other institutions since last attending Ball State University and who were in good standing with Ball State University at the time of stop out will be considered reenrolling students. Former Ball State students not in good academic standing with Ball State University as determined by the Registrar (academic disqualification) must apply for reinstatement. This process requires an application, found at bsu.edu/apply. All documentation must be submitted to the Office of Admissions no later than 7 days before the official start of each term. Applicants should submit documents early in order to complete the requirements for application and to allow time for the committee to consider all documentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission of International Students to Ball State University</head><p>Students who are not citizens, permanent residents, asylees, refugees, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) of the United States must enroll at Ball State University through the International Admissions.</p><p>Prospective students must meet all of the university's international student admission requirements. In addition to submitting a special admission application and all supporting academic credentials, students must have evidence of adequate financial support for expenses for one academic year-including tuition, fees, books, supplies, maintenance (lodging and food), health insurance, taxes, and miscellaneous expenditures <ref type="bibr">(clothing, local travel, recreation, toiletries, telephone, etc.)</ref> before Ball State may issue visa-enabling documents, if applicable. An international student intending to enroll at Ball State University may be required to take the TOEFL, IELTS, or Pearson's PTE before being admitted, regardless of the extent of previous training in English. Any exceptions to these English proficiency admission requirements must be approved by the International Admissions . For information about these exams contact TOEFL at toefl.org, IELTS at ielts.org, or Pearson PTE at pearsonpte.com. Any student admitted conditionally with a score lower than 79 (internet-based) on the TOEFL, 6.5 on the IELTS, or 53 on the Pearson PTE will be required to take an English language proficiency exam during international student orientation to determine the English language courses that must be taken through the Intensive English Institute. Upon completion of the IEI program or submitting a TOEFL, IELTS, or Pearson PTE that meets minimum admission requirements, the students must pursue full time academic study. Exceptions to these rules must be approved by the Rinker Center for International Programs. Any international student may take a course in the Intensive English Institute for noncredit, regardless of whether such a course is required. Any student who is required to take a course in the Intensive English Institute and whose progress is unsatisfactory will be required to repeat the course if the Intensive English Institute, Rinker Center for International Programs, and the chairperson of the relevant department deem it advisable. Any student offered admission to non-degree study in the Intensive English Institute only must apply as a degreeseeking student and be offered admission before enrolling in credit-bearing academic classes. Upon enrollment, international students are assessed nonresident tuition and fees for undergraduate and graduate courses offered by the university. The university currently has a limited number of scholarships authorized by the University Board of Trustees that may be awarded to outstanding and deserving students from other countries. These scholarships are equivalent in value to a partial waiver of university tuition fees. No scholarships are available for room, board, or transportation costs. Successful applicants will be sent documentation allowing them to apply for a student visa through United States consular representatives in their home countries. All international students are required to participate in a health insurance plan designed for Ball State University students unless approved for a waiver. The premium must be along with nonresident tuition and fees and must be maintained throughout the student's period of enrollment at the university. Upon arrival at Ball State, students are required to attend international student orientation during which registration information and other relevant student issues are discussed. An English language examination will be administered to those students who require the test at this time to determine language competency. Prospective students are encouraged to inquire at least one year before proposed enrollment at Ball State by contacting International Admissions or by visiting bsu.edu/admissions/international. . Students who have a break in continuous semester attendance or who have attended other institutions since last attending Ball State and who were in good standing with Ball State at the time of stop out will be considered reenrolling students. Please refer to the information above. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENROLLMENT DEPOSIT</head><p>Students admitted as undergraduates to the university for the first time must accept their formal offers of admission by completing the Enrollment Confirmation process and paying the $100 non-refundable enrollment deposit. The deposit will be applied directly to first-semester fees. The deadline for fall and summer semesters is May 1 and for spring semester the deadline is January 1. In cases of financial difficulties, a guidance counselor may request, in writing, that the enrollment deposit be deferred for a student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ORIENTATION</head><p>Freshmen and transfer students participate in a required orientation program. Orientation is a learning experience that helps students understand academic and career expectations, become involved in collegiate life, and learn about the transition period students may experience as they enter college. During Orientation students meet with academic advisors, register for courses, and get their Ball State (ID Card). Admitted students who have confirmed their enrollment deposit will receive information authorizing the student to select an orientation date. Family members are encouraged to attend Orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPECIAL ENROLLMENT Enrollment as Guest Students</head><p>Students regularly enrolled and in good academic standing at other colleges or universities who wish to attend Ball State University for one semester and have their credit transferred back to their home institution and may apply as guest students. To be eligible, students must have minimum cumulative grade-point averages of 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) and be eligible to return immediately to their home institutions. Guest applications are available at bsu.edu/apply. Students must submit official college transcripts to the Office of Admissions. Within seven days of application receipt, applicant will receive notification from the Help Desk providing Ball State Credentials. Additionally, if application is approved, the Office of Admissions will send official notification outlining next steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission as Auditors</head><p>All students who meet the general requirements for admission to Ball State University may enroll as auditors in credit courses upon approval of the academic department offering the course and the Office of Admissions. Auditors do not earn academic credits or grades. Students who have audited courses cannot later test out of those courses. Auditors must pay auditors' fees for each course unless the course requires full fees. Applications can be obtained from the Office of Admissions. three to five days prior to the first day of classes of each semester or term. If an application is approved, applicant must visit the Office of Registrar to be enrolled in requested course. No online courses are available to be audited. If space is needed for students who want to earn credit in the course, auditors' registrations will be canceled and their money fully refunded. If auditing students choose not to attend the course, then fees are not refunded. Faculty members may not admit anyone to class as an auditor who has not officially registered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADVANCED STANDING</head><p>Ball State University offers opportunities to earn credit toward a degree for knowledge students have acquired independently, at work, in the military, through workshops and special classes, and in other ways. Most of these opportunities require that students take an examination to "test out" of a course or group of courses. Credit earned in this way counts toward graduation requirements, but students do not receive a grade for it. Students cannot receive credit of this type for courses for which they have already received credit. Students can earn up to 63 credits through this program. The opportunities for earning advanced standing are: • Advanced Placement Program • International Baccalaureate Certificates or Diploma • College Level Exam Program (CLEP tests-subject and general) • Credit by departmental examination • Credit by departmental authorization • Credit earned while in military service • Credit for foreign language proficiency Any department may, at its discretion, administer an examination for any course offered in the department. The department also determines the standards for passing these examinations. Students who earn passing scores will be granted credit for the courses. Credit by examination will not be awarded to students who have been enrolled or are currently enrolled in the courses for credit or audit. Credit by departmental authorization may be granted for learning experiences the department believes to be the equivalent of college work. No grade is given for this credit. Credit and advanced placement in foreign languages and mathematics may be awarded through the Advanced Credit Placement Test that is available online and can be taken prior to attending freshman orientation. Testing instructions are mailed to students with their orientation invitation. Students must receive placement through the testing process before registering for the appropriate courses. For more information, visit bsu.edu/admissions/credit to learn how Ball State awards advanced credit. Ball State University will accept courses for transfer evaluation and advanced standing credit transcript posting only if the student is currently enrolled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESIDENCY</head><p>Because Ball State University is financially supported by Indiana legislative appropriations, resident students pay less in fees than out-of-state students. Residency status, as determined by the Registrar in accordance with rules adopted by the Board of Trustees, is subject to change. Residency status depends primarily upon the length of time a person has lived in Indiana for purposes other than attending a college or university. A minimum residency of a year is required for independent students (not claimed as dependents by parents or guardians on their income tax forms). The student bears the burden of proof in making a claim of resident status. To request a change in residency classification, a student must file an application form and provide proof of residency in Indiana. Copies of the regulations, the Application for Nonresident Fee Exemption, and other information are available in the Office of Registrar, Lucina Hall, Room B43, or at online at bsu.edu/registrar by selecting "Miscellaneous Information" and click "Review guidelines."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID</head><p>The staff members in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships are eager to assist you. Over three-fourths of all Ball State students receive some form of financial aid, including scholarships, grants, loans, and student employment. To be considered for most financial aid programs, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be received by the federal processor on or before April 15. Apply online at fafsa.gov. For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at 800-227-4017 or 765-285-5600 or visit bsu.edu/finaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIME LIMIT</head><p>There is no specific time limit for the completion of undergraduate degrees, but the university reserves the right to review course work that is more than seven years old. Furthermore, the university is neither obligated nor committed to continue courses or programs so that students can take more than the normal four or five years to complete bachelor's degrees or more than two years to complete associate degrees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CREDITS</head><p>Class standing and grade-point averages at Ball State University are determined at the close of the term on the basis of semester credits. Generally, one hour of class time a week equals one credit. For example, most classes at Ball State carry 3 credits, and they meet for approximately three hours each week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS STANDING</head><p>Undergraduate students are designated as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors during their academic careers at Ball State. Students who have earned fewer than 30 semester credits are freshmen. Students who have earned 30 credits or more but fewer than 60 credits are sophomores. Students who have earned 60 credits or more but fewer than 90 credits are juniors. Students who have earned 90 credits or more are seniors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE LOAD</head><p>The normal course load in a semester is 12 to 18 credits. (During a semester, 9 to 11 credits is considered a threequarter-time load; 6 to 8 credits is considered a half-time load.) A total of twelve credits in a semester is considered a full course load for undergraduate students. Freshmen are not eligible to register for more than 18 credits unless they have met the following conditions:</p><p>1.They have earned previous residence credit at Ball State University. 2.They have cumulative grade-point averages of at least 3.0. 3.They have successfully completed all of their scheduled courses in the preceding semester or term. Students who are on academic probation may not register for more than 18 credits in a semester or term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADES Grades</head><p>The university reports and records grades using the plus/minus letter system. Quality points are allocated to each recorded grade according to the following scale: Programs requiring C or better grades will not accept a Cgrade (unless specified otherwise). A student's grade-point average (GPA) is calculated by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of GPA credits. A grade of F is recorded when a student fails a course or withdraws from a course after the withdrawal period unless, in the judgment of the dean of the instructor's college, the reasons for withdrawing from a course warrant a W. FN (Non-attendance) represents a failing grade awarded to the student who did not attend a course (no completed assignments, no exams, no instructor interaction or other documented engagement in an academically-related activity in the course). FS (Stopped attendance) represents a failing grade awarded to a student who did not officially withdraw but failed to complete a course (i.e., did not take a final exam, stopped attending, etc.) and failed to achieve the course objectives. Instructors will be required to enter the last date of academic engagement for the student receiving a grade of FS. A failing grade <ref type="bibr">(F, FN, or FS)</ref> is recorded when a student withdraws from a course after the published withdrawal deadline for the semester or term unless, in the judgement of the instructor or college dean, the reasons for withdrawing from the course are such that the student should have a W. CR is recorded for students registered under credit/no credit provisions who do work that is 2.0 or above. NC is recorded for students registered under credit/no credit provisions who do work that is below 2.0. I represents incomplete work and is given only when it is determined that the student should be given an opportunity to finish the work. The instructor, along with the department chairperson, decides whether to award an incomplete grade in a course and outlines the requirements and time limit for completing the work. It is most important that the conditions for removing the I be as specific as possible. Removal of an I grade should be limited to as short a period as possible. CR/NC enrollments will expire to become a failing grade as defined by the Degree Requirements and Time Limit <ref type="bibr">12| BALL STATE UNIVERSITY 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">-2020</ref> grading method. All other enrollments expire to an F grade. Unless an earlier completion date is specified by the instructor, an I grade awarded for an undergraduate course will expire as follows: for Fall enrollment, by May 1; for Spring and/or Summer enrollment, by December 1. An exception is made when an extension on the timeline has been recommended by a department chairperson and approved by the appropriate dean. The Office of the Registrar will send an email reminder to the student and to the instructor of an I grade on the student record on or about the 15 th of every month. NR represents a grade not properly reported by an instructor. The instructor must assign a grade by the fifth week of the next term. If an NR grade is not removed by the fifth week of the following (academic year) term, the Registrar's Office will change the grade to F or to NC if it is a credit or no credit course. W represents an official withdrawal from a course. A "W" is recorded when a student withdrawals from a course after the published withdrawal deadline for the semester or term unless, in the judgement of the instructor, department, or college dean, the reason for course withdrawal does not meet university withdrawal guidelines and the student will receive a failing grade. Students who want to take courses without credit to apply toward a degree (auditors) sign waivers for the specific courses. Students must make audit adjustments prior to the end of the add/drop period for the course term of enrollment. Students earn no academic credit for auditing classes. Such classes are represented by the entry AU on the student's transcript. At the close of each semester or term, students may access grades at my.bsu.edu. Any correction in a grade already reported must be made by the instructor and approved by the department chairperson and the dean of the instructor's college before it is filed in the Office of the Registrar . Any such change must be completed within one year of the close of the session for which the grade was due. Dean's List. Undergraduates who earn at least a 3.5 gradepoint average for 12 or more credits of graded course work during a semester or for 6 or more credits of graded course work during a summer term will be named to the dean's list for that semester or term. Course enrollment under the grading option of credit/no credit is not used in Dean's List calculation. This designation will be placed on students' academic transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CREDIT/NO CREDIT POLICY</head><p>Students may choose to earn up to 15 credits under the credit/no credit option. If a course is offered only for credit/no credit then it will not count in the fifteen-credit allowance. Students who have taken a course for a grade cannot enroll again on a credit/no credit basis. Courses taken on a credit/no credit basis will not count toward the academic major, minor, or any University Core Curriculum requirements, except for student teaching, internships, and courses offered only for credit/no credit. If a student has taken courses in a particular subject for credit/no credit and then decides to major or minor in that subject, not more than two of the courses will count toward the major or minor requirements. Students on academic probation may not use the credit/no credit option. With these exceptions, departments must allow students to take courses for credit/no credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MINIMUM GRADE REQUIREMENTS</head><p>A student will be placed on academic probation at the close of a term when the cumulative grade-point average is less than 2.0. At the close of a term, the Office of the Registrar will notify students who are on academic probation of their status, including any requirements the University establishes to help improve their academic performance.</p><p>Students on academic probation may be required to repeat courses, enroll in no more than 18 credits, take courses in reading and study skills, attend academic progress meetings sponsored by the Office of the Registrar, attend workshops and seminars on academic success, obtain advisor's approval to make schedule changes, and enroll in class sections that offer supplemental instruction. Students who are informed by the Registrar that they have been placed on academic probation should immediately meet with their academic advisor to discuss plans for improvement. Academic standing is determined at the end of a semester.</p><p>To avoid academic dismissal a student on academic probation must meet the following conditions: • A student with less than 30 earned credits at the end of the semester, (including transfer credit and other credit granted) is required to earn a 2.0 term grade-point average at the end of the probation term and each following term until the cumulative average reaches 2.0 or above. • A student with 30 or more earned credits at the end of the semester, (including transfer credit and other credit granted) is required to earn a 2.1 term grade-point average at the end of the probation term and each following term until the cumulative average reaches 2.0 or above. Transferred credits from other colleges and universities will be included in determining the number of completed credits. The grades from those institutions will not be used in figuring the cumulative grade-point average. Students dismissed from Ball State for academic reasons cannot be reinstated for at least two semesters (summer is considered a semester). To be reinstated, students must complete an application form available from the Office of the Registrar and submit it to the Office of the Registrar for review by the appropriate date for the term of enrollment. The application cannot be reviewed if a "university hold" has been placed on the student record or if the university has not received official transcripts of grades from all other schools attended since the last semester of attendance at Ball State. Reinstatement to the university does not ensure admission to a particular college or program of study. Ball State is not obligated to reinstate students who have been dismissed. Students granted reinstatement must show that they have sufficient aptitude to pursue their intended program of study. They must also show signs of increased maturity, increased commitment to education, and adequate financial resources to attend Ball State without excessive employment. Students may not apply for reinstatement more than once in a twelve-month period. Students who have been disqualified will not be reinstated more than once in a three-year period. All degree programs require that students earn a gradepoint average of at least 2.0 overall and in each major, minor, certificate, and the University Core Curriculum. Some programs-for example, teacher education-have higher minimum requirements. Academic Clemency. Undergraduate students who were not enrolled at Ball State University for a five-year period may petition the Office of the Registrar to have grades and credits earned before that period removed from the calculation of their cumulative grade-point averages. Students participating in the program are specifically required to comply with the following provisions:</p><p>• The student must not already have an earned degree from Ball State University. • University records must verify that they were not registered in any capacity at Ball State University for a period of at least five years. • For students who qualify for academic clemency, all previous Ball State University course work with grades of C or above will be counted for credit only. However, students will lose credit for all courses with grades below C and resume their academic program with no cumulative grade-point average and marks placed in the student record. • The student's academic records will be inscribed with the note "Academic Clemency Granted (date)." • Academic clemency may be used only one time by a Ball State University student. • Academic clemency is final and irreversible. • All other policies of Ball State University apply. Call the Office of the Registrar, 765-285-1722, for more information on the deadlines for applications for reinstatement or academic clemency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT RECORDS</head><p>At the close of each term, enrolled students may view grade reports showing attempted credits, earned credits, quality points, grade-point average for the term, and cumulative grade-point average on the university's student services Web site my.bsu.edu. Permanent academic records are kept in the Office of the Registrar. Midterm Evaluation of Undergraduates By the end of the eighth week of the semester, faculty will submit a midterm grade for all students whose grades are C-, <ref type="bibr">D+, D, D-, F, or NC</ref>. This policy will apply to all classes and grades will be made available to students. Each student's academic advisor will receive notification of the student's performance, and, if a student lives in a residence hall, the residence hall director also will receive this information. The purpose of the midterm evaluation is to provide students with information about their current classroom performance as well as provide information to support personnel for students whose performance may result in a grade of less than a C. It is ultimately the student's responsibility to respond appropriately to this information. The midterm grade does not guarantee a specific performance at the end of the semester but is merely notice of the student's performance to that time. This policy excludes all summer and part of term classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RIGHT TO BEREAVEMENT LEAVE</head><p>Students will be excused from class in the event of the death of a close friend or member of the student's family or household. The number of excused absences allowed is determined by the distance of funeral services from Muncie, Indiana, as follows:</p><p>Three work days -150-mile radius of Muncie Four work days -Between 150-300 mile radius of Muncie Five work days -Beyond 300-mile radius of Muncie Seven work days -Outside of North America If the student is unable to attend the funeral services, the student will be allowed three school days for bereavement. Given proper documentation, the instructor will excuse the student from class and provide the opportunity to earn equivalent credit for assignments missed. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome, he or she may appeal as outlined in Ball State University's Procedure for Student Bereavement Appeals found in the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE REPETITION</head><p>An undergraduate student may repeat a course an unlimited number of times except in cases where a department has imposed repetition limits. The repetition of a course does not remove the previous grades from the student's official academic record. A W will not replace a previous grade. Unless it is a variable credit course, the last grade in a course will be used in computing the student's grade-point average. The credits will count only once toward meeting minimum credit requirements for graduation. The University is not obligated to offer courses so that a student can repeat them. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with an advisor. The university reserves the right to modify or cancel courses when necessary because of accreditation requirements, insufficient enrollment, lack of staff members, or for financial or other reasons. In addition, the chairperson of a department can transfer students from one section of a class to another section of the same class. Departments can substitute courses to meet major and minor requirements as long as the substitution does not reduce the number of credits required in the program. Either a student or a department can request a course substitution before the alternate course is taken. The department chairperson must sign a copy of the approval of the substitution; the form must then be submitted to the appropriate advising center. Students who need to change their class schedules can do so any time after their initial registration through the end of the add/drop time frame. There is no charge for changes made during this time frame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXTENDED EDUCATION COURSES</head><p>The Division of Online and Strategic Learning offers a wide variety of courses to meet continuing or extended education needs. Students enrolled in extended education courses are entitled to the support services of University Libraries and Unified Technology Support. Access to other services and facilities is only available to students who have paid all necessary fees. Ball State students enrolled in any online or off campus education course will only receive residence credit for those courses that originate at Ball State University. For students pursuing a degree at Ball State University, there may be a limit to the number of independent learning credits that will count toward a major or minor. To inquire about the limitations governing degree programs, contact the academic department responsible for the major or minor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change of Course Period</head><p>Students may make changes to their schedule through the add/drop period. Specific calendar dates may be viewed on the website bsu.edu/registrar. Courses dropped through this period are not recorded on the student's permanent record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Withdrawal Period</head><p>Students may withdraw from courses from the start date of the course through 60% of the scheduled duration of the course. Specific calendar dates may be viewed on the website at bsu.edu/registrar. NOTE: Saturday is not considered a class day for these purposes. The course withdrawal period is determined according to the following schedule:</p><p>• from the eight to the forty-fifth day of classes in a fall or spring semester; • from the eight to the thirtieth day of classes in a summer semester; • from the fourth to the fifteenth day of classes in a five week session. • From the fifth day to the twenty-fourth day of classes in an eight week session. Students wishing to withdraw from a course during this period should first discuss the withdrawal with their instructor. All student-initiated withdrawals will be recorded as a final grade of W during this period. However, students who discontinue enrollment or who abandon courses without following the withdrawal policy's procedures will normally earn a failing grade in those courses. Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships prior to withdrawing to determine how it will affect your financial aid. To see the impact of the withdrawal on your bursar account view your ebill account online. Additional information can be found at bsu.edu/bursar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal after the Course Withdrawal Period</head><p>If there are verifiable extenuating circumstances which make withdrawal from a course academically justified after the withdrawal period ends, the college dean or designate may grant an exception to the above withdrawal policy. The faculty member is responsible for recording the last date of attendance and determining a withdrawal or failing grade. A "W" is recorded when a student withdrawals from a course after the published withdrawal deadline for the semester or term unless, in the judgment of the instructor, department, or college dean, the reason for course withdrawal does not meet university withdrawal guidelines and the student will receive a failing grade. To see the impact of the withdrawal on your bursar account, view your ebill account online. Additional information can be found at bsu.edu/bursar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS ATTENDANCE</head><p>A student's enrollment is regarded as a contract with the university. Since full performance requires, in part, regular and punctual class attendance, students are expected to attend all classes for which they are registered. Faculty will establish attendance policies for their courses and communicate those policies through course syllabi or outlines.</p><p>Students who know they must be absent from a class should notify the instructor or departmental office. Courtesy requires that students speak to the instructor and preferably present a signed and dated memo briefly stating the reasons for absence. Faculty members are responsible for keeping records of attendance of all students registered in each class. Students are responsible for completing any work they have missed. The faculty member is not required to do extra teaching to help students "catch up."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIELD TRIPS</head><p>Field trips consistent with the purpose of the course should be planned at the beginning of the semester. Absence caused by field trips in a course or by official university responsibilities will be announced in advance to the instructors of the course(s) in which the student is enrolled. Students obtain these notices through the department chairperson's office and take them to their instructors at least three days in advance of the absence. No field trips, travel, or other special events involving students are scheduled during the first week or the last two weeks of a semester. Exceptions will be granted only after consultation with and approval by the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs. Whenever possible, trips should be scheduled for weekends. Field trips are voluntary, but a course grade may be lowered if students do not go on a field trip and do not complete adequate make-up work as assigned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNSHIPS AND PRACTICA</head><p>The university encourages student internships and practica.</p><p>Internships and practica are defined as supervised practical experience in a student's field of study. In order to be recorded on the student's academic transcript, the internship or practicum must have an academic component. Academic supervision must be conducted by faculty in the student's major or minor course of study in collaboration with a supervisor at the internship or practicum site. Academic internships and practica must be approved by the department chairperson or a designated representative of the student's major or minor course of study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Goals and Objectives</head><p>To achieve this vision and accomplish these transformations, student learning experiences are guided by a recursive, intellectual development process inherent in the following goals:</p><p>1. To transform experience into information, Ball State graduates are intentional learners who • accurately observe and measure elements of the natural and social worlds, • are alert to the importance of context, • explore diverse ways of knowing, • develop strategies for reflecting on experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.To transform information into knowledge, Ball</head><p>State graduates are informed, flexible thinkers who • analyze data to reveal existing patterns of information and to create new patterns; • understand the various ways that information is incorporated into branches of knowledge; • work independently as well as collaboratively to generate knowledge; • develop an intellectual framework with which to synthesize information from multiple sources;</p><p>• adapt their intellectual framework to accommodate new information; • develop the art of communication-oral, visual, and written-in more than one language (natural and/or symbolic). 3.To transform knowledge into judgment, Ball State graduates are critical and creative thinkers who • use multiple sources of information and knowledge in forming judgments; • evaluate strengths and weaknesses of arguments and actions; • understand the ethical implications of possessing and using knowledge; • take an inquiring stance toward the world while appreciating the contributions of tradition; • consider and understand others' values as well as their own; • value diversity in the social and natural world; • develop effective decision-making strategies based on an awareness of their own strengths and weaknesses; • understand how their actions affect the complex, interrelated systems that compose our environment. 4.To transform judgment into action, Ball State graduates are responsible learners who • recognize the responsibilities of an educated person to self, family, community, country, and the world; • accept the responsibility to act on their principles; • adapt to change; • work with others to overcome obstacles to communication, building consensus for action; • communicate effectively-in oral, visual and written modes, and in more than one language (natural and/or symbolic); • adopt habits of mind for continuous inquiry about themselves, others, and the world; • act responsibly given the dangers to and the fragility of the natural environment; • make and act on a commitment to health and wellness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Rationale for the University Core Curriculum (UCC)</head><p>In keeping with the recursive nature of learning transformations and the goals stated in the Preamble and the Goals and Objectives, the core curriculum is designed to enable students to • realize their intellectual potential, • add breadth and depth to their educational experience, • increase their personal well-being, and • participate actively in their communities. Moreover, the University recognizes its responsibility to ensure that students are conversant with ways of knowing, with criteria for judgment, and with types of information outside their majors. To succeed in the 21st Century, where work often requires a group effort by experts from multiple disciplines, university graduates will need to form, lead, or be members of problem-solving, brainstorming, or decision-making teams in a wide variety of professional settings. Thus the core curriculum requires students to engage disciplines outside the domains of knowledge in which their majors reside, to develop skills in written and oral communication, to become mathematically, scientifically, and historically literate, and to understand issues in the areas of physical wellness and personal finance. Any forward-looking curriculum must also address the mounting issues, problems, and opportunities in the areas of civic engagement, diversity, and international and environmental awareness. The UCC has six distinguishing features:</p><p>• Intellectual development: As indicated in the Preamble and Goals and Objectives, UCC courses must have intellectual development goals, not simply content area requirements. • Exposure to multiple domains: The UCC ensures that students will be able to distinguish among domains of knowledge based on their specific epistemologies and methods, as well as on the basis of content. • Integration of 21st Century skills: In addition to developing writing skills beyond those of the required course in English composition, the UCC asks students to engage issues related to civic life, diverse cultures, and the environment, not in separate courses for each of these areas, but in courses that address one or more of these areas either inside or outside the major, inside or outside the UCC. • Integration of Core courses and the major: The UCC allows course work in the major to count for as many as six credits in the Core as long as the courses in the major meet learning transformation requirements. • Experiential/immersion experience or similar learning experience: The UCC envisions that students will demonstrate the ability to work successfully in the major (and related areas, as appropriate) through experiences that are cumulative and integrative, that include individual or collaborative reflective components, and that provide an opportunity to communicate, both orally and in writing, at a level expected of a college graduate. • Learning outcomes: The UCC encourages participation by any department in the university because the acceptability of courses for the core depends on learning outcomes, as well as course content. Writing Proficiency Program. All baccalaureate students must satisfy the Writing Proficiency Requirement prior to graduation.</p><p>All WPP courses have as a prerequisite completion of ENG 104 or its equivalent with a grade of "C" or better. Students who have at least 60 but not more than 89 completed credits may attempt WPP 392 (Writing Proficiency Examination) two times. WPP 392 is a 0 credit course. Students who have at least 60 completed credits may attempt WPP 394 (Writing Proficiency Seminar). WPP 394 is a 1 credit course, and the credit does apply toward total credits. Students who have at least 60 completed credits may choose to take WPP 393 (Writing Proficiency Course). WPP 393 is a 2-credit course, and the credits do apply toward total credits. WPP393 may also be used to satisfy the Core Curriculum's "W" or Writing Intensive Course requirement. Students with baccalaureate degrees from accredited institutions who are pursuing a second baccalaureate degree from BSU are exempt from the Writing Proficiency Requirement. Students who have satisfied the Writing Proficiency requirement after receiving a passing grade in one WPP course may not attempt another WPP course in order to supplement their grade total.</p></div>

Swartz, Chairperson bsu.edu/architecture/ Architectural education attends to the critical 21 st century environmental and social challenges in our communities while educating students in analytical and creative thinking, intellectual inquiry, ideation, hands-on making, and communication. We seek to inspire our students with the grounding of a rigorous education that fosters the Estopinal College of Architecture and Planning creative and intellectual confidence, ethical grounding, and self-awareness to allow them to succeed in their disciplinary aspirations in a rapidly changing world. Three undergraduate degree programs in architecture are offered. Each of these is tailored to different student educational pursuits and professional aspirations. The five-year Bachelor of Architecture program provides a professionally oriented undergraduate education resulting in an accredited professional degree (a necessary requirement for professional licensure). The B.Arch degree balances the intensity of a professional degree program with a broader, well rounded, and diverse undergraduate university education. This B.Arch degree program also provides a foundation for other career paths and/or educational pursuits at the graduate level. This degree program is currently eligible for initial candidacy and accreditation by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. The university expects to host a visit for initial accreditation in Fall 2020. See * below. The four-year undergraduate degree program Bachelor of Arts (includes a foreign language concentration) or Bachelor of Science (no foreign language concentration) with a major in architecture provide a "pre-professional" undergraduate architecture education. This degree path prepares students to pursue a graduate professional M.Arch degree in architecture (a necessary requirement for professional licensure). This degree is the pre-professional component of the department's NAAB accredited Master of Architecture degree. Note that the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited professional degree. See ** below. The four-year undergraduate major BS in Environmental Design provides students with an immersive exposure to the discipline of architecture, while preparing them for leadership roles in allied environmental design disciplines. While benefitting from lessons in critical thinking, communication and design process inherent in an architectural education, this degree suits students who have broader educational and career aspirations, perhaps leading to careers (with or without additional graduate education) in the construction industry, interior design, industrial design, business management, communications, marketing, or business, to name a few. This degree does not directly lead to professional licensure as an architect although the three-year professional Master of Architecture program would be an option for students in this track. Approval to pursue any of the departmental undergraduate degrees involves admission to the university http: <ref type="bibr">//cms.bsu.edu/admissions/undergraduateadmissions/information-for/high-school-</ref> A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.75 overall in the CAP first-year courses Note: transfer requests into the undergraduate program are addressed on a case-by-case basis. Retention Standards: Students in the B.Arch and BA/BS undergraduate degree programs receiving grades BELOW C-in two consecutive Professional Studies (per NAAB) required courses (i.e., <ref type="bibr">ARCH 201,</ref><ref type="bibr">202;</ref><ref type="bibr">ARCH 214,</ref><ref type="bibr">314;</ref><ref type="bibr">ARCH 218,</ref><ref type="bibr">318 etc.)</ref>, must repeat the sequence of both courses. In the United States, most registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit professional degree programs in architecture offered by institutions with U.S. regional accreditation, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may require a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture for admission. However, the preprofessional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. The NAAB grants candidacy status to new programs that have developed viable plans for achieving initial accreditation. Candidacy status indicates that a program expects to achieve initial accreditation within six years of achieving candidacy, if its plan is properly implemented. In order to meet the education requirement set forth by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards, an applicant for an NCARB Certificate must hold a professional degree in architecture from a program accredited by the NAAB; the degree must have been awarded not more than two years prior to initial accreditation. However, meeting the education requirement for the NCARB Certificate may not be equivalent to meeting the education requirement for registration in a specific jurisdiction. Please contact NCARB for more information. * Ball State University, Department of Architecture, has achieved Initial Candidacy for the following NAABaccredited degree program:</p><p>B Design prepares graduates for careers in designing and building the environments in which we live, work, and play.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>edu/honors</head><p>The Honors College offers distinctive learning opportunities for students with excellent academic promise by way of special courses, colloquia, seminars, and independent study. The curriculum is interdisciplinary in nature, consisting of courses that link issues and themes from a variety of modes of inquiry. Honors professors often invite guest speakers to furnish additional perspectives on topics under study. Students in the Honors College complete a core of six Honors courses that can also meet requirements in the University Core Curriculum. The core includes inquiries in contemporary American civilization, global studies, science, and a three-term integrated exploration of the major intellectual, artistic, and cultural achievements of humankind. Honors core courses may be taken during any year of study. All incoming students enroll in the Freshman Seminar in their first semester. This seminar provides an orientation to the Honors College and the university experience, and is guided by an upper-division Honors College student mentor. After the freshman year, students may enroll in Honors colloquia. Each Honors student takes at least two colloquia during their undergraduate studies. These colloquia are developed by Honors faculty members to focus on special topics, creative connections, or critical issues in their areas of expertise. As a senior, each student completes an individual inquiry or creative project under the guidance of a professor selected by the student. Throughout their four years, Honors students have ready access to their Honors advisor, who helps to identify one's academic goals and offers continual guidance from freshman orientation through graduation. Honors students may apply for the Undergraduate Fellows competition, which awards stipends for independent work with a faculty mentor. Honors students are strongly encouraged to pursue short-or long-term study abroad experiences and major post-graduate fellowship opportunities. Any undergraduate student may also earn "Departmental Honors" in their major, as determined by the major department and coordinated by the Honors College. Applications for admission to the Honors College are reviewed by the Honors College following the applicant's admission to Ball State University. The Honors College considers the strength of the high school curriculum (including the Indiana Academic Honors Diploma or equivalent curriculum and value-added experiences such as AP, IB or other special academic courses), extracurricular activities and leadership experiences, letters of reference from teachers familiar with the student's potential for college academic work, and standardized test scores. Students admitted to the Honors College must make regular progress in the Honors curriculum: students' gradepoint averages must be at least 3.0 at the end of the freshman year and 3.15 at the end of the sophomore year; students should complete at least one Honors core course by the end of the first year; students should complete at least three Honors core courses by the end of the second year. In order to graduate with an Honors diploma, students must complete the Honors curriculum and finish with a cumulative grade-point average of at least 3.33. Transfer students are also welcome to request admission to the Honors College. Transfer students should contact the dean of the Honors College directly, preferably by e-mail. For more information, contact the dean of the Honors College via e-mail (honors@bsu.edu) or phone, 765-285-1024, or explore the Honors College Web site at www.bsu.edu/honors. The College of Sciences and Humanities equips students with the skills and knowledge they need to be innovative, responsible, and globally engaged twenty-first century citizens. This College is the largest college at Ball State University; it encompasses disciplines in humanities, social sciences, and mathematical, natural, and computer sciences, and offers more than 80 majors in 16 academic departments. The College provides students with educational experiences designed to enhance their ability to analyze situations, think critically, solve complex problems, and communicate clearly. Its programs retain the core elements of a traditional liberal arts degree.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J. Coleman, Chairperson bsu.edu/anthropology</head><p>As the study of humankind, anthropology is part of the social sciences at Ball State University. It draws upon theory, methodology, and data from the humanities and biological sciences as well. Cultural anthropology is concerned with the ways people organize themselves socially in different types of groups. Archaeology is concerned with how human culture has evolved and changed through time. Biological anthropology examines the evolution and adaptation of the species, and explores variations among past and present living populations, the biological bases of human behavior, and primate studies. Linguistics, which is taught in the Ball State University Department of English, is concerned with the nature and history of language and its role in human culture. The department offers cultural field schools abroad, prehistoric and historic archaeological field schools, educational opportunities through Ball State's Applied Anthropology Laboratory, and internship opportunities. The anthropology major offers a core program designed to develop a foundation in all subfields of anthropology. The department also offers a minor in anthropology and the opportunity to earn departmental honors. The Department of Biology offers programs for students preparing for careers in science teaching, laboratory biology, environmental biology, and health professions such as medicine, medical technology, and dentistry. The laboratory sciences of cellular and molecular biology, genetics, and microbiology offer in-depth opportunities for students pursuing bioscience positions in medicine, government, academia, and industry. Experiences with the modern tools of biotechnology are a central theme for all laboratory biology concentrations and the department offers a biotechnology certification program. Biologists in environmental careers work to maintain the natural world for future generations. The department's conservation biology programs focus on preparing students for careers related to the conservation of plant and animal biodiversity and the science supporting the sustainable management of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Further information about careers for biology majors can be found on our departmental Web site www.bsu.edu/biology. The biology major offers a core program intended to develop a common background in biology and additional courses in specialized concentrations designed to prepare students for careers or graduate work in aquatic biology and fisheries, field botany, cellular and molecular biology, environmental biology, genetics, microbiology, wildlife biology and conservation, and zoology. Our general biology concentration allows students to pursue an individualized program for their specific career goals as a biologist. Pre-professional majors add selected courses to meet entrance requirements into medical, dental, and medical technology schools. A teaching major in life science is offered for students who plan to teach in the secondary schools. (Additional course requirements for science teaching programs appear in this catalog under Interdepartmental Programs (p. 160) in the College of Sciences and Humanities.) It is strongly recommended that students seek departmental advising, on an individual basis, early in their programs to plan course work sequences and obtain specific information about their selected emphasis areas and possible certification. </p></div>

To qualify for admission to the Indiana University School of Dentistry at the close of three years of predental preparation, students must complete the major and specific course and scholastic requirements of the curriculum with a minimum of 92 credits at Ball State University. If accepted into dental school, they will use the credit earned the first year in the Indiana University School of Dentistry (28 credits) to meet the senior year course requirements for the baccalaureate degree from Ball State. In addition to the basic science requirements, students entering the Indiana University School of Dentistry will be required to have 20 credits of Biology for majors; 15 credits of Chemistry including general, organic and biochemistry; 8 credits of general Physics; 3 credits of Social Sciences; and 3 credits of Humanities. The following courses are recommended for elective credit: BIO 313; CHEM 232; CC 102.</p><p>To be admitted to the Indiana University School of Dentistry, students must earn satisfactory scores on the Dental Admission Test given by the American Dental Association. Students are responsible for applying to the dental school and making arrangements to take the admission test. Students should take the test in the spring semester fifteen months before they hope to enroll in dental school, but preferably only after completing the required biology and chemistry courses. Students should formally apply for admission to dental school the next summer, twelve months in advance. Predental counseling is available in the Department of Biology. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRE-MEDICINE PROGRAM</head><p>In addition to general graduation requirements at Ball State, students wishing to complete this major must take biology, chemistry, and physics courses that meet or exceed the science requirements for admission to most medical schools. Some medical schools also require general psychology and sociology. Because admission to a medical school is not guaranteed (only 45 percent of applicants nationwide are admitted to medical schools), each pre-med student should complete another major in any subject.</p><p>The following courses are recommended for elective credit in the first three years: mathematics; BIO 214, BIO 313, BIO 444; ANAT 201 and PHYS 215. Except when required to complete an undergraduate major, courses in human anatomy, human physiology, medical bacteriology, medical biochemistry, and medical pharmacology will not be accepted by the School of Medicine as part of the 94 liberal arts credits. Students should take the Medical College Admission Test in the spring or summer, twelve to fifteen months before they hope to enroll in medical school and should formally apply for admission to medical school that same summer, twelve months in advance.</p><p>Premedical counseling is available in the Department of Biology. Application to IU School of Optometry is made through OptomCAS and Indiana University's Graduate e-APP system. You must also complete the "Optometry Departmental Questions" form which consists of a prerequisites worksheet and a short essay section. Applications are due by February 1. Supplementary materials like letters of recommendation are due by February 28. Applicants must take the Optometry Admissions Test (OAT) and provide the official score report by February 1. The OAT is offered year round on computer but you must wait 90 days after an administration to be able to take the test again. It is recommended that you take the exam in late spring or early summer following your Junior year to allow time for a retake if needed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PREPHARMACY PROGRAM</head><p>The prepharmacy program is designed for students who want to apply for admission to the Butler University College of Pharmacy or the Purdue University School of Pharmacy. When completed satisfactorily, the designated courses will meet the preprofessional curricular requirements of Purdue and Butler at the end of the second year. At both Purdue and Butler the combined prepharmacy-pharmacy program leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy requires six years. However, the number of applicants to any college of pharmacy exceeds the capacity of the school. Therefore, students are selected for admission into the prepharmacy and pharmacy programs at these schools based on considerations such as scholastic standing, character, and professional aptitude. Students should become familiar with the admission requirements stated in the bulletins of Butler and Purdue Universities. Careful arrangement of the program for each year is essential so that courses may be completed in sequence and in the allotted time. In particular, general chemistry should be completed in the freshman year. Mathematics, including calculus, is highly desirable. Copies of the programs are available from the pre-pharmacy advisor located in the biology department. There are minor differences in requirements between the School of Pharmacy at Purdue and the College of Pharmacy at Butler. The prepharmacy programs do not lead to graduation from Ball State University. They merely supply students with an approved sequence of courses for the first two years of the complete six-year program. Furthermore, physical education is not a part of this program for students who hope to transfer to Purdue, but it is for those who hope to go to Butler. Students who drop out of the prepharmacy program and elect to follow degree programs of Ball State University will be expected to meet all Ball State degree requirements. Prepharmacy counseling is available in the Department of Biology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</head><p>In order to apply for admission to the professional program at Purdue University's School of Veterinary Medicine, you must first complete the minimum prerequisite course work shown below. Although the requirements outlined above provide an adequate background for entrance into the professional school, the minimally prepared applicant will face competition from applicants with more advanced college work. Since the total number of applicants exceeds the number of available places in the veterinary school, the pre-veterinary student is encouraged to have an alternative goal and major in some one subject matter area toward which the above courses may be applied; a major in Biology with a Zoology option is recommended. Although the minimum GPA for resident application is a 3.0, the overall mean resident GPA for admission to Purdue School of Veterinary Medicine for the class starting in the Fall of 2018 was a 3.78. Nonresident GPA means were similar. Purdue also seriously considers veterinary experience, non-veterinary animal experience, extracurricular activities, paid employment, references, and the applicant interview in the evaluation process. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. Carter, Chairperson</head><p>The Department of Environment, Geology and Natural Resources is dedicated to studying, exploring and managing our natural world. Our programs offer students the opportunity to become involved in shaping our futures. We prepare students for various career tracks that are all related to the environment and the wise use of our natural resources. Our goal is to enable our students to help lead the world moving forward in a sustainable way that meets the needs of society. The department offers 4 majors: 1) major in geology, 2) major in environmental geoscience, 3) major in natural resources and environmental management, and 4) teaching major in earth/space science education. We also offer 7 minors that help students in other majors gain specialized knowledge about the environment, geological sciences, natural resources, and environmental management. The major in geology provides students with classic geologic training and involves a strong background in math and science and the applications of these fields to geology. The major in environmental geoscience provides students with a comprehensive overview of interacting earth systems including lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, as well as understanding the evolution of earth's physical and biological systems through time. Both of these majors prepare students for geological careers in industry, environmental consulting and government agencies, and for graduate study that leads to research, teaching, management, and many other positions in industry, government, and education. The major in natural resources and environmental management has two different concentrations: Natural Resources and Environmental Management. Both have a common set of required courses and are designed to give students expertise in the scientific understanding of physical, biological, social, and political aspects of natural and managed systems. The natural resources concentration provides students with a strong background in environmental interpretation, land management, environmental policy, and the application of environmental practices that promote resource sustainability. The environmental management concentration offers students opportunities to develop analytical skills in laboratory settings related to pollution control, sampling air, land, and water systems for contamination, and best practices for environmental remediation. The teaching major in earth/space science education prepares students for teaching at the middle and high school levels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="68">CREDITS</head><p>Students are expected to have completed mathematics through MATH 112 or their high school equivalent as approved by the primary departmental advisor. Geography as a science is distinguished by the spatial approach to understanding the mechanisms of the world's physical and human environments and the linkages between them. Human geography is specifically concerned with the spatial aspects of human activities, while physical geography examines the spatial processes explaining the Earth's physical environment. Both human and physical geographers develop skills in cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing. To meet society's needs for greater geographic and geospatial understanding in the twenty-first century, the Department of Geography offers bachelor's degrees (BA/BS) in Geography (with four distinct concentrations) as well as a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology and Climatology. All programs prepare students for employment as well as graduate study.</p><p>• Concentration 1. Human Geography. This concentration is designed for students interested in the human dimensions of geography. Whether from a social science or humanities perspective, students apply interests in urbanization, religion, language, population, economics, ethnicity, and politics in a spatial context that includes local, regional, and global scales. Students are also able to minor in Concentration 1. While some Concentration 1 students continue their studies at the graduate level, there also exist employment opportunities in government agencies as well as the private sector. • Concentration 2. Travel and tourism. This concentration provides students the geographical knowledge, the analytical skills, and the practical experience that are beneficial for successful careers in the travel/tourism industry. The sequence of specialized courses addresses the spatial, organizational, social, and economic aspects of sustainable tourism development, as well as the interaction between tourists and destinations.

Psychology is a science that studies behavior and mental processes. Psychologists study individual differences in personality and cognitive abilities, social and biological influences on behavior, and the effects of development and learning on the individual. The study of psychology can help students understand both their own motivations and the behavior of others. The department offers a program of study that is intended to serve students with a variety of career goals. Some students seek employment immediately following graduation. Others use the major as preparation for graduate study or for a career as a high school social studies or psychology teacher. In addition to a basic understanding of psychological science in both laboratory and experiential settings, the undergraduate program is designed to promote the development of critical thinking and communication skills, technological and diversity competencies, and personal and professional ethics. The courses students select within the major should be driven by their educational goals. Whether students intend to pursue employment or graduate study, they should consult with their primary advisor regarding course selection. Their primary advisor may also be helpful in choosing a minor that will further their professional and personal objectives. Students are also assigned a faculty advisor, with whom students should consult for graduate school or career-related questions, issues, or advice. Students interested in teaching psychology at the high school level may complete a social studies major with a concentration in psychology. Through their course work, sociology majors develop practical skills in writing, analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, data analysis, and research methods, which are valued and sought after in the job market. In addition to these skills, a degree in sociology provides students with the ability to consider social issues within the context of society as a whole and in relation to complex social systems. Ultimately students leave with the knowledge and skill to influence change in the world. Sociology majors find employment in business, non-profit, human resources, and government organizations. Many students pursue advanced degrees in sociology while others find themselves well prepared for graduate study in urban planning, institutional research, social work, nonprofit management, counseling, law, and business. </p></div>

Ledbetter, Chairperson bsu.edu/accounting Accounting is often described as the "language of business." Business managers, stockholders, investors, creditors, government agencies, and labor groups depend on accountants for financial data and need to understand the "language." Majors in accounting prepare students for careers in public accounting as certified public accountants (CPA) or for careers as accountants for individual companies in private industry, government agencies, or nonprofit organizations. Under current state law, an Indiana candidate must complete 150 credits of education containing the equivalent of an accounting major in order to take the CPA Examination. This means that a candidate cannot sit for the CPA Examination with only a 120-credit bachelor's degree in accounting. To obtain the 30 additional credits necessary to take the CPA Exam, the Department and its Alumni Advisory Council recommend that students complete the 30-credit master's degree. ECONOMICS J.

The fourth or senior year consists of a twelve-month clinical laboratory program in an accredited hospital school of medical technology. Thirty-two credits are granted for the successful completion of this year. The minimum total for the degree is 120 credits. Admission to a school of medical technology is determined entirely by the school applied to and is based on such considerations as scholastic standing (e.g., minimum grade-point average of 2.5), personal interviews, and recommendations. Completion of the first three years does not guarantee admission to the clinical year; students are therefore advised to plan an alternative program that may be completed in the fourth year. Students may then reapply for the clinical year. The university has established affiliations for preparation of medical technologists with the following Indiana hospitals: Saint Francis Hospital in Beech Grove, Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne, IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Good Samaritan Hospital in Vincennes, and St. Margaret Mercy Health Care Centers in Hammond. We are also affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee.MAJOR IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY (BA/BS)</note></figure>

CS 120 requires MATH 108 or Math Placement.Subtotal: 17   No more than 8 transfer credits are accepted in the minor, and the minor is not open to majors in computer science. The Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology offers a variety of courses that help students understand the dimensions and causes of crime and delinquency and the theories of crime prevention and control. Courses examine the structure and philosophy of the American criminal justice system; the operation of criminal courts at the local, state, and federal levels; techniques and theories of law enforcement; and the philosophies and practices of various correctional programs. Students are prepared for entrylevel professional positions in the criminal justice system as well as for graduate study in related subjects.Baccalaureate DegreesStudents will be guided by the outline of baccalaureate degrees (p. 20), the University Core Curriculum (p. 26), and the concentration areas listed below. English studies offers diverse gateways into the study of language. American, British, and world literature courses enable students to read and interpret works of literature with a greater understanding of their cultural, aesthetic and philosophical contexts. Linguistics and Global Communications offer an understanding of how languages are structured and how languages are used in communicative and interactional contexts. TESOL courses prepare students to teach those for whom English is a new language. Creative writing courses offer students the opportunity to sharpen their writing and creative thinking skills through the study of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and screenwriting. Rhetoric and writing courses help students grow as writers and understand how writing contributes to lifelong learning and professional success. English education courses prepare students for the challenges and rewards of teaching in secondary schools. Each major has its own unique gateway class, and all students take a required capstone course, ENG 444, Senior Seminar. The Department of English offers a Bachelor of Arts degree for all majors, except for the English/Language Arts teaching major, which may be awarded either as a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science. We also offer minors in creative writing, film/screenwriting, linguistics and global communication, literature, and professional writing and emerging media, and coursework for an add-on license in English as a Second Language for teachers. The lowest acceptable grade in a course for credit toward any major or minor in English is C. In addition, for graduation with the English/Language Arts teaching major, the minimum overall grade-point average (GPA) is 2.5.For information about the related minors in European studies and women's and gender studies, see Interdepartmental Programs (p. 39). Language Arts teaching majors may apply two courses to both a major and minor in English. All other students who major and minor in English may apply only one course to both the major and the minor. Students who complete two majors in English may only count ENG 444 and two additional courses towards both majors. Students who complete no English major but two minors may apply only one course to both minors. This program is designed to provide a foundation in the structure of language and its role in culture and communication. It is designed for students seeking careers in global settings, including teaching English abroad, as well as graduate studies in linguistics and related fields. Four semesters (or the equivalent) of a modern or classical language at the college level are required. ENG 436 will be double-counted for the TESOL minor and the English BA with applied linguistics concentration major. Students need to choose ENG 438 and ENG 457 for electives in order to fulfill the credit requirements. If students have not taken ENG 322 as an elective for the major, they may take ENG 322 as an elective for the minor. The minor in Linguistics and Global Communication is not available to students who are majoring in this concentration. This program is designed to provide a foundation in the full range of subjects within English studies: literature, rhetoric, writing, linguistics, and creative writing. It is designed for students seeking a broad liberal education but not necessarily planning to pursue graduate studies in English. Four semesters (or the equivalent) of a modern or classical language at the college level are required.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="4">180| BALL STATE UNIVERSITY 2019-2020 UNDERGRADUATE CATALOG</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>CS 416 HIST 202 CJC 230 ENG 332</cell><cell>Computer Networks Computer Science United States History, 1877 to the Introduction to Policing Linguistic Phonetics and</cell><cell>3 6 3 3 3</cell><cell>CS 420 ENGLISH STUDIES, 36 CREDITS Multitier Web Architectures</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell cols="5">Required Courses CS 120 Computer Science 1: Programming Fundamentals CS 121 Computer Science 2: Data Structures and Objects CS 222 Advanced Programming CS 224 Design and Analysis of Algorithms CS 230 Computer Organization and Architecture CS 239 Social and Professional Issues CS 380 Theory of Computation 1 CS 420 Multitier Web Architectures CS 421 CS 431 Programming Languages CS 439 Current Topics Seminar in GEOG 121 Geography of the Cultural HIST 201 American History, 1492-1876 ENG 321 English Linguistics ENG 320 Introduction to Linguistic Science Environment ENG 220 Language and Society Data Analytics ENG 206 Reading Literature Required courses, 18 credits CS 421 Data Analytics CS 439 Current Topics Seminar in Computer Science CS 445 Human-Computer Interaction CS 446 System Administration CS 447 Network Security CS 455 Data Mining CS 456 Image Processing CS 490 Software Production Studio CS 499 Independent Study MATH 415 Mathematics of Coding and Communication Subtotal: 12 4 4 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3 TO 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 TO 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 TO 6 1 TO 6 3 Subtotal: 63-68 MINOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE 17 CREDITS Requirements List CS 120 Computer Science 1: Programming Fundamentals 4 CS 121 Computer Science 2: Data Structures and Objects 4 Subtotal: 8 9 credits from the following CS 124 Discrete Structures 3 CS 222 Advanced Programming 3 CS 224 Design and Analysis of Algorithms 3 CS 230 Computer Organization and Architecture 3 CS 315 Game Programming 3 CS 380 Theory of Computation 1 3 CS 410 Web Programming 3 CS 411 Mobile Application Development 3 CS 416 Computer Networks 3 CS 418 Database Design 3 CS 419 Operating Systems 3 CC 105 Introduction to the Classical World 3 Associate Degree ASSOCIATE IN ARTS-CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND CRIMINOLOGY (AA) 60 CREDITS General education, 36 credits ENG 103 Rhetoric and Writing 3 ENG 104 Composing Research 3 HIST 150 The West in the World 3 MATH 125 Quantitative Reasoning 3 Fine Arts elective One course from: AHS 100 Introduction to Art 3 MUHI 100 Introduction to Music 3 THEA 100 Introduction to Theatre 3 Subtotal: 3 Natural Science elective One course from: BIO 100 Biology for a Modern Society 3 CHEM 100 People and Chemistry 3 GEOG 101 Earth, Sea, and Sky: A Geographic View 3 GEOL 101 Planet Earth's Geological Environment 3 HSC 160 Fundamentals of Human Health 3 NREM 101 Environment and Society 3 PHYC 100 Conceptual Physics 3 Subtotal: 3 ANTH 111 Anthropology of Everyday Life CC 101 Word Origins and Vocabulary Development 3 3 One course from: Humanities elective MAJOR Required Courses CJC 101 Introduction to American Criminal Justice System 3 CJC 102 Introduction to Criminology 3 CJC 211 Race, Gender, and Crime 3 CJC 220 Research Methods in Criminal Justice 3 CJC 229 Decision-Making and Ethics in Criminal Justice 3 CJC 251 Criminal Law 3 CJC 301 Evaluation Research in Criminal Justice 3 CJC 495 Capstone in Criminal Justice 3 24 credits from electives in CJC Subtotal: 24 Subtotal: 48 For those not taking the internship, a series of directed electives in CJC or related fields will be recommended.

See department statements for course requirements. Students will demonstrate that mastery as a result of intensive preparation in two or more disciplines, one of which must be historical perspectives. Students will complete 30 credits in historical perspectives to facilitate preparation in both United States and world history, complemented by preparation in one other discipline (15 credits in: economics, geography, government/political science, psychology, or sociology), and four other courses (12 credits), one from each of the four other disciplines, totaling 57 credits. Students are encouraged to pursue additional licensure in one or more of the other four disciplines. Teaching programs require additional courses in educational methods. The professional education courses are included in this listing. Each student's program of study must include at least one of the following courses: PSYS 416, 432, or 468. PSYS 493 and 494 are taken in sequence after the completion of all other PSYS courses. By focusing on strong analytical and quantitative skills, the mathematical sciences programs prepare students for professional positions in a variety of areas. The department offers majors in actuarial science, mathematical sciences, and mathematics teaching. In conjunction with the Department of Economics, the department offers a major in mathematical economics. For information on the major in mathematical economics, see Interdepartmental Programs (p. 44). The department minor in mathematics is open only to non-departmental majors.
