<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In 1845, Frederick Douglass told his white readers: "You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man." This simple statement effectively describes the enduring paradox of African American male identity: although black and white males share a genital sameness, until the nation elected its first African American president the former has inhabited a culturally subjugated gender identity in a society premised on both white supremacy and patriarchy. But Douglass's statement also suggests that black maleness is a discursive construction, i.e. that it changes over time. If this is so, how does it change? What are the modes of its production and how have black men over time operated as agents in reshaping their own masculinities? Reading a range of literary and cultural texts, both past and present, students examine the myriad ramifications of, and creative responses to, this ongoing challenge.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFRS 2651 (c, ESD) Queer Race</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>How does the concept of queerness signify in cultural texts that are ostensibly about the struggle for racial equality? And vice versa, how does the concept of racialization signify in cultural texts that are ostensibly about the struggle for LGBT recognition and justice? While some of this work tends to reduce queer to traditional sexual minorities like lesbigay and trans folk while downplaying racial considerations, others tend to limit the category race to people of color like blacks while downplaying questions about sexuality. Such critical and creative gestures often place queer and race in opposition rather than as intersecting phenomena. Students examine the theoretical and cultural assumptions of such gestures, and their implications, through close readings of selected works in both the LGBT and African American literary traditions.

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>From the first chronicles of Columbus, who believed he had arrived in "The Indies, " to the fantasies of global visitors lured by the comforts of secluded resorts, imagination has been a defining force impacting both the representation and the material lives of Caribbean people. Explores the historical trends that have shaped Caribbean societies, cultural identities, and intellectual history through a panoramic study of twentieth-and twenty-first-century fiction, essays, and films, with a focus on authors from the Hispanic Caribbean and US-Latinas of Caribbean descent. Engaging with the responses from Caribbean intellectuals to the challenges of the distorting mirror, addresses: how writers and artists have responded to the legacy of colonialism, slavery, and the plantation economy; how literature and art have depicted dominant trends in the region's more recent history such as absolutist regimes, massive migrations, the tourist industry, and even natural disasters; how the Caribbean drawn by artists and intellectuals relates to global representations of the region. Authors include Piñera, Padura, Santos-Febres, Chaviano, and Junot Díaz. Taught in Spanish.

The curator identifies an axe from seventh-century Benin. Killmonger disagrees. "It was taken by British soldiers in Benin, " Killmonger claims, "but it's from Wakanda, " the fictional nation portrayed in the film. This scene presents a starting point for this course's inquiry into issues of politics and African art. The course examines the impact of colonial relations on museum collections and displays of African art today, and the roles of art as political discourse in Africa. Materials analyze how leaders and institutions have used objects to articulate authority and navigate conflict during precolonial and colonial periods, nationalist movements, and the years since countries in Africa gained political independence.

Course material explores how textiles traveled between Africa, Asia, and Europe through precolonial trade routes to how nineteenth-century African textile designs are transformed on European and American fashion show runways today. The course asks questions about how colonial empires, institutions, artists, and other individuals have used textiles to mediate exchanges with other societies. Textiles from Africa represent dynamic visual expressions to investigate issues relating to cultural representation and constructions of identity and power. From tapestries and quilts to ceremonial cloths and everyday dress, we will explore the making, circulation, and use of textiles and their designs to understand what ideas and beliefs textiles carry and communicate. The course focuses on interactions between societies in Africa and other parts of the world, especially Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

Indeed, Pakistan has been variously called a "terrorist state, " a "failed state, " and a "lawless frontier." This course engages in an academic study of the gender, religion, and politics in Pakistan to deepen students' understanding of the world's sixth-most populous country. We begin with accounts of the British colonization of South Asia and the nationalist movements that led to the creation of Pakistan. We then consider the myriad issues the nation has faced since 1947, focusing in particular on the debates surrounding gender and Islam, and Pakistan's entanglements with the US through the Cold War and the War on Terror. In addition to historical and ethnographic accounts, the course will center a number of primary texts (with English translations) including political autobiographies, novels, and terrorist propaganda materials.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Examines representations of gender, divinity, and power in cosmology, mythology, literature, and society in Hinduism and esoteric tantric traditions. Delving into India's philosophical tradition, we discuss prak#ti, the feminine principle or nature, and the male or pure spirit, puru#a. We analyze issues of authority and gender in Sanskrit epics, the Rāmāyana and the Mahābharata, as they are retold in vernacular languages, songs, and animated films. We learn how Kālī, the most militant goddess in the Devī Māhātmyam, serves in the cause of nationalist politics and how she is "sweetened" and democratized over time. The course culminates in a role-playing game "A virtuous woman? The Abolition of Sati in India, 1829, " which uses an innovative methodology called reacting to the past (RTTP). In RTTP, students research and articulate opinions of historical players through in-character writing and speaking assignments, learning to express themselves with clarity, precision, and force. There is no dearth of stories regarding the dangers of women and sexuality for Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Nath yogis and ascetics. Texts after texts written on ancient, classical, and early modern Asian monasticism point to the evil of women and the dangers they pose to those attempting to live monastic lives. Women, however, have historically been and continue to be involved in these religious traditions. This class will examine the highly gendered worldview found within South and Southeast Asian yogic and monastic texts. Primarily reading Hindu, Nath yogi, Jain, and Buddhist canonical teachings, the class will discuss the manner in which women have historically been viewed within these religious traditions. It will then shift to look at the manner in which women have been and continue to take part in these communities in their everyday life. Through the use of both academic readings and multimedia texts, the class will examine how women navigate their roles within these male-dominated communities, their reasons for joining these communities, and the differences that exist for women within the different monastic and yogic communities.

Focuses on World War II as a global moment when modernity's two sides, its dreams and nightmares, collided. Emphasis on contemporary Asian diaspora Anglophone fiction that probes the exclusions and failures of nation and empire-foundational categories of modernity-from both Western and Asian perspectives. On the one hand, World War II marks prominently the plurality of modernities in our world: as certain nations and imperial powers entered into their twilight years, others were just emerging. At the same time, World War II reveals how such grand projects of modernity as national consolidation, ethnic unification, and imperial expansion have led to consequences that include colonialism, internment camps, the atom bomb, sexual slavery, genocide, and the widespread displacement of peoples that inaugurates diasporas. Diaspora literature thus constitutes one significant focal point where modernity may be critically interrogated. <ref type="bibr">(Same as: ENGL 2005)</ref> Previous terms offered: Fall 2017.</p></div>

Focuses instead on the latecoming figure of the aged narrator in recent Asian American fiction, who constellates themes of dislocation and reclamation, memory, and the body rather than those of maturation and heritage. Explores old age as a vehicle for engaging contemporary issues of globalization and diaspora; historical trauma and cultural memory; life and biopolitics. Examines these works within the paradigm of transnational Asian America, which goes beyond the United States as geographical frame to shed light on the new diasporic identities and cultural politics emerging from twentieth-century global transits.

Examines the two major strands of Buddhism in America: that of immigrant communities and that which is practiced by Americans without preexisting cultural ties to Buddhist traditions. After a brief introduction to Buddhism's emergence and spread in the first millennium, readings trace the differences between these varieties of American Buddhism. Themes to be explored include temples as sources of material, emotional, and spiritual support, Buddhist practices as source of cultural identity and connection to homelands, and religious innovations and controversies among American "converts." These latter include the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and the widespread commercialization of Zen.

The contemporary landscape differs from the "Scramble for Africa, " as it marks a shift from a solidly Western-led initiative to one in which new actors from the global south are taking on more pivotal roles. Superpowers (the United States, China, and Russia), colonial powers (UK, France, and Belgium), and less powerful states (Japan, India, and Brazil) are in competition with emerging African nations (Nigeria and South Africa) for wealth and influence on the continent. The course dedicates considerable time to exploring contemporary interactions between African states and their most significant external partner-China-considering questions of neocolonialism and neoimperialism, and asks students to conclude whether a new scramble for Africa is underway.

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>The mythical fate-driven foundation of Rome and the city's subsequent self-fashioning as caput mundi (capital of the world) have made the city an idea that transcends history, and that has for millennia drawn historians, poets, artists, and, most recently, filmmakers to attempt to capture Rome's essence. As a result, the city defined by its ruins is continually created anew; this synergy between the ruins of Rome -together with the mutability of empire that they represent --and the city's incessant rebirth through the lives of those who visit and inhabit it offers a model for understanding the changing reception of the classical past.

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>In the ancient Mediterranean world, speech was fraught with danger and uncertainty. Words had enormous power-not just the power to do things but a tangible power as things. Words attached themselves to people as physical objects. They lived inside them and consumed their attention. They set events in motion: war, conversion, marriage, death, and salvation. This course investigates the precarious and deadly presence of oral language in the religious world of late antiquity (150 CE to 600 CE). Focusing on evidence from Christian, Jewish, and pagan sources-rabbinic literature, piyyutim, curse tablets, amulets, monastic sayings, creeds, etc.-students will come to understand the myriad ways in which words were said to influence and infect religious actors. For late ancient writers, words were not fleeting or ethereal, but rather quite tactile objects that could be felt, held, and experienced. It is the physical encounter with speech that orients this course. (Same as: REL 3325) Previous terms offered: Spring 2019.</p></div>

Enrollment limit: 18.</p><p>From the folkloric dance forms to popular and secular dance practices, this course journeys through various islands and countries of the Caribbean to learn about their various histories and cultures, including the music, costumes, and basic rhythms associated with each particular dance form. This in-studio course provides a general introduction to some of the sacred and popular dances of the Caribbean. Although movement is the primary work of this course, what we learn in class may be supplemented by readings and outside research. *Please note that no prior experience or training is required. Grading will not be based on technical skill levels, but on mindful, full-bodied participation that demonstrates comprehension and articulation of course materials. An introduction to theatrical design that stimulates students to consider the world of a play, dance, or performance piece from a designer's perspective. Through projects, readings, discussion, and critiques, explores the fundamental principles of visual design as they apply to set, lighting, and costume design, as well as text analysis for the designer and the process of collaboration. Strong emphasis on perceptual, analytical, and communication skills. What is performance? Today it seems as if nearly everything performs: from cars and computers to actors and athletes. Explores the many meanings of performance, particularly art forms such as theater, dance, and media, as well as actions and behaviors in everyday life such as political speeches, rituals, and celebrations. Explores the performing arts as "twice-behaved behavior"-that is, repeatable, embodied activities across both the performing arts and more broadly within culture. Studies what defines performance and also asks how we might use approaches to performance as interpretive lenses. Balances this focus on theory with practice via performance attendance and watching films as well as attending nontheatrical events in order to examine them "as performance." Finally, in order to explore performance as a distinct epistemology or "way of knowing, " students participate in movement workshops in addition to making a culminating performance. Studio work accompanies video viewings and readings on twentiethcentury modern dance and ballet. Focuses on the cultural politics of dance performance --vocabularies and notions of representation, intention, and authorship --and changing ideas of the performance space. Viewing and reading moves chronologically, while studio work addresses global themes such as dance and identity, expressionism, selfreference, and the natural. No previous dance experience is required. Among the many forms of live performance, musical theater remains one of the most popular and successful genres from the nineteenth century to today. Echoes of musical theater appear in films, popular television, and circulate extensively through social media (e.g., #ham4ham). Surveys the cultural history of musical theater from mid-nineteenth-century entertainment in vaudeville and music halls, to contemporary productions on Broadway and in London's West End. Focuses predominantly on American and European productions, while also observing how these performances change as productions travel around the world. Students read scripts, listen to cast recordings, and where possible, watch videos and films of performances. Also considers shows that move from stage to screen (e.g., Rent) and from movies to theater (e.g., " Groundhog Day, The Musical"). (Same as: THTR 1505) DANC 1750 (c) Technical Production Abigail Killeen. Every Semester. Fall 2019. Enrollment limit: 10. .5 Credit Credit/D/F Only.</p><p>Exposes performance arts students to the technical production process for theater and dance performance and serves as a complementary course to Theater 1700: Performance in Production (.5 credit). Students observe and engage with several areas of production through supervised participation in one departmental production, either theater or dance. Students are introduced to all dimensions of technical production, including lighting, set, sound, media, costume design and creation, stage management, and technical direction, among others. Following this overview, students serve as production assistants for a specific production. They attend regular rehearsals and participate in the collaborative creation process. Tasks may also include dramaturgical research, assistant directing, and other support as determined to best benefit the student and their specific goals. Students are very much a part of the production team and are expected to follow professional codes of conduct within the production. The course may be taken on any show, but students in 1750 may not perform in the show associated with the course. This course requirement may be waived by students who are either already engaged in work study in the department, or the requirement can be met by students through an approved and supervised independent study (Theater or Dance 2970/4000) in an area of technical production or design. This course is a continuation of principles explored in DANC 1104 Improvisation, with the addition of techniques and skills for dancing in physical contact. Emphasis is on the partnering duet form, contact improvisation: rolling, how to fall and land softly, how to give and receive weight, how to move with an awareness of sensation. The class is studio focused and will include readings, in-class discussions and watching live and recorded dancing. Musical theater is a popular performance form that challenges students to work in multiple disciplines, combining dance, acting, music, and design. This course will give students with experience in acting, singing, and dancing an opportunity to hone their skills together through the performance of songs and scenes from a variety of musical theater styles. Students will do projects in ballad singing, choral numbers, group dances, and acting the song. Actors, singers, choreographers, and musicians will be encouraged to work together in class and in evening rehearsals toward a public performance on Family Weekend and a cabaret performance at the end of the semester. Performances will be grounded in historical readings and research that contextualizes the origins of the pieces being performed.  Intermediate-level dance technique class. Students are expected to have prior training and/or have received full credit in Modern I. Classes progress through warm-up, center work and phrases across-the-floor. Concepts will be further illuminated through choreographic combinations. Emphasis is placed on musicality, and imagery and breath to stimulate and open energetic pathways in relation to alignment, mobility, and expression. Students will learn how to work individually and move together as a group. Additional work in improvisation and somatics/ anatomy may be included. Builds on the beginning level performances in DANC 1212: Modern I: Repertory and Performance. This course deepens students' work in creative process, rehearsal and performance through the creation of original choreography for the Department Dance Concert. Students will be provided with a clearly defined grading rubric as well as course goals and expectations. Students may be involved in generating movement material as well as engaging in improvisational structures for performance. The course may also feature guest artists and opportunities for student choreography. In semesters when both Dance 2211 and 2212 are offered, it is recommended that students enroll in both simultaneously, but this is not required. A continuation of the fundamental principles of ballet technique as a studio practice and performing art. Includes barre, center, on the floor and across-the-floor exercises with an emphasis on healthy anatomical alignment, complex coordination, movement quality, and musicality. Combines dance training with assigned reading and writing, video viewing, presentation projects, performance attendance, and in-class discussion to increase appreciation for and participation in the art form.  As technology has evolved so has the world of theater and dance. Advanced Design: Media offers students an in-depth look at the technology, theory, and aesthetic involved in creating highly developed projections and graphic sequences for stunning multimedia theater and dance productions. Students will learn the cutting edge 3D computer animation software Autodesk Maya and Adobe Creative Suite to design digital sets for contemporary performance. Assignments will include creating digital landscapes for specific scenes and developing short loop animations for digital prop placement. By the end of the semester students will have re-imagined and developed their original design of a play through computer generated sound and visuals. As technology has evolved, so has the world of theater and dance. Offers students an in-depth look at the technology, theory, and aesthetics involved in lighting design choices for theater and dance productions. Students explore the latest software and technology used by lighting designers, while learning to make their own artistic choices for contemporary performance. Assignments include creating lighting plots for specific scenes and performance events. By the end of the semester, students have reimagined and developed their own original lighting designs for a play or dance project to be presented in class.

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>Puppetry, the animation of inanimate objects in performance, is typically considered a 'small' art form yet it has a sprawling historical, cultural, and aesthetic reach. Venerable theater historian George Speaight highlights puppetry's ubiquitous presence when he says, "Puppet shows seem to have existed in almost all civilizations and in almost all periods . . . It has everywhere antedated written drama and, indeed, writing of any kind. It represents one of the most primitive instincts of the human race." An introduction to puppetry, this course integrates the practical modes of design, construction, and performance with an examination of theories of origin, historical context, and global cultural significance. Through studio projects, individual and group performance, critiques, discussion, readings, video viewing, and research presentations, students will consider, create, and manipulate a variety of puppetry styles including object theater, shadow puppetry, hand puppets, bunraku-type puppets, and rod puppets while exploring what puppetry is, where it came from, its role in the history of western theater, as well as its cultural significance in Asia, Indonesia, Africa, India, and the Middle East.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DANC 2503 (c, ESD, VPA) Introduction to Black Performance Studies</head><p>Every Other Fall. Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>What does it mean to say that we perform our identities? What role can performance play in the fight for racial and social justice?,What role has performance played in shaping the history of black Americans, a people long denied access to literacy? Performance studies--an interdisciplinary field devoted to the study of a range of aesthetic practices--offers us insight into such questions. Investigates various performances, including contemporary plays, movies and television, dance, and social media. Queries the relationships between identities like race, gender, class, and performance as well as the connection between performance onstage and in everyday life. Dance-an art form whose medium is the body-and ethnography-the study of people and their cultures-are great tools for addressing some of the ways different dancing bodies have been historically policed for "dancing sex(y)." Other tools, such as critical dance and black theories, in addition to queer and feminist approaches, will also be utilized to comprehend the uneven ways these bodies are further racialized, sexualized, and gendered within the Americas. In particular, students will learn about various dances (such as the Brazilian samba to the Cuban rumba, Jamaican Dancehall, and the Trinidadian wine) through readings, lectures, and actual in-studio dancing. Ultimately, the intention here is to understand dancing as both a meaning-making activity and a way of understanding the world. In turn, it is an important lens for critically thinking, talking, researching, and writing about politics of identity (especially regarding nationality, gender, race, and sexuality).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EOS 2540 (a, INS) Equatorial Oceanography</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>The equatorial ocean is a region with virtually no seasonal variability, and yet undergoes the strongest interannual to decadal climate variations of any oceanographic province. This key region constitutes one of the most important yet highly variable natural sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Explores how circulation, upwelling, biological activity, biogeochemistry, and CO2 flux in this key region vary in response to rapid changes in climate. Particular emphasis on past, present, and future dynamics of the El Niño Southern Oscillation. In-class discussions are focused on the primary scientific literature. In the 1980s, NASA's satellite program turned some of its space-viewing sensors towards the earth to better understand its processes. Since that time, NASA's Earth Observatory mission has yielded a fleet of satellites bearing an array of sensors that provide a global view of the earth each day. Global-scale ocean properties, including bathymetry, temperature, salinity, wave height, currents, primary productivity, sea ice distribution, and sea level, are revealed through satellite-detection of ultraviolet, visible, infrared and microwave energy emanating from the ocean. These satellite data records currently exceed thirty years in length and therefore can be used to interpret climate-scale ocean responses from space. A semester-long research project, targeted on a student-selected oceanic region, focuses on building both quantitative skills through data analysis and writing skills through iterative writing assignments that focus on communicating data interpretation and synthesis. Coastal oceans lie between the shore and the continental shelves. While they represent less than 10 percent of the global ocean, they are responsible for more than half of the global ocean productivity and are the oceanic regime most experienced by humans. They are also the connection between terrestrial environment and the open ocean, and thus quite sensitive to anthropogenic activities. Interdisciplinary exploration of the coastal ocean includes geologic morphology, tides and coastal currents, river impacts, and coastal ecosystems, with examples taken from global coastal oceans. Weekly labs focus on developing skills in field observation, experimentation, and data analysis in the context of the Gulf of Maine.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>In 1845, Frederick Douglass told his white readers: "You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man." This simple statement effectively describes the enduring paradox of African American male identity: although black and white males share a genital sameness, until the nation elected its first African American president the former has inhabited a culturally subjugated gender identity in a society premised on both white supremacy and patriarchy. But Douglass's statement also suggests that black maleness is a discursive construction, i.e. that it changes over time. If this is so, how does it change? What are the modes of its production and how have black men over time operated as agents in reshaping their own masculinities? Reading a range of literary and cultural texts, both past and present, students examine the myriad ramifications of, and creative responses to, this ongoing challenge.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGL 2651 (c, ESD) Queer Race</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>How does the concept of queerness signify in cultural texts that are ostensibly about the struggle for racial equality? And vice versa, how does the concept of racialization signify in cultural texts that are ostensibly about the struggle for LGBT recognition and justice? While some of this work tends to reduce queer to traditional sexual minorities like lesbigay and trans folk while downplaying racial considerations, others tend to limit the category race to people of color like blacks while downplaying questions about sexuality. Such critical and creative gestures often place queer and race in opposition rather than as intersecting phenomena. Violence and interracial sex have long been conjoined in U.S. literary, televisual, and filmic work. The enduring nature of this conjoining suggests there is some symbolic logic at work in these narratives, such that black/white intimacy functions as a figural stand-in for negative (and sometimes positive) commentary on black/white social conflict. When this happens, what becomes of "sex" as a historically changing phenomenon when it is yoked to the historically unchanging phenomenon of the "interracial"? Although counter-narratives have recently emerged to compete with such symbolic portrayals, i.e. romance novels, popular films and television shows, not all of these works have displaced this earlier figural logic; in some cases, this logic has merely been updated. </p></div>

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Asian American literature is dominated by voices of youth: the child narrator and the bildungsroman genre have long been used by writers to tell not only personal coming-of-age stories but also that of Asian America itself, as a relative newcomer into the American nation-state and its cultural landscape. Focuses instead on the latecoming figure of the aged narrator in recent Asian American fiction, who constellates themes of dislocation and reclamation, memory, and the body rather than those of maturation and heritage. Explores old age as a vehicle for engaging contemporary issues of globalization and diaspora; historical trauma and cultural memory; life and biopolitics. Examines these works within the paradigm of transnational Asian America, which goes beyond the United States as geographical frame to shed light on the new diasporic identities and cultural politics emerging from twentieth-century global transits.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>What does it mean to act (or dance) like an American? In 1840, French writer Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the characteristics of this young nation, the United States of America, and its people could be studied in its theaters. He based this on a few key observations. Theater is a social event, where people gather in groups to watch other groups of people interact. Theater is also an immediate art, performed live in front of a specific audience. Takes its start from Tocqueville's observations by looking at American performances in drama, dance, and theatrical events as reflections of changing American identities. Looks at indigenous and colonial drama, but a majority of the course focuses on drama, musical theater, and dance of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In particular, looks at the ways in which specific performances defined what it meant to be American, as well how individual artists reshaped theater and dance to represent their own diverse identities. As part of the reading, attends to the variety of identities--racial, ethnic, gendered, classed, and religious-that emerge from and continue to define the diversity of America on stage.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Understanding global change requires knowing how the biosphere, geosphere, oceans, ice, and atmosphere interact. An introduction to earth system science, emphasizing the critical interplay between the physical and living worlds. Key processes include energy flow and material cycles, soil development, primary production and decomposition, microbial ecology and nutrient transformations, and the evolution of life on geochemical cycles in deep time. Terrestrial, wetland, lake, river, estuary, and marine systems are analyzed comparatively. Applied issues are emphasized as case studies, including energy efficiency of food production, acid rain impacts on forests and aquatic systems, forest clearcutting, wetland delineation, eutrophication of coastal estuaries, ocean fertilization, and global carbon sinks. <ref type="bibr">Lectures</ref>  In the 1980s, NASA's satellite program turned some of its space-viewing sensors towards the earth to better understand its processes. Since that time, NASA's Earth Observatory mission has yielded a fleet of satellites bearing an array of sensors that provide a global view of the earth each day. Global-scale ocean properties, including bathymetry, temperature, salinity, wave height, currents, primary productivity, sea ice distribution, and sea level, are revealed through satellite-detection of ultraviolet, visible, infrared and microwave energy emanating from the ocean. These satellite data records currently exceed thirty years in length and therefore can be used to interpret climate-scale ocean responses from space. A semester-long research project, targeted on a student-selected oceanic region, focuses on building both quantitative skills through data analysis and writing skills through iterative writing assignments that focus on communicating data interpretation and synthesis. </p></div>

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>In 1845, Frederick Douglass told his white readers: "You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man." This simple statement effectively describes the enduring paradox of African American male identity: although black and white males share a genital sameness, until the nation elected its first African American president the former has inhabited a culturally subjugated gender identity in a society premised on both white supremacy and patriarchy. But Douglass's statement also suggests that black maleness is a discursive construction, i.e. that it changes over time. If this is so, how does it change? What are the modes of its production and how have black men over time operated as agents in reshaping their own masculinities? Reading a range of literary and cultural texts, both past and present, students examine the myriad ramifications of, and creative responses to, this ongoing challenge.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Violence and interracial sex have long been conjoined in U.S. literary, televisual, and filmic work. The enduring nature of this conjoining suggests there is some symbolic logic at work in these narratives, such that black/white intimacy functions as a figural stand-in for negative (and sometimes positive) commentary on black/white social conflict. When this happens, what becomes of "sex" as a historically changing phenomenon when it is yoked to the historically unchanging phenomenon of the "interracial"? Although counter-narratives have recently emerged to compete with such symbolic portrayals, i.e. romance novels, popular films and television shows, not all of these works have displaced this earlier figural logic; in some cases, this logic has merely been updated. </p></div>

Questions how this image of diversity and freedom is squared with Brazil's practices of social control: high rates of economic inequality and police violence, as well as limited reproductive rights. Using carnival and control as frameworks, examines how contemporary Brazilian society articulates gender roles and sexual identities, as well as racial and class hierarchies. While course content focuses on Brazil, topics addressed are relevant to students seeking to understand how institutions of intimacy, propriety, and power are worked out through interpersonal relations.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Newly freed from censorship, Russian filmmakers in the quarter-century between 1990 and 2015 created compelling portraits of a society in transition. Their films reassess traumatic periods in Soviet history; grapple with formerly taboo social problems such as alcoholism, anti-Semitism, and sexual violence; explore the breakdown of the Soviet system; and critique the darker aspects of today's Russia, often through the lens of gender or sexuality-specifically addressing subjects such as machismo, absent fathers, rape, cross-dressing, and birthing. Central are the rapid evolution of post-Soviet Russian society, the emergence of new types of social differences and disparities and the reinvention of old ones, and the changing nature of social roles within the post-Soviet social fabric. <ref type="table">Taught</ref>  </p></div>

Other tools, such as critical dance and black theories, in addition to queer and feminist approaches, will also be utilized to comprehend the uneven ways these bodies are further racialized, sexualized, and gendered within the Americas. In particular, students will learn about various dances (such as the Brazilian samba to the Cuban rumba, Jamaican Dancehall, and the Trinidadian wine) through readings, lectures, and actual in-studio dancing. Ultimately, the intention here is to understand dancing as both a meaning-making activity and a way of understanding the world. In turn, it is an important lens for critically thinking, talking, researching, and writing about politics of identity (especially regarding nationality, gender, race, and sexuality).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GSWS 2651 (c, ESD) Queer Race</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>How does the concept of queerness signify in cultural texts that are ostensibly about the struggle for racial equality? And vice versa, how does the concept of racialization signify in cultural texts that are ostensibly about the struggle for LGBT recognition and justice? While some of this work tends to reduce queer to traditional sexual minorities like lesbigay and trans folk while downplaying racial considerations, others tend to limit the category race to people of color like blacks while downplaying questions about sexuality. Such critical and creative gestures often place queer and race in opposition rather than as intersecting phenomena. There is no dearth of stories regarding the dangers of women and sexuality for Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Nath yogis and ascetics. Texts after texts written on ancient, classical, and early modern Asian monasticism point to the evil of women and the dangers they pose to those attempting to live monastic lives. Women, however, have historically been and continue to be involved in these religious traditions. This class will examine the highly gendered worldview found within South and Southeast Asian yogic and monastic texts. Primarily reading Hindu, Nath yogi, Jain, and Buddhist canonical teachings, the class will discuss the manner in which women have historically been viewed within these religious traditions. It will then shift to look at the manner in which women have been and continue to take part in these communities in their everyday life. Through the use of both academic readings and multimedia texts, the class will examine how women navigate their roles within these male-dominated communities, their reasons for joining these communities, and the differences that exist for women within the different monastic and yogic communities.

Enrollment limit: 15.</p><p>Examines the major postwar writings of the controversial African American author and the role his fiction and nonfiction played in challenging that era's static understandings of racial, gender, and sexual politics. Although Baldwin lived abroad for much of his life, many critics associate the author narrowly with the United States black civil rights and sexual liberation struggles. In recent years, however, Baldwin has increasingly been recognized as a transnational figure and for his invaluable contributions to the discourse of globalization. Indeed, Baldwin's "geographical imagination, " one informed by critical racial literacy, led him to anticipate many of the central insights of contemporary Queer Studies, Whiteness Studies, as well as Employs gender as a theoretical tool to investigate the production, consumption, and representation of popular music in the United States and around the world. Examines how gender and racial codes have been used historically, for example to describe music as "authentic" (rap, rock) or "commercial" (pop, new wave), and at how these codes may have traveled, changed, or re-appeared in new guises over the decades. </p></div>

Enslaved Africans who rebelled against oppression and fled from the plantation system are called maroons and their act, marronage. Except for Queen Nanny of the Jamaican Blue Mountains, only male names have been consecrated as maroons. Yet, enslaved women did fight against slavery and practice marronage. Caribbean writers have made a point of bringing to memory forgotten acts of marronage by women during slavery or shortly thereafter.

Enrollment limit: 12.</p><p>Gender, sexuality, race, and other aspects of identity have come to play a huge role in our public and private lives, and these same issues can be key to understanding how people lived and understood their lives in the past. Through in-class discussion and individual research projects, students in this seminar examine intersections of these concerns with the visual arts produced in the ancient Mediterranean region and medieval Europe (c. 500 BCE-c. 1500 CE), gaining a deeper and richer understanding of how people in the past described themselves and their lives and made sense of individual identities. Specific topics covered will include representations of women and minorities, the roles played by women as makers and patrons of art, and the usefulness of modern categories of sexuality and gender in the context of ancient and medieval art. Explores when, why, and how women organize collectively to challenge political, economic, and social injustice in the late twentieth century. This course investigates how civil rights and labor movements, the rise and fall of dictatorships, and neoliberalism impacted and continues to impact female cultural production and activism in the Americas. In our investigation, we will turn to the intersection between art and activism as we look at a wide range of artistic practices, from literature and film to site-specific performance art and interventionist art. Throughout the semester, we will revisit the following questions as we consider the development of female activism in the Americas: 1) what is the relationship between feminism and activism, 2) can literature and performance be placed at the service of activism, and 3) how does looking at the Americas as a whole enable us to better understand the shared injustices across the North/South divide?

Enrollment limit: 15.</p><p>The fall of the Berlin Wall and the concomitant end of the Cold War ushered in what many cultural critics call the era of globalization. An exploration of how contemporary German culture (1990-present) grapples with both the possibilities and uncertainties presented by globalization. Examines a myriad of cultural texts --films, audio plays, dramas, short fiction, novels, photographs, websites --as well as mass events (i.e., the Love Parade, the 2006 World Cup) within their political, social, and economic contexts to show how Germany's troubled past continues to affect the role it plays on the global stage and how its changing demographics --increased urbanization and ethnic diversity --have altered its cultural and literary landscape. Critically considers issues such as migration, terrorism and genocide, sex tourism, the formation of the European Union, and the supposed decline of the nation-state. Frequent short writings, participation in debates, and a final research project based upon a relevant topic of individual interest are required. All materials and course work in German.

Enrollment limit: 15.</p><p>In German culture, color/hue has played an important role in marking ethnic difference. Investigates the presence of color--metaphorical and actual, as provocative rhetoric and residual thought--in Germany today (e.g., around 2000), before exploring to what extent this presence is a lingering effect of the cultures around 1900 and 1800. In German culture color marks not only "racial difference" (e.g., "black" vs. "white"), but also geographical difference ("tropical colors") or diversity ("Bunte Republik Deutschland"). Considers changing discourse on color and ethnic difference in literary texts and films, all of which serve to illuminate the broader cultural context at three historical junctures: 1800, 1900, and 2000. Considers texts and films in conjunction with non-fiction, including examples from the visual arts (paintings, photographs, "Hagenbecks Völkerschauen"), medical and 'scientific, ' encyclopedic entries, policy statements and advertisements ("Reklamemarken, " commercials), and popular music (hip-hop, lyrics), recognizing, in the process, how German culture ("national identity") defines itself through and against color.

Since Thurgood Marshall orchestrated the NAACP's legal strategy to bring civil rights issues before the court rather than Congress, many other interest groups have followed suit. Investigates the trend of seeking legal change via courts, focusing on the Supreme Court's role in social change by asking two connected questions: first, should the Supreme Court be deciding issues with such far-reaching impacts; second, since the court does wade into these matters, how effective are the justices in moving public opinion and influencing social change? Examines areas of policy in which the court has been particularly active including civil rights, access to abortion, and same-sex marriage, among others.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Fall 2017, Fall 2016.</p></div>

Yet the activities of NGOs vary significantly from one political system to another, most notably differing among developing and developed states and democratic and authoritarian states. In addition, NGOs' role in the political process is being transformed by globalization and the increasingly transnational nature of political activism. Explores the following questions: How do factors such as a state's level of economic development, its political culture, the nature of the political regime, and the arrangement of its political institutions shape NGOs' role and influence in the political process? When and where have NGOs been successful in influencing political developments? How do the growing transnational linkages among NGOs affect their role in domestic politics?

What is the "resource curse?" Begins by putting Africa in the context of global resource extraction, oil in particular. Establishes Africa's long pre-colonial experience with trade in iron, gold, salt, and slaves. The colonial period deepened the reliance of many territories on specific resources, a pattern that continues to the present. Uses Burkina Faso as a specific example of gold extraction, contrasting industrial and artisanal mining. Modern streams of prospectors throughout West Africa echo the California gold rush, but with important distinctions. An introduction to political science, the interplay between national and foreign governments, international and domestic firms, and local and migrant prospectors as they vie for access to valuable resources are highlighted.

As one US Special Forces officer in Iraq noted, counterinsurgency is not just thinking man's warfare, it is the graduate level of war. How do we make sense of the intricate, violent contest between insurgent and counterinsurgent? Why have the United States' wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan been exceedingly drawn out, irregular, and destructive? Connecting classic and critical military texts such as Clausewitz and US Army/Marine Corps operational manuals, with case studies from Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan (contrasting the US and Soviet interventions), entwines political/military theory with battlefield history to deepen understandings of thinking man's warfare.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Spring 2019, Spring 2018, Spring 2016.</p></div>

From teaching evolution to legalizing abortion to accepting climate change, science has been at the center of some of our most persistent political debates. But science is neither as objective nor as detached from society as we commonly assume; it is inextricably bound to cultural, social, and even moral norms. This course uses moments of legal and political tension to explore the complexities of how scientific knowledge is produced, disseminated, and accepted (or rejected). Case studies include the Scopes Trial, the eugenics-era decision in Buck v. Bell, lawsuits against the tobacco industry, and Roe v.

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>A cultural history of what, when, why, and how people eat in China. Explores a history of Chinese food, and more importantly, a history of China through its food. Structured around four historical periods (antiquity, middle period, late imperial, and modern), studies the connections between food and agriculture, politics, religion, health, technology, and literature. From one perspective, examines foodways in China as cultural constructs and introduces topics such as the human adaptation, experimentation, knowledge formation, technological development, cultural appropriation, and value judgment of food. From another, discusses the material aspects of a culinary history, e.g., the biological facts, ecological sensitivities, environmental adaptation, and historical evolution of foodstuffs. In correspondence with the four historical periods, provides opportunities to prepare and eat four meals, each of them designed to convey a broader sense of historical context. The meals include: Han aristocrat's feast (ancient), Song literati party (middle period), Hubei peasant meal (late imperial), and American Chinese takeout (modern). Meals are scheduled on Friday afternoons throughout the semester (not on regular class-meeting days). Attendance at these meals is not mandatory, but provide additional context and experience. Taken together, students are encouraged to reflect both on what food tells us about Chinese history, and how it causes us to reflect on our own everyday lives.

Note: This course is part of the following field(s) of study: Europe. The indigenous peoples of North America have long and diverse histories stretching back over 15,000 years. Since the uniting of the world's two hemispheres at the turn of the sixteenth century, native communities have faced numerous challenges and fallen victim to often unimaginable hardship. Native cultures showed considerable adaptability in the face of these challenges. Through centuries of imperial oppression, American Indians proved determined in fighting for their rights and insisting on their proper place in an evolving environmental, political, and social landscape. These shared struggles led to a dawning sense of a pan-Indian racial and cultural identity in the early nineteenth century.

Taking a transnational approach, considers not only how these decades unfolded in different countries, but also unearths the many flows¬ ¬of ideas, objects, and people that wove diverse movements together. Focuses on developments in North America and Europe and situates them in a fully global context. Note:This course is part of the following field(s) of study: Europe, United States, and Atlantic Worlds. The Cold War was not simply a rivalry between two superpowers but a fully global competition between different models of social, political, and economic development. After reviewing the consolidation of fascism, welfare capitalism, and Stalinism in the 1930s, we study how the precarious alliance between American capitalism and Soviet communism devolved into open conflict after WWII. Since this competition unfolded on a planetary level, with each side struggling to convince the world that its model was superior, this course takes a global approach, surveying such events as the division of Europe, decolonization in Asia and Africa, the wars in Korea and Afghanistan, the Cuban and Iranian revolutions, the civil war in Angola, the rise of Reagan and Gorbachev, and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. In so doing, this course explores such themes as imperialism, revolution, modernization, democratization, nation-building, internationalism, non-alignment, human rights, and neoliberalism.</p></div>

Since ancient times, Sicily has been a crossroads of cultures and civilizations whose influence has created a Babel of languages, customs, and ideas that separates it from, while uniting it to, the mainland.

Enrollment limit: 18.</p><p>The intimacy and immediacy of Catullan lyric and elegiac poetry have often been thought to transcend time and history; in his descriptions of a soul tormented by warring emotions, Catullus speaks to all of us who have felt love, desire, hatred, or despair. Yet Catullus is a Roman poet, indeed, the Roman poet par excellence, under whose guidance the poetic tools once wielded by the Greeks were once and for all transformed by the Roman world of the first century BC. Catullus is a product of his time; in turn, he helps to make his time comprehensible to us. Catullus is studied in all his complexity by engaging the entire literary corpus he has left, and so to understand his crucial role in shaping the Roman poetic genius. Taught concurrently with Latin 3310. T. Lucretius Carus (c. 94-55 BCE) is the author of a poem, "on the nature of things, " composed in six books of didactic-epic hexameters. A student of Epicurean philosophy, Lucretius adapts both the beliefs and protoscientific discoveries of one of classical antiquity's most influential intellectual traditions to Latin poetry; his poem proves a model both for subsequent classical poets and for the rationalist movements of the Renaissance. In this seminar, we will read selections from the poem in Latin, and the entire work in English, and consider recent scholarly approaches to Lucretius's work. We will also devote several weeks at the end of the semester to Lucretius's postclassical influence and reception.

His epic-style Metamorphoses, in fifteen books, gathers together several hundred episodes of classical myth, organized through an elaborate play with chronology, geography, history, philosophy, and politics; the resulting narrative is at once clever, romantic, bleak, and witty, and repeatedly draws attention to its own selfconscious poetics while carrying the reader along relentlessly. Focuses on a close reading of three books in Latin, against the background of the entire poem read in English, and considers at length the ideological contexts for and implications of Ovid's work. Assignments include several projects intended to train students to conduct research in Classics; this seminar counts as a research seminar. </p></div>

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>In 1970, the Chilean Salvador Allende became one of the first Marxists in the world to be democratically elected president of a country. His attempted reforms led to years of social unrest. In 1973, a right-wing military coup led to what would be General Augusto Pinochet's seventeen years of brutal dictatorship. This course discusses that period of Chilean (and Latin American) history through locally produced sources, both from the social sciences and the arts, with a focus on literature <ref type="bibr">(Bolaño, Meruane, Lemebel, Neruda, Lihn)</ref>  Explores when, why, and how women organize collectively to challenge political, economic, and social injustice in the late twentieth century. This course investigates how civil rights and labor movements, the rise and fall of dictatorships, and neoliberalism impacted and continues to impact female cultural production and activism in the Americas. In our investigation, we will turn to the intersection between art and activism as we look at a wide range of artistic practices, from literature and film to site-specific performance art and interventionist art. Throughout the semester, we will revisit the following questions as we consider the development of female activism in the Americas: 1) what is the relationship between feminism and activism, 2) can literature and performance be placed at the service of activism, and 3) how does looking at the Americas as a whole enable us to better understand the shared injustices across the North/South divide?

Seminar. Examines the convergence of politics and spirituality in the musical work of contemporary black women singer-songwriters in the United States. Analyzes material that interrogates and articulates the intersections of gender, race, class, and sexuality generated across a range of religious and spiritual terrains with African diasporic/ black Atlantic spiritual moorings, including Christianity, Islam, and Yoruba. Focuses on material that reveals a womanist (black feminist) perspective by considering the ways resistant identities shape and are shaped by artistic production. Employs an interdisciplinary approach by incorporating ethnomusicology, anthropology, literature, history, and performance and social theory. The Western canon --the repertory of works and composers at the core of classical music --may seem pretty immutable. But in fact works and composers continually fall in and out of it, or move up and down in its hierarchy. At the same time, it has been extraordinarily difficult for the canon to include works by women, people of color, and non-Western composers. Examines the processes of, and pressures on, canon formation from about 1780 until the present and a number of pillars of classical music, from Handel's "Messiah" and Haydn's "Creation" to the symphonies of Shostakovich and the works of Nadia Boulanger's students.</p></div>

Repertoires have included Gaelic folksongs sung in Ireland, a Jimi Hendrix festival, over a dozen works by Eric Whitacre, the music of Bartok sung in his native Hungary, songs of Violetta Parra sung in her native Chile, premieres of new American music for the Society of Composers, Messiah with the Portland Symphony, and the moresche of Lassus at an ACDA convention in Boston. Rehearsals are Monday and Thursdays 4:30-5:40, plus a sectional on either Tuesday or Wednesday.</p></div>

Employs gender as a theoretical tool to investigate the production, consumption, and representation of popular music in the United States and around the world. Examines how gender and racial codes have been used historically, for example to describe music as "authentic" (rap, rock) or "commercial" (pop, new wave), and at how these codes may have traveled, changed, or re-appeared in new guises over the decades. The practice of jazz improvisation and composition offers a tradition rich with innovations in harmony and rhythm. Many of these innovations have become integral to a wide variety of musical styles, including pop, soul, rock, and film music. Provides an opportunity to expand musical understanding and vocabulary for improvisation and composition in a variety of tonal contexts. Bridges analysis and practice, examining a variety of theoretical devices and applying them to performance, composition, and arranging. Exercises include keyboard harmony, solo transcription, improvisation practice, and composition projects. All senior majors must take this course, which involves either a single semester of independent work or the second semester of an honors thesis. In addition to weekly individual meetings with a faculty advisor, students meet as a group with the entire faculty several times during the semester. Must be taken in the spring of the senior year. Open only to senior music majors. Examination of the molecular control of neuronal structure and function. Topics include the molecular basis of neuronal excitability, the factors involved in chemical and contact-mediated neuronal communication, and the complex molecular control of developing and regenerating nervous systems. In the spring of 2019, students enrolling in Molecular Neurobiology have two choices for the lab. They may enroll in a traditional weekly lab (LAB 1 offered on Tuesday), or enroll in an intensive 8-day lab (LAB 2) to be held during the first half of spring break (March 9-16) at Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, in Salisbury Cove, Maine. Participants will stay in dorms and focus solely on lab work for the duration of the lab. This experience will completely replace weekly labs. An advanced seminar covering brain mechanisms that affect behavior in humans and other animals. Topics may include the neural circuits that regulate normal social interactions, learning and memory processes, and/or higher cognitive functions, as well as the relationship between disrupted neural functions and mental disorders. The major emphasis of the course will be on reading and discussing primary research articles in the field of behavioral neuroscience. (Same as: PSYC 3057) Prerequisites: Three of: either PSYC 2050 (same as NEUR 2050) or PSYC 2060 (same as NEUR 2060) or BIOL 2135 (same as NEUR 2135) and PSYC 2510 or either BIOL 1102 or BIOL 1109 and PSYC 2520 or either MATH 1300 or MATH 1400.</p></div>

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>In this course you will learn about the main animal models used in the study of how the nervous system controls motor behavior as animals, including humans, interact with the environment. The course will cover the principal motor systems (including those for walking, flying, swimming, breathing, and others), focusing in particular on bridging the gap between molecular/cellular neuroscience and higher-level perception and behavior. Topics to be covered include neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and functions of the most studied animal behaviors, and the groups of interconnected neurons (termed neural circuits) that control them. Students will read, interpret, analyze, and discuss seminal (classical) and recent scientific papers from influential motor systems neurobiology laboratories. The course will also discuss the relevance of these neuronal motor systems to human diseases. A seminar-style class exploring primary scientific literature focused on the synapse as the fundamental signaling unit of the brain. Focuses on the cell biology, physiology, plasticity, and signal integration of interneuronal communication. Topics will also include recent methodological advances in the study of synaptic function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 1028 (c, FYS) A Philosopher's Dozen</head><p>Fall 2019.</p><p>An introduction to philosophy by way of twelve famous thought experiments. Explores central questions in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics by considering such imaginary scenarios as the runaway trolley, Mary in the black and white room, the ailing violinist, the split-brain transplant, the evil neurosurgeon, twin earth, and the experience machine. What is it that makes you a person, and what is it that makes you the same person as the little kid in your parents' photo album? Philosophers have defended a number of different answers to these questions. According to some, it is persistence of the same soul that makes for personal identity. Others argue that it is persistence of the same body that matters, or the continuity of certain biological processes. Still others contend that it is psychological relations that matter. Canvases all of these answers and considers thought experiments about soul swapping, brain transplants, and Star Trek transporters. Readings from both historical and contemporary sources.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Fall 2018, Fall 2015.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 1043 (c, FYS) The Meaning of Life</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>An examination of the question of whether human existence has a meaning or point, and what it even means to ask this question. Among the topics covered: Would the existence of God (or gods) render life meaningful? Does death make human existence and projects pointless, or does the finitude of human existence instead give our lives and projects meaning and significance? Is there such a thing as the best way to live--or are some ways of living at least better than others--and if so, are these objective, mind-independent facts? Readings include ancient Near Eastern and ancient Greek reflection on the topic (the Epic of Gilgamesh, Ecclesiastes, Aristotle, Epictetus, Epicurus), as well as work by contemporary philosophers and poets (Thomas Nagel, Susan Wolf, Bernard Williams, Wallace Stevens, Wislawa Szymborska, and others).</p><p>Previous terms offered: Fall 2016.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 1045 (c, FYS) Strange Worlds</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>Philosophy challenges us to justify the beliefs that we ordinarily take for granted. Some philosophers argue that commonsense beliefs cannot meet this challenge, and that reality is very different from how things seem. Parmenides argues that there is only one thing. Sextus Empiricus tries to convince us that nobody knows anything (not even that nobody knows anything!). Gottfried Leibniz argues that only minds exist. J. M. E. McTaggart contends that time is unreal. C. L. Hardin denies that anything is colored. Examines these and other strange conclusions and the arguments offered in support of them. Our society is riven by deep and troubling moral controversies. Examines some of these controversies in the context of current arguments and leading theoretical positions. Possible topics include abortion, physicianassisted suicide, capital punishment, sexuality, the justifiability of terrorism, and the justice of war.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Fall 2017, Fall 2015.</p></div>

Enrollment limit: 50.</p><p>Through analysis of different theories of political and social organization represented in classic political philosophy and fiction, examines notions of what contributes to one kind of society being perceived as "better" than another, the roles of private property and families, and the delineation between private and public. Authors may include Robert Heinlein, Ursula K. LeGuin, Alexei Panshin, and others.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Spring 2019, Spring 2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 1434 (c) Free Will and Moral Responsibility</head><p>Every Other Fall. Enrollment limit: 50.</p><p>We hold people responsible for their actions: we get credit and praise for nice things we do or good papers that we write; we are blamed if we break a promise or if we plagiarize a paper. In holding one another responsible in these ways, we seem to presuppose that people have free will, for it seems that we should not hold people responsible if they did not The central problem of logic is to determine which arguments are good and which are bad. To this end, we introduce a symbolic language and rigorous, formal methods for seeing whether one statement logically implies another. We apply these tools to a variety of arguments, philosophical and otherwise, and demonstrate certain theorems about the formal system we construct.</p><p>Previous terms offered: <ref type="bibr">Fall 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, Fall 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, Fall 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Fall 2015</ref> PHIL 2233 (a, MCSR) Advanced Logic Every Other Spring. Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Investigates several philosophically important results of modern logic, including Gödel's incompleteness theorems, the Church-Turing Theorem (that there is no decision procedure for quantificational validity), and Tarski's theorem (the indefinability of truth for formal languages). Also includes an introduction to modal logic and the logic of necessity and possibility. Analyzes and evaluates the main approaches in the philosophy of art. Many modern and postmodern artworks challenge us to figure out why, on any theory, they would count as art at all. Our aim is to highlight the rich diversity of art in order to convey the difficulty of coming up with suitable theories, especially in light of the expanding mediascape of digital culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 2341 (c) Philosophy of Law</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>An introduction to legal theory. Central questions include: What is law? What is the relationship of law to morality? What is the nature of judicial reasoning? Particular legal issues include the nature and status of privacy rights; the legitimacy of restrictions on speech and expression; the nature of equality rights; and the right to liberty. Science is often thought of as the paradigm of rational inquiry, as a method that gives us an unparalleled ability to understand the nature of the world. Others have doubted this rosy picture, and have emphasized historical and sociological aspects of the practice of science. Investigates the nature of science and scientific thought by looking at a variety of topics, including the demarcation of science and non-science, relativism and objectivity, logical empiricism, scientific revolutions, and scientific realism. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 2430 (c) Epistemology</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>What is knowledge, and how do we get it? What justifies us in believing certain claims to be true? Does knowing something ever involve a piece of luck? Is it possible that we lack knowledge of the external world altogether? An introduction to the theory of knowledge, focusing on contemporary issues. Considers various conceptions of what it takes to have knowledge against the background of the skeptical challenge, as well as topics such as self-knowledge and the problem of induction.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Spring 2018. Examines contemporary theories of racism prominent in philosophy, social psychology, sociology, and history. Though we will read widely across disciplines, our focus is philosophical: What is racism? Who gets to define the term? What's at stake in defining it? How do issues of implicit racial bias, hate speech, xenophobia, dehumanization, oppression, and ideology (to name just a few intersections) enter competing theories? Is racism fundamentally mental, institutional, some combination of both, or what? Can a single definition accommodate everything that is called "racism, " or do we need multiple definitions? Is "racism" overused to the point of diminishing the term's moral force/ opprobrium? These are some of the issues we'll explore. There will be a lot of dense reading for this course. Reading and comprehending assigned texts and keeping tabs of points of disagreement and convergence among authors will prove crucial to successful completion of this course.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 3325 (c) Utilitarianism and Its Critics</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 15.</p><p>How should we decide what to do? Utilitarianism is the view that the right act is the act that produces the greatest happiness of the greatest number-an appealing view in many respects, since we do want to be happy. However, it doesn't give much respect to the value of the individual or the value of liberty. Utilitarians argue that happiness is so desirable that it is worth sacrificing these other things. Examines the arguments in the debate between those who value only the maximization of happiness and those who think happiness must sometimes take second place to other things, one of the most important issues in ethics. This advanced seminar will consider the value of liberty: whether it has intrinsic value or is simply valuable as a means to an end. If it is merely valuable as a means to an end, when may those ends be achieved through other means than the use of personal liberty? We will read some of the classic works on liberty (such as J.S. Mill and John Locke, Isaiah Berlin's differentiation between positive and negative liberty, and Robert Nozick's defense of libertarianism) and contemporary essays that address the value of liberty in the personal and political sphere.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 3422 (c) Nihilism and Naturalism</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 15.</p><p>Various areas of metaphysics (e.g., philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, metaethics, philosophy of religion) raise questions about the nature and existence of phenomena that seem central to being a person: mind, meaning, and value. Some skeptical philosophers argue that belief in such things would commit us to a kind of unscientific magic. However, if we deny the existence of mind, meaning, and value, it can seem that we collapse into a nihilistic abyss in which nothing makes sense, even the scientific worldview that brought us these problems. Philosophers attempt to find a comfortable middle ground between the extremes, but the question is whether any such position is stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 3432 (c) The Story of Analytic Philosophy</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>Analytic philosophy is commonly regarded as the dominant school in contemporary philosophy. However, there is no set of doctrines common to all analytic philosophers, nor is there any one thing that could properly be termed the method of analytic philosophy. The term "analytic philosophy, " if useful at all, indicates a shared set of concerns, a shared predilection for clarity of argument, and a shared history of the most eminent figures in the tradition. This course examines that story from 1879 through the late twentieth century, including works by Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rudolf Carnap, W. V. Quine, Donald Davidson, and Saul Kripke. Topics include objectivity and truth; the foundations of mathematics; and the nature of language, theories, evidence, and meaning.</p><p>Prerequisites: Two of: either PHIL 1000 -2969 or PHIL 3000 or higher and either PHIL 1000 -2969 or PHIL 3000 or higher.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Fall 2017.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 3455 (c) Ideas and Common Sense</head><p>Non-Standard Rotation. Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>Traces the rise and fall of one of the great epistemological innovations of modern philosophy, the so-called "theory of ideas." According to this theory, thinking involves the manipulation of mental items and sense perception is mediated by awareness of them. The theory is put forward by Descartes, but receives its fullest treatment in Locke's "Essay, " where it is used to explain perceptual relativity, secondary qualities, the constraints on scientific explanation, and even our inability to perceive fast and slow motions. Later, Hume uses the theory to justify a far-reaching skepticism about causation and about enduring things. The theory's sharpest and most insightful critic is Reid, the Scottish philosopher of common sense whose methodological views prefigure the "ordinary language" movement of the twentieth century.</p><p>Prerequisites: PHIL 1000 -2969 or PHIL 3000 or higher.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Fall 2018.</p></div>

Does not direct students to seek authentic insights into orthodox or doctrinal religion in the literary texts but to explore the tensions between textual religion and everyday lived reality in South Asia. In this exploration of Hindu texts, we delve into some of the most ancient and beloved literature from the Indian subcontinent. Students read major scriptural sources, including the Vedas and Upanishads. In our study of the epics (the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, including the Bhagavad Gita), we discuss translations from Sanskrit and popular retellings of these stories into other languages and media.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Examines monastic communities throughout South and Southeast Asia and the ways they have been at the forefront of right-wing religious politics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Across Asia, Hindu and Buddhist monks have been playing a political role that some consider contradictory to their spiritual image. Investigates how various monastic communities harness political power today, as well as how different communities in early-modern Asia used their spiritual standing and alleged supernatural powers to influence emperors and kings. Uses the practice of human sacrifice to investigate the relationship between religion and violence. As an act of choreographed devotion, sacrifice implicates notions of debt, transformation, exchange, purification, sacredness, death, and rebirth. It is a ritual designed to destroy for an effect, for an explicit if often intangible gain. On the one hand, human sacrifice involves all of these same issues and yet, on the other, it magnifies them by thrusting issues of agency, autonomy, and choice into the mixture. Must a sacrificial victim go peaceably? Otherwise, would the act simply be murder? Investigates the logic of human sacrifice. How have religions across history conceptualized and rationalized the role and status of the human victim? Considers a diverse range of examples from the Hebrew Bible, Greek tragedies, the New Testament, science fiction, epics, missionary journals and travelogues, horror films, and war diaries.</p><p>Previous terms offered: Fall 2018, Fall 2015.</p><p>REL 2232 (c, IP) Approaches to the Qur'an Every Other Spring.

Enrollment limit: 16.</p><p>In the ancient Mediterranean world, speech was fraught with danger and uncertainty. Words had enormous power-not just the power to do things but a tangible power as things. Words attached themselves to people as physical objects. They lived inside them and consumed their attention. They set events in motion: war, conversion, marriage, death, and salvation. This course investigates the precarious and deadly presence of oral language in the religious world of late antiquity (150 CE to 600 CE). Focusing on evidence from Christian, Jewish, and pagan sources-rabbinic literature, piyyutim, curse tablets, amulets, monastic sayings, creeds, etc.-students will come to understand the myriad ways in which words were said to influence and infect religious actors. For late ancient writers, words were not fleeting or ethereal, but rather quite tactile objects that could be felt, held, and experienced. It is the physical encounter with speech that orients this course. (Same as: CLAS 3325) Previous terms offered: Spring 2019.</p></div>

Puppetry, the animation of inanimate objects in performance, is typically considered a 'small' art form yet it has a sprawling historical, cultural, and aesthetic reach. Venerable theater historian George Speaight highlights puppetry's ubiquitous presence when he says, "Puppet shows seem to have existed in almost all civilizations and in almost all periods . . . It has everywhere antedated written drama and, indeed, writing of any kind. It represents one of the most primitive instincts of the human race."

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>What does it mean to act (or dance) like an American? In 1840, French writer Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the characteristics of this young nation, the United States of America, and its people could be studied in its theaters. He based this on a few key observations. Theater is a social event, where people gather in groups to watch other groups of people interact. Theater is also an immediate art, performed live in front of a specific audience. Takes its start from Tocqueville's observations by looking at American performances in drama, dance, and theatrical events as reflections of changing American identities. Looks at indigenous and colonial drama, but a majority of the course focuses on drama, musical theater, and dance of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In particular, looks at the ways in which specific performances defined what it meant to be American, as well how individual artists reshaped theater and dance to represent their own diverse identities. As part of the reading, attends to the variety of identities--racial, ethnic, gendered, classed, and religious-that emerge from and continue to define the diversity of America on stage.

Different scholars have presented the American Revolution as either a radically egalitarian movement for universal human rights or as a fundamentally conservative rebellion led by elite men striving to protect their wealth and power from both the British Parliament and those occupying the lower rungs of American society.

Except for Queen Nanny of the Jamaican Blue Mountains, only male names have been consecrated as maroons. Yet, enslaved women did fight against slavery and practice marronage. Caribbean writers have made a point of bringing to memory forgotten acts of marronage by women during slavery or shortly thereafter. Proposes to examine the fictional treatment Frenchspeaking Caribbean authors grant to African or Afro-descent women who historically rebelled against slavery and colonization. Literary works studied against the backdrop of douboutism, a conceptual framework derived from the common perception about women in the French Caribbeanwhich means strong woman.

Contemporary migration and globalization patterns have transformed where and how religious traditions are practiced, radically altering the landscape of local religion around the world. While migration has been integral to the development of many religious traditions, this course considers the role of colonialism, transnational religious networks, and the global flow of people and ideas in the creation of new religious identities. Readings highlight debates about the relation of religion to gender, ethnicity, and nationality, including the global popularity of yoga, Hindu identity in diaspora, transnational networks of Islamic learning, and changing gender norms in Buddhist monasteries. Through historical primary sources and recent ethnographies, this course focuses on questions such as: How is religious identity transformed by migration? Do religious rituals change in diaspora?

The struggle against anti-black racism has often required that individual African Americans serve as representative figures of the race. How have twentieth-and twenty-first-century black authors tackled the challenge of having to speak for the collective while also writing narratives that explore the singularity of an individual life? What textual approaches have these authors employed to negotiate this tension between what theorists of the genre broadly call referentiality and subjectivity? Authors include W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Malcolm X, Jamaica Kincaid, Maya Angelou, Samuel Delaney, Barack Obama, among others. Note: Fulfills the literature of the Americas requirement for English majors.

Enrollment limit: 35.</p><p>Examines the two major strands of Buddhism in America: that of immigrant communities and that which is practiced by Americans without preexisting cultural ties to Buddhist traditions. After a brief introduction to Buddhism's emergence and spread in the first millennium, readings trace the differences between these varieties of American Buddhism. Themes to be explored include temples as sources of material, emotional, and spiritual support, Buddhist practices as source of cultural identity and connection to homelands, and religious innovations and controversies among American "converts." These latter include the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and the widespread commercialization of Zen. There is no dearth of stories regarding the dangers of women and sexuality for Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Nath yogis and ascetics. Texts after texts written on ancient, classical, and early modern Asian monasticism point to the evil of women and the dangers they pose to those attempting to live monastic lives. Women, however, have historically been and continue to be involved in these religious traditions. This class will examine the highly gendered worldview found within South and Southeast Asian yogic and monastic texts. Primarily reading Hindu, Nath yogi, Jain, and Buddhist canonical teachings, the class will discuss the manner in which women have historically been viewed within these religious traditions. It will then shift to look at the manner in which women have been and continue to take part in these communities in their everyday life. Through the use of both academic readings and multimedia texts, the class will examine how women navigate their roles within these male-dominated communities, their reasons for joining these communities, and the differences that exist for women within the different monastic and yogic communities.
