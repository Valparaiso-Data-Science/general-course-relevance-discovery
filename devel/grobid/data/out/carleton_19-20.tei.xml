Carleton College was founded by the Minnesota Conference of Congregational Churches under the name of Northfield College on November 14, 1866. Preparatory school classes began in September 1867, but it was not until 1870, when the Reverend James W. Strong took office as the first president, that the first college class was formed and construction on the first on-campus building was begun. It was agreed at the outset that after one year formal church control should end, but throughout its formative years the College received significant support and direction from the Congregational churches.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Carleton chose not to demolish the historic old middle school when planning for the Weitz Center for Creativity, rather, entire sections of the original 1910 and 1934 structures were either preserved or recycled. The following materials have been reclaimed for use in the new facility: mosaic tile floor, ornate ironwork on a main staircase, wood from the bleachers in the former gym which was reused as wall covering, wood seats from the 1930s-era auditorium which appear as a sculpture installation on the ceiling leading to the new cinema, much of the original woodwork and trim, and slate from the original blackboards. Many details helped the Weitz Center for Creativity achieve LEED gold certification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Programs</head><p>Well over a century ago, Carleton started promising its students a "liberal and thorough" education. That goal is embodied still in the College's requirements for graduation, which are designed to expose students to a wide variety of disciplines, as well as to allow them to concentrate on a major subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Requirements</head><p>To receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton, a student must earn at least 210 credits and a cumulative grade point average of C (2.0) or better.</p><p>Liberal Arts Requirements: <ref type="bibr">(AI, Curricular Exploration, Global Citizenship, Writing, QRE and PE)</ref> A good liberal arts education requires not only rigor and depth, but also sufficient breadth to expose students to a wide range of subjects and methods of studying them. The college seeks to ensure that its students study one field in depth by requiring a major and an integrative exercise within the major. It encourages students to acquaint themselves with the major divisions of knowledge and modes of inquiry by requiring them to complete six credits with grades of S or Cor better from each of six curricular exploration areas.</p><p>Students must also complete an Argument and Inquiry seminar and fulfill requirements in writing, quantitative reasoning, global citizenship (international studies, intercultural domestic studies, and demonstrate proficiency in a second language), and complete four terms of physical education. Successful completion of all course and credit requirements requires grades of S or Cor better in each course.</p><p>Finally, students must spend six academic terms in residence at Carleton, including their senior year (last three academic terms), and earn at least 108 credits enrolled at Carleton.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Argument and Inquiry Seminars (AI) -6 credits</head><p>All first-year non-transfer students must take an Argument and Inquiry (AI) seminar in their first term. Each fall term, the College offers over thirty AI seminars designed to introduce students to a liberal arts approach to learning and to develop the critical and creative skills they will need to thrive in academic work at Carleton. Offered in many different subject areas across the curriculum, AI courses share certain structural elements and a set of common goals. AI courses are small, discussion-based seminars, and carry the WR (writing rich) designation. Designed to foster students' intellectual independence, these courses develop habits of critical thinking, clarify how scholars ask questions, and teach students how to find and evaluate information in reading and research and to use it effectively and ethically in constructing arguments. Encouraging students to become collaborative learners and active members of Carleton's learning and living community, AI seminars strengthen students' habits of cooperation with peers and offer opportunities and tools for critical reading, deliberative discussion, and effective college-level writing.</p><p>Curricular Exploration Requirements -36 credits; 6 credits in each of <ref type="bibr">6 areas</ref> Arts Practice (ARP) The act of imagining and creating art is an important way of understanding and knowing art and the creative process. At least six credits are required in courses in which students develop an appreciation of artistic creative practice through experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formal or Statistical Reasoning (FSR)</head><p>The development of logical systems, formal models, abstract mathematical reasoning, and statistical reasoning has been foundational to intellectual development in many disciplines. At least six credits are required in courses that focus on methods of formal reasoning including mathematics, logic, and the design and analysis of algorithms or statistical reasoning.</p><p>Humanistic Inquiry (HI) At least six credits are required in courses in which students are introduced to humanistic inquiry with an emphasis in its historical, cultural, ethical, and/or intellectual contexts.</p><p>Literary/Artistic Analysis (LA) At least six credits are required in courses in which there is an emphasis on analysis of literature or the visual and performing arts.</p><p>Science with Lab (LS) Modern citizenship requires an understanding of the processes and methods of the natural sciences. At least six credits are required in courses that focus on developing an appreciation of the scientific study of the natural world. Courses must include a lab component to qualify. In the case of a student using a six-credit course/two-credit lab pair to satisfy the LS requirement, a grade of C-or better must be earned in each paired course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Inquiry (SI)</head><p>The study of human and social behavior and how these are shaped by, and shape, socially constructed institutions is essential to a liberal education. At least six credits are required in courses that focus on the variety of disciplinary approaches to the study of individuals and societies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Citizenship</head><p>Language Requirement: Language is the way that members of a culture organize and encode their thoughts, allowing them to communicate with each other. Moreover, language shapes one's relationship with other people, and different languages will shape that relationship differently.</p><p>At Carleton we think that a liberally educated student should understand the way language is embedded within cultural practices and worldviews. To this end, we expect students to cross linguistic borders, experiencing another language "from the inside." In addition to the primary benefits a degree of competency in a language can offer (including basic communication, the ability to read foreign texts, and interaction with those of a different culture), the study of a foreign language provides students with a fuller understanding of the role played by their own native tongue. Also, crucially, it requires each student to experience the challenges of dealing with other cultures and peoples on their own terms. Language learning at Carleton, therefore, advances and supports the stated values and goals of the College's Mission Statement.</p><p>The four basic language skills for most modern languages (reading, speaking, aural comprehension, and writing) are mutually reinforcing as well as individually valuable, although the emphasis will vary among different language sections and individual teaching styles. In special cases, students' strengths (in speaking, for instance) might make up for weaknesses in reading and writing, and vice versa.</p><p>The requirement aims to assure that students will acquire a usable level of competence in a second language. This competence is demonstrated either (a) through successful completion of a fourth-level language course (fifth-level in Arabic, Chinese or Japanese) or <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref> through acceptable performance on a standardized or departmentally designed examination. Fluent speakers of second languages may ask to be tested for fulfillment of the requirement or, in the case of languages not offered at Carleton, may ask that testing be arranged. Students whose native language is other than English may fulfill this requirement by demonstrating competence in their native language, as well as English.</p><p>Entering students may fulfill the requirement by satisfactory performance on a College Board Advanced Placement or Achievement test, International Baccalaureate Higher Level examination or on another placement examination most appropriate for the particular language. Students who have not taken such a test before entering the college should take the language placement examination either during the summer prior to matriculation or during their first week at Carleton. Students beginning their study of language, as well as those who need more study to complete the requirement, should enroll in language in their first year.</p><p>Students who complete language courses equivalent to courses 101 through 204 (205 in Arabic/Chinese/Japanese) at domestic post-secondary institutions after being enrolled at Carleton may take the appropriate placement or proficiency examinations to gain advanced standing or exemption. Credit toward the degree is typically not awarded, however.</p><p>Language study at Carleton aims at far more than the satisfaction of the requirement. Students are encouraged to increase their proficiency through advanced courses and study abroad and to apply their language skills in their academic work in other areas. With this foundation, language will enrich their studies at Carleton and enable graduates to become contributing members of the multi-cultural world.</p><p>International Studies (IS) -6 credits: Courses that meet the IS requirement contain a geographic scope broader than the United States and by pedagogy and/or content develop in students an understanding of other perspectives on global, comparative, and historical subjects. Courses mostly focused on the United States but with a notable comparative or transnational component may satisfy the requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intercultural Domestic Studies (IDS) -6 credits:</head><p>Courses that meet the IDS requirement focus on the United States. Course content addresses the role of identity and status in shaping the experiences of American society. Scope of instruction can be historical and comparative and include opportunities for reflection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing Requirement</head><p>The ability to write well is particularly important in college, not only as a means of demonstrating mastery of material, but as part of the process of coming to that mastery. For many people, writing well is a life-long learning process. As students develop greater understanding of themselves, the world, and language, they become more adept at expressing precisely, and perhaps eloquently, what they have in mind. The Carleton Writing Requirement is meant to be a checkpoint on that journey, not the final destination. It is a measure of progress and assurance that Carleton students are on the right path, and that with continued learning, they will develop into fully competent writers by graduation.</p><p>To guide students as they begin to work on writing at the college level, the College has developed some general criteria for good writing at Carleton. Although individual assignments, genres, or disciplines may place more or less emphasis on each criterion, faculty agree that student writing should feature the following:</p><p>Students are required to successfully complete 1) the AI seminar (WR1), 2) six credits of additional coursework designated WR2 and 3) successfully complete a writing portfolio to be reviewed by faculty after the third term, and no later than the sixth term.</p><p>For further information, see the Writing Rich Guidelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Reasoning Encounter (QRE) -Three courses</head><p>Students will complete three courses that have been designated as providing quantitative reasoning encounters <ref type="bibr">(QRE)</ref>. Quantitative reasoning -the inclination and ability to interpret, assess, and use quantitative information in one's scholarly work, civic activities, and personal life -is recognized by the College as a vital part of a liberal education for each student. Through multiple exposures to examples of quantitative reasoning a student will better appreciate the ways that quantitative evidence is developed and used. Courses offering meaningful opportunities for this exposure will be designated as quantitative reasoning encounters.</p><p>The goal of the requirement is to increase students' appreciation for the power of QR and to enhance their ability to evaluate, construct, and communicate arguments using quantitative information. A course designated as a "Quantitative Reasoning Encounter" (QRE) will include at least one substantial assignment or module designed to enhance one or more of the following QR skills:</p><p>1. Possessing the habit of mind to consider what numerical evidence might add to the analysis of a problem; 2. Identifying appropriate quantitative or numerical evidence to address a question; 3. Locating or collecting numerical or quantitative data; 4. Interpreting numerical evidence properly including recognizing the limitations of methods and sources used; 5. Effectively communicating arguments that involve numerical or quantitative evidence.</p><p>Since an example of work demonstrating an ability to employ quantitative or numerical evidence in arguments is an element of the Writing Portfolio, students are strongly advised to take QRE courses early in their academic careers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical Education</head><p>Four terms of Physical Education activity are to be taken by each student. Only one activity per term may count toward this requirement. The Physical Education program includes a variety of activity courses, designed to appeal to students. We believe that physical activity can contribute to students' health and well-being now and in the future. Special Majors: A student seeking a major not offered in the College's established curriculum may propose a self-designed special major for approval by the Academic Standing Committee. All special majors involve close consultation with two faculty advisers. Students are expected to petition for special majors during the sixth term of their academic career. For additional information, see the Registrar's Office.</p><p>Integrative Exercises vary from department to department. Intended to help students relate the subjects they have studied in their major field, they sometimes take the form of comprehensive examinations covering the fundamentals of the discipline. In other departments, extensive research projects, papers or public lectures are required. Departments may award a minimum of three and a maximum of fifteen academic credits for the integrative exercise. For more information, refer to the individual departmental listing or speak to the department chair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Regulations</head><p>Academic policies are published in the online handbook "Academic Regulations and Procedures" on the Campus Handbook web page. This is the publication of record in matters regarding academic policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progress</head><p>Carleton students are normally expected to complete their work in four years and may be dropped from the College if they have not earned at least 42 credits and a cumulative GPA of 1.8 at the end of three terms; 96 credits and a GPA of 2.0 at the end of six terms; and 150 credits; and a GPA of 2.0 at the end of nine terms. (These are the lower limits allowed and do not indicate normal progress; that is closer to 54 credits, 108 credits and 162 credits, respectively.)</p><p>For graduation, a minimum of 210 credits and a GPA of 2.0 is required. A student whose record in the judgment of the Academic Standing Committee indicates an inability to fulfill the College requirements for whatever reason may be suspended or dismissed at the end of fall or winter term as well as at the end of the academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Residence Requirements</head><p>Normally it takes four years to complete the work for graduation, of which at least six terms, including the senior year (last three academic terms), must be spent in residence at Carleton. Some exceptions to the senior residency rule may be given by the Academic Standing Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Study</head><p>Carleton does not ordinarily give degree credit for courses taken elsewhere during the summer. Permission may occasionally be given if the student cannot otherwise graduate in twelve terms, but it must be requested in advance from the Academic Standing Committee, and the department chair may specify at that time that credit will be granted only upon special examination after the completion of the course. Petition forms are available on the Academic Standing Committee website. Credit may be earned during the summer on approved off-campus study programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Honors</head><p>Students are graduated with "Distinction in a Major" if they achieve distinction in the departmental integrative exercise and a cumulative grade point average of 3.50 in all departmental courses taken in the major. Outstanding seniors in the field of music performance will be selected by Music faculty for the "Honors in Music Performance" award. Students who have outstanding records in all course work will earn the Bachelor of Arts degree with honors. Honors will be awarded to students with a grade point average in the top 2 percent of their graduating class (summa cum laude), those in the remainder of the top 15 percent (magna cum laude), and those in the remainder of the top 30 percent (cum laude).</p><p>The honor of "Dean's List" may be earned by first-year students, sophomores and juniors whose previous academic year's GPA places them in the top 10 percent of their class. Eligibility for Dean's List assumes three terms of academic work, the bulk of which is done at Carleton. Students on non-Carleton off-campus programs for one term are eligible for Dean's List if their off-campus grades are comparable to those they maintained at Carleton. Students off campus for two or more terms on a non-Carleton program are not eligible in that year. Students on leave for a term are not eligible in that year. This honor is recognized at Opening Convocation in September of the following year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses of Instruction</head><p>The Departments of Instruction pages list courses offered at the College. They also contain general information about various departmental programs and their requirements for a major. In addition to departmental listings, offerings are organized by area studies, which are special courses of study, and by minors, which represent either an integrated disciplinary or an interdisciplinary program of study.</p><p>Courses are numbered with the following general scheme:</p><p>• 000-099 Pre-College • 100 Argument and Inquiry Seminar <ref type="bibr">• 101-199</ref>  Students may pursue independent study, independent research, or independent reading in more than one term. Ordinarily, this work is not on the introductory level. In some cases, it can be an academic follow-up to an internship experience. By registration time for the term in which the study is done, the student is expected to obtain a faculty supervisor in the chosen field of interest and, with their assistance and approval, determine the nature and purpose of the study and the number of credits to be assigned. Course credit for these various independent study options is determined by arrangement with the instructor before registration, and may be for one to six credits.</p><p>Although not noted separately under departmental course listings, independent study options are available across the curriculum. Forms are available in the Registrar's Office and on the Registrar's Office website. Independent study, in any form, does not count toward Argument and Inquiry, Curricular Exploration, Writing, Quantitative Reasoning Encounter, or Global Citizenship requirements.</p><p>• Independent Study is an individual, non-research, directed study in a field of special interest, under the supervision of a faculty member. It allows a student to pursue an academic interest outside the listed course offerings, or explore in more depth an area of study that has been encountered in a previous course. An Independent Study should culminate in several short papers, a single paper, or any other project acceptable to the supervising faculty member and the student. • Independent Reading: In an Independent Reading, a student will read a body of material, with a syllabus devised and agreed upon in collaboration with a faculty supervisor. Typically the student would be expected to meet regularly with the supervising member (for example, weekly). • Independent Research: Independent Research provides an opportunity for a student to pursue research in a field of special interest, under the supervision of a faculty member or in close partnership with a faculty member. The research undertaken should be designed as an investigation yielding original results or a creative product that contributes to the area of study. While it may not be possible to bring a project to fruition within the confines of our academic term, an Independent Research course should culminate in the student's own contribution to a discipline or field of study, whether in the form of fully-supported conclusions or completed creative product, or in the substantive progress toward such a goal.</p><p>Advanced Departmental Seminars <ref type="bibr">(395)</ref> Departmental seminars are usually open only to departmental majors, or by consent of the instructor involved. Because the topics vary from year to year, some students are able to register for more than one departmental seminar during their college program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minors</head><p>All students at Carleton must complete an academic major. In addition, students may elect to complete a minor as part of their academic program. A minor represents either an integrated disciplinary or an interdisciplinary program of study that may strengthen and complement a major, but a student pursuing any major can potentially pursue a minor in a different discipline. Disciplinary minors recognize the students acquisition of in-depth knowledge of a single discipline; interdisciplinary minors recognize the completion of a program of study that links and integrates multiple academic disciplines. Minors are also intended to promote communities of learning and may offer opportunities to relate academic studies to issues that students confront outside of Carleton. Full descriptions of the minors are included in the alphabetical listing of departments and programs. Minors offered for the current academic year are: By special arrangement a limited number of students may take courses at St. Olaf College which are not offered at Carleton. Graded course credit will be granted; enrollment requires the permission of the instructor and the registrar at each institution. For additional information, see the Registrar's Office.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Africana</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departments of Instruction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Africana Studies</head><p>The program in Africana Studies provides a cross-culturally and historically comparative framework to study the rich connections and exchanges among African people, their descendants, and the various "new worlds" in which they have made and are making their lives. A particular strength of Carleton's Africana Studies program is the opportunity to explore these issues on the African continent as well as in numerous African diasporas--of varying historical depth--in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Africana Studies combines area studies and ethnic studies foci on the cultural, literary, political, social, and intellectual responses to slavery, colonialism, missionization, and racialization throughout Africa and its many diasporas.</p><p>Students can pursue their intellectual interests in Africa and its diasporas through on-campus courses and off-campus studies programs (including programs offered through Carleton's departments of History and Environmental Studies), and through a rich variety of courses in nearly all curricular exploration divisions. Through multidisciplinary training, students are encouraged to develop their analytic, research, and literary skills; they acquire the intellectual tools to critique and correct the distortions and silences about Africans and their descendants in both academic canons and public discourse.</p><p>The Africana Studies major thus prepares students for lifetime engagement in scholarship as well as in fields such as law, public policy, education, public health, social work, and the arts. Toward this end, and in addition to coursework, students are encouraged to take advantage of the rich array of speakers, exhibits, co-curricular, and extracurricular activities related to Africans and their diasporas.</p><p>Students majoring in Africana Studies create their own program of study by choosing courses in a structured and reflective manner from a variety of disciplinary departments. In developing their program, students should talk to the department about courses that have particularly high African, African Diaspora, and/or African American Studies content. They are particularly encouraged to choose these courses from among the list of relevant courses. Courses marked AFSTPERT can complement the major, but do not count toward the required nine courses plus comprehensive exercise without special permission of the Program Director. Because of the complexities of creating a meaningful program from a wide array of departmental offerings, students interested in majoring should draw up a program of study that has breadth and depth in consultation with the Director of Africana Studies before declaring their major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Africana Studies Major</head><p>Admission to the program will depend upon the acceptance, by the Africana Studies Committee, of a written proposal outlining the student's program of study. Courses cannot double count for two requirements.</p><p>• Interdisciplinary Course <ref type="bibr">(6 credits</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(30 credits)</ref>. Each student should take 30 credits of distribution that are essential to Africana Studies. Among these distribution courses, students must choose at least one 6-credit course each from among the three disciplinary groups: Humanistic Inquiry, Social Inquiry and Literary and Artistic Analysis; at least four of the distribution courses must be at the 200-level or above and at least one at the 300-level. The 300-level course should be completed in one of the two disciplines in which the student writes his/her comprehensive exercise; in this course the student must produce a substantial paper or project in Africana Studies. In addition, majors are highly encouraged to take the <ref type="bibr">AMST</ref>     <ref type="bibr">(3 credits)</ref> This 3-credit course gives Africana Studies majors and minors the opportunity to apply what they have learned by preparing for and presenting at the annual National Council for Black Studies (NCBS) conference. Under the guidance of Africana Studies faculty members, students will interrogate the origins and institutionalization of Africana Studies; revise an Africana Studies-themed research paper completed in a previous course into a conference paper; and prepare and submit a paper proposal for NCBS. At NCBS, students will present their own research and engage with the work of Africana Studies scholars at panels, plenaries and workshops. Afterward, they will write a short assessment of the conference and their experience in Africana Studies at Carleton.</p><p>• Comprehensive Exercise AFST 400 <ref type="bibr">(6 credits)</ref> The comprehensive exercise is a substantial (approximately 34-40 page) research paper on a topic within African, African American, and/or African Diaspora studies, grounded in two complementary disciplines, advised by two faculty members chosen from these two disciplines. The student should have completed a 300-level course in one of these two disciplines. The comps process begins with a proposal in fall term of the senior year, and ends with a final written thesis and oral presentation early in spring term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Courses Pertinent to Africana Studies</head><p>• ARTH 160 American Art to 1940 (not offered in 2019-20) <ref type="bibr">•</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African Studies Minor</head><p>The Africana Studies minor is designed to complement a student's disciplinary major through an interdisciplinary specialization on the contexts and experiences of Africans and their many diasporas. Combining area studies and ethnic studies foci, the Africana Studies minor provides students the opportunity to explore the rich connections and exchanges among African people, their descendants, and the global locales--in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East--in which they have made and are making their lives. Students can do this through both on-campus courses and off-campus studies programs. In their senior year Africana Studies minors draw connections among these courses through an interdisciplinary reflective capstone experience.</p><p>Fostering interdisciplinary critical thinking, the Africana Studies minor prepares students for lifetime engagement in scholarship as well as in fields such as law, public policy, education, public health, social work, and the arts. Toward this end, and in addition to coursework, students are encouraged to take advantage of the rich array of speakers, exhibits, co-curricular, and extracurricular activities related to Africans and their diasporas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Africana Studies Minor Requirements</head><p>The Africana Studies minors requires seven courses as follows. Courses cannot double count for two requirements.</p><p>One core interdisciplinary <ref type="bibr">(6-credit)</ref> course which, in part, specifically discusses Africana Studies as a coherent field of study.  <ref type="bibr">Thought, 1919</ref><ref type="bibr">Thought, -1969</ref> Two survey courses (12 credits) that introduce the "state of the field" of African and/or African Diaspora studies within specific disciplines Three distribution courses (18 credits) that combine depth and breadth in the field. Each student should take 18 credits chosen from at least two of the following disciplinary groups: Literary and Artistic Analysis; Humanistic Inquiry and Social Inquiry. Two of the three distributional courses must be at the 200-level or above. At least one of the distribution courses should be a 300-level course in which the student produces a substantial paper or project in Africana Studies encompassing African, African American and African Diaspora Studies. In rare cases, a student can petition to write a substantial paper in a 200-level course (i.e., be released from the 300-level course requirement), if that course is highly relevant to their own focus.  AFST 125 New African Migrations African societies have long been shaped by migration--including quests for new knowledge, land, and livelihoods as well as the coercive migrations of slavery and refugee flight. Recent transformations in global political-economies and local conditions have made migration a central feature of contemporary African life. This course introduces students to African and African diaspora studies through an examination of new African migrations. Starting with the formation of "domestic diasporas" through rural-urban migration within African countries, we will explore connections and ruptures created by south-south international migrations within the African continent, and transnational migrations to the United States and Europe. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>AFST 200 The Black Intellectual Tradition in the Twentieth Century This course focuses on theories, ideologies, frameworks, and methodologies that constitute: 1) the Black intellectual tradition in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and 2) Africana Studies as an academic discipline. The course is structured around examinations of Black intellectual strategies and struggles for justice, recognition, self-determination, and freedom. We will read and discuss classic and contemporary scholarship concerning the study of the Black experience in the United States and the African Diaspora, and that has shaped the discipline of Africana Studies. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>AFST 220 Intersectionality This course is an in-depth examination of intersectionality, as a theory and analytic framework, and the socio/political projects out of which it emerges. We will focus on how intersecting categories of social difference such as race, class, gender, and sexuality create and maintain social inequalities in U.S. society and abroad.

Under the guidance of Africana Studies faculty members, students will interrogate the origins and institutionalization of Africana Studies; revise an Africana Studies-themed research paper completed in a previous course into a conference paper; and prepare and submit a paper proposal for NCBS. At NCBS, students will present their own research and engage with the work of Africana Studies scholars at panels, plenaries and workshops. Afterward, they will write a short assessment of the conference and their experience in Africana Studies at Carleton. 3 credits; NE; Winter; Thabiti Willis AFST 400 Integrative Exercise Not offered 2019-20</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies</head><p>This program is designed to encourage and support the interdisciplinary study of American culture. It draws upon the expertise of faculty in various disciplines and strives to understand the institutions, values, and beliefs that have shaped the experiences of U.S. residents. Recognizing the diverse and pluralistic nature of our society, the American Studies program enables the student to construct an interdisciplinary major around topics of the student's own choice such as urban studies, ethnicity, media, religion, gender roles, environmental thought or some other aspect of the American experience. The program supports interdisciplinary courses taught by Carleton faculty and it brings to campus nationally known visiting artists and scholars under the auspices of the Fred C. Andersen Foundation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the American Studies Major</head><p>American Studies is an interdisciplinary major which a student constructs from offerings in two or more departments of instruction. Students take both core courses in the field of American Studies and additional courses from one of five broad, thematic streams (listed below). This theme will both provide additional structure and points of comparison and a foundation for a comprehensive exercise.</p><p>Majors must complete 69 credits in the following general areas:</p><p>I. Core Courses: Each student must complete all of these:</p><p>• AMST 115 Introduction to American Studies or AMST 287 California Art and Visual Culture (offered as part of the "Visions of California" OCS Program) one or the other of these is a prerequisite for AMST 345 and AMST 396. • AMST 345 Theory and Practice of American Studies • AMST 396 Junior Research Seminar • AMST 399 Senior Seminar in American Studies • AMST 400 Colloquium and Integrative Exercise in American Studies (3 credits, to be taken in winter term of the senior year, along with AMST 399.) A senior may choose: o Essay or Project Option: a 35-40 page essay on an approved topic; or an approved project (e.g., a critical documentary, radio narrative, web design project, performance piece, or academic civic engagement project) accompanied by a 15-20 page essay. Open only to students who receive approval of a project prospectus. o Examination Option: A written examination given early in spring term II. Survey Courses: Students must take three survey courses. Two of these courses must come from a single department. Students will also take a one-term survey course from a different department. Because the entire range of these survey courses is not offered every year, students should consult the online catalog and plan accordingly. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Topical Courses:</head><p>Each student must take twenty-four credits that deal with elements of the American experience from one of the thematic streams below. Courses that will fulfill this requirement are listed under each group. No more than six of these credits may be from a 100level course. (Survey courses above and beyond those used to satisfy the required one-term and two-term sequences may count as a Topical Course.) Students must take courses from at least two departments. In order that majors acquire the research skills necessary to complete the major, six of these twenty-four credits must be at the 300-level.</p><p>• Race, Ethnicity and Indigeneity: What is the relationship between race and ethnicity and U.S.</p><p>cultures? Students will look at these questions in a comparative and interdisciplinary framework. Concentrators in this area should take a combination of courses that will allow them to comparatively assess the experiences of at least two ethno-racial groups in America.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies Courses</head><p>AMST 115 Introduction to American Studies This overview of the "interdisciplinary discipline" of American Studies will focus on the ways American Studies engages with and departs from other scholarly fields of inquiry. We will study the stories of those who have been marginalized in the social, political, cultural, and economic life of the United States due to their class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, citizenship, and level of ability. We will explore contemporary American Studies concerns like racial and class formation, the production of space and place, the consumption and circulation of culture, and transnational histories. 6 credits; HI, IDS, WR2; Fall, Winter; Nancy J Cho, Melinda Russell AMST 218 Asian American Studies Are Asian Americans forever foreigners or honorary whites? This class provides an introduction to Asian American Studies and introduces you to the research on Asian Americans. We begin with brief introduction of U.S. immigration history and theories about assimilation and racial stratification. Paying particular attention to how scholars ask questions and evaluate evidence, we will cover research on racial and ethnic identity, educational stratification, mass media on their papers or projects during the spring term. Prerequisite: American Studies 396. 3 credits; S/NC; Winter Arabic See Middle Eastern Languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Archaeology Minor</head><p>Archaeology is the interdisciplinary study of the past through its material remains, situated in their cultural and environmental context. The core and supporting courses of the Archaeology Minor at Carleton are designed to give students a methodological and theoretical introduction to these three elements of materials, culture and environment. In course projects, students take an interdisciplinary view, analyzing and interpreting material remains in a variety of ways. The range of supporting courses provides students with the flexibility to plan their own programs. In addition to Archaeology courses, several other department offer classes that count toward the Archaeology Minor; these include Classics, Geology, Art History, History, and Sociology and Anthropology. Students are highly encouraged (but not required) to become involved in archaeological fieldwork beyond the context of their coursework at Carleton.</p><p>Students from any major may participate in the Archaeology Minor. Students interested in the minor are encouraged to consult with the co-directors of the minor early in the sophomore year in order to plan ahead and retain as much freedom of choice as possible in meeting the requirements of the program, especially because two required courses are offered only every other year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Archaeology Minor</head><p>A total of forty-eight credits are required for the minor, including:</p><p>• Core Courses (24 credits required) o <ref type="bibr">ARCN 246 Archaeological Methods (not offered 2019-20)</ref> o CLAS 122 The Archaeology of Mediterranean Prehistory (not offered  or CLAS 123 Greek Archaeology and Art (not offered   Supporting courses may be drawn from any of the core courses listed above (beyond the 24 credits required), or from selected other ARCN pertinent courses (listed below). In each course the student must (at a minimum) complete a project with an explicit focus on the interpretation of archaeological materials. In certain circumstances another course (one not listed as ARCN pertinent) may be substituted with the approval of the Archaeology Program co-directors, provided the requirement of completing an archaeological project of sufficient scale is also fulfilled. An archaeological field school or independent study may also count toward one of the required supporting courses with approval of the Program co-directors.</p><p>The co-directors of the minor can advise students about which courses may fulfill these requirements. These courses are in many College departments and include courses taught by visiting professors. Students are encouraged to consult with the Program co-directors, who are available to help students and instructors of supporting courses. The following courses with ARCN pertinent designations can be applied to the Minor. Note that 100-level Geology courses may, but do not always, count as supporting courses. Archaeology Courses <ref type="bibr">ARCN 246 Archaeological</ref> Methods &amp; Lab As a field that is truly interdisciplinary, archaeology uses a wide range of methods to study the past. This course provides a hands-on introduction to the entire archaeological process through classroom, field, and laboratory components. Students will participate in background research concerning local places of historical or archaeological interest; landscape surveying and mapping in GIS; excavation; the recording, analysis, and interpretation of artifacts; and the publication of results. This course involves real archaeological fieldwork, and students will have an opportunity to contribute to the history of the local community while learning archaeological methods applicable all over the world. 6 credits; LS, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 ARCN 250 Digital Archaeology The practice of archaeology in the twenty-first century is an inevitably digital undertaking: from the way we record data, process finds, map distributions, analyze patterns, and even publish our interpretations, it all passes through a 'digital filter.' This hands-on course will explore the different approaches that digital archaeologies take--from 3D imaging of objects and structures, spatial analysis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing initiatives in contested or inaccessible landscapes, to modeling in Virtual Reality (VR) environments--while also reading about and discussing the implications and challenges of digital approaches and technologies for the theory and practice of archaeology. 3 credits; NE, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 ARCN 395 Archaeology: Science, Ethics, Nationalism and Cultural Property This seminar course will focus on a wide range of contemporary issues in archaeology, including case studies from many continents and time periods that shed light on archaeological theory and practice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Art History Courses (ARTH)</head><p>ARTH 100 Laughing Matters: The History of Political Caricature For over two centuries political caricature has permeated the popular culture of democratic societies. This course surveys that history, covering topics including revolutionary printmaking, editorial cartooning, political censorship, mock journalism, and anti-cartoon terrorism. We will explore pictorial protests against war, corruption, bigotry, and injustice, as well as graphic ridicule heaped upon political figures ranging from King Louis-Philippe to Boss Tweed to President Trump. But how effective is political caricature? Does it sway minds or merely reinforce extant opinions? When, if ever, does it become objectionable or libelous? Can comically exaggerated or distorted imagery actually reveal subtle insights or hidden truths? 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Baird E Jarman ARTH 100 Renaissance, Revolution, and Reformation: The Life and Art of Albrecht Dürer "If man devotes himself to art, much evil is avoided..." This statement, on the divine nature of art, was penned by the German artist Albrecht Dürer. Dürer's artworks--his paintings, his drawings, his woodblock prints, and his engravings--have been construed to be some of the most theologically sophisticated, naturalistically rendered, theoretically informed, classically inflected, and socially engaged of the period we now refer to as the "Renaissance." This thematically organized course will engage the work of Albrecht Dürer, around these issues. Discussions will be integrated with student presentations, analyses of primary and scholarly texts, and writing assignments. 6 credits; WR1, AI, IS; Fall; Jessica F Keating ARTH 101 Introduction to Art History I An introduction to the art and architecture of various geographical areas around the world from antiquity through the "Middle Ages." The course will provide foundational skills (tools of analysis and interpretation) as well as general, historical understanding. It will focus on a select number of major developments in a range of media and cultures, emphasizing the way that works of art function both as aesthetic and material objects and as cultural artifacts and forces. Issues include, for example, sacred spaces, images of the gods, imperial portraiture, and domestic decoration. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Fall; Baird E Jarman, Kathleen M Ryor ARTH 102 Introduction to Art History II An introduction to the art and architecture of various geographical areas around the world from the fifteenth century through the present. The course will provide foundational skills (tools of analysis and interpretation) as well as general, historical understanding. It will focus on a select number of major developments in a range of media and cultures, emphasizing the way that works of art function both as aesthetic and material objects and as cultural artifacts and forces. Issues include, for example, humanist and Reformation redefinitions of art in the Italian and Northern Renaissance, realism, modernity and tradition, the tension between self-expression and the art market, and the use of art for political purposes. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Winter; Jessica F Keating, Kathleen M Ryor ARTH 140 African Art and Culture This course will survey the art and architecture of African peoples from prehistory to the present. Focusing on significant case studies in various mediums (including sculpture, painting, architecture, masquerades and body arts), this course will consider the social, cultural, aesthetic and political contexts in which artistic practices developed both on the African continent and beyond. Major themes will include the use of art for status production, the use of aesthetic objects in social rituals and how the history of African and African diaspora art has been written and institutionally framed. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 155 Islamic Art and Architecture This course surveys the art and architecture of societies where Muslims were dominant or where they formed significant minorities from the seventh through the nineteenth centuries. It examines the form and function of architecture and works of art as well as the social, historical and cultural contexts, patterns of use, and evolving meanings attributed to art by the users. The course follows a chronological order, where selected visual materials are treated along chosen themes. Themes include the creation of a distinctive visual culture in the emerging Islamic polity; cultural interconnections along trade and pilgrimage routes; and westernization. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 160 American Art to 1940 Concentration on painting of the colonial period (especially portraiture) and nineteenth century (especially landscape and scenes of everyday life) with an introduction to the modernism of the early twentieth century. The course will include analysis of the ways art shapes and reflects cultural attitudes such as those concerning race and gender. 6 credits; LA, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 164 Buddhist Art The Buddhist religion has been a central part of Asian cultures and societies since the third century BC. This course will trace the development of Buddhist art and architecture from its beginnings in India through its migration across the Asian continent. Attention will be paid to both the Mahayana and Theravada traditions in Central East, South, and South-East Asia. Special emphasis will be placed on the relationship between different doctrines, for example, Tantrism or Zen and the development of form and style. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 165 Japanese Art and Culture This course will survey art and architecture in Japan from its prehistoric beginnings until the early twentieth century, and explore the relationship between indigenous art forms and the foreign (Korean, Chinese, European) concepts, art forms and techniques that influenced Japanese culture, as well as the social political and religious contexts for artistic production. 6 credits; LA, IS; Spring; Kathleen M Ryor ARTH 166 Chinese Art and Culture This course will survey art and architecture in China from its prehistoric beginnings to the end of the nineteenth century. It will examine various types of visual art forms within their social, political and cultural contexts. Major themes that will also be explored include: the role of ritual in the production and use of art, the relationship between the court and secular elite and art, and theories about creativity and expression. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 171 History of Photography This course covers nineteenth and twentieth century photography from its origins to the present. It will consider formal innovations in the medium, the role of photography in society, and the place of photography in the fine arts. 6 credits; LA; Not offered <ref type="bibr">2019</ref><ref type="bibr">-20 ARTH 172 Modern Art: 1890</ref><ref type="bibr">-1945</ref> This course explores developments in the visual arts, architecture, and theory in Europe and America between 1890 and 1945. The major Modernist artists and movements that sought to revolutionize vision, culture, and experience, from Symbolism to Surrealism, will be considered. The impact of World War I, the Great Depression, and the rise of fascism will be examined as well for their devastation of the Modernist dream of social-cultural renewal. Lectures will be integrated with discussions of artists' theoretical writings and group manifestoes, such as those of the Futurists, Dadaists, Surrealists, Constructivists, and DeStijl, in addition to select secondary readings. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 209 Chinese Painting Since the tenth century in China, a tension emerges between art created as a means of self expression and works which were intended to display social status and political power and to convey conventional values. This course concentrates on the primary site of this tension, the art of painting. We will explore such issues as the influence of Confucian and Daoist philosophy on painting and calligraphy, the changing perception of nature and the natural in art, the politics of style, and the increasing dominance of poetry rather than narrative as a conceptual construct for painting. Prerequisite: Any one term of art history. 6 credits; LA, IS; Winter; Kathleen M Ryor ARTH 211 Contemporary Art Program: Critical Issues in Art Now In this survey, students will be exposed to the diverse range of themes, concepts, and mediums that contemporary artists are working with at the present moment. After a brief historical overview of artistic practice since 1960, the course will be divided into a set of thematic concerns. Students will learn about how artists today respond to globalization, market capitalism, issues of racial and ethnic identity, and other issues within our complex contemporary geopolitical situation. Readings will be pulled from contemporary art journals, art blogs, e-journals, and statements by both artists and exhibition curators. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 212 Contemporary Art Program: The Art World and Its Institutions In this course, students will think critically about the institutions that present and frame contemporary art today, including the biennial exhibition, the museum, the commercial gallery, and the art journal. Critical questions include: If biennial exhibitions purport to be global surveys, how do they conceptualize "the global?" How have museums changed the ways in which they present such challenging works, and how do they make judgments about which works to acquire? What role do commercial galleries play in promoting certain artists over others, and has this skewed the survey of global artists toward certain kinds of art or artists? 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 213 Contemporary Art Program: Art Criticism in the Digital Age This course is a platform for students to reflect thoughtfully and critically on the works they have encountered abroad, the ideas raised by the visiting speakers, and the broader experiences they have had while traveling through Europe. The primary medium through which students will voice their reactions will be a studentauthored art blog. Given that so much cultural criticism now takes place in these virtual forums, students will thus be part of a broader community of art critics and theorists as their contributions add productively to the ongoing virtual conversation around the art of this moment. 6 credits; NE; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 214 Queer Art Beyond surveying the rich history of arts by LGBTQA+ individuals, this course takes as its object of study the ways in which the arts have been used to question, undermine, and subvert the gendered and sexual norms of dominant cultures-in short, to queer them. In so doing, such visual and performative practices offer new, alternative models of living and acting in the world based on liberatory politics and aesthetics. This course will consider topics such as: censorship of queer artists; art of the AIDS crisis; activist performance; the sexual politics of public space; and queer intersections of race, class and gender in visual art among others. Prerequisite: Any one art history course. 6 credits; LA, IDS; Fall; Ross K Elfline ARTH 215 Cross-Cultural Psychology in Prague: Prague Art and Architecture This course will examine key developments in Czech visual art and architecture from the early medieval to the contemporary periods. Slide-based lectures will be supplemented by visits to representative monuments, art collections, and museums in Prague. 4 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 220 The Origins of Manga: Japanese Prints Pictures of the floating world, or ukiyoe, were an integral part of popular culture in Japan and functioned as illustrations, advertisements, and souvenirs. This course will examine the development of both style and subject matter in Japanese prints within the socio-economic context of the seventeenth through twentieth centuries. Emphasis will be placed on the prominent position of women and the nature of gendered activity in these prints. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 225 Religion, Royalty &amp; Romantics: The Gothic and Gothic Revival This course examines Gothic art and architecture, both religious and secular, during the late Middle Ages and then again, with the Gothic Revival, after the Industrial Revolution. The course investigates how the concept of the Gothic evolved, explores how the Gothic style became invested with various cultural connotations, and traces its various deployments in popular culture. In the medieval period, this course focuses on works of art from France, England, Germany and Italy from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. Discussions of the Gothic Revival from the nineteenth century onward focus more broadly upon Europe and the United States. Approximately half of the class sessions will be held at St. Olaf. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 232 Madrid Program: Spanish Art Live This course offers an introduction to Spanish art from el Greco to the present. Classes are taught in some of the finest museums and churches of Spain, including the Prado Museum, the Museo Nacional de Arte Reina Sofía, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Toledo Cathedral in Toledo, and the Church of Santo Tomé. Prerequisite: Spanish 205. 6 credits; LA, IS; Fall; Humberto R Huergo ARTH 235 Revival, Revelation, and Re-animation: The Art of Europe's "Renaissance" This course examines European artistic production in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century. The aim of the course is to introduce diverse forms of artistic production, as well as to analyze the religious, social, and political role of art in the period. While attending to the specificities of workshop practices, production techniques, materials, content, and form of the objects under discussion, the course also interrogates the ways in which these objects are and, at times, are not representative of the "Renaissance." Prerequisite: One Art History course or instructor permission. 6 credits; LA, IS; Winter; Jessica F Keating ARTH 236 Baroque Art This course examines European artistic production in Italy, Spain, France, and the Netherlands from the end of the sixteenth century through the seventeenth century. The aim of the course is to interrogate how religious revolution and reformation, scientific discoveries, and political transformations brought about a proliferation of remarkably varied types of artistic production that permeated and altered the sacred, political, and private spheres. The class will examine in depth select works of painting, sculpture, prints, and drawings, by Caravaggio, Bernini, Poussin, Velázquez, Rubens, and Rembrandt, among many others. 6 credits; LA, IS; Spring; Jessica F Keating ARTH 240 Art Since 1945 Art from abstract expressionism to the present, with particular focus on issues such as the modernist artist-hero; the emergence of alternative or non-traditional media; the influence of the women's movement and the gay/lesbian liberation movement on contemporary art; and postmodern theory and practice. Prerequisite: Any one term of art history. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 241 Contemporary Art for Artists This course is a survey of major artistic movements after 1945 as well as an introduction to significant tendencies in current art and craft production. The goal of this course is to develop a familiarity with the important debates, discussions, and critical issues facing artists today. By the end of the course, students will be able to relate their own work as cultural producers to these significant contemporary artistic developments. Students will read, write about, and discuss primary sources, artist statements, and theoretical essays covering a wide range of media with the ultimate goal of articulating their own artistic project. Prerequisite: Any two studio art courses or permission from the instructor. Not open to students who have previously taken Art History 240. 6 credits; LA; Spring; Ross K Elfline ARTH 245 Modern Architecture This course surveys the history of western architecture, chiefly in Europe and North America, from approximately 1800 to 1950, paying particular attention to new building practices spurred by technological innovations arising from the Industrial Revolution. Architectural theory, stylistic concerns, new building typologies (such as skyscrapers and railway stations), urbanization, and the professionalization of architecture receive attention in the context of different cultural and political settings. Architectural movements covered include neoclassicism, the gothic revival, art nouveau, the beaux-arts tradition, the arts and crafts movement, the prairie school, constructivism, art deco, international-style modernism, brutalism and others. Prerequisite: One Art History course or instructor permission. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 <ref type="bibr">ARTH 247 Architecture Since 1950</ref> This course begins by considering the international triumph of architecture's Modern Movement as seen in key works by Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and their followers. Soon after modernisms rise, however, architects began to question the movement's tenets and the role that architecture as a discipline plays in the fashioning of society. This course will examine the central actors in this backlash from Britain, France, Italy, Japan, the United States and elsewhere before exploring the architectural debates surrounding definitions of postmodernism. The course will conclude by considering the impact of both modernism and postmodernism on contemporary architectural practice. 6 credits; LA; Fall; Ross K Elfline ARTH 255 Islam in the Eyes of the West How have images of Islam impacted European culture? How did existing pictorial traditions/practices frame the ways in which Islam was visualized in Europe? This course will interrogate the ways in which representational technologies facilitated and/or obstructed making sense of Islam from the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries. We will explore a wide range of images in diverse media, including, but not limited to, maps, costume books, panel paintings, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, popular prints, ethnographic treatises, and early photographs. Prerequisite: Any art history course or permission of the instructor. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 263 European Architectural Studies Program: Prehistory to Postmodernism This course surveys the history of European architecture while emphasizing firsthand encounters with actual structures. Students visit outstanding examples of major transnational styles--including Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Moorish, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical and Modernist buildings--along with regionally specific styles, such as Spanish Plateresque, English Tudor and Catalan Modernisme. Cultural and technological changes affecting architectural practices are emphasized along with architectural theory, ranging from Renaissance treatises to Modernist manifestos. Students also visit buildings that resist easy classification and that raise topics such as spatial appropriation, stylistic hybridity, and political symbolism. 6 credits; LA, IS; Winter; Baird E Jarman ARTH 264 European Architectural Studies Program: Managing Monuments: Issues in Cultural Heritage Practice This course explores the theory and practice of cultural resource management by investigating how various architectural sites and urban historic districts operate. Students will consider cultural, financial, ethical and pedagogical aspects of contemporary tourism practices within a historical framework that roots the travel industry alongside religious pilgrimage customs and the aristocratic tradition of the Grand Tour. Interacting with professionals who help oversee architectural landmarks and archaeological sites, students will analyze and assess initiatives at various locations, ranging from educational programs and preservation plans to sustainability efforts and repatriation debates. 6 credits; LA, IS; Winter; Baird E Jarman ARTH 265 Planning Utopia: Ideal Cities in Theory and Practice This course will survey the history of ideal plans for the built urban environment. Particular attention will be given to examples from about 1850 to the present. Projects chosen by students will greatly influence the course content, but subjects likely to receive sustained attention include: Renaissance ideal cities, conceptions of public and private space, civic rituals, the industrial city, Baron Haussmann's renovations of Paris, suburbanization, the Garden City movement, zoning legislation, Le Corbusier's Ville Contemporaine, Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City, New Urbanism and urban renewal, and planned capitals such as Brasília, Canberra, Chandigarh, and Washington, D.C. Prerequisite: Any one Art History course or instructor permission. 6 credits; LA; Spring; Baird E Jarman ARTH 266 Arts of the Japanese Tea Ceremony This course will examine the history and aesthetics of the tea ceremony in Japan (chanoyu). It will focus on the types of objects produced for use in the Japanese tea ceremony from the fifteenth century through the present. Themes to be explored include: the relationship of social status and politics to the development of chanoyu; the religious dimensions of the tea ceremony; gender roles of tea practitioners; nationalist appropriation of the tea ceremony and its relationship to the mingei movement in the twentieth century; and the international promotion of the Japanese tea ceremony post-WWII. Prerequisite: Requires concurrent registration in Studio Arts 236. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARTH 267 Gardens in China and Japan A garden is usually defined as a piece of land that is cultivated or manipulated in some way by man for one or more purposes. Gardens often take the form of an aestheticized space that miniaturizes the natural landscape. This course will explore the historical phenomenon of garden building in China and Japan with a special emphasis on how cultural and religious attitudes towards nature contribute to the development of gardens in urban and suburban environments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biochemistry</head><p>The biochemistry program at Carleton rests on the close cooperation between the departments of Biology and Chemistry. Emerging as a recognized discipline early in the last century, biochemistry has grown into a vast subject that spans several established disciplines. It serves as the link between the fields of chemistry and biology, and even as it flourishes at the interface of these subjects, it holds a strong position within the two traditional disciplines. Fundamentally, biochemistry seeks to establish an understanding of biological phenomena at a molecular level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Biochemistry Minor</head><p>The biochemistry minor requirements reflect the fundamental importance of the intellectual tools and structures of biology and chemistry to the study of all issues in biochemistry, and we ask students to get a grounding in both disciplines. It is likely that many students enrolling in the minor will major in either biology or chemistry. To encourage breadth within the minor, no more than five six-credit courses from a student's own major may be counted toward the minimum requirements of the minor.</p><p>Both the biology and chemistry departments maintain vigorous weekly seminar programs, regularly bringing to the college distinguished scientists, including many biochemists. Each minor should make it a priority to attend relevant seminars whenever possible. At the beginning of each term, minors will be notified of the pertinent biology and chemistry seminars held that term.</p><p>Finally, both the chemistry and biology departments regularly offer integrative exercise experiences in biochemistry as an option for their majors. Minors who are biology or chemistry majors have the option of furthering their pursuit of biochemistry through a biochemical topic as the basis for their senior integrative exercise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other relevant courses</head><p>The college offers a number of related courses that would enhance the background of a biochemistry concentrator. The following courses are not part of the concentration, but do support the program. In particular, we strongly encourage interested students to enroll in BIOL 240. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology</head><p>Potential biology majors should select a sequence of courses that will acquaint them with a variety of organisms, and their molecular and cellular structure, physiology, heredity, development, evolution, and ecological interactions. Biologists pursue careers in biological research, study in the medical sciences, teaching at the college or high school level, work in environmental sciences, or work in numerous commercial and industrial areas.</p><p>Requirements for the Biology Major Laboratory work is an integral part of most biology courses. In courses in which registration for the laboratory is separable from the lecture portion of the course, all biology majors are required to register concurrently for laboratory and lecture in order for these courses to count toward requirements for the major unless otherwise noted.</p><p>No course taken at another school may be used to meet the requirements for the major without prior approval of the Chair and Biology faculty. Students may request that up to six credits of biology-related coursework from an off-campus program be applied to the major as one upperlevel biology elective. To do this, you must discuss approval of these credits with the department chair, and complete an Approval of Special Credit for Off-Campus Study Form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Introductory Sequence</head><p>The Introductory Biology sequence consists of two courses, Biology 125 and 126, both of which are required before any further upper-level course work in Biology. The two courses can be taken in either order. Students who received a score of 5 on the AP exam or a score of 6 or 7 on the IB exam are exempted from Biology 125, and only need to take Biology 126 before taking upper-level Biology courses. Prerequisites for Biology 126 include Chemistry 123 or 128; or AP Chemistry score of 4 or 5; or IB score of 5, 6 or 7.</p><p>There are two versions of Biology 125, and students are urged to make a thoughtful choice of the appropriate offering based on their background and learning style. The winter term offering of Biology 125 is designed for students who 1) earned a score of 3 or 4 in AP Biology, or 2) received a score of 5 in IB Biology, or 3) earned a grade of B or higher in Honors or Advanced Biology in high school. In addition, these students are expected to have mastered basic concepts of chemistry in either a high school or college chemistry course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology Courses</head><p>BIOL 100 What Would Nature Do? Learning From the Natural World Humpback whales. Wind turbines. These topics seem unrelated, yet an engineer realized the anatomical features that make a whale so graceful in the sea could make a wind turbine more efficient in the wind. Many of the challenges humans currently face have been solved in the natural world while using less energy and materials. This course examines how today's problem solvers are learning from millions of biological examples and evolution's 3.8 billion years of research and development to engineer products, processes, and systems that are conducive to life rather than destructive. Prerequisite: Requires concurrent registration in IDSC 198. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Matt Rand, Dimitri S Smirnoff BIOL 101 Human Reproduction and Sexuality The myths surrounding human reproduction and sexuality may out weigh our collective knowledge and understanding. This course will review the basic biology of all aspects of reproduction--from genes to behavior--in an attempt to better understand one of the more basic and important processes in nature. Topics will vary widely and will be generated in part by student interest. BIOL 215 Agroecology Agriculture comprises the greatest single type of land use on the planet--as such, what happens on farms will have far-reaching effects on all other systems on the biosphere. With world human population growing exponentially, the search for sustainable agricultural systems is more important than ever. This course focuses on the scientific aspects of food production, which will involve the application of the principles of ecosystem and population ecology to agricultural systems. Topics covered will include organic farming, biotechnology, and effects of pesticide use. Several types of local farms will be visited--large, small, organic, conventional. Prerequisite: One introductory science lab course <ref type="bibr">(Biology 125,</ref><ref type="bibr">126,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chemistry 123,</ref><ref type="bibr">128,</ref><ref type="bibr">Geology 110,</ref><ref type="bibr">115 or 120)</ref>. Requires concurrent registration in BIOL 216. 6 credits; NE, QRE; Fall; David Hougen-Eitzman BIOL 216 Agroecology Lab These lab sessions will mainly involve visits to local area farms. The visits will provide an opportunity to examine biological processes on real farms and the environmental effects of different farming methods. This laboratory portion of the class will include a community engagement aspect, where class groups complete projects that provide services to farmers or community organizations. Prerequisite: Concurrent registration in Biology 215 is required. 2 credits; NE; Fall; David Hougen-Eitzman BIOL 224 Landscape Ecology In the Anthropocene, there has been dramatic change in the distribution of species and communities across the global landscape. The primary objective of this course is to introduce the theory and practice of landscape ecology. Throughout this course, we will consider the major themes of scale and hierarchy theory, compositional analysis, fragmentation, meta-populations, and landscape metrics, all within the broad context of how landscape patterns influence ecological process. BIOL 338 Genomics and Bioinformatics The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has revolutionized biology, enabling transformative breakthroughs in fields ranging from agriculture to conservation to medicine. In this course, students will gain experience with the computational and bioinformatics tools needed to analyze "big data," including sequence searching and alignment, assembly, gene calling and annotation. Students will learn to ask and answer their own scientific questions using sequence data, and to critically assess the conclusions other genomics and bioinformatics studies. No prior computer programming experience is required. Associated laboratory will focus on wet lab methods for DNA/RNA extraction and preparation as well as computational analysis The manner in which ecological challenges are solved (e.g., moving around vs. staying put, finding food, avoiding predators) is often related to an individual's biomechanical design. This class will challenge students to view their physical surroundings from the perspective of an organism. How do mussels feed in a fast stream vs. stagnant pond? Why do healthy trees uproot rather than break in half? How can a sea urchin with no eyes "see"? We will use primary scientific literature to examine the physical principles that underlie fundamental ecological processes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemistry</head><p>Chemistry provides the connection between molecular concepts and the complex systems found in nature. Chemistry courses stress the understanding of chemical principles, as well as the experimental basis of the science. The curriculum provides a strong foundation for graduate work in chemistry, biochemistry, and other chemistry-related areas, for positions in industry, for high school teaching, and for studies in the medical and health sciences. The department is on the list of those approved by the American Chemical Society (ACS). Students may choose to pursue an ACS certified degree.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Introductory Courses</head><p>Most first-year students will take Chemistry 123, Principles of Chemistry or Chemistry 128, Principles of Environmental Chemistry. Both are one-term courses designed for students who have had a good high school chemistry preparation. Although taught from slightly different perspectives, all sections of Chemistry 123 or Chemistry 128 will cover the fundamental topics that prepare students for further work in chemistry, biology, geology, or medicine. When scheduling permits, we also offer a section of Chemistry 123 with problem solving. This smaller section will have additional class meetings for problem solving and review and is appropriate for students who have had a high school chemistry course but want more interaction with the instructor as they begin the study of college-level chemistry.</p><p>Students who have not had a high school chemistry course should take Chemistry 122, An Introduction to Chemistry, which is designed to prepare students with little or no prior work in chemistry for further study in the discipline. This course also includes class sessions with problem solving and review.</p><p>Students planning to take Chemistry 122, 123, or 128 should take the self-administered chemistry placement evaluation, available on the chemistry department home page.

In addition, students will have the opportunity to explore current research in the field of analytical chemistry through the reading and presentation of articles from the primary literature. CHEM 348 Introduction to Computational Chemistry This class will introduce students to computational chemistry with a focus on simulations in chemistry and biology. This course will include hands-on experience in running classical molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry programs, an introduction to methods to simulate large systems, and demonstrations of the use of more sophisticated software to simulate chemical and biological processes. It will also include a survey of the current literature in this area, as well as lecture time in which the background necessary to appreciate this growing area of chemistry will be provided. CHEM 361 Materials Chemistry Materials chemistry seeks to understand condensed matter through the study of its structural, electronic, and macroscopic properties with an eye on practical applications. Therefore, the study of matter from a materials perspective requires a multidisciplinary approach involving chemistry, physics, engineering, and technology. Some topics to be covered include crystalline structure, X-ray diffraction, band theory, conductivity, magnetic and optical properties, the effect of size on materials properties, and soft materials. Current research in materials chemistry will be explored through group presentation and discussion of primary literature papers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cinema and Media Studies</head><p>The Cinema and Media Studies (CAMS) major combines the critical study of moving image and sound media with digital video and audio production. Courses range from global and Hollywood film studies to fiction and nonfiction filmmaking, animation, television studio production, moving image media installations, and writing for film and television. The integration of theory and practice is a guiding principle in the formulation of the curriculum, reflecting a liberal arts philosophy in which thinking and making are mutually informing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Cinema and Media Studies Major</head><p>Seventy-two credits are required for the major: forty-eight credits in core courses and twentyfour credits in elective courses. In the core curriculum, students are required to enroll in CAMS 110 and CAMS 111, two 200-level production courses (one of which must be CAMS 270 or CAMS 271), two 200-level film history courses (one of which must be CAMS 210, CAMS 211 or CAMS 214) and one 300-level theory seminar <ref type="bibr">(CAMS 320,</ref><ref type="bibr">CAMS 330)</ref>.

Credit for elective courses may be obtained by enrolling in any departmental or approved extra-departmental courses with the following stipulations: a) Any CAMS course not fulfilling a core requirement can serve as an elective course for the CAMS major. b) A limit of 18 credits in production courses count in fulfillment of elective credit for the major. The production courses currently taught in the department are listed below. Any of these courses can serve as electives for the major (up to a limit of 18 credits) as long as the course is not already serving in fulfillment of a core requirement for the major. CAMS 111 Digital Foundations This class introduces students to the full range of production tools and forms, building both the technical and conceptual skills needed to continue at more advanced levels. We will explore the aesthetics and mechanics of shooting digital video, the role of sound and how to record and mix it, field and studio production, lighting, and editing with Adobe Premiere Pro CC. Course work will include individual and group production projects, readings, and writing. This is an essential foundation for anyone interested in moving-image production and learning the specifics of CAMS' studios, cameras, and lighting equipment. This course focuses on the history, production, and consumption of cult television. The beginning of the seminar will be focused on critically examining a number of theoretical approaches to the study of genre and fandom. Building on these approaches, the remainder of the course will focus on cult television case studies from the last eight decades. We will draw on recent scholarship to explore how cult television functions textually, industrially, and culturally.</p><p>Additionally, we will study fan communities on the Internet and consider how fansites, webisodes, and sites like YouTube and Netflix transform television genres. Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 188 Rock 'n' Roll in Cinema This course is designed to explore the intersection between rock music and cinema. Taking a historical view of the evolution of the "rock film," this class examines the impact of rock music on the structural and formal aspects of narrative, documentary, and experimental films and videos. The scope of the class will run from the earliest rock films of the CAMS 219 African Cinema: A Quest for Identity and Self-Definition Born as a response to the colonial gaze and discourse, African cinema has been a deliberate effort to affirm and express an African personality and consciousness. Focusing on the film production from West and Southern Africa since the early fifties, this course will entail a discussion of major themes such as colonialism, nationalism and independence, and the analysis of African symbolisms, world-views, and their links to narrative techniques. In this overview, particular attention will be given to the films of Ousmane Sembène, Souleymane Cissé, Mweze Ngangura, Zola Maseko, Oliver Schmitz, Abderrahmane Sissako and many others. CAMS 236 Israeli Society in Israeli Cinema This course will introduce students to the global kaleidoscope that is Israeli society today. Since the 1980s the Israeli public has increasingly engaged with its multicultural character, particularly through films and documentaries that broaden national conversation. Our approach to exploring the emerging reflection of Israel's diversity in its cinema will be thematic. We will study films that foreground religious-secular, Israeli-Palestinian, gender, sexual orientation, and family dynamics, as well as CAMS 240 Adaptation Film adaptations of pre-existing texts (from songs to novels) have been around almost as long as cinema itself, and the percent of film adaptations continues to grow. (Of the top twothousand movies over the last twenty years fifty-one percent were adaptations.) In this course we will take a chronological journey through the history of film adaptations in a variety of film cultures, considering along the way the processes involved in translating narratives from words to visual media, and how the cinematic has come to shape the literary (reverse adaptation). Discussions and assignments will aim at both analysis and practice. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>CAMS 242 Sound and Music in TV and New Media This course covers the theory and production of sound and music in radio, electronic soundscapes, electroacoustic music, and film and video. The course will focus on the aesthetics, theory and practice of sound in these media. Students will create sound artworks in a laboratory component, using Logic Pro and other sound engineering software. Students will produce several audio projects, including a podcast of a radio show, an electronic musique concrete or sound art piece, and a musical accompaniment to a short film or video using pre-existing music. 6 credits; ARP; Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 243 Film Sound History Although cinema is an audio-visual medium, there has long been a tendency to privilege the visual component of film over the elements of film sound. In an attempt to redress this imbalance, this course will focus on the technological, cultural, and theoretical histories of film sound throughout the twentieth century. We will examine the transition to sound in United States and European cinema, radio's role in the development of sound aesthetics, standardized and alternative sound practices, the role and use of music in cinema, and the complex effects of contemporary sound technologies on the medium and experience of film. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 245 The Essay Film This course explores a hybrid cinematic genre whose critical and creative energies spring from the collision of traditionally separated spheres: documentary and fiction, text and image, private and public, reason and intuition. We focus on the intersection where creative practice and intellectual inquiry meet through theoretical readings, film screenings, and the fulfillment of various production exercises aimed at the production of original film work. Cartoons, and Advertising will be covered. The course will focus on how television genre categories are defined in theory, but often hybridized in practice. The course will also provide a historical perspective on these genres, and analysis of programs from visual, sound, and musical perspectives to observe how each has evolved over time. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>CAMS 256 Digital Cinema Culture The phrase "going to the movies" is perhaps more meaningless than ever. Not only do the proliferation of screens, ubiquity of cinematic conventions, and ease of media access make it seem as though we are always-already at the movies, but the definition of what a movie is seems to be in constant flux. This course addresses the issue of twenty-first century film culture by exploring how emerging media technologies have reconfigured the meaning and function of cinema in the "digital age." Topics include media convergence, digital bodies, video games and VR, digital exhibition and distribution, social media, cinephilia, and fandom. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 257 Video Games and Identity As video games have emerged as a dominant cultural form, they have become deeply intertwined with broader cultural debates around identity. By analyzing a variety of specific games as well as the industry that creates them and the communities who play them, we will think through topics such as liberal multiculturalism, neoliberal capitalism, feminism, queerness, ethical design, the military-entertainment complex, GamerGate, and discourses of political correctness. This course will avoid categorizing games as having "positive" or "negative" social effects and will instead focus on how video games function as a window into issues of identity in U.S. culture. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 258 Feminist and Queer Media The focus of this course is on spectatorship-feminist, lesbian, queer, transgender. The seminar interrogates arguments about representation and the viewer's relationship to the moving image in terms of identification, desire, masquerade, fantasy, power, time, and embodied experience. The course first explores the founding essays of psychoanalytic feminist film theory, putting these ideas into dialogue with mainstream cinema. Second, we consider the aesthetic, narrative, and theoretical interventions posed by feminist filmmakers working in contradistinction to Hollywood. Third, "queering" contemporary media, we survey challenges and revisions to feminist film theory presented by considerations of race and ethnicity, transgender experience, and queerness. 6 credits; LA, IDS; Spring; Candace I Moore CAMS 263 The Element of Control: Studio Filmmaking How do we bring attention to an artifact or object, a gesture or speech? In this class students will become familiar with strategies and techniques of studio practices in film making. Students will be asked to think through the ways control can heighten our conversations in film, or bring attention to specificities. Through lighting techniques and camera techniques students will learn the slippery art of controlled environments. Projects will place pressure on students to integrate elements learned in the studio into larger film making practices while learning conceptual and historical conversations around the uses of the studio. Prerequisite: Cinema &amp; Media Studies 111 or instructor permission. 6 credits; ARP; Spring; Carl H Elsaesser CAMS 264 Story Development Workshop This course explores the creative practice of developing stories for narrative films. Students will draw inspiration from a variety of sources that are personal, cultural, or observational, and in doing so, develop confidence in their own artistic practice and perspective. We will learn the fundamentals of dramatic tools, use these tools to make screen ideas evolve, consider audience reception, and practice giving and receiving constructive critique. By the end of term, students will have generated ideas for future production projects that reflect their thematic concerns, and have a fully developed outline for a project that may be realized in an upper level production course. Prerequisite: Cinema and Media Studies 111. Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 265 Sound Design This course examines the theories and techniques of sound design for film and video. Students will learn the basics of audio recording, sound editing and multi-track sound design specifically for the moving image. The goal of the course is a greater understanding of the practices and concepts associated with soundtrack development through projects using recording equipment and the digital audio workstation for editing and mixing. Prerequisite: Cinema and Media Studies 111 or instructor permission. 6 credits; ARP; Winter; Jay S Beck CAMS 267 Cinema in Europe Program: Exploring Cinema in Europe Experiential learning is at the heart of this course; students will engage directly with filmmakers and arts organizations through film screenings, studio visits, and workshops. Class discussions, written responses, and creative projects will provide opportunities for reflection and synthesis as students expand their knowledge of contemporary cinema practices. Prerequisite: Participation in OCS Media Arts Program. 6 credits; ARP, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 268 Cinema in Europe Program: Cinema Production Workshop This course will combine classes taught by faculty director Laska Jimsen with specialized workshops by filmmakers and media artists in the cities we visit. Workshops will draw on strengths of the CAMS production curriculum, including a focus on form/content, sound/image, and theory/practice relationships, while introducing students to production practices not currently offered at Carleton. Each student will produce individual and collaborative exercises. Prerequisite: Students will need Adobe Creative Cloud Software and a laptop capable of running that software. Participation in OCS Media Arts Program. 6 credits; ARP, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CAMS 270 Nonfiction This course addresses nonfiction media as both art form and historical practice by exploring the expressive, rhetorical, and political possibilities of nonfiction production. A focus on relationships between form and content and between makers, subjects, and viewers will inform our approach. Throughout the course we will pay special attention to the ethical concerns that arise from making media about others' lives. We will engage with diverse modes of nonfiction production including essayistic, experimental, and participatory forms and create community videos in partnership with Carleton's Center for Community and Civic Engagement and local organizations. The class culminates in the production of a significant independent nonfiction media project. CAMS 288 Experimental Film &amp; Video Production A process-based production course focused on the conceptual and technical concerns of experimental film, video, and other time-based arts. We will explore the personal, cultural, political, and formal/aesthetic aspects of experimental media through readings, writings, screenings, and the production of experimental media projects. Key course concerns include medium specificity and relationships between sound and image, form and content, and theory and practice. We will consider "experimental" as a working practice rather than a genre--a way of testing hypotheses and a process of discovery In order to bring the students into contact with the cultural and social discourses examined in Cinema and Media Studies 295, this course begins with a study trip to Santiago and Buenos Aires during the first two weeks in December. Our time will be spent visiting filmmakers, producers, scholars, and cultural organizations that shape filmmaking practices and cultural production. The course meets once early in winter term and then involves individual meetings with the faculty during the first five weeks. The course then meets regularly during the second half of winter term, when students formally present their projects followed by a group discussion. CAMS 370 Advanced Production Workshop I In this course, students will develop a concept and complete pre-production for their CAMS production comps. Students will draw inspiration from a variety of sources that are personal, cultural, and observational, and in doing so, develop confidence in their own artistic practice and perspective. We will refine technical and formal strategies, consider audience reception, and practice giving and receiving constructive critique. Prior to registering for the course, students must submit a project proposal to the instructor. </p></div>

CLAS 100 The Trojan Legend: Mythology, Archaeology, and Legacy The rage of Achilles, the face that launched a thousand ships, Greeks bearing gifts, Brad Pitt's leg double...The Trojan Legend is one of the most reproduced, adapted, and controversial stories of all time. Troy's roots at the foundations of western literature have inspired countless works of art, literature, and film, which for millennia have retold this epic set of tales. In this seminar we will explore the legend of the Trojan War through ancient and modern literature and art, as well as the archaeological sites, civilizations, and imaginary places that have contributed to this legend down to the present. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Alex R Knodell CLAS 111 Classical Mythology Myth was an integral component of thought, both individual and societal, in the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome. We will study a selection of the most famous Classical myths through close reading of Homer, the Greek tragedians, Ovid and other ancient sources. In addition we'll discuss the most prominent of modern modes of myth interpretation, in an attempt to determine how myth speaks--both to the ancient world and to us. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 112 The Epic in Classical Antiquity: Texts, Contexts, and Intertexts It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the early Greek epics for the classical world and the western literary tradition that emerged from that world. This course will study closely both the Iliad and the Odyssey, as well as Hesiod's Theogony, and then consider a range of works that draw upon these epics for their creator's own purposes, including Virgil's own epic, the Aeneid. By exploring the reception and influence of ancient epic, we will develop an appreciation for intertextuality and the dynamics of reading in general as it applies to generations of readers, including our own. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Winter; Chico Zimmerman CLAS 116 Ancient Drama: Truth in Performance The tragic and comic stage offered the Greeks and Romans a public arena for exploring fundamental questions about politics, divinity, sex, and death. Although written texts have preserved many ancient plays, the ideal vehicles for their communication remain, as their authors intended, the stage, the voice, and the body. This course will therefore introduce a variety of ancient tragedies and comedies with special attention, not only to their themes, but to the manner of their performance, culminating in student-driven productions that put into practice skills and expertise developed in the class. We will also experience modern adaptations of ancient drama, both in film and in the Twin Cities theater scene. 6 credits; ARP, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 122 The Archaeology of Mediterranean Prehistory: From the Beginning to the Classical Age "Never say that prehistory is not history." The late Fernand Braudel had it right. Over 99 percent of human history predates the written word, and this course examines one of the world's most diverse, yet unifying environments--the Mediterranean Sea--from the earliest populations around its shores to the emergence of the Classical world of the Greeks and Romans. Neanderthals and modern humans, the first artists and farmers, multiculturalism among Greeks, Phoenicians, Etruscans, and others... These are some of the topics to be covered as we study the precursors and roots of what would become "Western" civilization. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 123 Greek Archaeology and Art This course explores the archaeology and art of the Ancient Greek world. Beginning with prehistory, we will track the development of the material culture of Ancient Greece through the Classical and Hellenistic periods, and conclude by discussing aspects of the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman empires that followed. We will focus throughout on aspects of archaeological practice, material culture and text, art and society, long-term social change, and the role of the past in the present. 6 credits; HI, IS, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 124 Roman Archaeology and Art The material worlds of the ancient Romans loom large in our cultural imagination. No other civilization has made as direct a contribution to our own political system or to its physical vestiges of power and authority. From the architecture of the state to visual narratives of propaganda, Roman influence is ubiquitous in the monuments of western civilization. But what were the origins of the Romans? Their innovations? Their technical, artistic, and ideological achievements?</p><p>How are they relevant today? This course explores these questions and more through the archaeology of the eternal city and beyond. 6 credits; HI, IS; Winter; Alex R Knodell CLAS 127 Ancient Technology Technology--humanity's efforts to manipulate its physical environment-stands as a central concern of the modern world. This course examines the technology of the ancient world and investigates its integral relationship to other facets of human activity. Theories of technological change will be explored initially in order to develop a socially-informed understanding of technology. In the second part, students will investigate specific ancient technologies using archaeological and textual evidence and present their findings to the class. The goal of this course is to understand technology as a social phenomenon in both the ancient and modern worlds. 6 credits; HI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 131 Imagining New Worlds: From Homer to Columbus and Beyond From the beginnings of their civilization, the Greeks were aware that they inhabited just a small corner of a much larger world. How did they imagine faraway places and peoples? What did ancient maps look like? How much have Greek literature and science shaped later geographical thought and practice, from the Roman Empire to the European "Age of Exploration" to our own "Age of Google"? Can we use ancient methods to measure the world? Drawing on various sources in translation, we will explore the literary and scientific frontiers of ancient geography and trace its legacy into the modern world. 6 credits; HI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 135 Food and Drink in the Ancient World We may all be what we eat, but we are also where, when, why, with whom, and how we eat. In this class, we will explore patterns of food production, preparation, consumption, availability, and taboos, examining issues like gender, health, and wealth within the historic and geographic context of the ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds. Literary, art historical, anthropological and archaeological approaches and evidence will be explored in our pursuit of connections between food, drink, and daily life, as we consider how in both the ancient and modern worlds, we 'are what we eat.' 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 145 Ancient Greek Religion Greek religion played a crucial role in how the ancient Greeks understood the world around them. Mythology and cosmology shaped their understanding of how the world worked, while the ritual of sacrifice formed the basis of the social fabric underpinning all aspects of Greek society. In this course we will learn about Greece's polytheistic belief system--its gods and religious rites--as well as examining how religion shaped the daily lives of ordinary Greeks, often in surprising ways. We will read the works of ancient authors such as Homer and Hesiod, study the archaeological remains of sacred sites, inscriptions, and curse tablets, as well as engage with experimental archaeology. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 173 Sport and Daily Life This course is an exploration of life, death, and entertainment in the ancient world, particularly in Rome. We will focus especially on how and why people take part in sporting events and on how sport intersected with gender, social class, and economic concerns in the ancient world. Topics include the history of sport, slavery and marginal groups, demography, gladiatorial and combat events, and entertainment and politics. Our primary focus in lecture and discussion will be interpretation of a variety of ancient sources, but we will also evaluate modern views of ancient entertainment. 6 credits; HI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 214 Gender and Sexuality in Classical Antiquity In both ancient Greece and Rome, gender (along with class and citizenship status) largely determined what people did, where they spent their time, and how they related to others. This course will examine the ways in which Greek and Roman societies defined gender categories, and how they used them to think about larger social, political, and religious issues. Primary readings from Greek and Roman epic, lyric, and drama, as well as ancient historical, philosophical, and medical writers; in addition we will explore a range of secondary work on the topic from the perspectives of Classics and Gender Studies. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS, QRE; Spring; Clara S Hardy CLAS 223 Ancient Science Did the Greeks invent "science" as we know it, or has modern science blossomed into something wholly different from its ancient roots? How distinct are scientific and religious patterns of thinking? Who controls knowledge about nature, the cosmos, and the body, and what's the proper way to communicate it? Why should we trust "the experts," ancient or modern, anyway? Pursuing these and other questions, this course introduces students to the strange and dynamic world of ancient science, from the earliest Presocratics to Roman-era authorities like Claudius Ptolemy. Students will not only learn about theories that dominated Western thinking for millennia, but also gain first-hand experience with ancient scientific methods. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 227 Athens, Sparta, Persia and the Battle for Greece Forged in the crucible of wars fought between cultures with diametrically opposed views on politics and society, the fifth century BC witnessed arts, philosophy, and science all flourish in thrilling new ways. The two radically different Greek states of Athens and Sparta first teamed up to defeat the invading Persian empire. While this shocking victory spurred their respective cultures to new heights, their political aspirations drove them to turn on each other and fight a series of wars over control of Greece--all the while with Persia waiting in the wings. We will study these events against the backdrop of the political, intellectual, and cultural achievements of Athens, Sparta and Persia, drawing on the rich body of literature and material culture from this period. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 229 Warlords and the Collapse of the Roman Republic The class will investigate the factors that led a Republican government that had lasted for 700 years to fall apart, leading to twenty years of civil war that only ended with the rise of a totalitarian dictatorship. We will look at the economic, social, military, and religious factors that played key roles in this dynamic political period. We will also trace the rise and influence of Roman warlords, politicians, and personalities and how they changed Roman politics and society. We will study many of the greatest characters in Roman history, as well as the lives of everyday Romans in this turbulent time. 6 credits; HI, IS; Fall; Jake Morton CLAS 230 The Rise and Fall of the Great Hellenistic Kingdoms Alexander the Great united the Greek states by force before waging a ten-year campaign that brought Greek influence all the way to India. In the aftermath of Alexander's death, his generals divided the world into kingdoms. These kingdoms presided over an extraordinary flourishing of arts and science over the next 300 years. However, this period also saw these kingdoms continuously strive for domination over one another until they were ultimately dominated by the rising power of Rome. This class will explore one of the most exciting periods in ancient history, a time of great cultural achievements, larger than life characters, and devastating conflicts. 6 credits; HI, IS; Spring; Jake Morton CLAS 231 The Roman Principate This class introduces the history of Rome from Augustus to Diocletian. From demented emperors to new religions to economic collapse, the course uses Rome as a lens to address enduring historical questions. For example, how do individuals get, keep, and hand on power? What are the relationships between a central power and those on the periphery of that power and between a ruling elite and those they rule? How do foreign affairs affect internal policies and politics?</p><p>Since we rely largely on ancient sources, we will also devote time to the interpretation of those sources in all their delightful eccentricity. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 240 Rome: From Village to Superpower This class will investigate how Rome rose from a humble village of outcasts and refugees to become the preeminent power in the entire Mediterranean. We will trace Rome's political evolution from kings to the Republic, alongside their gradual takeover of the Italian peninsula. We will study how Rome then swiftly overpowered what had been the most powerful kingdoms in the Mediterranean and established themselves as dominant. Who were these Romans and what were their political, military, religious, and social systems that enabled them to accomplish so much? What critical events shaped their development and ultimately led to total political control of the Mediterranean world? Students who previously took Classics 228 cannot take Classics 240. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 267 Political Landscapes: Archaeologies of Territory and Polity We live in a world of states. Nearly every inch of the earth is clearly delineated on maps and plans, ascribed to a particular political authority. But the widespread availability of precise spatial information is relatively new in human history. This seminar examines archaeology beyond the site. How did ancient polities understand and demarcate territory? What tools can we use to understand this? We begin by examining theories of space, place, landscape, and boundaries. The second part of the course compares case studies from across the ancient world to explore archaeological approaches to territory and polity in greater detail. Prerequisite: At least one previous archaeology course, <ref type="bibr">Classics 122,</ref><ref type="bibr">123,</ref><ref type="bibr">124 or Archeology 246;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> contact instructor to discuss other relevant courses. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 CLAS 295 Junior Colloquium The Colloquium is designed to introduce and consolidate the research and interpretive skills required in the highly interdisciplinary study of Classical antiquity. Meeting weekly, three two-week modules will be organized around the main areas identified in the Classics major requirements-historical analysis, literary analysis, archaeological analysis-in order to solidify skills in finding, reading/interpreting, and citing evidence and sources from, and about, the Classical world. Additionally, students will choose a Symposium theme for the following year and generate a common bibliography pertaining to the topic of the Symposium. Students will also draft a Call for Papers and identify potential Symposium respondents. 3 credits; NE; Spring CLAS 394 Senior Seminar As part of their senior capstone experience, majors in the classics department will formulate a call for papers developing the current year's theme for a colloquium, and following standard guidelines of the field produce proposals ("abstracts") for their own papers to be presented in the winter term. 3 credits; NE; Fall CLAS 400 Senior Symposium From proposals ("abstracts") developed in Classics 394, departmental majors will compose a twenty minute presentation to be delivered at a symposium on the model of professional conferences. The talks will then be revised into articles to be submitted to a journal of professional style, accepted and edited by the group into a presentable volume. Prerequisite: Classics</p></div>

Spoken by millions in the ancient world and kept continuously "alive" up to the present, Latin provides a window onto an intellectual and cultural landscape that is both foreign and familiar to modern students. This beginning course will develop necessary vocabulary, forms, and grammar that allows students to begin reading short passages of unadulterated prose and poetry from the ancient Roman world right from the start. 6 credits; NE; Fall; Jake Morton LATN 102 Intermediate Latin Continuation of essential forms and grammar. Prerequisite: Latin 101 with a grade of at least C-or placement. 6 credits; NE; Winter; Chico Zimmerman LATN 103 Introduction to Latin Prose and Poetry This course completes the formal textbook introduction to the morphology and syntax of Latin. The focus will be on consolidating and applying grammatical concepts learned throughout the Latin sequence to the reading of extended selections of authentic Roman prose and poetry. Prerequisite: Latin 102 with a grade of at least C-or placement. 6 credits; NE; Spring; Jake Morton LATN 204 Intermediate Latin Prose and Poetry What are the "rules" of friendship? Would you do anything for a friend? Anything? The ancient Romans were no strangers to the often paradoxical demands of friendship and love. The goal for Intermediate Latin Prose and Poetry is to gain experience in the three major modes of Latin expression most often encountered "in the wild"-prose, poetry, and inscriptions-while exploring the notion of friendship. By combining all three modes into this one course, we hope both to create a suitable closure to the language sequence and to provide a reasonable foundation for further exploration of Roman literature and culture. Prerequisite: Latin 103 with a grade of at least C-or placement. 6 credits; NE; Fall; Chico Zimmerman LATN 233 The Catilinarian Conspiracy In 63 BC, a frustrated Roman nobleman named Catiline attempted to start a revolution to overthrow the Roman government, only to be exposed and stopped by the politician Cicero. At least, that is how Cicero depicts it, and we will read part of Cicero's speech that led to Catiline's condemnation. However, we will also read the contemporary Roman historian Sallust's magisterial account of the events which reveals a more complicated story about both Catiline and the senators' response. These are two of the greatest works in Latin literature and reading them together will allow us to investigate what really happened in 63 BC. Prerequisite: Latin 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA, IS; Winter; Jake Morton LATN 235 The Bacchanalian Affair In 186 BC stories of wild and debauched secret religious rites being celebrated under cover of night sparked panic in Rome, which led to a brutal state suppression of the cult. Was this a crackdown on impious behavior or political oppression? Over the course of the term we will translate three sources of evidence to determine what actually happened: the Roman historian Livy's scintillating and outrageous account of this conspiracy; works by the Roman comedic playwright Plautus that might have shaped Livy's storytelling; and the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, a detailed inscription found in southern Italy discussing the new laws Rome passed to suppress the cult. The course will investigate why epistolary form was so important in Latin literature, and you'll learn about the consequences (even controversies!) that resulted when authors imparted the form of personalized communication to texts with a public reception. We'll read Cicero, Ovid, and Seneca, but also the correspondence of private individuals and some theoretical treatments of letter-writing, all to determine the range of styles and content that epistolary form enveloped. See you in September, Hans. Prerequisite: Latin 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 LATN 257 Caesar, Lucan, and Civil War This course will examine narratives of the early stages of the Roman Civil War through contemporary prose accounts of Caesar and Cicero and the poet Lucan's Neronian epic on the Civil War. Topics will include manipulation of public opinion and memory, historical reconstruction through text, the relationship between prose history and historical epic, and the literal and metaphorical dissolution of Rome through civil war, as well as stylistic and philosophical concerns specific to each author.

Did you ever get the feeling that "there has to be a better/smarter way to do this problem"? The Data Structures course is all about how to store information intelligently and access it efficiently. How can Google take your query, compare it to billions of web pages, and return the answer in less than one second? How can one store information so as to balance the competing needs for fast data retrieval and fast data modification? To help us answer questions like these, we will analyze and implement stacks, queues, trees, linked lists, graphs, and hash tables. Students who have received credit for a course for which Computer Science 201 is a prerequisite are not eligible to enroll in Computer Science 201.

Good programs are quite a bit harder to write, and are correspondingly less common. In this course, we will study techniques, tools, and habits that will improve your chances of writing good software. While working on several medium-sized programming projects, we will investigate code construction techniques, debugging and profiling tools, testing methodologies, UML, principles of object-oriented design, design patterns, and user interface design.

Prerequisite: Instructor's permission. 1 credit; S/CR/NC; NE; Fall; David R Musicant CS 301 History of Computing in England Program: History of Computing In the mid-1800s, Charles Babbage's analytical engine, inspired by programmable looms, was the first conception of an automated programmable computing device. A century later, British researchers built some of the first physical computers---particularly WWII-era code-breaking work, and programmable machines developed immediately after the war. We will explore those two eras, through historical writings (including Babbage and Ada Lovelace, who wrote programs for the analytical engine, and Alan Turing) and visits to relevant museums and archives. We will also study some of the more recent history of computing, particularly the major advances in the 1960s and 1970s. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 and 202 (Math 236 will be accepted in lieu of Computer Science 202. 6 credits; FSR; Summer; David Liben-Nowell CS 304 Social Computing The last decade has seen a vast increase in the number of applications that connect people with one another. This course presents an interdisciplinary introduction to social computing, a field of study that explores how computational techniques and artifacts are used to support and understand social interactions. We will examine a number of socio-technical systems (such as wikis, social media platforms, and citizen science projects), discuss the design principles used to build them, and analyze how they help people mobilize and collaborate with one another. Assignments will involve investigating datasets from online platforms and exploring current research in the field. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201. 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CS 311 Computer Graphics Scientific simulations, movies, and video games often incorporate computergenerated images of fictitious worlds. How are these worlds modeled inside a computer? How are they "photographed" to produce the images that we see? What performance constraints and design tradeoffs come into play? In this course we learn the basic theory and methodology of computer graphics, following the historical development of the field, from software implementations to fixed-function hardware, shader programs, and recent lower-level interfaces.

Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 or instructor permission. 6 credits; FSR; Winter; John Ellinger CS 314 Data Visualization Understanding the wealth of data that surrounds us can be challenging. Luckily, we have evolved incredible tools for finding patterns in large amounts of information: our eyes! Data visualization is concerned with taking information and turning it into pictures to better communicate patterns or discover new insights. It combines aspects of computer graphics, humancomputer interaction, design, and perceptual psychology. In this course, we will learn the different ways in which data can be expressed visually and which methods work best for which tasks. Using this knowledge, we will critique existing visualizations as well as design and build new ones. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201. 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CS 321 Artificial Intelligence How can we design computer systems with behavior that seems "intelligent?"

How does Amazon.com figure out what items you might be interested in buying? How can categories of similar politicians be identified, based on their voting patterns? These questions can be answered via data mining, a field of study at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, database systems, and statistics. Data mining concerns itself with the goal of getting a computer to learn or discover patterns, especially those found within large datasets. We'll focus on techniques such as classification, clustering, association rules, web mining, collaborative filtering, and others. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201. Additionally, Computer Science 202 is strongly recommended. 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CS 328 Computational Models of Cognition How are machine learning and human learning similar? What sorts of things can people learn, and how can we apply computer science ideas to characterize cognition? This interdisciplinary course will take a computational modeling approach, exploring how models can help us to better understand cognition and observing similarities between machine learning methods and cognitive tasks. Through in class activities and readings of both classic and contemporary research papers on computational cognitive modeling, we'll build up an understanding of how different modeling choices lead to different predictions about human behavior and investigate potential practical uses of cognitive models. Final collaborative research projects will allow you to apply your modeling skills to a cognitive phenomenon that you're interested in. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 or instructor permission. Computer Science 202 strongly recommended. 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CS 330 Introduction to Real-Time Systems How can we prove that dynamic cruise control will brake quickly enough if traffic suddenly stops? How must a system coordinate processes to detect pedestrians and other vehicles to ensure fair sharing of computing resources? In real-time systems, we explore scheduling questions like these, which require provable guarantees of timing constraints for applications including autonomous vehicles. This course will start by considering such questions for uniprocessor machines, both when programs have static priorities and when priorities can change over time. We will then explore challenges introduced by modern computers with multiple processors. We will consider both theoretical and practical perspectives. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 and Computer Science 202 (Mathematics 236 will be accepted in lieu of Computer Science 202). 6 credits; FSR; Winter; Tanya M Amert CS 331 Computer Networks The Internet is composed of a large number of heterogeneous, independently-operating computer networks that work together to transport all sorts of data to points all over the world. The fact that it does this so well given its complexity is a minor miracle. In this class, we'll study the structure of these individual networks and of the Internet, and figure out how this "magic" takes place. Topics include TCP/IP, protocols and their implementations, routing, security, network architecture, DNS, peer-to-peer networking, and Wi-Fi along with ethical and privacy issues. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 or instructor permission. 6 credits; FSR; Winter; Amy Csizmar Dalal CS 332 Operating Systems If you're working in the lab, you might be editing a file while waiting for a program to compile. Meanwhile, the on-screen clock ticks, a program keeps watch for incoming e-mail, and other users can log onto your machine from elsewhere in the network. Not only that, but if you write a program that reads from a file on the hard drive, you are not expected to concern yourself with turning on the drive's motor or moving the read/write arms to the proper location over the disk's surface. Coordinating all this hardware and software is the job of the operating system. In this course we will study the fundamentals of operating system design, including the operating system kernel, scheduling and concurrency, memory management, and file systems. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 and 208 or instructor permission. 6 credits; FSR; Spring; Aaron W Bauer CS 334 Database Systems Database systems are used in almost every aspect of computing, from storing data for websites to maintaining financial information for large corporations. Intrinsically, what is a database system and how does it work? This course takes a two-pronged approach to studying database systems. From a systems perspective, we will look at the low-level details of how a database system works internally, studying such topics as file organization, indexing, sorting techniques, and query optimization. From a theory perspective, we will examine the fundamental ideas behind database systems, such as normal forms and relational algebra. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 or consent of the instructor. 6 credits; FSR; Not offered 2019-20 CS 341 History of Computing in England Program: Cryptography Modern cryptographic systems allow parties to communicate in a secure way, even if they don't trust the channels over which they are communicating (or maybe even each other). Cryptography is at the heart of a huge range of applications: online banking and shopping, password-protected computer accounts, and secure wireless networks, to name just a few. In this course, we will introduce and explore some fundamental cryptographic primitives. Topics will include public-key encryption, digital signatures, code-breaking techniques (like those used at Bletchley Park during WWII to break the Enigma machine's cryptosystem), pseudorandom number generation, and other cryptographic applications.

(Mathematics 236 will be accepted in lieu of CS 202). 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Summer; David Liben-Nowell CS 344 Human-Computer Interaction The field of human-computer interaction addresses two fundamental questions: how do people interact with technology, and how can technology enhance the human experience? In this course, we will explore technology through the lens of the end user: how can we design effective, aesthetically pleasing technology, particularly user interfaces, to satisfy user needs and improve the human condition? How do people react to technology and learn to use technology? What are the social, societal, health, and ethical implications of technology? The course will focus on design methodologies, techniques, and processes for developing, testing, and deploying user interfaces. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 or instructor permission. 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Winter; Sneha Narayan CS 348 Parallel and Distributed Computing As multi-core machines become more prevalent, different programming paradigms have emerged for harnessing extra processors for better performance. This course explores parallel computation (programs that run on more than one core) as well as the related problem of distributed computation (programs that run on more than one machine). In particular, we will explore the two major paradigms for parallel programming, shared-memory multi-threading and message-passing, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Other possible topics include synchronization mechanisms, debugging concurrent programs, fork/join parallelism, the theory of parallelism and concurrency, parallel algorithms, cloud computing, and Map/Reduce.

The size and complexity of the resulting datasets have led to a new era where computational methods are essential to answering important biological questions. This course focuses on the process of transforming biological problems into well formed computational questions and the algorithms to solve them. Topics include approaches to sequence comparison and alignment; molecular evolution and phylogenetics; DNA/RNA sequencing and assembly; and specific disease applications including cancer genomics. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 and Computer Science 202 (Mathematics 236 will be accepted in lieu of Computer Science 202). 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Fall; Layla K Oesper CS 364 Molecular Programming and Nanoscale Self-Assembly Algorithms are ubiquitous in nature and are even present in biological and chemical processes. For example, cells receive molecular signals, execute procedures, and send signals of their own, and chemical reactions compute functions by transforming reactants into products according to molecular rules. In this course, we will investigate various mathematical models of chemistry, biology, and nanoscale self-assembly. We will use each model as a programming language to compute molecular algorithms, verify their correctness, and analyze their complexity and robustness. We will also discover that many of these models are algorithmically universal and are equivalent in power to modern programming languages. Prerequisite: Computer Science 201 and Computer Science 202 (Mathematics 236 will be accepted in lieu of Computer Science 202). No background in biology or chemistry is required, but it may be helpful. 6 credits; FSR, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 CS 399 Senior Seminar As part of their senior capstone experience, majors will work together in teams (typically four to seven students per team) on faculty-specified topics to design and implement the first stage of a project.

The basic introductory courses, 110 or 111 or both, are prerequisites to advanced courses; they offer a good foundation for further work in economics, but they have also been designed for students who have not yet selected majors and for those in other majors seeking an introduction to the analysis of economic theory and policies. Note: Either course in the principles sequence, Economics 110 or 111, can be taken first. Independent study (291 or 391) for those with special research interests can be taken with any faculty member.</p></div>

May be counted toward the History major. Prerequisite: Economics 110 and 111. 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 ECON 233 World Economic History This course surveys world economic history from Paleolithic times to today. It helps students understand the fundamental forces that drive economic growth and living standards. We address questions such as: How did economic systems function during the ancient and medieval periods? What caused the Industrial Revolution, allowing billions of humans to escape the "Malthusian trap"? Why haven't all countries experienced economic growth? Finally, what lessons can we learn from the past to help us better understand what the future may hold? The course focuses on long-term trends, but we will also examine short-run cyclical phenomena such as financial crises. Prerequisite: Economics 110 and 111. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IS, QRE; Winter; Jenny Bourne ECON 240 Microeconomics of Development This course explores household behavior in developing countries. We will cover areas including fertility decisions, health and mortality, investment in education, the intra-household allocation of resources, household structure, and the marriage market.

The course complements Economics 241. Prerequisite: Economics 111. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Fall; Faress Bhuiyan ECON 241 Growth and Development Why are some countries rich and others poor? What causes countries to grow? This course develops a general framework of economic growth and development to analyze these questions. We will document the empirical differences in growth and development across countries and study some of the theories developed to explain these differences. This course complements Economics 240. Prerequisite: Economics 110. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Fall; Ethan L Struby ECON 246 Economics of Welfare This course presents economic theory on how society as a whole ranks and chooses between different alternatives. It delves into the realm of normative economics analyzing objectives society may want to pursue, mechanisms designed to reach those objectives, and the resulting welfare of individuals affected by the choices made. The theoretical tools discussed will be used to study different mechanisms of voting, redistributing income, government intervention, auctions, and trade. Among other things, students will be exposed to the Pareto criterion, Arrow's impossibility theorem, the Vickrey-Clarke-Grove mechanism, the Coase theorem, utilitarianism, Rawlsian ethics, and welfare theorems. Prerequisite: Economics 111. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ECON 257 Economics of Gender This course uses economic theory and empirical evidence to examine gender differentials in education, marriage, fertility, earnings, labor market participation, occupational choice, and household work. Trends and patterns in gender-based outcomes will be examined across time, across countries, and within socio-economic groups, using empirical evidence from both historical and recent research. The impact of government and firm policies on gender outcomes will also be examined.

Prerequisite: Economics 111. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Winter; Prathi Seneviratne ECON 258 Ethical Questions and Economic Models While economists generally follow Friedman's advice and so focus on positive questions, our models routinely raise questions concerning distribution and other normative issues. This course explores that intersection between the positive and the normative. After studying normative theories proposed by Mill, Nozick, Rawls, Sen, and others, students will explore these ideas in a series of applications to understand better the positive and normative implications of economic models of regulation of prescription drug prices, Pigouvian taxation of externalities, standards for FDA drug approval, rent ceilings, minimum wages, anti-gouging laws, macroeconomic stimulus policies, and more. Prerequisite: Economics 110 and 111. 6 credits; SI; Not offered 2019-20 ECON 259 Economics of Higher Education This course examines current issues in higher education through the lens of both theoretical and empirical economics.

Prerequisite: Economics 110 and 111. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 ECON 263 Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Economic Performance Joseph Schumpeter, in lamenting the absence of an accepted theory of entrepreneurship, observed that this gap in economics is much like having Hamlet performed with the Prince of Denmark absent. Much has changed since Schumpeter leveled this criticism. Economics has embraced the contributions of entrepreneurs and provided theoretical models explaining their actions. This course explores the foundations of a microeconomic theory of entrepreneurship, investigating the role of entrepreneurs (and intrapreneurs within large organizations) as agents for change. Case studies of business development provide practical illustrations of ways in which entrepreneurs operate and how their efforts contribute to economic progress. Prerequisite: Economics 110 or 111. 6 credits; SI; Winter; Bruce R Dalgaard ECON 264 Health Care Economics This course will focus on the economics of medical care and how health care markets and systems work.

Prerequisite: Economics 110 and 111. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 ECON 275 Law and Economics Legal rules and institutions influence people's behavior. By setting acceptable levels of pollution, structuring guidelines for contract negotiations, deciding who should pay for the costs of an accident, and determining punishment for crimes, courts and legislatures create incentives. How do economic considerations factor into legal rules, and how do laws affect economic output and distribution? In this class, we use court cases, experiments, and current legal controversies to explore such issues.

No major is offered; however, we do offer an interdisciplinary minor for those students who are especially interested in educational studies but not necessarily in public school teaching.</p><p>Students may also qualify for 5-12 teaching licensure in the State of Minnesota in communication arts, mathematics, earth and space science, life science, and social studies. 7-12 licensure is offered in chemistry and physics. K-12 licensure is offered in world languages (French, German, Spanish) and visual arts. Earning licensure requires: completion of an approved Carleton major; other subject area courses not required by the Carleton major and/or specific courses within the major; a specified program of educational studies courses (see the Teacher Education Handbook); and student teaching in the major field, usually in a "13th Term."</p><p>Students interested in pursuing teaching licensure should obtain a handbook from the department office and should consult with a member of the education faculty early in their sophomore year. Students are encouraged to make formal application for admission to the teacher education program during the spring term of their sophomore year. Carleton licensure students will complete the majority of their course work at Carleton, but there will be courses only offered at St. Olaf through the inter-registration process which are required for licensure. St. Olaf will submit Carleton student's recommendation for licensure to the Minnesota Department of Education after completion of student teaching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Studies Minor</head><p>The Educational Studies Minor provides an interdisciplinary approach to the study of education as an individual pursuit, an institutional venture, and a societal imperative.

Standardized Testing and American Education How and why have standardized tests become so central to our educational system? This seminar will explore the following topics, among others--the invention of standardized tests and the growth of the testing industry; psychometrics (the science of mental measurement); and the controversies surrounding the use of standardized tests, including charges that they are culturally biased and do not positively contribute to student learning. Our analyses will be informed by a close examination of authentic testing materials, ranging from intelligence tests to the SAT. 6 credits; AI, WR1, IDS; Fall; Jeff Snyder EDUC 110 Introduction to Educational Studies This course will focus on education as a multidisciplinary field of study. We will explore the meanings of education within individual lives and institutional contexts, learn to critically examine the assumptions that writers, psychologists, sociologists and philosophers bring to the study of education, and read texts from a variety of disciplines. What has "education" meant in the past? What does "education" mean in contemporary American society? What might "education" mean to people with differing circumstances and perspectives? And what should "education" mean in the future? Open only to first-and second-year students. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IDS; Fall, Winter, Spring; Jeff Snyder, Deborah Appleman EDUC 225 Issues in Urban Education This course is an introduction to urban education in the United States.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Courses</head><p>ENGL 099 Summer Writing Program Emphasizing a writing process approach, the Summer Writing Program helps high school seniors learn to compose academic papers that are similar to those they will write in college. Students read both contemporary and traditional literature from classic texts by writers such as Plato and Shakespeare to a variety of modern short stories, essays, and poems by authors such as August Wilson, Margaret Atwood, James Baldwin, Alice Walker, and Adrienne Rich. This literature then becomes the focus of their papers. Students write every day, and although occasional creative writing exercises are included, the main emphasis of the course will be on expository prose. Cannot be used for the Writing Requirement. 6 credits; S/CR/NC; Summer; Deborah Appleman ENGL 100 Drama, Film, and Society With an emphasis on critical reading, writing, and the fundamentals of college-level research, this course will develop students' knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the relationship between drama and film and the social and cultural contexts of which they are (or were) a part and product. The course explores the various ways in which these plays and movies (which might include anything and everything from Spike Lee to Tony Kushner to Christopher Marlowe) generate meaning, with particular attention to the social, historical, and political realities that contribute to that meaning. An important component of this course will be attending live performances in the Twin Cities. These required events may be during the week and/or the weekend. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Pierre Hecker ENGL 100 How We Read: The History and Science of Reading In recent years, a 500-year-old technology for reading (the printed book) has been challenged by a very new one (the LCD displays in our phones and tablets). At the same time, advances in cognitive neuroscience have deepened our understanding of reading as a mental process. This makes it a good moment to consider how we read now and how we read in the past. We will examine a variety of reading practices, including reading aloud and silent reading, as well as the emotional impact of reading. The course will emphasize the foundational skill of academic reading--"close" reading--but also consider "distant" and "surface" reading. In addition to relevant scholarship, we will read poetry and novels as we reflect on our own habits as readers. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; George G Shuffelton ENGL 100 Imagining a Self This course examines how first-person narrators present, define, defend, and construct the self. We will read an assortment of autobiographical and fictional works, focusing on the critical issues that the first-person speaker "I" raises. In particular, we will consider the risks and rewards of narrative self-exposure, the relationship between autobiography and the novel, and the apparent intimacy between first-person narrators and their readers. Authors will include James Boswell, Charlotte Bronte, Harriet Jacobs, Sylvia Plath, and Dave Eggers. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Jessica L Leiman ENGL 100 Literary Revision: Authority, Art, and Rebellion The poet Adrienne Rich describes revision as "the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction." This course examines how literature confronts and reinvents the traditions it inherits. Through a diverse selection of fiction, poetry, and drama, we will examine how writers rework literary conventions, "rewrite" previous literary works, and critique societal myths. From Charles Chesnutt to Charles Johnson, from Henrik Ibsen to Rebecca Gilman, from Charlotte Bronte to Jean Rhys, from Maupassant and Chekhov to contemporary reinventions, we will explore literary revision from different perspectives and periods. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Nancy J Cho ENGL 100 Literature and Science Literature and science will seem to most of us disparate enterprises arising from fundamentally different kinds of knowing. This course investigates how nineteenth-century literature responded to the burgeoning authority of newly professionalized natural sciences and what the new sciences borrowed from literature. Reading both literary and scientific texts and paying attention to how writers of either kind understand themselves and their tasks, we will seek to observe how science and literature both threatened and served each other. In the second half of the term we will sample some twentieth-century examples of this fraught and fruitful relation. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Peter J Balaam ENGL 100 Rhetoric: Art of Persuasion Rhetoric's all around us: in political manifestos and legal pleadings; in professions of love and advertisements for dog food. We use it whenever we urge someone to believe what we say or do what we want. But how well do we understand the foundations and protocols of this art that teaches us "to see the available means of persuasion?" In this class we'll study the origins and theory of rhetoric (via Aristotle), examine exemplary instances (from Pericles to Trump), and consider the charges (via Plato) that it's all lies and trickery, while learning how to compose persuasive academic papers and presentations. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Timothy Raylor ENGL 100 Visions of the Waste Land In his great post-World War I poem, T. S. Eliot described the waste land of western civilization as "a heap of broken images." We will explore how the writers of the first half of the twentieth-century invented ways of reshaping those broken images into a new literary art that has come to be called Modernism. Writers studied will likely include Yeats, Joyce, Woolf, and Faulkner. Attention will be given to the writing of literary critical papers, and to supplying students with the foundational tools for more advanced literary study. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Gregory B Smith ENGL 109 Introduction to Rhetoric English 109 is the single Carleton course devoted exclusively to the study and practice of expository prose. It is designed to provide students with the organizational and argumentative skills they will need in order to write effectively at the college level and beyond. All sections of the course feature diverse readings, weekly writing exercises and essays, and individual tutorials. 6 credits; NE, WR2; Winter, Spring; George Cusack, Peter J Balaam ENGL 112 Introduction to the Novel This course will explore the history and form of the British novel, tracing its development from the eighteenth century to the present. Among the questions that we will consider: What are our expectations for novels, and what makes them such a popular form of entertainment? How did a genre once considered a source of moral corruption become a legitimate, even dominant, literary form? Authors will likely include: Daniel Defoe, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, and Jean Rhys. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Winter; Jessica L Leiman ENGL 114 Introduction to Medieval Narrative This class will focus on three of the most popular and closely connected modes of narrative enjoyed by medieval audiences: the epic, the romance, and the saint's life. Readings, drawn primarily from the English and French traditions, will include Beowulf, The Song of Roland, the Arthurian romances of Chretien de Troyes, and legends of St. Alexis and St. Margaret. We will consider how each narrative mode influenced the other, as we encounter warriors and lovers who suffer like saints, and saints who triumph like warriors and lovers. Readings will be in translation or highly accessible modernizations. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 115 The Art of Storytelling Jorge Luis Borges is quoted as saying that "unlike the novel, a short story may be, for all purposes, essential." This course focuses attention primarily on the short story as an enduring form. We will read short stories drawn from different literary traditions and from various parts of the world. Stories to be read include those by Aksenov, Atwood, Beckett, Borges, Camus, Cheever, Cisneros, Farah, Fuentes, Gordimer, Ishiguro, Kundera, Mahfouz, Marquez, Moravia, Nabokov, Narayan, Pritchett, Rushdie, Trevor, Welty, and Xue. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Spring; Kofi Owusu ENGL 117 African American Literature This course pays particular attention to the tradition of African American literary expression and the individual talent that brings depth and diversity to that tradition. The course's broader aims will be complemented by an introduction to the concept of genre and by the cultivation of the relevant skills of literary analysis. Authors to be read include Baraka, Ed Bullins, Countee Cullen, Douglass, Ellison, Nikki Giovanni, Hughes, Weldon Johnson, Larsen, and Wheatley. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IDS; Fall; Kofi Owusu ENGL 118 Introduction to Poetry We will look at the whole kingdom of poetry, exploring how poets use form, tone, sound, imagery, rhythm, and subject matter to create what Wallace Stevens called the "supreme fiction." Examples will be drawn from around the world, from Sappho to spoken word. Participation in discussion is mandatory; essay assignments will ask you to provide close readings of particular works; a couple of assignments will focus on the writing of poems so as to give you a full understanding of this ancient and living art. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Winter; Timothy Raylor ENGL 119 Introduction to U.S. Latino/a Literature We will begin by examining the forefathers and mothers of Latino/a literature: the nineteenth century texts of exile, struggles for Latin American independence, and southwestern resistance and accommodation. The early twentieth century offers new genres: immigrant novels and popular poetry that reveal the nascent Latino identities rooted in (or formed in opposition to) U.S. ethics and ideals. Finally we will read a sampling of the many excellent contemporary authors who are transforming the face of American literature. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IDS; Spring; Adriana Estill ENGL 125 Norse and Celtic Mythology What remains of the beliefs of the pre-Christian Norse and Celts represent some of the stranger and more obscure elements of Western tradition. Preserved thanks to the literacy which was brought by the new religion that extinguished it, the mythology of the Irish, Welsh, and Icelanders left a legacy that reveals itself in surprising places in our modern world. This course studies works such as the Prose and Poetic Eddas, The Mabinogi, and The Táin to explore myths as the products of environment and culture and examine the problems of transmission inherent to Christian descriptions of pagan belief. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 126 Arthurian Tradition: From Medieval to Modern King Arthur is a figure from Western tradition whose name conjures a clear series of associations: the Sword in the Stone, the Round <ref type="table">Table,</ref> the Holy Grail. This course traces the development of this tradition, from its origins in an obscure corner of the British Isles to its dominance within both European literature and the popular imagination. Similarly, Arthur himself takes on multiple, sometimes contradictory guises-an enemy of the English and yet a symbol of England, the archetype of the perfect king but a champion of democracy, the epitome of Christian devotion yet suffused with pagan imagery. Our texts range from medieval Welsh legend to modern film; everything is in modern English translation. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>ENGL 129 Introduction to British Comedy "And those things do best please me / That befall prepost'rously." A survey of comic plays, novels, short stories, films and television from Shakespeare, Austen, Lewis Carroll, Gilbert and Sullivan, Oscar Wilde, through P.G. Wodehouse and beyond. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 131 Reading Fiction Selected texts to be read in this course include those by Daniel Defoe, Thomas Hardy, Charles Johnson, J.M. Coetzee, Zadie Smith, and Sherman Alexie. We will pay close attention to the language of fiction, to the nature of narrative, and to narrative traditions in our ten-week journey from the world of Defoe's Moll Flanders to that of Alexie's Part-Time Indian. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 135 Imperial Adventures Indiana Jones has a pedigree. In this class we will encounter some of his ancestors in stories, novels and comic books from the early decades of the twentieth century. The wilds of Afghanistan, the African forest, a prehistoric world in Patagonia, the opium dens of mysterious exotic London--these will be but some of our stops as we examine the structure and ideology and lasting legacy of the imperial adventure tale. Writing Across Genres This course is a practitioner's guide to the creative writing process. We will work across genres, from poetry and prose fiction to creative nonfiction. Much of the reading in the class will be generated by class participants. Be ready to engage in critical and compassionate editorial conversation/discussion of each other's writing. 6 credits; ARP, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 187 Murder From the ancient Greeks to the Bible to the modern serial killer novel, murder has always been a preeminent topic of intellectual and artistic investigation. Covering a range of genres, including fiction, nonfiction, drama, and film, this transhistorical survey will explore why homicide has been the subject of such fierce attention from so many great minds. The "Great War" and the Literary Imagination The First World War shaped the world that we recognize as ours, creating new ways of remembering and forgetting as well as new forms of artistic expression. Writers shattered poetic forms and visual artists traditional modes of representation in order to register the previously unimaginable horrors of mechanized trench warfare and industrial-scale slaughter. Focusing primarily on poetry we will follow the arc of this aesthetic engagement from both British and German perspectives, starting with the late-Romantic musings of Rupert Brooke, through the haunting poems of Wilfred Owen, on to the various short-lived movements that marked the birth of modernism. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 202 The Bible as Literature We will approach the Bible not as an archaeological relic, nor as the Word of God, but "as a work of great literary force and authority [that has] shaped the minds and lives of intelligent men and women for two millennia and more." As one place to investigate such shaping, we will sample how the Bible (especially in the "Authorized" or King James version) has drawn British and American poets and prose writers to borrow and deploy its language and respond creatively to its narratives, images, and visions. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Winter; Peter J Balaam ENGL 203 The Age of Beowulf Although the Age of Beowulf ended almost one thousand years ago, its influence endures. Just as the CGI adaptation of Beowulf uses Old English--the language in England during this period--to mark the monstrous, the History Channel's Vikings uses this era as a historical backdrop, and Tolkien's LOTR finds much of its inspiration in Old English literature. In this class, then, we'll return to the source--to tales of demons, dragons, heroes, and saints found in various chronicles, poems, riddles, and more from the Age of Beowulf--and, hopefully, start to understand why this particular epoch looms so large. Texts will be read in modern translation. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 204 History of the English Language This class teaches the history of the English language through the prism of sociolinguistics. Along with teaching phonology, the basics of Old and Middle English, and changes in morphology, pronunciation and vocabulary over time, the course will explore how language both shapes and is shaped by society. We will use the history of English as a vehicle for exploring issues of imperialism, class, and politics that arose throughout the language's development. Along the way, students see how language plays an active role in both perpetuating and resolving communities' thorniest social problems, in the past and in the present day. ENGL 216 Milton Radical, heretic, and revolutionary, John Milton wrote the most influential, and perhaps the greatest, poem in the English language. We will read the major poems (Lycidas, the sonnets, Paradise Lost, Samson Agonistes), a selection of the prose, and will attend to Milton's historical context, to the critical arguments over his work, and to his impact on literature and the other arts. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Fall; Timothy Raylor ENGL 217 A Novel Education Samuel Johnson declared novels to be "written chiefly to the young, the ignorant, and the idle, to whom they serve as lectures of conduct, and introductions into life." This course will explore what kinds of education the novel offered its readers during a time when fiction was considered a source of valuable lessons and a vehicle for corruption. We will read a selection of eighteenth-and nineteenth-century novels, considering how they engage with contemporary educational theories, notions of male and female conduct, and concerns about the didactic and imaginative possibilities of fiction. Authors include Richardson, Lennox, Austen, Edgeworth, and Dickens. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>ENGL 218 The Gothic Spirit The eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw the rise of the Gothic, a genre populated by brooding hero-villains, vulnerable virgins, mad monks, ghosts, and monsters. In this course, we will examine the conventions and concerns of the Gothic, addressing its preoccupation with terror, sex, and the supernatural. As we situate this genre within its literary and historical context, we will consider its relationship to realism and Romanticism, and we will explore how it reflects the political and cultural anxieties of the age. ENGL 222 The Art of Jane Austen All of Jane Austen's fiction will be read; the works she did not complete or choose to publish during her lifetime will be studied in an attempt to understand the art of her mature comic masterpieces, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Winter; Susan Jaret McKinstry ENGL 223 American Transcendentalism Attempts to discern the nineteenth-century Zeitgeist come down, Emerson says, to a "practical question of the conduct of life. How shall I live?" This interdisciplinary course will investigate the works of the American Transcendentalist movement in its restless discontent with the conventional, its eclectic search for better ways of thinking and living. We will engage major works of Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller, and Whitman alongside documents of the scientific, religious, and political changes that shaped their era and provoked their responses. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 225 'Public Offenders': Pre-Raphaelites and Bloomsbury Group Two exceptional groups of artists changed aesthetic and cultural history through their writings, art, politics, and lives. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood began in 1847 when art students united to create "direct and serious and heartfelt" work; the Bloomsbury group began with Cambridge friends sharing their insistence on aesthetic lives. Critics said the PRB "extolled fleshliness as the supreme end of poetic and pictorial art," and the Bloomsbury Group "painted in circles, lived in squares and loved in triangles." We will study Dante Rossetti, Holman Hunt, John Millais, William Morris, Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, Roger Fry, Vanessa and Clive Bell. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Spring; Susan Jaret McKinstry ENGL 226 Modernism In the first decades of the twentieth century, modernist writers, artists, and thinkers confronted a modern world of rapidly accelerating industrialization, urbanization, and militarization with radically new ideas and forms that, by the estimation of many, upended twenty centuries of culture. This course, while centered on literature, will explore the modernist movement on both sides of the Atlantic and across genres and disciplines. We will study William Butler Yeats, James ENGL 245 Bollywood Nation This course will serve as an introduction to Bollywood or popular Hindi cinema from India. We will trace the history of this cinema and analyze its formal components. We will watch and discuss some of the most celebrated and popular films of the last 60 years with particular emphasis on urban thrillers and social dramas. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Spring; Arnab Chakladar ENGL 247 The American West Wallace Stegner once described the West as "the geography of hope" in the American imagination. Despite various dystopian urban pressures, the region still conjures up images of wide vistas and sunburned optimism. We will explore this paradox by examining both popular mythic conceptions of the West (primarily in film) and more searching literary treatments of the same area. We will explore how writers such as  <ref type="bibr">-1980</ref> In this course we will follow the various paths that the novel in India has taken since the late nineteenth century. Reading both works composed in English and some in translation we will probe in particular the ways in which questions of language and national/cultural identity are constructed and critiqued in the Indian novel. We will read some of the most celebrated Indian writers of the last 100 odd years as well as some who are not as well-known as they should be. The course will also introduce you to some fundamental concepts in postcolonial studies. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Spring; Arnab Chakladar ENGL 251 Contemporary Indian Fiction Contemporary Indian writers, based either in India or abroad, have become significant figures in the global literary landscape. This can be traced to the publication of Salman Rushdie's second novel, Midnight's Children in 1981. We will begin with that novel and read some of the other notable works of fiction of the following decades. The class will provide both a thorough grounding in the contemporary Indian literary scene as well as an introduction to some concepts in post-colonial studies. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 252 Caribbean Fiction This course will examine Anglophone fiction in the Caribbean from the late colonial period through our contemporary moment. We will examine major developments in form and language as well as the writing of identity, personal and (trans)national. We will read works by canonical writers such as V.S Naipaul, George Lamming and Jamaica Kincaid, as well as by lesser known contemporary writers. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 256 Ireland Program: Irish History and Culture In this course we will examine the beliefs, practices, and relationships that shaped the Irish historical experience, providing students with an historical grounding for their explorations and studies in Ireland. In addition to history and politics, topics will include language, folklore, music, and visual culture. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Summer; Constance Walker ENGL 258 Contemporary American Playwrights of Color This course examines a diverse selection of plays from the 1960s to the present, exploring how different theatrical contexts, from Broadway to regional theater to Off-Off Broadway, frame the staging of ethnic identity. Playwrights and performers to be studied include Amiri Baraka, Alice Childress, Ntozake Shange, George C. Wolfe, Luis Valdez, David Henry Hwang, August Wilson, Philip Gotanda, Maria Irene Fornes, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Anna Deavere Smith.</p><p>There will be occasional out-of-class film screenings, and attendance at live theater performances when possible. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 261 Telling Your American Story This is a creative nonfiction course focused around students writing their American stories. The goal of the course is the generation of new narratives to enrich and add complexity to the popular stories of what constitutes America(n). Each assignment will build on the next, culminating in a final portfolio of student writing about their lives and its place in American history and context. Prerequisite: Any one English course. 6 credits; ARP, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 262 Narrative Lab We'll explore narrative in any number of styles and guises, reading and writing various forms including the fairy tale, prose poem, ten minute play, and short fiction. We may veer toward the pilot and we will touch on the narrative potential in video games. A few of the questions we'll consider: What do we require of narrative in 2017? What form is best suited to specific material?</p><p>What basic material must be included in this form but is not essential to that form? Some projects will be collaborative and others will be done solo. 6 credits; ARP, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 263 Crafts of Writing: Creative Nonfiction Do you like it when true things happen? Would you like to take those true things and make them sound truer than true? Would you like to use words while doing that? In this course, students will write an evocation, a piece of long-form narrative journalism, and a personal essay. Class time will be spent on live writing assignments, giving and receiving feedback, learning writing and research techniques, and having discussions about things that seem trivial right up until the moment that their ultimate significance is revealed. Prerequisite: One previous English course. 6 credits; ARP, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 264 American Lyric: Poetry, Pop and Rap In this course we will look at the shifting boundary between genres that share a common root in lyrical expression. From the sonnet to chart topping pop to underground rap, what it means to be American has been built and is continually refurbished from the lyric up. We will be asking many questions. ENGL 319 The Rise of the Novel A study of the origin and development of the English novel throughout the long eighteenth century. We will situate the early novel within its historical and cultural context, paying particular attention to its concern with courtship and marriage, writing and reading, the real and the fantastic. We will also consider eighteenth-century debates about the social function of novels and the dangers of reading fiction. ENGL 333 Margaret Atwood Margaret Atwood is among the most influential and important writers of our time. In this class we will study a wide range of her major work from the beginning of her career to the present, asking questions about genre, feminism, form, etc. While her novels will be our focus, we will also read some of her poetry, short stories, and essays. There will be occasional out-of-class screenings of television and film adaptations of Atwood's work. </p></div>

The complexities of environmental problems dictate that study of the environment be based in multiple disciplines to provide students with skill sets and knowledge bases in the following areas: scientific principles as applied to the environment, the political, economic, social and cultural dimensions of environmental problems, the historical and ethical context for environmental problems and policy, and literary and artistic explorations of the environment. Students who major in Environmental Studies can gain a broad knowledge base in the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities, which is intended to help them understand the complex environmental issues faced by societies around the world.</p><p>The major is designed to help students make connections across these key knowledge bases, which traditionally have been pursued largely in disciplinary isolation. In order to facilitate making these connections, the major is organized into a multidisciplinary set of core courses. In addition, we ask students to work with their advisors to develop a specific interdisciplinary focus, which will be explained and exhibited in an electronic "Profile." Examples of interdisciplinary foci supported by our curriculum include: Conservation and Development, Food and Agriculture, Energy and Climate, Environmental Justice, Landscapes and Perception, and Water Resources.</p><p>The Environmental Studies major prepares students for meaningful involvement in a wide array of environmental and governmental organizations, as well as for graduate study in many environmental fields, law, public policy, and other areas of inquiry.</p></div>

America through European Eyes During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, America often served as a canvass for projecting European anxieties about economic, social and political modernization. Admiration of technological progress and political stability was combined with a pervasive anti-Americanism, which was, according to political scientist Andrei Markovits, the "lingua franca" of modern Europe. These often contradictory perceptions of the United States were crucial in the process of forming national histories and mythologies as well as a common European identity. Accordingly, this course will explore the many and often contradictory views expressed by Europe's emerging mass publics and intellectual and political elites about the United States during this period. 6 credits; AI, WR1, IS; Fall; Paul Petzschmann EUST 110 The Nation State in Europe This course explores the role of the nation and nationalism within modern Europe and the ways in which ideas and myths about the nation have complemented and competed with conceptions of Europe as a geographic, cultural and political unity. We will explore the intellectual roots of nationalism in different countries as well as their artistic, literary and musical expressions. In addition to examining nationalism from a variety of disciplinary perspectives--sociology, anthropology, history, political science--we will explore some of the watershed, moments of European nationalism such as the French Revolution, the two world wars, and the Maastricht treaty. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>EUST 111 The Age of Cathedrals Arising over a period of two medieval centuries, the gothic cathedrals of Europe symbolize at once faith, political and economic power, local identity, and technological and artistic achievement. Later generations commemorated them in literature and art, destroyed them in their political and religious zeal, and restored them (and continue to restore them) out of different sort of political zeal as well as a sense of duty and opportunity to preserve a national and European cultural inheritance and tourist treasure. In this course, we seek to understand the cathedral and its enduring legacy in Europe, and especially in France, from a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives and using a variety of media and sources. 6 credits; HI, IS; Fall; William L North EUST 159 "The Age of Isms" -Ideals, Ideas and Ideologies in Modern Europe "Ideology" is perhaps one of the most-used (and overused) terms of modern political life. This course will introduce students to important political ideologies and traditions of modern Europe and their role in the development of political systems and institutional practices from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. We will read central texts by conservatives, liberals, socialists, anarchists and nationalists while also considering ideological outliers such as Fascism and Green Political Thought.

Of course; however, their accessibility doesn't mean they are simple. In this course, students will learn to read graphic novels as cultural products generated by artists, places, and institutions. Coming from French-speaking countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, these texts argue for different (and sometimes contradictory) definitions of the genre; but also bring to the fore political and societal issues at stake in the francophone world. Using the tools of contemporary theory, students will draw connections between art and cultural representations. Starting with discussions about the origins of French colonialism in North Africa, it will develop into an analysis of the war of liberation and the ways it has been recorded in history books, pop culture, and canonical texts.

Prerequisite: Take German 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 GERM 213 Staging Revolution From classic drama to concrete poetry, from epigrams to Instagram, how are revolutions and social movements spurred forward by the medium in which they are promoted? Not just literal revolution, but what literary revolutions themselves have resulted from such processes? Students will be exposed to many different kinds of texts and films of varying length, and challenged to ask the question: how is language being used here? Course goals include refinement of written and spoken expression, and further development of reading and listening skills. Readings/viewings from GERM 215 Refugees Welcome? Debating Migration and Multiculturalism in Post-War Germany This class brings together diverse voices--journalists, philosophers, and political scientists, as well as authors and filmmakers--in order to trace Germany's contested development to a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. Starting with the "guest worker" program of the 1960s to the ongoing refugee crisis, Germans have asked themselves "What is 'deutsch'?" We will explore Germany's rich history of negotiating national identity through public discourse, including topics such as German-Turkish relations, Jewish emigration after the Cold War, and the role of Islam in modern Germany. We will focus on refining students' reading skills: We will survey works from a variety of genres, expand our vocabulary, and explore different layers of German writing through contextualization, translation, analysis and discussion. We will hone our reading strategies for works of fiction and non-fiction, discuss the pros and cons of various (online) dictionaries, and review relevant grammar topics.

In response to the religious and philosophical "crisis" of Jewish identity during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we will explore what it means to live between two distinct cultural traditions, how this struggle impacts questions of authorship, cultural belonging and personal identity, and how critical engagement with the past helps to shape and determine our hopes and aspirations for the future. In English translation. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 GERM 247 Mirror, Mirror: Reflecting on Fairy Tales and Folklore Many people are familiar with the fairy tales collected and published by the Brothers Grimm and have seen iterations of such stories in animated Disney films and live-action reboots. In this class, taught in English, we will critically examine folktales, consider their role in shaping societal standards and how they spread specific values across cultures. We will study the origins of Grimms' fairy tales before discussing their larger role across media and cultures. Our study of traditional German fairy tales will be informed by contemporary theoretical approaches including feminist theory, ecocriticism, psychology, and animal studies. 6 credits; LA, IS; Spring; Kiley Kost GERM 256 Berlin Program: Crossing Boundaries Who is allowed in? Who is refused entry? How is Berlin divided? How does the city come together? From the first city walls shortly after its 1237 founding to its most famous wall erected in 1961 to today's debate on accepting migrants, Berlin's borders have always had profound effects on its own residents and the world at large. In this course, we will encounter walls in texts, films, plays, museums, and excursions, as well as the difficulties in crossing these boundaries. We will thereby focus on issues of religious tolerance, immigration, xenophobia, the Cold War, and Berlin as cultural and political capital. Prerequisite: Acceptance to Berlin Program. 6 credits; HI, IS; Fall; Seth Elliott Meyer GERM 257 Berlin Program: Walking the Metropolis As much as a place affects its people, every person's footprints leave a literal and figurative imprint on the place.

In this course, taught in German, we will read works of literature and poetry that portray disaster. Focusing on disaster as the site of interaction between humans and the environment, we will explore and discuss the impact of modern technology, contemporary environmental issues, and the concept of disaster in the shadow of war. Thinking in terms of environmental justice, we will also consider who is impacted by such disasters and in what ways. In this course, students will undertake critical readings of surveillance and seminal portrayals of it from the history of German-language literature and film. We will examine the purposes surveillance has served throughout history, the effects it has had on people, the state, and technology, and the ways in which it has been aestheticized in modern fiction, press, and film.

Prerequisite: Acceptance to Berlin Program. 6 credits; LA; Fall; Seth Elliott Meyer GERM 360 Song That Sleeps in Everything Starting with the Baroque era, we will examine German poems as expressions of the literary movements that gave birth to them. Since the class will focus on each poem as representative of an aesthetic code grounded in specific literary movements, this class is also an excellent introduction to German literary history. We will read the poems, discuss them, listen to recordings and do our own lyrical or dramatic readings. Selections will include poems set to music, as well as twentieth century Cabaret. Interested students may also try their hand at translation. Prerequisite: German 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 GERM 372 The Latest--Current Themes in German Literature, Film and the Media In this course, students will read and discuss a number of new works from the German-speaking countries that deal with important contemporary issues--the pressures of growing up and finding a job in uncertain economic times, the catastrophe of 9/11, the ever-present theme of finding love, immigrant perspectives, the challenges of aging, etc. We will examine novels and stories that deal with these topics, but also articles in magazines (Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) and films, trying to understand how various genres and media differ in their approaches to our themes. At the center of our discussion there will thus be the question of what forms of expression a society finds for the formulation of its most urgent challenges, and how these texts take part in the public debate. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History</head><p>The History major introduces students to major civilizations of the past and develops skills of research, analysis, expression that are essential to students in the Liberal Arts environment. These skills are also relevant to all careers and professions. History majors learn not only what happened in the past, but also how to explain significant elements of continuity and how to analyze moments of profound rupture. Thus a History major develops a deep appreciation for the durable phenomena of world cultures (the persistence of poverty, the transcendence of genius, the corruption of political power), as well as a keen analytical framework for understanding transformative moments in time (the American, Mexican and French Revolutions, the Civil Rights Movement, etc.)</p><p>In view of the variety of departmental offerings, History majors are allowed to design their own mix of courses. The department offers guidelines, attentive advising, and carefully selected requirements to ensure coherence in the student's growing mastery of the discipline. Still, much of the choice on specific courses is left up to the individual student. The student's pathway through the major should reflect his or her particular interests, abilities and career plans.</p><p>See History Department Web site: https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/history/</p></div>

Though the course is not a comprehensive survey, it racializes the history of work by tracing the long story of black labor in the U.S. from the plantation to the plant. Whereas the bulk of the course will analyze black labor and labor movements in the twentieth century, specifically focusing on the push for economic inclusion and mobility amid employment, societal and union-related racial discrimination, we will examine what involuntary black labor meant in the context of slavery and the construction of a capitalist economy. We will devote attention to black workers with regard to such topics as antiunionism, deindustrialization, economic inequality, Fordism, labor radicalism and violence, New Deal and unemployment insurance, the rise of civil rights unionism, and slavery and capitalism, among other themes. In this seminar, we will examine the Black Death (primarily in Europe) from a range of perspectives and disciplines and through a range of sources. We will seek to understand the biological and environmental causes of the disease, therapies, and the experience of illness, but also the effects of the mortality on economic, social, religious, and cultural life. 6 credits; AI, WR1, QRE, IS; Fall; Victoria Morse HIST 100 Trials in Early America Women and men of all races, ethnicities, and classes passed through the courts of early America. This course will be based primarily on trial transcripts and other court papers from seventeenth-and eighteenth-century America. We will use these documents as windows onto the contemporary legal, cultural, and social issues that these trials challenged. Using secondary sources, the seminar will then put these issues into the larger contexts of slavery, colonization and empire in Dutch, <ref type="bibr">Spanish, French, and British</ref>   <ref type="bibr">, 1865-1945</ref> This course offers a survey of the American experience from the end of the Civil War through World War II. Although we will cover a large number of major historical developments--including Reconstruction, the Progressive movement, World War I, the Great Depression, the New Deal and World War II--the course will seek to emphasize the various beliefs, values, and understandings that informed Americans' choices throughout these periods. A particular theme will be individual Americans' varied personal experiences of historical trends and events. We will seek to understand the connections (and sometimes the disconnections) between the past and present. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 122 U.S. Women's History to 1877 Gender, race, and class shaped women's participation in the arenas of work, family life, culture, and politics in the United States from the colonial period to the late nineteenth century.

We will explore how the dimensions of race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality shaped diverse women's experiences of these historical changes. Topics will include: immigration, the expansion of the welfare system and the consumer economy, labor force segmentation and the world wars, and women's activism in civil rights, labor, peace and feminist movements. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Winter; Annette Igra HIST 124 History of the City in the United States This course introduces modern United States urban history in social, cultural, political, and economic perspective. Our particular focus will be the period from 1865-present, but we will also consider earlier trends of urbanization in the U.S. Major course themes will include: life in the city, the rise, fall, and renewal of the American city, urban history and public memory, the economic and political history of the city, the culture of cities, and immigration, race, and ethnicity. We will also examine approaches to studying U.S. urban history.  250-850 CE. We will focus in particular on how people in late antiquity used environmental, institutional, socio-economic, and cultural resources to address an ongoing series of changes and challenges in their worlds. It also examines these responses from multiple perspectives: winners and losers, elites and nonelites, people of different ethnicities and cultures, urban and rural populations, and diverse religious groups and sects within these groups.

We will examine questions like: What did "crusade" or "mission" mean? How did people respond to, resist, or co-opt these enterprises? Did crusade and mission expand Europeans' knowledge of other cultures? In addition to critical analysis of primary sources and current scholarship, the course will offer opportunities to share knowledge with a broader public.  <ref type="bibr">, 1789-1914</ref> This course traces the evolution of Europe from the French Revolution to the outbreak of World War I, and examines some of the political, social, economic, intellectual, and cultural forces that have shaped and reshaped European society. We will cover the growth of modern nation-states, the industrial revolution and its effects on society, changes in the family and gender roles, and the evolution of modern consciousness in the arts, literature, and philosophy. The course will strive to look at both Western and Eastern Europe, and will conclude with a close examination of the causes of the First World War. 6 credits; HI, IS; Fall; David G Tompkins HIST 141 Europe in the Twentieth Century This course explores developments in European history in a global context from the final decade of the nineteenth century through to the present. We will focus on the impact of nationalism, war, and revolution on the everyday experiences of women and men, and also look more broadly on the chaotic economic, political, social, and cultural life of the period. Of particular interest will be the rise of fascism and communism, and the challenge to Western-style liberal democracy, followed by the Cold War and communism's collapse near the end of the century. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 142 Women in Modern Europe An exploration of women's lives in Europe from 1700 to the present. We will focus on changes in women's work before and after the industrial revolution, women as revolutionaries in 1789, 1848, and 1871, and campaigns for women's rights. Why did Virginia Woolf say it was worse "perhaps" to be locked in than to be locked out? Why did Bertolt Brecht's character known simply as "the mother" take up the flag of revolution in Russia in 1905? We will investigate these questions from the Early Modern era to the European Union through a variety of sources: philosophical In order to answer these questions, this course asks you to think about history differently: can we imagine history as something other than a line of progress? Can political struggles be the same if the language that describes them changes? This class will explore alternative conceptions of history, agency, and change as we examine the ways indigenous people have engaged states in Latin America since the nineteenth century. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 181 West Africa in the Era of the Slave Trade The medieval Islamic and the European (or Atlantic) slave trades have had a tremendous influence on the history of Africa and the African Diaspora. This course offers an introduction to the history of West African peoples via their involvement in both of these trades from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. More specifically, students will explore the demography, the economics, the social structure, and the ideologies of slavery. They also will learn the repercussions of these trades for men's and women's lives, for the expansion of coastal and hinterland kingdoms, and for the development of religious practices and networks. 6 credits; HI, IS; Fall; Thabiti Willis HIST 183 History of Early West Africa This course surveys the history of West Africa during the precolonial period from 790 to 1590.

This course will explore how a "Pacific World" framework can help us understand the movement of peoples, goods, and ideas across an oceanic space. Can we describe the history of the Pacific as having a unified history? This course will explore various topics in Pacific history including the history of exploration and migration, cross-cultural encounters, science and empire, and environmental history from 1750 to the present. While this course will be transnational in scope, it will focus primarily on U.S. exploration, trade, and the making of an American Pacific frontier. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 200 Historians for Hire A two-credit course in which students work with faculty oversight to complete a variety of public history projects with community partners.

Potential projects include educational programming, historical society archival work, and a variety of local history opportunities. HIST 203 American Indian Education, 1600s-present This course introduces students to the history of settler education for Indigenous students. In the course, we will engage themes of resistance, assimilation, and educational violence though an investigation of nation-to-nation treaties, federal education legislation, court cases, student memoirs, film, fiction, and artwork. Case studies will illustrate student experiences in mission schools, boarding schools, and public schools between the 1600s and the present, asking how Native people have navigated the educational systems created for their assimilation and how schooling might function as a tool for Indigenous resurgence in the future. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Spring; Meredith L McCoy HIST 204 Jews, Christians and Muslims in the Medieval Mediterranean The Mediterranean was a dynamic hub of cultural exchange in the Middle Ages. We will draw on Jewish, Muslim, and Latin Christian sources to explore this contact from 1050-1492 and the role of the sea itself in joining and separating the peoples who surrounded it. What did it mean to be a Muslim pilgrim in Christian-held Palestine? A Jewish vizier serving a Muslim ruler in Spain? A Christian courtier courting martyrdom in North Africa? We will explore lives led between coexistence and violence, intellectual and legal structures that helped to negotiate difference, and the textures of daily life. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 205 American Environmental History Environmental concerns, conflicts, and change mark the course of American history, from the distant colonial past to our own day.

Some previous knowledge of American history assumed. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 215 Carleton in the Archives: Studies in Institutional Memory and Culture Ours is a world of institutions--schools, corporations, non-profits, government agencies--that shape the way we act, think, and remember. The memory [and amnesia] of institutions themselves, the records they keep and throw away, and the way these repositories are organized and used are crucial elements in their function and survival. How do institutions remember? What is the relationship between "official" and "individual" memory in the making of an institutional world? How do past and present connect? We will explore this and related questions through readings, discussion, and a hands-on project based upon material in Carleton's own archives. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 216 History Beyond the Walls This course will examine the world of history outside the walls of academia. Looking at secondary-school education, museums, and public policy, we will explore the ways in which both general and specialized publics learn and think about history. A central component of the Movies can make understanding the past seem easy because they do not require the people observing them to thinkthey can just sit and enjoy the story. But this is not true of films and novels that address crucial issues like slavery. Slavery in the U.S. and globally was and remains a moral question. People are pro, anti, or indifferent to slavery and its legacies, and their responses to representations of human bondage can reveal a lot about contemporary attitudes about race and gender. In this class we will examine this process by looking at a range of films (e.g., Gone With The Wind, 12 Years a Slave, Django, and Mandingo). We will contextualize the films with both primary and secondary texts. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 223 The Presidents and their Slaves This course analyzes slavery, often referred to as the peculiar institution, through its most peculiar lens: the involvement in chattel slavery by the founding fathers and the federal government. We will explore the troubled history of our nation's founding fathers who, on the one hand, promoted democracy and liberty, and who, on the other hand, owned slaves. We will study the lives of Sally Hemings, Paul Jennings, Ona Judge and other slaves owned by Presidents and will probe how the White House emerged as a quasi-plantation built on the labor of enslaved people. Further, we will examine the federal government's legacy in perpetuating and protecting slavery, scrutinizing the Constitution, Fugitive Slave Act and other legislative actions that safeguarded the institution. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Winter; Tyran K Steward HIST 224 Divercities: Exclusion and Inequality in Urban America This course examines the twentiethcentury history of the United States city in global comparative perspective. It will focus on how exclusion, difference, inequality, and segregation have evolved along with diversity and heterogeneity in the modern city. We will explore this basic contradiction of the U.S. city in history as a contested site of opportunity and foreclosure, asking: how have American cities been both zones of exclusion and inequality while at the same time places in which diverse groups of people have interacted? 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 225 James Baldwin and Black Lives Matter This seminar is an inquiry into James Baldwin's rich political and cultural thought that animates racial justice demands that take shape under conditions of domination. Armed with critical tools from history, but also cultural studies and queer theory, we seek to understand connections between the civil rights/black power era in the 1950s and '60s and the Black Lives Matter movement of our time. Baldwin is an exemplar of critical conversations about black death by police in Cleveland, Chicago, Ferguson, and the Twin Cities and the disentanglement between Martin Luther King's dream and the American Dream. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Spring; Harry M Williams HIST 226 U.S. Consumer Culture In the period after 1880, the growth of a mass consumer society recast issues of identity, gender, race, class, family, and political life. We will explore the development of consumer culture through such topics as advertising and mass media, the body and sexuality, consumerist politics in the labor movement, and the response to the Americanization of consumption abroad. We will read contemporary critics such as Thorstein Veblen, as well as historians engaged in weighing the possibilities of abundance against the growth of corporate power. 6 credits; HI, IDS, WR2; Spring; Annette Igra HIST 227 The American West Somewhere on the sunset-side of the Mississippi River, the American West begins. It is a region steeped in nostalgia and freighted with stories and longings that Americans have now cherished for many generations. It is also a place as complex and tangled in dynamic cultural, political, and environmental forces as any place on earth. Among the themes we will focus on are relationships among Native American and Euro-American peoples, the transition from imperial frontier to American territory, the shaping power of economic and cultural initiatives, and the centrality of nature and environmental change in forging our western past and present. HIST 229 Working with Gender in U.S. History Historically work has been a central location for the constitution of gender identities for both men and women; at the same time, cultural notions of gender have shaped the labor market. We will investigate the roles of race, class, and ethnicity in shaping multiple sexual divisions of labor and the ways in which terms such as skill, bread-winning and work itself were gendered. Topics will include domestic labor, slavery, industrialization, labor market segmentation, protective legislation, and the labor movement. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 HIST 231 Mapping the World Before Mercator This course will explore early maps primarily in medieval and early modern Europe. After an introduction to the rhetoric of maps and world cartography, we will examine the functions and forms of medieval European and Islamic maps and then look closely at the continuities and transformations in map-making during the period of European exploration. The focus of the course will be on understanding each map within its own cultural context and how maps can be used to answer historical questions. We will work closely with the maps in Gould Library Special Collections to expand campus awareness of the collection. 6 credits; HI, WR2, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST Life This course will explore the history of England from the time of the Tudors through the Industrial Revolution, with a particular focus on the history of poverty and social welfare. We will use new technologies to develop innovative ways to teach and learn about the past. Using a specially designed digital archive, students will construct life stories of paupers, politicians and intellectuals. One day per week, the class will work in a computer lab constructing 3-Dimensional, virtual institutions and designing computer game scenarios that utilize their research to recreate the lived experience of the poor. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 236 Women and Gender in Europe before the French Revolution What were women's lives and experiences like in Europe before the modern era? What work did they do, how did they manage their private lives, their family commitments, their faith, and their intellectual lives? We will examine these questions through women's own writings, writings about women, and secondary literature on family, gender, medicine, law, and culture. In 2016-17, we will have a special opportunity to think about Jewish women's lives.  <ref type="bibr">1953)</ref>. This course will explore many of these changes, with special attention paid to the social and political impact of wars (the Russo-Japanese War, World War I, the Civil War, and the Great Patriotic War) and revolutions <ref type="bibr">(of 1905 and 1917)</ref>, the ideological conflicts they engendered, and the comparative historical context in which they transpired. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 242 Communism, Cold War, Collapse: Russia Since Stalin In this course we will explore the history of Russia and other former Soviet states in the period after the death of Stalin, exploring the workings of the communist system and the challenges it faced internally and internationally. We will investigate the nature of the late Soviet state and look at the different trajectories Russia and other post- These six centuries witnessed dramatic transformations, including changing environmental conditions, ethnic migrations, the coming of Christianity, waning Roman influence, the rise of kingdoms, and the emergence of new agricultural and economic regimes. We will look beyond the kings and priests at the top of society by analyzing objects people made and used, buildings they built, and human remains they buried alongside primary and secondary written sources. Students will gain experience in how to write history from "things." 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 <ref type="bibr">HIST 247</ref> The First World War as Global Phenomenon On this centenary of the First World War, the course will explore the global context for this cataclysmic event, which provides the hinge from the nineteenth century into the twentieth. We will spend considerable time on the build-up to and causes of the conflict, with particular emphasis on the new imperialism, race-based ideologies, and the complex international struggles for global power. In addition to the fighting, we will devote a significant portion of the course to the home front and changes in society and culture during and after the war. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 249 Two Centuries of Tumult: Modern Central Europe An examination of the political, social, and cultural history of Central Europe from 1848 to the present day. We will explore the evolution of state and civil society in the multicultural/multinational regions of the present-day Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, as well as eastern Germany and Austria. Much of the course will focus on the common experiences of authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, fascism/Nazism, and especially the Communist era and its dissolution. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 250 Modern Germany This course offers a comprehensive examination of German history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will look at the German-speaking peoples of Central Europe through the prism of politics, society, culture, and the economy. Through a range of readings, we will grapple with the many complex and contentious issues that have made German history such an interesting area of intellectual inquiry. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 250F Modern Germany-FLAC German Trailer This course is a supplement in German for History 250, Modern Germany, and will meet once weekly. Open to students who have completed German 103 or who have intermediate or advanced skills in German. Speaking in German, we will discuss German language primary sources, including documents, music and film clips. Together, we will explore comparative dimensions of Chinese economic history from the sixteenth century to the present, examine classical and recent scholarship on Chinese economic development, global movement of capital and labor, origins of Chinese capitalism, "world-system" theories, agrarian "involution," arguments about East Asia's economic divergence from Europe, and market reforms with "Chinese characteristics." Christopher Isett (University of Minnesota) will explain how economic historians apply history methods and approaches. Yingjia Tian (Wesleyan) will share his business history case study on 1950's Shanghai electric companies. Brent Irvin '94 (Tencent Corporation/China) will discuss the state of the business world in contemporary China. Each Ott Family Lecturer will also present a public talk for the class, campus, and wider community; public talk attendance is a required component of this course. 6 credits; HI, QRE, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 259 Women in South Asia: Histories, Narratives, and Representations The objective of this course is to analyze the historical institutions, practices and traditions that define the position of women in India. We consider the various ways in which the trope of the Goddess has been used for and by Indian women in colonial and post-colonial India; the colonial state's supposed rescue of Indian women; the position and role of European women in colonial India; how women's bodies come to embody and signify community honor and become sites of communal contest. We explore the making of Mother India; the connection between nation, territory and the female form; and the ways in which women have been represented in history as well as Indian cinema. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 260 The Making of the Modern Middle East A survey of major political and social developments from the fifteenth century to the beginning of World War I. Topics include: state and society, the military and bureaucracy, religious minorities (Jews and Christians), and women in premodern Muslim societies; the encounter with modernity. 6 credits; HI, IS; Fall; Adeeb Khalid HIST 262 Public Health: History, Policy, and Practice This course will examine the rise of the institution of public health in the modern period. Locating public health within the social history of medicine we will consider how concepts of health and disease have changed over time and how the modern state's concern with the health of its population cannot be separated from its need to survey, police, and discipline the public. Topics covered will include miasma, contagion, quarantine, vaccination and the connection between European imperialism and the institutionalization of public health in colonial contexts. We will also consider how certain epidemics became the major drivers for public health. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 263 Plagues of Empire The globalization of disease is often seen as a recent phenomenon aided by high-speed communication and travel. This course examines the history of the spread of infectious diseases by exploring the connection between disease, medicine and European imperial expansion. We consider the ways in which European expansion from 1500 onwards changed the disease landscape of the world and how pre-existing diseases in the tropics shaped and thwarted imperial ambitions. We will also question how far Western medicine can be seen as a benefit by examining its role in facilitating colonial expansion and constructing racial and gender difference. 6 credits; HI, IS; Spring; Amna Khalid HIST 265 Central Asia in the Modern Age Central Asia--the region encompassing the post-Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and the Xinjiang region of the People's Republic of China--is often considered one of the most exotic in the world, but it has experienced all the excesses of the modern age. After a basic introduction to the long-term history of the steppe, this course will concentrate on exploring the history of the region since its conquest by the Russian and Chinese empires. We will discuss the interaction of external and local forces as we explore transformations in the realms of politics, society, culture, and religion. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 268 India Program: History, Globalization, and Politics in Modern India Indian democracy presents a complicated social and political terrain that is being reshaped and remapped by a wide variety of efforts to bring about economic development, social change, political representation, justice, and equality. In this course we will examine, among other topics, the history of modern India with a focus on political movements centered on issues of colonialism, nationalism, class, gender, and caste. We will also examine changes in contemporary India brought about by globalization, and study how particular groups and communities have reacted and adapted to these developments. Prerequisite: OCS India Program. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 HIST 270 Nuclear Nations: India and Pakistan as Rival Siblings At the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947 India and Pakistan, two new nation states emerged from the shadow of British colonialism. This course focuses on the political trajectories of these two rival siblings and looks at the ways in which both states use the other to forge antagonistic and belligerent nations. While this is a survey course it is not a comprehensive overview of the history of the two countries. Instead it covers some of the more significant moments of rupture and violence in the political history of the two states. The first two-thirds of the course offers a top-down, macro overview of these events and processes whereas the last third examines the ways in which people experienced these developments. We use the lens of gender to see how the physical body, especially the body of the woman, is central to the process of nation building. We will consider how women's bodies become sites of contestation and how they are disciplined and policed by the postcolonial state(s HIST 287 From Alchemy to the Atom Bomb: The Scientific Revolution and the Making of the Modern World This course examines the growth of modern science since the Renaissance with an emphasis on the Scientific Revolution, the development of scientific methodology, and the emergence of new scientific disciplines. How might a history of science focused on scientific networks operating within society, rather than on individual scientists, change our understanding of "genius," "progress," and "scientific impartiality?" We will consider a range of scientific developments, treating science both as a body of knowledge and as a set of practices, and will gauge the extent to which our knowledge of the natural world is tied to who, when, and where such knowledge has been produced and circulated. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 298 Junior Colloquium In the junior year, majors must take this six-credit reading and discussion course taught each year by different members of the department faculty. The course is also required for the History minor. The general purpose of History 298 is to help students reach a more sophisticated understanding of the nature of history as a discipline and of the approaches and methods of historians. A major who is considering off-campus study in the junior year should consult with their adviser on when to take History 298. Prerequisite: At least two six credit courses in History (excluding HIST 100 and Independents) at Carleton. 6 credits; HI; Fall, Winter; Amna Khalid HIST 306 American Wilderness This course is part of the off-campus spring break program, involving two-linked courses in winter and spring. To many Americans, wild lands are among the nation's most treasured places. Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree--the names alone evoke a sense of awe, naturalness, beauty, even love. But, where do those ideas and feelings come from, and how have they both reflected and shaped American cultural, political and environmental history over the last four centuries? These are the central issues and questions that we will pursue in this seminar. Prerequisite: History 205 or instructor permission. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Winter; George Vrtis HIST 307 Wilderness Field Studies: Grand Canyon This course is the second half of a two-course sequence focused on the study of wilderness in American society and culture. The course will begin with a two-week off-campus study program during spring break at the Grand Canyon, where we will learn about the natural and human history of the Grand Canyon, examine contemporary issues facing the park, meet with officials from the National Park Service and other local experts, conduct research, and experience the park through hiking and camping. The course will culminate in the spring term with the completion and presentation of a major research project. Prerequisite: History 306. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Spring; George Vrtis HIST 308 American Cities and Nature Since the nation's founding, the percentage of Americans living in cities has risen nearly sixteenfold, from about five percent to the current eighty-one percent. This massive change has spawned legions of others, and all of them have bearing on the complex ways that American cities and city-dwellers have shaped and reshaped the natural world. This course will consider the nature of cities in American history, giving particular attention to the dynamic linkages binding these cultural epicenters to ecological communities, environmental forces and resource flows, to eco-politics and social values, and to those seemingly far-away places we call farms and wilderness. Prerequisite: History 205 or permission of the instructor. 6 credits; WR2, IDS, HI; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 309 ?Crime &amp; Punishment: American Legal History, 1607-1865. Legal documents such as depositions, file papers, complaints, accusations, confessions, and laws themselves offer a fascinating window into American history. Such documents lend themselves to the study of American Indian history, capitalism, family relationships, and slavery, to name only a few possible topics. This is an advanced research seminar in which students will write a 25-30 page paper based on original research. Participation in the seminar will also include some common readings that use a variety of approaches to legal history, and extensive peer reviews of research papers. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 310 Black Women Intellectuals This seminar aims to expose students to intellectual history from the distinct standpoint of black women. The core question is how have the unique challenges that slavery, segregation, and racial discrimination posed to black women's minds and bodies shaped their political, social and religious concerns? The course introduces some of the major primary and/or secondary readings in this paradigm-altering subfield in United States history. The major writing assignment is a long bibliographic essay or an intersectional biography on a black woman activist, artist, or scholar. Prerequisite: A history course is helpful, but not required. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 316 History, Nature &amp; Smartphones For the past two decades, historians have increasingly used digital tools to construct and deliver their research. This is particularly the case in public history, which aims to collaborate with public audiences in the co-construction of the past. This seminar will build on this trend, exploring the ways that Minnesota's environmental history can be imagined, understood, and expressed in the digital age. During the course, we will meet with specialists in public and digital history; we will conduct research at the Minnesota Historical Society; and we will develop several web-and smartphone-based stories for the Minnesota Environmental History Project. Prerequisite: Previous History course or instructor permission. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 HIST 320 The Progressive Era? Was the Progressive Era progressive? It was a period of social reform, labor activism, and woman suffrage, but also of Jim Crow, corporate capitalism, and U.S. imperialism. These are among the topics that can be explored in research papers on this contradictory era. We will begin by reading a brief text that surveys the major subject areas and relevant historiography of the period. The course will center on the writing of a 25-30 page based on primary research, which will be read and critiqued by members of the seminar. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Fall; Annette Igra HIST 330 Ideas Incarnate: Institutional Formation, Reform, and Governance in the Middle Ages Institutions emerge from the translation of ideas, ideals, needs, and values into human communities living in particular conditions, equipped with certain resources, guided and controlled by certain norms, and protected and challenged by particular ideas and actions. Once formed, institutions encounter further issues of governance and change as they evolve and encounter new realities, success, and failure. This seminar examines the complex histories and cultures of medieval institutions-churches, monasteries, secular and religious courts, households, and the universities. Through theoretical readings and case studies we will examine how, over time, questions of purpose, leadership, the distribution of power and authority, the acquisition and disposition of material and human resources, record keeping, and legitimacy are encountered and resolved. This course will be of interest to anyone interested in the dynamics of institutions and the dialogue between concepts and material conditions as they play out in time. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 335 Ireland: Land, Conflict, Memory This course explores the history of Ireland from Medieval times through the Great Famine, ending with a look at the Partition of Ireland in 1920. We examine themes of religious and cultural conflict and explore a series of English political and military interventions. Throughout the course, we will analyze views of the Irish landscape, landholding patterns, and health and welfare issues. Finally, we explore the contested nature of history and memory as the class discusses monuments and memory production in Irish public spaces. 6 credits; HI, WR2, QRE, IS; Fall; Susannah R Ottaway HIST 338 Digital History, Public Heritage &amp; Deep Mapping How do new methods of digital humanities and collaborative public history change our understanding of space and place? This hands-on research seminar will seek answers through a deep mapping of the long history of Northfield, Minnesota, before and after its most well-known era of the late nineteenth-century. Deep mapping is as much archaeology as it is cartography, plumbing the depths of a particular place to explore its diversity through time.</p><p>Students will be introduced to major theories of space and place as well as their application through technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 3D modeling, and video game engines. We will mount a major research project working with the National Register of Historic Places, in collaboration with specialists in public history and community partners. 6 credits; HI, QRE, IDS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 341 The Russian Revolution and its Global Legacies The Russian revolution of 1917 was one of the seminal events of the twentieth century. It transformed much beyond Russia itself. This course will take stock of the event and its legacy. What was the Russian revolution? What was its place in the history of revolutions? How did it impact the world? How was it seen by those who made it and those who witnessed it? How have these evaluations changed over time? What sense can we make of it in the year of its centenary? The revolution was both an inspiration (to many revolutionary and national-liberation movements) and used as a tale of caution and admonition (by adversaries of the Soviet Union). The readings will put the Russian revolution in the broadest perspective of the twentieth century and its contested evaluations, from within the Soviet Union and beyond, from its immediate aftermath, through World War II, the Cold War, to the post-Soviet period. The course is aimed at all students interested in the history of the twentieth century and of the idea of the revolution. Prerequisite: One course in Modern European History or instructor consent. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Spring; Adeeb Khalid HIST 346 The Holocaust This course will grapple with the difficult and complicated phenomenon of the genocide of the Jews of Europe. We will explore anti-Semitism in its historical context, both in the German-speaking lands as well as in Europe as a whole. The experience of Jews in Nazi Germany will be an area of focus, but this class will look at European Jews more broadly, both before and during the Second World War. The question of responsibility and guilt will be applied to Germans as well as to other European societies, and an exploration of victims will extend to other affected groups. 6 credits; HI, IS; Winter; David G Tompkins HIST 347 The Global Cold War In the aftermath of the Second World War and through the 1980s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed for world dominance. This Cold War spawned hot wars, as well as a cultural and economic struggle for influence all over the globe. This course will look at the experience of the Cold War from the perspective of its two main adversaries, the U.S. and USSR, but will also devote considerable attention to South America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Students will write a 20 page paper based on original research. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 359 Women in South Asia: Histories, Narratives, and Representations The objective of this course is to analyze the historical institutions, practices and traditions that define the position of women in India.

Prerequisite: At least one prior course in the history of the Middle East or Central Asia or Islam. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 365 Colonialism in East Asia This course explores the phenomenon of settler colonialism in East Asia. We will focus on the dynamics of emigration in the age of mass migration since the early nineteenth century onwards. We will begin by examining colonial encounters in which Chinese and Japanese middlemen either competed against or collaborated with the Europeans as they covered a range of areas of the globe. In the second half of the course, students will undertake projects focusing on a specific region and period of settler colonialism, identify and present source materials, develop a substantial (20-page) research paper, and engage in peer review. Prerequisite: One prior six credit History course. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 383 Africa's Colonial Legacies This course deepens understanding of the causes, manifestations, and implications of warfare in modern Africa by highlighting African perspectives on colonialism's legacies. Drawing from cases in South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Algeria, and Sudan, the course questions whether Britain's policy of indirect rule, France's direct rule, and South Africa's apartheid rule were variants of despotism and how colonial rule shaped possibilities of resistance, reform, and repression. Students also will learn how different historical actors participated in and experienced war as well as produce an original research paper that thoughtfully uses primary and secondary resources. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 386 Africa: Art, Nation, and Politics This course explores "Africa" as a historical construction, place, culture, artistic practice, commodity, and identity shaped by imperial ambitions, global trade, religious impulses, aesthetic forms, memory, and struggles for sovereignty. It illustrates how art, nationalism, and politics have been at the center of ideas about Africa and its relationship to colonialism and modernity from the nineteenth century to current times. In addition to select case studies, students will work with diverse sources such as missionary accounts, speeches, press releases, visual art, songs, and musical performances. Students will produce an original research paper of fifteen to twenty pages using primary and secondary resources. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>HIST 398 Advanced Historical Writing This course is designed to support majors in developing advanced skills in historical research and writing. Through a combination of class discussion, small group work, and one-on-one interactions with the professor, majors learn the process of constructing sophisticated, welldocumented, and well-written historical arguments within the context of an extended project of their own design. They also learn and practice strategies for engaging critically with contemporary scholarship and effective techniques of peer review and the oral presentation of research.

Topics may include functions (linear, exponential, logarithmic), geometry, trigonometry, and analysis and graphical representation of data sets. Students will work in teams on several activities, including exploring Carleton-specific data sets that can be used tell a story about the College and collaborating on problems that explore how particular quantitative skills are used in the sciences and social sciences. In addition, students review and practice their quantitative skills through self-paced work. 5 credits; S/CR/NC; NE; Summer; Melissa Eblen-Zayas IDSC 099 Summer Humanities Institute The Summer Humanities Institute brings together seminar, lecture, and individual and group research experiences in History and English Literature along with six art historical lectures to offer students an in depth and multi-disciplinary understanding of the legacies of the Roman Empire in Early Modern Europe. In the History component, students explore the world and thought of Niccolo Machiavelli, as he uses the Roman past to understand the Italian present. In the English component, students will examine in depth William Shakespeare's use of Roman history as inspiration and context for drama but also as an ongoing tradition of performance. Lectures and discussion requiring significant preparation are complemented by daily supervised research throughout the course culminating in a public presentation of their original research. For high school juniors and seniors. 6 credits; S/CR/NC; Summer; William L North IDSC 099 Summer Quantitative Reasoning Institute The Summer Quantitative Reasoning Institute (SQRI) is a three-week intensive training in quantitative methods in the social sciences.

Does it seem overly heated and lacking in basic civility? What would "civil" discourse actually look like? Is it a skill one can practice and master? This Argument and Inquiry seminar attempts to address these questions both theoretically and practically by allowing students the opportunity to read, view, and discuss material relevant to many of our nation's most pressing problems and flash points, while also providing a theoretical framework for the practice of civil discourse around potentially divisive topics. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Chico Zimmerman IDSC 100 Games and Gaming Cultures In this seminar, we will use games (both by studying them and by playing them) as a lens through which we can explore all manner of fascinating questions. How do the games we play shape our culture and our communities? What makes a game fun, engaging, addictive, boring, brutal, or banal? How can games encourage certain kinds of behavior, even after we've stopped playing them? Could we make Carleton itself a bit better--or at least more fun--if we gamified certain aspects of life here? To aid our exploration, we'll draw on readings from multiple genres and employ a variety of research methods to analyze games from social, textual, and design perspectives. This course will also include weekly lab sessions on Wednesday evenings (6:15-8:30PM). Students will be required to attend at least eight out of ten lab sessions. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; George Cusack IDSC 103 Student Conversations about Diversity and Community In this course students participate in peer-led conversations about diversity and community at Carleton. Students complete readings and engage in experiential exercises that invite them to reflect on their own social identities and their attitudes toward race, gender, class, and sexuality. By taking risks and engaging in honest conversations and self-reflection, students work together to understand differences and to explore how to build communities that are welcoming and open to diversity. Students keep a weekly journal and write two reflective essays that are graded by faculty members. Required application form: https://apps.carleton.edu/dialogue/. 2 credits; S/CR/NC; NE, IDS; Winter; Thabiti Willis IDSC 110 Thinking with Numbers: Using Math and Data in Context This course will enhance students' quantitative skills and provide opportunities to apply those skills to authentic problems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistics Courses</head><p>LING 100 The Noun We've all been taught that nouns are people, places, and things. Yet, these seemingly simple linguistic objects are surprisingly complex. For instance, languages vary in what information (e.g., case, gender, person, number) nouns display. Even within a single language, the form of a noun may change depending on its function within a sentence or its function within a conversation. This course uses contemporary linguistic theories to account for the many varied forms of nouns throughout the world's languages. No familiarity with languages other than English is required. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Cherlon L Ussery LING 110 Introduction to Linguistics The capacity to acquire and use natural languages such as English is surely one of the more remarkable features of human nature. In this course, we explore several aspects of this ability. Topics include the sound systems of natural languages, the structure of words, principles that regulate word order, the course of language acquisition in children, and what these reveal about the nature of the mind. 6 credits; FSR; Winter, Spring; Jenna T Conklin LING 115 Introduction to the Theory of Syntax This course is organized to enable the student to actively participate in the construction of a rather elaborate theory of the nature of human cognitive capacity to acquire and use natural languages. In particular, we concentrate on one aspect of that capacity: the unconscious acquisition of a grammar that enables a speaker of a language to produce and recognize sentences that have not been previously encountered. In the first part of the course, we concentrate on gathering notation and terminology intended to allow an explicit and manageable description. In the second part, we depend on written and oral student contributions in a cooperative enterprise of theory construction. 6 credits; FSR; Fall, Winter, Spring; Cherlon L Ussery, Mike Flynn LING 117 Sociophonetics This course is a theoretical and practical introduction to studying phonetics (the science of speech) and its relation to sociolinguistic variation (how speech systematically varies across speakers). Throughout the course, students will collect their own conversational speech data and learn to conduct acoustic analysis. Skills developed in the course include recording speech, transcribing, data processing and normalization, and effective presentation of results. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 LING 130 Sociolinguistics of Semitic Languages This course is an introduction to the sociolinguistics of Semitic languages, particularly how language and society interact with respect to identity, ethnicity, politics and religion. Topics will include the wide breadth of Arabic language varieties and dialects with focus on Arabic diglossia (use of both Standard and colloquial Arabic dependent on social context) and code-switching (alternating between Arabic varieties and/or other languages in conversation). Language ideologies, including the Arabic language and its relation to Arab nationalism, as well as the revitalization of Modern Hebrew and its role in the Zionist movement will also be explored. Finally, the official status of both majority and minority Semitic languages will be investigated through the lens of language policy, politics and power. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 LING 216 Generative Approaches to Syntax This course has two primary goals: to provide participants with a forum to continue to develop their analytical skills (i.e. to 'do syntax'), and to acquaint them with generative syntactic theory, especially the Principles and Parameters approach. Participants will sharpen their technological acumen, through weekly problem solving, and engage in independent thinking and analysis, by means of formally proposing novel syntactic analyses for linguistic phenomena. By the conclusion of the course, participants will be prepared to read and critically evaluate primary literature couched within this theoretical framework. Prerequisite: Linguistics 115. 6 credits; FSR; Winter; Cherlon L Ussery LING 217 Phonetics and Phonology Although no two utterances are ever exactly the same, we humans don't function like tape recorders; we overlook distinctions to which mechanical recording devices are sensitive, and we "hear" contrasts which are objectively not there. What we (think we) hear is determined by the sound system of the language we speak. This course examines the sound systems of human languages, focusing on how speech sounds are produced and perceived, and how these units come to be organized into a systematic network in the minds of speakers of languages. Prerequisite: 100-level Linguistics course. 6 credits; FSR; Fall; Jenna T Conklin LING 222 The Forms of Words in the World's Languages Languages vary in what kind of information is morphologically expressed. The form words take is, in part, governed by complex systems called "case" and "agreement." In general, case refers to forms of nouns, and agreement refers to forms of verbs. We go beyond familiar case patterns in which subjects are Nominative and objects are Accusative and familiar agreement patterns in which verbs display the person, gender, and/or number of subjects. We investigate the morphological patterns in at least a dozen (probably more!) languages with the goals of arriving at both cross-linguistic generalizations and language-particular nuances. No familiarity with languages other than English is required. Prerequisite: 100-level linguistics course. 6 credits; FSR; Spring; Cherlon L Ussery LING 231 Structure of Semitic Languages This course will examine the linguistic structure (sound, form, and meaning) of a wide variety of Semitic languages. In class we will examine Semitics from a typological perspective and practice linguistic analyses on datasets taken from well-studied Semitic languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew). Throughout the term students will also "adopt" a lesser-studied Semitic language and investigate its structure. This project will culminate in an in-class presentation and final paper. Prerequisite: Linguistics 110 or introductory knowledge of Arabic and/or Hebrew language (Arabic 101, Hebrew 101 or equivalent). 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 LING 240 Semantics and Pragmatics A central part of the grammar of a language is the meaning associated with words and phrases. This course explores the multi-faceted system that speakers access both when producing sentences and when interpreting them. Topics include the complexity surrounding actually defining words, the meanings of various modal verbs, and theories of pragmatics and the rules of conversation, among other topics. Prerequisite: Any 100 level Linguistics course. 6 credits; SI; Not offered 2019-20 LING 275 First Language Acquisition Humans are unique among animals in that we are able to attain native speaker competency in any language(s) we receive a sufficient amount of exposure to during our development. The path of acquisition is remarkably stable regardless of the language(s) being acquired, and is believed to yield insights into the nature of human language. In this course, we explore children's capacity to acquire language, with a focus on its implications for linguistic theory. Topics include acquisition of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics, and acquisition in extraordinary circumstances. Prerequisite: 100-level linguistics course. 6 credits; LS; Winter; Catherine R Fortin LING 280 Field Methods in Linguistics This course will introduce students to techniques of linguistic research and analysis through direct work with a native speaker of a language not taught at Carleton. Students will learn techniques for eliciting, organizing, describing, and analyzing data in an ethically responsible and scientifically rigorous manner. Our goal is to develop a description of the language-primarily, aspects of its phonology, morphology, and syntax--through working exclusively with a native speaker. Each student will investigate some aspect of the language in depth, culminating in a class presentation and research report. Prerequisite: 100-level Linguistics course. 6 credits; LS; Spring; Catherine R Fortin LING 285 Japanese Linguistics in Kyoto Seminar: The Linguistics of the Japanese Writing System The Japanese writing system is often said to be the most complicated in the world, even as Japan has among the very highest literacy rates. In this course, we will closely examine this extraordinary aspect of Japanese society, including its history, relationship with the spoken language, psychological processing, and neural implementation. Finally, we will examine the controversy concerning the use of Kanji, its political ramifications, and look at how the Japanese are responding to various pressures on the system. Experience with Japanese is not necessary. Prerequisite: 100-level Linguistics course. 6 credits; SI, IS; Spring; Mike Flynn LING 286 Japanese Linguistics in Kyoto Seminar: The Structure of Japanese This course examines the nature of the Japanese language through the lens of contemporary linguistic theory. Topics include the history of the language, its sound structure, word formation operations, syntax, and its use in social and artistic contexts. This course is not intended to teach students to speak Japanese, and while experience with Japanese would be helpful, it is not necessary. Prerequisite: 100-level Linguistics course. 6 credits; FSR, IS; Spring; Mike Flynn LING 288 The Structure of Dakota This course examines the nature of the endangered language Dakota, which was once spoken on what is today Carleton land. We will study several aspects of the language, including phonology, morphology, and syntax, with the assistance of speakers of the language from the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation. The goal of the course is to produce an array of careful, accurate, and clear descriptions of parts of the language, working towards a new pedagogical grammar of the language to be used in the construction of teaching materials for Dakota children LING 325 Syntax of an Unfamiliar Language In this course we examine, with the help of a native speaker consultant, the syntax of a language deliberately chosen for its being unfamiliar to all the participants. Our goals will be to construct a coherent and theoretically respectable account of principles of the grammar of this language, and to understand what our account reveals about the structure of human language generally. Each student will investigate some aspect of the syntax of the language in depth, culminating in a class presentation and research report. </p></div>

In this seminar we will read literary works by Arab authors written over approximately 1000 years--from the Crusades, the height of European imperialism, and on into the age of Iraq, Obama and ISIS. Through our readings and discussions, we will ask along with In this course, we will investigate the ways these two currents-war and the literary-converge in several Arab societies. As members of societies at war, but also as literary artists, how do authors represent these conflicting narratives? What sorts of war stories do they tell, how do they tell them, and what sort of literary practice is produced? We will study the birth of the Lebanese Civil War novel as a bona fide genre in the 1970s and 80s, how literature informed anticolonial struggles in Palestine and Algeria from the 1950s to the present, and read some works of genrebending horror and science fiction that have appeared in the wake of Iraq's recent destruction. Taught in English, no knowledge of Arabic is required. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ARBC 151 Spoken Egyptian Arabic Egyptian Arabic is the spoken dialect used in daily life in Egypt, the vernacular of Arab cinema and media, and the lyrical backbone of most modern Arab music. It is, thus, central to the cultural life of Egypt and the wider Arab world. Given this wide diffusion of Egyptian Arabic, learning to communicate in Egyptian Arabic opens doors across the Arabophone world. In this course, students with no prior Arabic language experience will build oral proficiency using instruction in the forms and vocabulary of spoken Egyptian, but also through a use of a variety of media, including films, songs, and other contemporary materials. Please note: This class is intended for students with a general interest in Arabic, who did not study Arabic before. It is not open to students who have had prior classroom experience with the Arabic language.

Authors writing in this genre collected and classified the knowledge of their time, drawing on material from a large variety of disciplines: literature (poetic, proverbial, historical-anecdotal), Religion (Quran, prophetic tradition, jurisprudence, theology), linguistics, as well as philosophy and the sciences. This encyclopedic genre represented the ideal of a broad-based erudition, and the perception that education should be entertaining as it is edifying. In this class we will read excerpts from the works of some of the major premodern anthology writers: Ibn Abd Rabbihi, Abu l-Faraj al-Isfahani, al-Ibshihi and al-Nuwayri.

A translation movement from Greek, Persian and Sanskrit into Arabic initiated in the eighth century, led to centuries of innovative scientific investigation, during which Arab scientists reshaped science in a variety of disciplines: from mathematics to astronomy, physics, optics and medicine. Many of their works entered Latin and the European curriculum during the Renaissance. In this reading course we will explore some of the achievements and thought processes in premodern Arabic scientific literature by reading selections from several seminal works. We will examine these in the cultural contexts in which they emerged and to which they contributed, and reflect on modern Western perceptions of this intellectual project. Readings and class discussions will be in both Arabic and English.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music Courses</head><p>MUSC 100 The Music That Isn't There This course interrogates the ways we listen to music. It turns specifically to ideas, structures, and histories that aren't explicitly articulated by the notes on the page or the sounds in the air, but that seem to want to travel with the music nonetheless. We'll animate the concept of dialogic form through analysis based on active listening, colliding, for example, Mozart with Joni Mitchell. We'll think about punk rock, engage theories of sampling, and place avantgarde, experimental work in context. By talking and especially writing through these ideas, you'll critique, support, and even transform your listening practice. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Andrea Mazzariello MUSC 101 Music Fundamentals A course designed for students with little or no music background as preparation and support for other music courses, ensemble participation and applied music study. The course covers the fundamentals of note and rhythmic reading, basic harmony, and develops proficiency in aural skills and elementary keyboard skills. This class will make regular use of the music computer lab for assignments. 3 credits; ARP; Spring; Matthew J Olson MUSC 103 Musicianship I An introduction to the basic elements of rhythm and melody, with a strong emphasis on sight reading using solfège, score reading in multiple clefs, and short dictation exercises. Prerequisite: The ability to read music as assessed by a diagnostic exam administered at the start of the term. MUSC 108 Introduction to Music Technology A course in using the computer to make meaningful interventions into our practices as musicians. We'll explore a number of approaches to composing, producing, and hearing music, among them coding, visual programming, and working in a digital audio workstation. Students will ultimately combine and hybridize these different methods in order to create unique, individual systems, using them to make new work. Open to all interested students; no prior experience with music, programming, or production required. 6 credits; ARP; Winter; Andrea Mazzariello MUSC 110 Theory I: The Materials of Music An introduction to the materials of western tonal music, with an emphasis on harmonic structure and syntax. It also covers phrase structure, musical texture, and small musical forms, along with basic theoretical concepts and vocabulary. Student work involves readings, listening assignments, analytical exercises, and short composition projects. Prerequisite: The ability to read music, as assessed by a diagnositc exam administered at the start of the term. 6 credits; LA; Fall; Andrea Mazzariello MUSC 111 Smashing the Idols: A History of "Western Art Music" This course introduces students to the different ideologies at play in the curation of a canon of "Western art music" from antiquity to the present. Students will consider examples from the museum of musical works and beyond. The class interrogates music from a variety of angles including philosophical, socio-cultural, and materialhistorical. Creative projects and interpretive listening assignments are the primary mode of evaluation. An ability to read music not required. 6 credits; LA, WR2, LA, WR2; Fall, Spring; Megan E Sarno, Brooke H McCorkle MUSC 115 Listening to the Movies This course explores the history and development of film music along with theories of how music contributes to the meaning of moving images and narrative scenes. The primary focus of the course will be on film music in the U.S., but notable film scores from Europe and Asia will also be discussed. The film music history covers historical periods from the pre-cinematic Vaudeville era through the postmodern films of the early twenty-first century. Cross-cutting this chronological history will be discussion of film musicals as a separate genre. Ability to read music not required. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Fall; Ronald Rodman MUSC 120 A History of Opera: Stage, Screen, Recording Pure pleasure or pure torture: Opera is said to be both. Music 120 is an introduction to opera based on its 400-year history from 1600 to the present. Issues covered include the relationship between words, action, and music in opera; singers and their power; opera as spectacle; race, gender and opera; opera in film; and the experience of live performance. This course will focus on specific repertoire from the classical tradition and will introduce students to a broad range of analytical methods, and cultural contexts. The course is open to all students and the ability to read music is not required. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 MUSC 121 Songs of Love, State and Self Humble in means but mighty in meaning, the song has given voice to every human emotion. Devout believers use song for worship, prima donnas sing for love or tragedy, and popular songsters tell stories through song. Anthems convey national identity while showtunes offer an escape from reality. In this course students will encounter many types of song and learn . Music and musicians discussed will include the classic blues singers of the 1920s, early country music (Jimmie Rodgers), and the legacy of Robert Johnson. Issues of authenticity and "ownership" of both the music and its cultural legacy will also be discussed. The course involves readings, listening assignments, and some transcriptions of early recorded blues. No prerequisite, although the ability to read music is helpful. 6 credits; LA, IDS; Spring; Justin M London MUSC 136 History of Rock This course is an introduction to the history of rock music, emphasizing primarily the period between 1954 and the present. Mixing historical and cultural readings with intense listening, we will cover the vast repertoire of rock music and many other associated styles. We will focus on the sounds of the music, learning to distinguish a wide variety of genres, while also tracing the development and transformation of rock and pop styles. The lectures will use a wide variety of multimedia, including commercial audio and video, unpublished audio and video sources, print materials, and technological devices. Knowledge of a technical musical vocabulary and an ability to read music are not required for this course. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IDS; Fall; Andy Flory MUSC 140 Ethnomusicology and the World's Music This course introduces both the world's musical diversity and the discipline of ethnomusicology. Drawing on musics of Native America, Indonesia, India, and the Caribbean, among others, we will study the written and recorded/filmed work of ethnomusicologists from roughly 1950-present, focusing on theories and methods. Though geographically wide-ranging, these efforts are connected by themes of tradition, globalization, religion, politics, gender, youth, and decolonization. Students will engage multiple forms of ethnomusicological scholarship, develop critical listening skills, and learn to convey their growing understanding of musical elements in writing and oral presentation. No musical experience necessary. 6 credits; LA, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20</p><p>MUSC 142 Musical Theater Practicum The Last Five Years, Jason Robert Brown's musical about a writer/aspiring Broadway performer couple, dramatizes the exhilaration and frustration of going to audition after audition on the way to a big break. This theme is exploited countless times in American musicals, precisely because singers and actors face countless auditions. In this course, students will gain historical and theoretical knowledge of the musical theater genre, a deeper knowledge of the craft, and be better prepared to face auditions of any kind. Final projects may be small-scale performances of solos, duets, or a full-class ensemble number. 6 credits; ARP; Not offered 2019-20 MUSC 144 Music/Migration This course introduces students to a variety of musics as they intersect with, arise from, or speak to migration. We will consider migration of peoples, of musical forms or genres, of instruments and other music technologies, and of musicians themselves. Our study might include such genres as ska and tango, instruments such as the piano, guitar, or accordion, and musics of the MUSC 213 Music and Religion Music and religion are united through philosophical precepts, but also through practical means. In this course we will encounter philosophical ideas about music as well as examine sacred musical practices of various religions, including Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu.</p><p>Students will analyze what function music holds in liturgies of many traditions. The final project will involve visiting local services to observe first-hand how religions use music. No previous music experience required. 6 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 MUSC 215 Music Theater in America This course outlines the history of the musical from Tin Pan Alley, through the golden age of Broadway with Rodgers and Hammerstein, to the current sensation "Hamilton," passing through the works of Stephen Sondheim. We will study the development of this hybrid genre by considering musical elements such as form, instrumentation, and harmony as well as dramatic, choreographic, and staging components. Additionally, social questions such as the representation of women and minority cultures, as they concern the works themselves and their audiences, will guide our readings and class discussion. Ability to read music not required. In this composition course, we'll create music for ourselves to perform. The members of the class constitute the Ad Hoc Ensemble; we'll begin by writing small studies for individual instruments or voices in this group, and methodically build to composing for the entire ensemble. We'll focus on idiomatic instrumental writing and orchestration, and will explore both traditional and experimental approaches to notation. Prerequisite: Music 110 or instructor permission. 3 credits; ARP; Not offered 2019-20 MUSC 223 Vocal Counterpoint In this composition course, we'll write for (our own) singing voices, anchoring our writing to various traditions of vocal part writing while developing our own idiosyncratic approaches. We'll move methodically from singing single lines against drones, to creating two-, three-, and four-part compositions, culminating in a substantial composition for multiple voices per part. We'll sing constantly to reinforce key concepts and to hear our works in progress, and will base our analysis of our own compositions as well as more canonical works on bringing the music to life through vocal performance. Prerequisite: Ability and willingness to sing from score, and Music 110 or instructor permission. 3 credits; ARP; Spring; Andrea Mazzariello MUSC 227 Perception and Cognition of Music Covers basic issues in auditory perception and cognition with an emphasis on the perception of musical pitch, including sensory discrimination, categorical perception, roughness and dissonance, absolute pitch, and auditory streaming. Other topics to be covered include the processing of language and music, and emotional responses to music. In the twentieth century, the U.S. and Western Europe saw a sharp rise in totalitarian governments that weaponized all parts of culture as part of their quest for ultimate control. These governments used music as propaganda and hired art composers whose skill could demonstrate the preeminence of their homeland, and who were required to pledge ideological loyalty.</p><p>In this class, students will conduct research on twentieth-century art music that was used to promote or subvert state authority. They will seek to understand aesthetics, identity, contracts, social networks, musical form and style, and reception. Prerequisite: Ability to read music or instructor permission. MUSC 340 Advanced Composition Seminar An advanced seminar in music composition for students with previous course work or compositional experience. Class will meet weekly as a group as well as individually with the instructor to work on compositional projects. Students will compose works in a range of styles and using a variety of media. Prerequisite: Music 208, 220 or instructor permission. 6 credits; ARP; Not offered 2019-20 MUSC 341 Rock Lab and Lab This class combines performance and academic study of rock music. In the first half of the course, we will learn to perform simple songs in small-group coaching sessions with a polished public performance as a midterm goal. During the second half of the course, we will make recordings of these performances. Throughout the term, we will accompany performance and recording activities with readings and discussion about aesthetics, performance practice in rock music, and mediation of recording techniques, all extraordinarily rich topics in popular music studies. No performance experience is needed. The course will accommodate students with a range of experience. Students will be grouped according to background, interest, and ability. There is a required hands-on laboratory component, which will be assigned before the start of the course. In these smaller groups, students will perform, record, and work with sound in small groups. Work will include experimentation with electric instruments, amplifiers, synthesizers, microphones, recording techniques, performance practice issues, musical production, mixing, and mastering. 6 credits; ARP, IDS; Spring; Andy Flory MUSC 342 Creative Music Performance Seminar Over the course of the term, each student will prepare the performance of a solo work, informed by the exploration of sources, comparison of recordings, score analysis, and performance science. Group meetings explore the pedagogy of musical, psychological, and intellectual preparation, and will guide improvement in technical and musical consistency during performance. Open to performers of all genres of applied music taught in the Carleton music department. Prerequisite: One term of 2 credit juried lessons on any instrument/voice or permission of instructor. </p></div>

Topics include neural transmission, development of the nervous system, anatomy, sensory systems, learning and the corresponding change in the brain, and the role of the nervous system in behavior. Team-based learning will be used to understand the experiments that shape current knowledge. 6 credits; LS, QRE; Fall; Sarah H Meerts, Eric D Hoopfer NEUR 238 Evolution of the Nervous System: Cells to Systems One way to understand the organization and function of the human brain is to examine the origin and evolution of its components. With this evolutionary lens, the cell biology of the neuron, neuronal signaling, and the organization of neural systems becomes clear. This course will cover the principles of cell and molecular neurobiology by investigating its evolutionary roots, and then use this framework to travel in time to understand how circuits and systems evolved to generate more complex behaviors. Students will develop a foundational competency in cell and molecular neuroscience and systems neuroscience by using tools that reveal evolutionary homology among organisms, such as bioinformatics and comparative neuroanatomy. Prerequisite: Neuroscience 127 or Psychology 216 and Biology 125, requires concurrent registration in Neuroscience 239. 6 credits; NE, QRE; Spring; Eric D Hoopfer NEUR 239 Evolution of the Nervous System Lab The focus of the laboratory will be on current techniques used to study the nervous system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy Courses</head><p>PHIL 100 Family Values: The Ethics of Being a Family Everyone has a family of one kind or another. Whether you love them, hate them, or both at the same time, your family has played a huge role in making you the person you are. That fact raises all kinds of interesting philosophical questions such as: what limits should there be on how parents shape their kids' lives and values? Are there demands of justice that are in tension with the way families are "normally" constituted? What duties do parents have to their children and vice versa? And what makes a person someone else's parent or child in the first place--genetics, commitment, convention? This course will explore all these questions and more. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Daniel M Groll PHIL 100 Science, Faith and Rationality This seminar will introduce the student to the study of philosophy through a consideration of various epistemic and metaphysical issues surrounding science and religion. What distinguishes scientific inquiry from other areas of inquiry: Its subject matter, its method of inquiry, or perhaps both? How does scientific belief differ from religious belief, in particular? Is the scientist committed to substantive metaphysical assumptions? If so, what role do these assumptions play in scientific investigation and how do they differ from religious dogma (if they do)? Our exploration of these questions will involve the consideration of both classic and contemporary philosophical texts. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Jason A Decker PHIL 112 Mind, Matter, Consciousness According to a common view of the mind, mental states are nothing more than states of the brain. There are certain features of human intellection, subjective experience, and action which have prompted some philosophers to argue that human mental activity is not reducible to brain activity. Some have gone on to argue that the human mind is immaterial and capable of surviving the death of the body. We will examine variants of these views as well as objections to them, reading selections from such historical figures as Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes, and such contemporary philosophers as Churchland, Nagel, and Searle. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 113 The Individual and the Political Community Are human beings radically individual and atomic by nature, political animals, or something else? However we answer that question, what difference does it make for our understanding of the ways in which larger political communities come into existence and are maintained? In this course we will explore these and related questions while reading two of the most foundational works in political theory, Plato's Republic and Hobbes's Leviathan, as well as several contemporary pieces influenced by these thinkers. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Fall, Spring; Allison E Murphy PHIL 115 Skepticism, God, and Ethical Dilemmas If I can't rule out that I'm dreaming, does it follow that I don't know that I'm in Minnesota right now? Are there sound arguments establishing either the existence or non-existence of God? If I can divert a train from one track to another so that only one person loses her life instead of five, am I morally required to do so? In this course we will address questions concerning skepticism, God, and moral dilemmas, and explore some of their interrelations. We will pay close attention to issues of philosophical methodology along the way. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Winter, Spring; Douglas B Marshall PHIL 116 Sensation, Induction, Abduction, Deduction, Seduction In every academic discipline, we make theories and argue for and against them. This is as true of theology as of geology (and as true of phys ed as of physics). What are the resources we have available to us in making these arguments? It's tempting to split the terrain into (i) raw data, and (ii) rules of right reasoning for processing the data. The most obvious source of raw data is sense experience, and the most obvious candidates for modes of right reasoning are deduction, induction, and abduction. Some philosophers, however, think that sense perception is only one of several sources of raw data (perhaps we also have a faculty of pure intuition or maybe a moral sense), and others have doubted that we have any source of raw data at all. As for the modes of "right" reasoning, Hume famously worried about our (in)ability to justify induction, and others have had similar worries about abduction and even deduction. Can more be said on behalf of our most strongly held beliefs and belief-forming practices than simply that we find them seductive---that we are attracted to them; that they resonate with us? In this course, we'll use some classic historical and contemporary philosophical texts to help us explore these and related issues. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 117 Philosophical Problems: Mind, Free Will and Morality What is knowledge, and can we know anything at all? What is the mind, and how is it related to the body? What is consciousness? Is there free will? Are there universal moral truths, or is morality subjective? In this introduction to perennial philosophical questions (as well as the goals and methods of philosophy) we will read contemporary and historical philosophical texts. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 118 God, Mind, and the Human Condition In this course we explore the interrelations between questions concerning God's existence, the nature of the mind, and the human condition. We begin by evaluating arguments for and against God's existence. This will give us a basis upon which to consider Descartes' arguments in the Meditations. We then turn to contemporary objections to Descartes' claim that the mind is an immaterial thing. If the mind is a material thing, what does that tell us about the human condition? Do humans have free wills and moral responsibilities? Are our lives meaningful? Is death a bad thing and if so, for whom? 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 120 Philosophy of Sex Sex is a pervasive feature of our individual lives and of contemporary political debate, yet has until recently has rarely been subject to sustained philosophical scrutiny. In this course we will investigate the ethical, political, and conceptual issues surrounding sex, critically reflecting on our own assumptions about sexed bodies, sexual pleasure, sexual conduct, and sexual and gender identities. What is sex? How do others identify us and how do we come to identify ourselves as sexual beings along the intersecting axes of gender, race, class, orientation, and ability? Can sex and pleasure become sites for personal liberation or ethical existence with others? We will take an intersectional approach to a variety of issues, including consent, casual sex, sexual objectification and commodification, sexual violence, normative medical and legal discourse about sex, gender, and reproduction, and the struggle for political recognition by sexual and gender minorities. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 121 The Philosopher and the Sophist In 399 BC Socrates was executed for introducing new gods and corrupting the youth. He claimed these were not the real charges against him--instead the trouble was that the Athenians mistook him for a sophist. 'Sophist' remains a choice term of derision for the pseudo-intellectuals, salesmen, political pundits, and propagandists who populate public life to this day. Traditionally a sophist is marked off not only by their bad ethical character, but also by the content of their ideas--most notably relativism, social constructionism, and realpolitik. The good standing of philosophers seems to depend on their success in distinguishing themselves from both the ideas and the actions of their evil twin, the sophist. In this course we will ask why this effort has seemed so important, and whether it is really possible to define philosophy in a way that excludes sophistry once and for all. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 122 Identity and Leadership Leaders who face tragedy and violence inspire others with their personal narratives of self-creation and meaning-making. This course invites students to investigate the relationship between the subjective meaning-making experience and various manifestations of the 'problem of evil'. We will read a variety of texts that highlight narrative experiences of tragedy, selftransformation, and models of leadership as empowerment. The course approaches these topics from a variety of philosophical PHIL 210 Logic The study of formal logic has obvious and direct applicability to a wide variety of disciplines (including mathematics, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, and many others). Indeed, the study of formal logic helps us to develop the tools and know-how to think more clearly about arguments and logical relationships in general; and arguments and logical relationships form the backbone of any rational inquiry. In this course we will focus on propositional logic and predicate logic, and look at the relationship that these have to ordinary language and thought. 6 credits; FSR; Fall, Winter; Jason A Decker, Douglas B Marshall PHIL 211 Being, Time and Identity The aim of metaphysics has traditionally been to identify the nature and structure of reality. The topics of this course are the topology of time, identity of things and individuals, causality, free will, and the referents of general terms. We will read a variety of classic and contemporary texts, which are organized topically. Prerequisite: 100-level Philosophy course or instructor permission. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 212 Epistemology Do you know that you're not just a brain, floating in a vat, receiving stimulations through electrodes? Or perhaps an immaterial soul being conned by a malicious demon? In this course, we will use these skeptical worries as a launching point for thinking about epistemological issues: What exactly is knowledge? Do we ever have it? If so, when, and how? We will approach these questions through an examination of theories of epistemic justification, including foundationalism, coherentism, internalism, externalism, and virtue epistemology. We will then consider some critiques of traditional epistemology, including feminist epistemology and naturalized epistemology. Prerequisite: 100-level Philosophy course or instructor permission. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 213 Ethics How should we live? This is the fundamental question for the study of ethics. This course looks at classic and contemporary answers to the fundamental question from Socrates to Kant to modern day thinkers. Along the way, we consider slightly (but only slightly) more tractable questions such as: What reason is there to be moral? Is there such a thing as moral knowledge (and if so, how do we get it)? What are the fundamental principles of right and wrong (if there are any at all)? Is morality objective? 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Winter; Daniel M Groll PHIL 214 Ecology, Ethics, and Economics In this course we will explore the hypothesis that the current ecological crisis is, at least in part, the product of an economic system that champions continual growth (hence ever increasing levels of production and consumption) and that the economic system is in turn supported by a specific set of materialist values. The course thus takes a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to its subject, and will include readings from across the disciplines of environmental science, economics, and ethics. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 215 Alienation, Authenticity, and Irony: Selfhood in the Modern World Who am I? What kind of world do I live in? What kind of life is possible or desirable for me? While these questions have been part of philosophy since its inception, there may be particular epistemic and ethical dilemmas of knowing ourselves as modern and post-modern subjects. Both theoretical and practical challenges to self-knowledge have emerged in the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Psychoanalysis, sociology, and evolutionary science have made us question whether there is an essential self to be known and, if so, whether we could have access to it. Historical events, including the world wars and the increased industrialization, bureaucratization, and secularization of western societies have made reckoning with finitude and alienation central to any project of self-knowledge. In this course we will consider the challenges to self-knowledge posed by life in the modern world, and 'authenticity' and 'irony' as two prominent responses to this fundamental self-estrangement. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 216 Nietzsche and Foucault: History, Truth, and Power Friedrich Nietzsche is famous for his scathing criticisms of both conventional morality and academic philosophy. He developed a mode of historical research, genealogy, which takes a perspective "beyond good and evil" in order to expose our moral ideals (including altruism, personal responsibility, and equality) as the products of contingent historical formations and struggles for power. Michel Foucault, writing in the second half of the twentieth century, submitted the values of 'normal' and 'pathological' (in diverse areas of the human sciences including mental illness, criminology, and sexuality) to a genealogical method modeled on that of Nietzsche. This course will be devoted to a comparative reading of Nietzsche and Foucault's genealogical works and the relation of these to their larger philosophical systems. Our guiding questions will be: What is the nature of power? What is the nature and value of truth? What bearing do the histories of our normative and scientific claims have on their truth-value? What is the status, in all of this, of the critical perspective of the genealogist? Where do the insights of Nietzsche and Foucault leave us in our own attempts to lead meaningful lives? 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 217 Reason in Context: Limitations and Possibilities Our reflection on significant human questions is often (perhaps always) embedded within a larger set of cultural or personal theoretical commitments. Such embeddedness suggests our reflection cannot achieve the standard of objectivity characteristic of a traditional ideal of rationality. Is this realization to be welcomed insofar as it weakens traditional dogmatic claims to truth and the associated implication that certain views or frameworks are superior to others? Or, in spite of the unmooring of the philosophical tradition from set criteria, do we still find ourselves committed to some ordering of rank and, if so, how do we make sense of this? In this course we'll examine these questions as they arise in the writings of Nietzsche, Heidegger and other continental philosophers. We will devote part of the course to the ancient sources (Plato and Aristotle) with whom the continental philosophers are in conversation. 6 credits; HI; Spring; Allison E Murphy PHIL 221 Philosophy of Law This course provides students with an opportunity to engage actively in a discussion of theoretical questions about law. We will consider the nature of law as it is presented by natural law theory, legal positivism and legal realism. Then we will deal with responsibility and punishment, and challenges to the idea of the primacy of individual rights from legal paternalism and moralism. We will next inquire into the explanations of why individuals should obey the law, and conditions under which civil disobedience is justified. Finally, we will discuss issues raised by feminist legal theory and some theories of minority rights. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 222 Topics in Medical Ethics Over the past forty years, the idea that competent patients have the right to make decisions about their own care has become paramount in medical ethics and medical practice. But the primacy of patient autonomy as a value raises a host of interesting questions: What can (or should) clinicians do when patients make poor decisions? What does it mean for a patient to be competent? Who should make decisions in those cases where the patient is deemed incompetent or too young to make decisions for herself? This course examines these questions and, depending on interest, larger policy questions (like debates about organ markets) that revolve around the relationship between autonomy and paternalism. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Spring; Daniel M Groll PHIL 223 Philosophy of Language In this course we will look at how philosophers have tried to understand language and its connection with human thought and communication. The course will be split into two parts: Semantics and Pragmatics. In the first part, we'll look at general features of linguistic expressions like meaning and reference. In the second part, we'll look at the various ways in which speakers use language. Topics to be considered in the second part include speech acts, implicature, and presupposition. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Spring; Jason A Decker PHIL 225 Philosophy of Mind What is the relationship between the mind and the brain? Are they identical? Or is there mental "stuff" in addition to physical stuff? Or perhaps some physical stuff has irreducibly mental properties? These, and related questions, are explored by philosophers under the heading of "the mind-body problem." In this course, we will start with these questions, looking at classical and contemporary defenses of both materialism and dualism. This investigation will lead us to other important questions such as: What is the nature of mental representation, what is consciousness, and could a robot have conscious states and mental representations? 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 <ref type="bibr">PHIL 226</ref> Love and Friendship This course will consider various philosophical views on the nature of love and friendship. It will focus on both the history of philosophical thinking about these notions from Plato and Aristotle to the twentieth century and a variety of contemporary views on the meaning of love and friendship that derive their insight from the most recent studies of emotion, agency, action, rationality, moral value, and motivation. We will also look at the variations in the understanding of love and friendship among the members of the same culture and across cultures. 6 credits; HI, WR2, QRE; Winter; Allison E Murphy PHIL 227 Philosophy with Children Children are naturally curious. They want to know about the world and their place in it. In other words, children are naturally philosophical. This course is about helping children explore and develop their nascent philosophical abilities via children's literature. To that end, the bulk of this course is devoted to preparing for, and then making, visits to a first grade class at Greenvale Park Elementary School in Northfield. Along the way, we'll explore the philosophy that can be found in all kinds of kids' books and learn about presenting complicated ideas in simpler form. In consultation with the instructor, this course will count toward either the Practical/Value requirement or the Theoretical requirement in the Philosophy Major for students who elect to write a final research paper. Prerequisite: Previous Philosophy course. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 228 Freedom and Alienation in Black American Philosophy The struggle of freedom against forms of alienation is both a historical and contemporary characteristic of Black/African-American philosophy. In this course we will explore how a variety of Black/African-American philosophers theorize these concepts. The aim of the course is to both offer resources for familiarizing students with African-American philosophers and develop an appreciation for critical philosophical voices in the Black intellectual tradition. The course will range from slave narratives, reconstruction, and civil rights to contemporary prison abolitionism, intersectionality, and afro-pessimism. The texts of the course will include: Angela Davis' Lectures on Liberation, Frederick Douglass' Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells Southern Horrors, George Yancy's African-American Philosophers 17 Conversations, and Afro-Pessimism: An Introduction. As well as select articles from historical and contemporary Black/African-American philosophers. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Winter; Eddie O'Byrn PHIL 232 Social and Political Philosophy We will study several prominent late twentieth century philosophers writing about social and political justice and representing a variety of views, such as liberalism, socialism, libertarianism, communitarianism, feminism and post-modernism. The following are some of the authors we will read: John Rawls, Gerald Cohen, Robert Nozick, Charles Taylor, Iris Marion Young, Seyla Benhabib, Jurgen Habermas, Jean-Francois Lyotard. 6 credits; HI, WR2, QRE, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 235 Analytic Philosophy's Greatest Hits Around the turn of the last century, a movement arose in philosophy which threatened to destroy philosophy itself. It started with a simple conviction that "what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence." This led to calls by analytically-minded philosophers to commit most of philosophy to the flames. After its self-destructive adolescence, however, analytic philosophy developed into something constructive. We'll look at some of the greatest hits from both phases. Authors to be read include Wittgenstein, Carnap, Quine, Anscombe, Goodman, Kripke, and Lewis. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 236 Proof, Knowledge, and Understanding in Mathematics An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics focusing on the history and development of mathematical proofs. The course is organized around three central questions: i. What is the relationship between a mathematical proof and our knowledge of the theorem that it proves? ii. Do some mathematical proofs go beyond establishing the truth of their theorems and actually explain why the theorems are true? iii. How has our mathematical knowledge grown throughout history? We will first address these questions by reading and discussing Imre Lakatos's book Proofs and Refutations. We will continue with readings drawn from classic and contemporary sources in the history and philosophy of mathematics. This course has no formal prerequisites, though it does presuppose a willingness to read, assess, and write about mathematical proofs. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 243 Animal Ethics: The Moral Status of Animals In an era of rapid globalization and increasing dominion of humans over the natural world, we are all (often unwittingly) party to practices that seemingly exact grave harm on billions of nonhuman animals. This raises a pressing ethical question: what are our moral obligations (if any) to nonhuman animals, and how might we practically fulfill such moral obligations (if they exist)? Also, what bearing does the latest scientific research on animal behavior have on these questions? In this course we will explore these and related questions, through a study of various philosophers and ethologists. The course will culminate in a class project that addresses animal ethics related issues in the community. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 246 Probability: The Very Guide of Life? Bishop Butler and David Hume claimed that "probability is the very guide of life." But what exactly is probability and what---if any!---kind of guidance does it give us? In this course, we will look at (i) competing philosophical interpretations of probability, including frequentist, Bayesian, and best-system theories, (ii) recent work in cognitive science on probabilistic reasoning, (iii) uses of probability in formal epistemology, decision theory, and science, and (iv) paradoxes and puzzles of probability. 6 credits; HI, WR2, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 251 Evidence, Objectivity, and Realism in the Sciences Science gives us an objective view of ourselves and the world we live in. Or does it? In this course, we'll pursue some fundamental questions about the nature of the empirical sciences. What makes something a science? What kinds of evidence are there for scientific claims? What, if anything, makes science objective? The main concepts of the course will be illustrated using examples of scientific reasoning from a range of sciences, including biology (e.g., research on gender), climate science (e.g., whether hurricanes are getting more damaging over time), and physics (e.g., the seventeenth century revolution in astronomy). One theme of the course will be feminist critiques of scientific practices and of traditional philosophy of science. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Fall; Douglas B Marshall PHIL 270 Ancient Philosophy Is there a key to a happy and successful human life? If so, how do you acquire it? Ancient philosophers thought the key was virtue and that your chances of obtaining it depend on the sort of life you lead. In this course we'll examine what these philosophers meant by virtue and how they understood its implications for your everyday life. We will situate the ancient understanding of virtue in the context of larger questions of metaphysics (the nature of being and reality), psychology, and ethics, as they arise in foundational works from Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Fall; Allison E Murphy PHIL 272 Early Modern Philosophy This course offers an introduction to major aspects of European theories of being and knowledge during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Key topics to be examined include: the distinction between the mind and the body; the existence and nature of God; the relationship between cause and effect; the scope and nature of human knowledge. We will place a special emphasis on understanding the philosophical thought of René Descartes, Anne Conway, G. W. Leibniz, and David Hume. Two themes will recur throughout the course: first, the evolving relationships between philosophy and the sciences of the period; second, the philosophical contributions of women in the early modern era. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Spring; Douglas B Marshall PHIL 274 Existentialism We will consider the emergence and development of major themes of existentialism in the works of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, as well as "classical" existentialists such as Heidegger, Sartre and De Beauvoir. We will discuss key issues put forward by the existentialist movement, such as "the question of being" and human historicity, freedom and responsibility and look at how different authors analyzed the nature and ambitions of the Self and diverse aspects of subjectivity. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 288 A Survey of Historical Ideas of Race In an effort to gain a perspective on the power of ideas, this class will trace the development of several ideas of race. We will look at attempts to define and create the concept of 'race,' and we will ultimately attempt to answer questions as to whether 'ideas of race' have improved our lives to date. We will address the topic of this course by progressing through four parts: 1. Race: Creating Socially Significant Difference, 2. Race: In the Interest of Science, 3. Race: Human Types and Being Human, 4. Race: Racial Identity?. We will draw on a range of significant texts representing several disciplinary perspectives, including philosophy, literature, film, and history. The overall goal of the course is to offer students a chance to learn, think, write, and discuss an idea that has been one of the forces engineering societal value and behavior in the U.S. for, at least, the past 400 years. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 289 Death, Dinner, and Discussion We're all going to die. We all know that. But we seem to spend a lot of our lives avoiding thinking and talking about it. This course aims to remedy that. We will meet weekly to talk about death and, more specifically, the choices we think we might want to make about how we will die and how we want to live at the end of our lives. Students in the class will be asked to think seriously and share their thoughts about these issues. Students will read some popular books that invite people to think about the end of their lives, hold a Death Over Dinner discussion as a class (with the professor), and hold (and write about) a Death Over Dinner discussion with some of their peers outside of class. Be ready to talk and to listen! We'll provide the Kleenex. 3 credits; S/CR/NC; NE; Winter; Daniel M Groll PHIL 299 Ethics Bowl This course will prepare a team or two from Carleton to participate in the regional Ethics Bowl tournament in Madison WI in November 2019 (dates TBD). Ethics Bowl teams prepare analyses of contemporary moral and political issues which they present, and defend, at the competition, while also engaging with the analyses of other teams. While Ethics Bowl is a competition, the focus in our course will be on doing the research necessary to understand the cases and then thinking through the cases together. Students do NOT have to be able to attend the Ethics Bowl tournament in Madison in order to take (and pass!) the course. The class will meet once a week. Previous Ethics Bowl experience is not required. Prerequisite: Instructor consent. 2 credits; S/CR/NC; NE; Fall; Daniel M Groll PHIL 302 Purpose in Nature We often explain our actions by appeal to goals or ends. For example, to explain why you run, you might state a practical end running serves -e.g., health. Such an explanation is "teleological" in character, in that it appeals to an "end" or "telos" (rather than your particular biochemical makeup). Are there good philosophical reasons for thinking that ends really operate in nature, over and above material processes, or are teleological explanations merely a heuristic or explanatory device helping us make sense of the world (but failing to capture any real feature of the world)? In the absence of a designer agent, how do we make sense of natural ends? What is the scope of natural teleology? Do natural ends operate only locally or more globally? This course explores these and related questions, through tracing the kinds of teleological explanations (and argument for teleology) philosophers, theologians and scientists employ, ranging from Presocratic natural science to contemporary biology, cosmology and philosophy. Prerequisite: 12 credits in philosophy or instructor permission. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 303 Bias, Belief, Community, Emotion What is important to individuals, how they see themselves and others, and the kind of projects they pursue are shaped by traditional and moral frameworks they didn't choose. Individual selves are encumbered by their social environments and, in this sense, always 'biased', but some forms of bias are pernicious because they produce patterns of inter and intra-group domination and oppression. We will explore various forms of intersubjectivity and its asymmetries through readings in social ontology and social epistemology that theorize the construction of group and individual beliefs and identities in the context of the social world they engender. Prerequisite: One Previous Philosophy course or instructor permission. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 304 Epistemology and Oppression Today, there is an increased interest in epistemic oppression, i.e. the ways knowledge-related considerations systematically and unwarrantedly compromise one's life and possibilities. As such, it has become integral to introduce students to writings by feminists of color who have grappled with knowledge-related problems for centuries. However, the women of color texts that develop understandings of epistemic oppression are difficult for typical philosophy/academic audiences to read. Not necessarily because the texts are opaque, but because the ambient assumptions of these thinkers can be radically different than most philosophical orientations prevailing today. There are differing metaphilosophical assumptions in women of color feminist thought that can make their insights around epistemic oppression difficult to identify and understand. The purpose and audiences of their writing often obscure the complexity of their thinking. The purpose of this course, then, will be to equip students with the ability to detect and comprehend women of color feminist epistemological projects for more comprehensive ways of understanding epistemic oppression. Prerequisite: One previous course in Philosophy. 6 credits; NE, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 305 Frederick Douglass: The Philosophies of a Slave, Citizen, and Diplomat This course will be a study of Frederick Douglass: A man born into American chattel slavery who liberated himself and lived to become an abolitionist, orator, diplomat, and American hero. Through his autobiographies (Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass 1845, My Bondage My Freedom 1855) and speeches (The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro 1852, We Welcome the Fifteenth Amendment 1869, Lessons of the Hour 1894), we will trace the evolution of Douglass' views on the abolition of slavery, American citizenship, political and moral responsibility, and his lifetime of activist work for equality. Alongside these texts, we will read contemporary philosophical literature that celebrates, contests, and critically highlights the significance of Douglass' philosophical legacy. The purpose of this course is help students underscore historical anti-discrimination philosophies and the diverse legacy of American philosophical figures. Prerequisite: One prior course in Philosophy or instructor permission. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Spring; Eddie O'Byrn PHIL 311 When Art is Not 'For Art's Sake' A central idea in modernist thinking about the arts is that an artwork is meant to be appreciated 'for its own sake.' In this course, we shall challenge this idea and consider art that is not primarily 'for art's sake' in order to explore more general questions about the nature of artworks and of artistic appreciation. We ask, under what conditions are such works artworks? Much of the course will address material in a new monograph upon which the professor is working. This course is co-taught. Prerequisite: One previous Philosophy course. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 318 Buddhist Studies India Program: Buddhist Philosophy This course introduces students to major trends in Buddhist philosophy as it developed in India from the time of the Buddha until the eleventh century CE. The course emphasizes the relationships between philosophical reasoning and the meditation practices encountered in the Buddhist Meditation Traditions course. With this in mind, the course is organized into three units covering the Indian philosophical foundations for the Theravāda, Zen, and Tibetan Vajrayāna traditions. While paying attention first and foremost to philosophical arguments and their evolution, we also examine the ways in which metaphysics, epistemology and ethics inform one another in each tradition. Prerequisite: Acceptance into the Buddhist Studies program. 8 credits; NE, IS; Fall; Arthur P McKeown PHIL 372 Kant's Critique of Pure Reason In this course we aim to understand the theories of knowledge and being developed by Immanuel Kant in his monumental Critique of Pure Reason. Although Kant's own text will remain our primary focus, we will also read helpful secondary works by Sebastian Gardner, Paul Guyer, Charles Parsons, and other recent interpreters. The main questions to be addressed include the following: How does the mind represent the world? Can we distinguish the way things are in themselves from the way they appear to us? What are space and time? On what basis do we make causal inferences? What substantive knowledge can we have about the world entirely independent of our experience of it? 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 PHIL 398 Comps Proposal This is the first part of the philosophy comps sequence. It is a five-week independent study to be enrolled in at the end of the Fall term Senior Year (or the year you will be compsing). The purpose is to give you the chance to do more reading on your comps topics and to start doing a bit of writing. By the last day of classes of Fall Term, you will turn in an official comps proposal (approximately 1500 words). The proposal will (a) articulate the main philosophical problem or puzzle that will be addressed in your comps; <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Political Science and International Relations Courses</head><p>POSC 100 Governing with the News "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war," said newspaper owner and editor William Randolph Hearst in 1895 at the cusp of the Spanish-American war. The quotation marks a symbiotic, potentially "tail-wags-dog" relationship mass media have had with government; the mantra "fake news," firing, harassing, and murdering of journalists marks the antagonistic relationship between these two institutions. This course studies news media as an institution. Coursework includes experiences with data capture, analysis, and visual presentation. 6 credits; AI, WR1, QRE, IDS; Fall; Barbara Allen POSC 120 Democracy and Dictatorship An introduction to the array of different democratic and authoritarian political institutions in both developing and developed countries. We will also explore key issues in contemporary politics in countries around the world, such as nationalism and independence movements, revolution, regime change, state-making, and social movements. 6 credits; SI, IS, WR2; Fall, Winter, Spring; Kent Freeze, Eric S Mosinger, Dev Gupta POSC 122 Politics in America: Liberty and Equality An introduction to American government and politics. Focus on the Congress, Presidency, political parties and interest groups, the courts and the Constitution. Particular attention will be given to the public policy debates that divide liberals and conservatives and how these divisions are rooted in American political culture. 6 credits; SI, IDS, QRE; Fall, Winter, Spring; Christina E Farhart, Melanie Freeze POSC 160 Political Philosophy Introduction to ancient and modern political philosophy. We will investigate several fundamentally different approaches to the basic questions of politics--questions concerning the character of political life, the possibilities and limits of politics, justice, and the good society--and the philosophic presuppositions (concerning human nature and human flourishing) that underlie these, and all, political questions. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Fall, Winter, Spring; Mihaela Czobor-Lupp, Laurence D Cooper POSC 170 International Relations and World Politics What are the foundational theories and practices of international relations and world politics? This course addresses topics of a geopolitical, commercial and ideological character as they relate to global systems including: great power politics, polycentricity, and international organizations. It also explores the dynamic intersection of world politics with war, terrorism, nuclear weapons, national security, human security, human rights, and the globalization of economic and social development. 6 credits; SI, IS, QRE; Fall, Winter, Spring; Summer N Forester, Tun Myint POSC 180 Global Politics &amp; Local Communities The 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall signaled beginnings of "a new world order," to use the words of President George HW Bush. With the increased attention to transnational issues like terrorism, climate change, immigration, and a global AIDS epidemic, the cooperative ideal was a welcome turn from Cold War competition. But three decades later we see nuclear arms stalemates, a rise of nationalist politics, exit from global agreements….What happened? How are local communities affected by changing views of globalization? This class examines debates in International Relations and domestic policy that address that question and the practice of global governance. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 201 Lobbyists, Wonks and Social Media: Public Policy Making in Democracy This course explores the process of policy making in the United States. We will also explore the diffusion of U.S. policy ideas and technology across the globe. The effectiveness of elected officials, lobbyists, idea entrepreneurs, and grass roots activists will be contrasted; techniques of agenda setting and agenda denial will be emphasized. Students from all majors interested in careers in public policy are welcome. Prerequisite: Sophomore Standing. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 202 Parties, Interest Groups and Elections Examination of the American electoral system and its components: parties, interest groups and the media.

The course will devote special attention to the 2016 election. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 203 Political Communication: Political Advertising in Elections and Public Policy Crosslisted with POSC 303. How does political advertising influence the electorate? How does political advertising influence our understanding of policy proposals? Election ads along with the six-second "sound bite" are now among the major forms of political communication in modern democracies. Add to these forms a battery of visual "arguments" seen in news media, film, and paid ads aimed at persuading us to adopt various policy positions. We will study how ads are created and "work" from the standpoint of political psychology and film analysis. Our policy focus for 2016 will be on climate change and the 2016 general election. 6 credits; QRE, SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 204 Media and Electoral Politics: 2018 United States Election Our analysis of media influences on politics will draw from three fields of study: political psychology, political behavior and participation, and public opinion. Students will conduct a study of the effects of campaign ads and news using our multiyear data set of content analyzed election ads and news. We study a variety of quantitative and qualitative research methods to learn how political communication affects U.S. elections. Taking this course in conjunction with Political Science 223 is highly recommended to learn methods such as focus group and depth interview methods and experiment design for conducting original research on elections. 6 credits; QRE, SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 205 News Media and Democratic Electoral Processes How have news media affected democratic elections in the U.S., UK, and EU? Case studies show traditional and new media-from citizen journalism to bots-shaping views of candidates and issues-and democracy itself. Using recent elections worldwide as a base, we will investigate traditional media as an institution in a challenging environment of new media sources and charges of "fake news." Coursework includes learning about research design through original data collection, data analysis, and visual representation of data. Political Science 223 is recommended as a way to learn quantitative and qualitative methods of social science research. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IDS; Fall; Barbara Allen POSC 207 Global Decline of Democracy: Urban Revanchism and Popular Resistance Our focus will be on policing, gentrification, gated communities and other tools for reclaiming and fortifying metropolitan space, as well as citizen responses. What community exists, for whom? 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 208 Presidential Elections, Gridlock and Policy Strategy Part One will focus on the process of candidate nomination and explanations for presidential elections. Part Two will focus on gridlock, Executive Branch tools, and strategies for governance in the midst of division. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 209 Money and Politics Modern elections have become multibillion-dollar ventures. How does money influence electoral and policy outcomes in the United States? Who donates and why do people or groups donate? Where does all the money go? How has campaign finance been regulated and what are proposed reforms? Focusing on recent elections, we will explore these questions by delving into the world of campaign finance. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IDS; Fall; Melanie Freeze POSC 210 Misinformation, Political Rumors, and Conspiracy Theories Why do people believe in conspiracy theories, hold on to misinformed beliefs even in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, and/or spread political and social rumors that may have little basis in fact? Who is most vulnerable to these various forms of misinformation? What are the normative and political consequences of misperceptions (if any)? This course explores the psychological, political, and philosophical approaches to the study of the causes, consequences, and tenacity of conspiracy beliefs, misinformation, and political rumors, as well as possible approaches that journalists could employ to combat misperceptions. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Spring; Christina E Farhart POSC 211 Environment and the Evolution of Rules: Designing Institutions to Solve Political Problems How can we design democratic institutions to deal with environmental and social problems? Are there universal approaches to solving political problems in physically and socially diverse communities? Do people come up with different institutional ways to address shared problems because of environmental or cultural differences? By examining basic principles of institutional design you will learn how to analyze constitutions, public policies, international treaties, and other "rule ordered relationships" that different people have created to deal with environmental concerns and, generally, the health and welfare of their communities. 6 credits; SI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 212 Environmental Justice The environmental justice movement seeks greater participation by marginalized communities in environmental policy, and equity in the distribution of environmental harms and benefits. This course will examine the meaning of "environmental justice," the history of the movement, the empirical foundation for the movement's claims, and specific policy questions. Our focus is the United States, but students will have the opportunity to research environmental justice in other countries. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IDS; Winter; Kimberly K Smith POSC 213 Psychology of Mass Political Behavior This course explores the political psychology of individual judgment and choice. We will examine the role of cognition, emotions, values, predispositions, and social identities on judgment and choice. From this approach, we will address the larger debate regarding the quality of democratic citizenship. 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE, IDS; Spring; Melanie Freeze POSC 214 Visual Representations of Political Thought and Action Visual media offer an alternative method of framing political ideas and events. Images found in such texts as film, posters, and even in statistical tables can enlighten--or mislead. Readings in visual theory, political psychology, and graphic representation will enable you to read images and use these powerful media to convey your ideas and research. 3 credits; LA, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 215 Political Communications in Comparative Context This five-week course will focus on the major theories of political communication in an election context. Our case studies will be the French and German 2017 elections. We compare the legal and cultural contexts of election news coverage and advertising in these countries and analyze media effects on voter perceptions using political psychology studies based on research in the U.S. and EU. 3 credits; QRE, SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 217 Monuments, Museums &amp; Meaning: How Politics Shapes Memory in Artifacts Why was naming the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian "political?" Why is the Smithsonian's Anacostia Museum not on the Washington DC Mall? What is memorialized by the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum? Why care about the eight Confederate leaders in the U.S. Capitol (or other public places)? This class examines museums and monuments as important types of political communication that preserve cultural artifacts, create historical records, and tell present and future generations the meaning of communities and individuals. We learn about various practices including funding, naming, acquiring, appropriating, placing, designing, and constructing the artifacts that house community memories. 3 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 218 Schools, Scholarship and Policy in the United States What can scholarship tell us about educational strategies to reduce achievement gaps and economic opportunity? Do the policies promoted at the city, state and federal levels reflect that knowledge? How are these policies made? What is the relationship between schools and the economic class, racial composition and housing stock of their neighborhoods? Prerequisite: Sophomore Standing. 6 credits; SI, IDS, WR2, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 219 Poverty and Public Policy in the U.S. Deindustrialization, inequality, housing policy, and welfare will be major topics. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 220 Politics and Political History in Film How do representations of politics in film influence our ideas about governance, citizenship, power, and authority? How do film and TV reflect values and beliefs of democratic society, particularly in the United States? These are two questions that we will consider in the course as we study films representing politics and historical events in fiction and nonfiction genres for entertainment and education. Films to be analyzed include: Battle of Algiers, Fog of <ref type="bibr">War, Cape Fear (1963</ref><ref type="bibr">), Manchurian Candidate (1960</ref> Political Science 100 are also encouraged to enroll. We learn to conduct focus groups, depth interviews, content analysis, and experimental analysis using election news, ads, speeches, and debates (in the U.S. or other democracies) as our cases for analysis. 3 credits; SI, IDS, QRE; Fall; Barbara Allen POSC 224 Measuring and Evaluating Social and Ecological Systems The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) and Social Ecological Systems (SES) Frameworks are designed to provide data on social, economic, and political institutions and the physical environment enabling us to understand the reciprocal effects of institutional and environmental change. We will learn these frameworks and the methods used to measure changes in natural resource systems. We study measurement, monitoring, and management of prairie and forest ecosystems in local agricultural use and restoration projects. Much of the course occurs on site in field trip locations. 3 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 225 Global-Local Commons: Sustainability, Diversity &amp; Self-Gov't in Complex Social-Ecological Systems This course introduces students to the study of commons (common pool resources and common property), particularly natural resources commons. The dilemmas of commons governance often reveal links between "governments" and "governance" as well as the global stakes of bettering local livelihoods. Our focus is on social and ecological systems (SES) linked directly with climate change, including local forest and prairie management sites. Students are strongly encouraged to take the five-week accompanying lab, POSC 224 Measuring and Evaluating Social and Ecological Systems, which extends our course content through research in field settings. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 226 Political Psychology This course is an introduction to political psychology, an inter-disciplinary field of study that applies psychological theory and research to the study of politics, as a theoretical alternative to rational choice models. Study will include applying psychological models to elite decision making and to political behavior of ordinary citizens. Topics include personality and political leadership, group processes and foreign policy, theories of information processing and elite decision making, malignant political aggression and punitive politics, altruism and heroic political action, etc. in light of important political issues and events. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 230 Methods of Political Research An introduction to research method, research design, and the analysis of political data. The course is intended to introduce students to the fundamentals of scientific inquiry as they are employed in the discipline. The course will consider the philosophy of scientific research generally, the philosophy of social science research, theory building and theory testing, the components of applied (quantitative and qualitative) research across the major sub-fields of political science, and basic methodological tools. Intended for majors only. Prerequisite: Mathematics 115, 215, 245, 275 or AP Statistics (score of 4 or 5). 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE; Fall, Winter, Spring; Melanie Freeze, Kent Freeze, Greg Marfleet POSC 231 American Foreign Policy An introduction to the actors and processes of American foreign policymaking and to the substance of American foreign policy. The course aims to provide students with an understanding of how knowledge of the past, the global policy environment, the processes of foreign policymaking, and the specifics of a foreign policy issue come together to help determine modern American foreign policy. The course will review the structure of the international system of states, state power and interests, the historical context of American foreign policy, actors in American foreign affairs, models of foreign policy decision making, and the instruments of foreign policy. Prerequisite: Political Science 122, AP American Government, or AP U.S. History is highly recommended. 6 credits; SI, IS; Spring; Greg Marfleet POSC 232 Chinese Foreign Policy The "Rise of China" over the past thirty-five years presents challenges and opportunities for the United States and other countries around the world. This course examines China's growing and changing influence in the world. The course starts by exploring historical Chinese foreign policy, from Imperial China through the Cold War. The course then examines a variety of different theories and factors explaining the general nature of China's foreign policy. The course concludes by detailing China's current bilateral relationships with specific countries and regions around the world. 6 credits; IS, SI; Spring; Kent Freeze POSC 236 Global, National and Human Security What are the greatest threats to national and global security? In this course we will explore a range of traditional security topics including: the proliferation of WMDs, terrorism, piracy, insurgencies, arms races, territorial disputes and strategic rivalries. In addition to these classic concerns, we also consider newer ones such as cyber-security, the threat of global pandemics, unmanned warfare and the impact of climate change. Our study begins and concludes with the debate over the concept of security in the twenty-first century. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 237 Southeast Asian Politics This course will cover key thematic issues of Southeast Asian politics, including the challenges of democracy, regional integration, environmental politics, the rise of the power of non-state actors, and struggles for citizen-sovereignty of the people. We will examine these frontier issues against the background of Southeast Asia's societal evolution through kingdoms, colonial eras, emergence of nation-states, and the influence of globalization on politics. 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 238 Sport &amp; Globalization London/Seville Pgm: Globalization and Development: Lessons from Int'l Football This course uses international football (soccer) as a lens to analyze topics in globalization, such as immigration and labor, inequality, foreign investment, trade in services, and intellectual property. Students will be presented with key debates in these areas and then use cases from international football as illustrations. Focusing on the two wealthiest leagues in Europe, the English Premier League and the Spanish Liga, students will address key issues in the study of globalization and development, and in doing so enhance their understanding of the world, sports, and sport's place in the world. 6 credits; SI, IS; Winter; Bob Carlson POSC 239 The Poor and the Powerless This course examines the foundations of development and globalization, their representations as historical processes, their manifestations over time, and their advocates and detractors. This will be done against the backdrop of empirical and substantive representations of actually-existing development outcomes and globalization processes, their organization, and their practices. This course employs a critical approach to development and is taught from a political economy perspective. In particular, it deals with the relationship between theory, ideology and practice by contrasting classical approaches with critical, Marxist, and radical approaches. It examines outcomes of development practice, both positive and negative, through a focus on globalization. 6 credits; SI, IS; Winter; Charisse E Burden-Stelly POSC 241 Ethnic Conflict Ethnic conflict is a persistent and troubling challenge for those interested in preserving international peace and stability. By one account, ethnic violence has claimed more than ten million lives since 1945, and in the 1990s, ethnic conflicts comprised nearly half of all ongoing conflicts around the world. In this course, we will attempt to understand the conditions that contribute to ethnic tensions, identify the triggers that lead to escalation, and evaluate alternative ideas for managing and solving such disputes. The course will draw on a number of cases, including Rwanda, Bosnia, and Northern Ireland. 6 credits; SI, IS; Winter; Dev Gupta POSC 242 Middle East Politics This course introduces the politics and political structures of states in the Middle East. We explore the political origins of Middle Eastern states, and investigate how regional politics are shaped by colonialism, religion, tribes, the family, and more. We examine the persistence of authoritarianism and its links to other issues like nationalism and militarism. The course covers how recent and current events like the revolutionary movements of the 'Arab Spring' civil society affect the states and their societies. We conclude with a consideration of the future of Middle Eastern politics, evaluating lingering concerns and emerging prospects for liberalization and reform. 6 credits; SI, IS, WR2; Winter; Summer N Forester POSC 247 Comparative Nationalism Nationalism is an ideology that political actors have frequently harnessed to support a wide variety of policies ranging from intensive economic development to genocide. But what is nationalism? Where does it come from? And what gives it such emotional and political power? This course investigates competing ideas about the sources of nationalism, its evolution, and its political uses in state building, legitimation, development, and war. We will consider both historic examples of nationalism, as well as contemporary cases drawn from Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the United States. 6 credits; SI, IS; Fall; Dev Gupta POSC 248 Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) What does that really mean? This course will afford students the opportunity to learn about nuclear, radiological, biological, chemical, and cyber WMD. We'll explore how these weapons are built, what happens when they are used, and how they are controlled-or not-by international security agreements. A multi-disciplinary approach will be used. Professors from the political science, chemistry, physics, computer science, biology, and philosophy departments will each contribute specific sections and, along with guest lecturers, augment our discussions on questions of global and national security policy. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 250 Ancient Political Philosophy: Plato's Republic Cross-listed with POSC 350. In this course we will examine ancient political philosophy through the intensive study of Plato's Republic, perhaps the greatest work of political philosophy ever written. What is morality? Why should a person behave morally? Wouldn't it be more satisfying to be a tyrant? What is the best way of life? What would a perfect society look like? What would be its customs and institutions, and who would rule? What would it demand of us, and would that price be worth paying? These are some of the politically (and personally) vital questions addressed by the book. 6 credits; HI; Fall; Laurence D Cooper POSC 251 Modern Political Philosophy: Liberalism and Its Critics Cross-listed with POSC 371. Liberalism is the dominant political philosophy of our time. Living in a liberal polity, each of us has been shaped by liberalism. But is liberalism the best political order? Do we even know what liberalism is? What are the strongest arguments in its favor, and what are the deepest criticisms we might level against it? In this course we will examine liberalism's philosophic roots and engage with some of its most forceful advocates and most profound critics. Our readings will include authors such as Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Tocqueville, Mill, and Nietzsche. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 254 Freedom, Excellence, Happiness: Aristotle's Ethics Cross-listed with POSC 354. What does it mean to be morally excellent? To be politically excellent? To be intellectually and spiritually excellent? Are these things mutually compatible? Do they lie within the reach of everyone? And what is the relation between excellence and pleasure? Between excellence and happiness? Aristotle addresses these questions in intricate and illuminating detail in the Nicomachean Ethics, which we will study in this course. The Ethics is more accessible than some of Aristotle's other works. But it is also a multifaceted and multi-layered book, and one that reveals more to those who study it with care. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 255 Post-Modern Political Thought The thought and practice of the modern age have been found irredeemably oppressive, alienating, dehumanizing, and/or exhausted by a number of leading philosophic thinkers in recent years. In this course we will explore the critiques and alternative visions offered by a variety of post-modern thinkers, including Nietzsche (in many ways the first post-modern), Heidegger, Foucault, and Derrida. 6 credits; HI; Fall; Mihaela Czobor-Lupp POSC 256 Nietzsche: Beyond Good and Evil Cross-listed with POSC 350. Nietzsche understood himself to be living at a moment of great endings: the exhaustion of modernity, the self-undermining of rationalism, the self-overcoming of morality--in short, stunningly, the "death of God." He regarded these endings as an unprecedented disaster for humanity but also as an unprecedented opportunity, and he pointed the way to a new ideal and a new culture that would be life-affirming and life-enhancing. This course will center on close study of Beyond Good and Evil, perhaps Nietzsche's most beautiful book and probably his most political one. Selections from some of his other books will also be assigned. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 258 Politics and Ambition Cross-listed with POSC 357. Is personal ambition a threat to peace and the public good or is it a prod to nobility and heroism? Does it exemplify the opposition between self and society or does it represent their intersection and mutual support-or both? And what is the nature of political ambition, especially the ambition to rule: what does the would-be ruler really want? We will take up these and related questions by studying several classic works of philosophy and literature. Readings will likely include works by Plato, Xenophon, and Shakespeare as well as American founders, statesmen, and moral leaders. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 259 Justice Among Nations Cross-listed with POSC 349. The purpose of this course is to bring to bear great works of political philosophy on the foundational questions of international politics. Our primary text will be Thucydides' gripping history of The Peloponnesian War. Thucydides was perhaps the greatest thinker about international relations that the world has seen. He was also a political philosopher--and psychologist--of the first rank. His book teaches much not only about politics but about human nature. 6 credits; SI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 260 The Political Philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau Cross-listed with POSC 350. In this course we will study what Rousseau considered his greatest and best book: Emile. Emile is a philosophic novel. It uses a thought experiment--the rearing of a child from infancy to adulthood--to explore human nature and the human condition, including their political dimensions. Among Emile's themes are natural goodness and the origins of evil; self-love and sociability; the differences and relations between the sexes; citizenship; and the principles of political right. The book also addresses the question of how one might live naturally and happily amid an unnatural and unhappy civilization. 6 credits; HI; Spring; Laurence D Cooper POSC 261 Power, Freedom, and Revolution Politics can be defined as struggle for power. However, what power means is neither self-evident nor a non-controversial issue. The course explores different definitions of power, its difference from violence and force, as well as the extent to which criticism, resistance, and freedom are intrinsic components of power. Special attention will be given to the relationship between power and revolution, especially to the difficulty of turning revolutionary violence into political representation. In the attempt to answer these questions we will read texts by Arendt and Foucault and will consider the concrete examples of the French, Soviet, and Iranian Revolutions. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 264 Politics of Contemporary China This course examines the political, social and economic transformation of China over the past thirty years. Students will explore the transformation of the countryside from a primarily agricultural society into the factory of the world. Particular emphasis will be placed on economic development and how this has changed state-society relations at the grassroots. The class will explore these changes among farmers, the working class and the emerging middle class. Students will also explore how the Chinese Communist Party has survived and even thrived while many other Communist regimes have fallen and assess the relationship between economic development and democratization. 6 credits; SI, IS; Fall; Kent Freeze POSC 265 Public Policy and Global Capitalism This course provides a comprehensive introduction to comparative and international public policy. It examines major theories and approaches to public policy design and implementation in several major areas: international policy economy (including the study of international trade and monetary policy, financial regulation, and comparative welfare policy), global public health and comparative healthcare policy, institutional development (including democratic governance, accountability systems, and judicial reform), and environmental public policy. This course serves as the gateway for the Political Economy Minor. Prerequisite: Mathematics 215 strongly recommended, or instructor permission. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Winter; Greg Marfleet POSC 266 Urban Political Economy City revenue is increasingly dependent on tourism. Cities manufacture identity and entertainment, whether we think of Las Vegas or Jerusalem, Berlin or Bilbao, the ethnoscapes of Copenhagen or the red light district of Amsterdam. As cities compete in the global economy to become playgrounds for a transnational tourist class, what is the role of urban residents? Who governs? Who benefits? Short essays or exams will be required. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 267 Comparative Foreign Policy Why do states act the way they do internationally? Why do some states act like "rogues" while others support the system? How do countries choose their allies or enemies? How do governments define their country's national interest and respond to global changes? Foreign policy is where internal politics and external politics intersect. Understanding any country's foreign policy requires that we pay attention to its position in the international system and its internal politics. In this course we will employ approaches from international relations and comparative politics to explore these questions across a range of countries. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 268 Global Environmental Politics and Policy Global environmental politics and policy is the most prominent field that challenges traditional state-centric ways of thinking about international problems and solutions. This course examines local-global dynamics of environmental problems. The course will cover five arenas crucial to understanding the nature and origin of global environmental politics and policymaking mechanisms: (1) international environmental law; (2) world political orders; (3) humanenvironment interactions through politics and markets; (4) paradigms of sustainable development; and (5) dynamics of human values and rules. 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 270 Political Philosophy and the Book of Genesis Cross-listed with Political Science 350. Much of the moral and political architecture of the post-modern, secular world traces back to pre-modern, religious scriptures--especially Genesis, the first book of the Bible. For this reason alone Genesis deserves attention. But there are even stronger reasons: With its accounts of creation, humanity's relation to nature and the divine, human aspiration and failure, the origins of community, and the good life for both individuals and societies, Genesis offers enormous riches even for those who approach it from an "external" philosophic standpoint (as we will in this class) rather than an "internal" religious one. Readings include Genesis and commentary. 6 credits; HI; Winter; Laurence D Cooper POSC 271 Constitutional Law I Covers American constitutional law and history from the founding to the breakdown of the constitution in secession crisis. Extensive attention will be paid to the constitutional convention and other sources of constitutional law in addition to Supreme Court cases. 6 credits; SI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 272 Constitutional Law II Covers American constitutional law and history from Reconstruction to the contemporary era. Extensive attention will be paid to the effort to refound the American constitution following the Civil War as manifest in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, and to the successive transformations which the Supreme Court worked in the new constitutional order. Political Science 271 is not a prerequisite. 6 credits; SI; Fall; Kimberly K Smith POSC 273 Race and Politics in the U.S. This course addresses race and ethnicity in U.S. politics. Following an introduction to historical, sociological, and psychological approaches to the study of race and ethnicity, we apply these approaches to understanding the ways in which racial attitudes have been structured along a number of political and policy dimensions, e.g., welfare, education, criminal justice. Students will gain an increased understanding of the multiple contexts that shape contemporary racial and ethnic politics and policies in the U.S., and will consider the role of institutional design, policy development, representation, and racial attitudes among the general U.S. public and political environment. 6 credits; SI, IDS; <ref type="bibr">Christina E Farhart POSC 275 Black Radical Political Thought, 1919</ref><ref type="bibr">-1969</ref> This course examines the history of Black radical political thought in the United States between 1919 and 1969. It also explores internationalist and diasporic linkages that shaped, and were shaped by, the U.S. context. "Black Radicalism" refers to the forms of politics and thought that have challenged, nationally and globally, economic exploitation, social inequality, political marginalization, and private and state-sanctioned anti-blackness. The political ideologies and practices we will consider include: Black nationalism, pan-Africanism, socialism and communism, and Black feminisms. The course will also pay special attention to the socio-historical and political economic contexts that give rise to different forms of Black radicalism. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IDS; Spring; Charisse E Burden-Stelly POSC 276 Imagination in Politics The course explores the bipolarity of imagination, the fact that imagination can be both a source of freedom and domination in contemporary politics. The main focus of the course is the capacity literature and film have to either increase the autonomous capacity of individuals to engage culture and language in a creative and interactive manner in the construction of their identities, or in a direction that increases their fascination with images and myths and, consequently, the escapist desire to pull these out of the living dialogue with others. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 278 Memory and Politics The ways in which human societies narrate their past can powerfully impact their politics. It can enhance their capacity to be just or it can undermine it. The fashion in which history is told can help societies avoid conflict and it can heal the lingering memory of previous wars. At the same time, historical narratives can escalate violence and deepen socio-cultural and political divisions, inequality, and oppression. In this course we will learn about the various connections between history and politics by reading the works of G. W. F. <ref type="bibr">Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, Hannah Arendt, and Paul Ricoeur. 6 credits;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b423">HI, IS;</ref><ref type="bibr">Not offered 2019-20</ref> POSC 280 Feminist Security Studies Feminist security studies question and challenge traditional approaches to international relations and security, highlighting the myriad ways that state security practices can actually increase insecurity for many people. How and why does this security paradox exist and how do we escape it? In this class, we will explore the theoretical and analytical contributions of feminist security scholars and use these lessons to analyze a variety of policies, issues, and conflicts. The cases that we will cover include the UN resolution on women, peace, and security, Sweden's feminist foreign policy, violence against women, and conflicts in Syria, Uganda, and Yemen. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IS; Fall; Summer N Forester POSC 281 Global Society: An Approach to World Politics One of the features of the Post-Cold War world has been the increased salience of issues such as terrorism, the environment, the influence of transnational corporations, the world-wide AIDS epidemic, the drug trade, and the crisis of refugees. The proliferation of such problems illustrates the limitations of state-centric international relations theory. This course examines new theoretical approaches to global politics that seek to understand how non-state actors and structures influence emerging patterns of global governance. We will debate as a class the extent to which a global society approach to world politics helps us to understand these transnational problems. 6 credits; SI, IS, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 282 Terrorism and Counterterrorism This course focuses on the historic and modern use of violence or the threat of violence by non-state actors to secure political outcomes. We will review the strategy and tactics of various terror groups, use case studies to understand the logic of terrorism, assess why some groups succeed while others fail, and study terrorist organizations' efforts at recruitment and indoctrination. These topics will be addressed from theoretical and practical perspectives, with input from expert guest speakers. Finally, we will assess counterterrorism measures, including the moral, ethical, legal, and practical approaches to creating security in the modern world. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 283 Separatist Movements This course explores the emergence and resolution of separatist movements around the world. While separatist movements are often associated with the violent dissolution of states, not all separatist movements result in violence and not all separatist movements seek independence. We will investigate the conditions under which separatist pressures are most likely to develop and when such pressures result in actual separation. We will contrast the tactics of movements, from peaceful approaches in places like contemporary Quebec or Scotland, to peaceful outcomes like the "velvet divorce" of Czechoslovakia, to violent insurrections in places like the Philippines, Spain, and Northern Ireland. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 284 War and Peace in Northern Ireland This class examines the decades-long conflict in Northern Ireland between Catholics and Protestants known as "The Troubles." We will investigate the causes of violence in this region and explore the different phases of the conflict, including initial mobilization of peaceful protestors, radicalization into violent resistance, and de-escalation. We will also consider the international dimensions of the conflict and how groups forged transnational ties with diaspora groups and separatist movements around the world. Finally, we will explore the consequences of this conflict on present-day Northern Ireland's politics and identify lessons from the peace process for other societies in conflict. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 285 The U.S. Intelligence Community This course covers the U.S. Intelligence Community, how intelligence supports national security policy development, and how intelligence is applied to execute strategy in pursuit of policy objectives (specifically, implementation of national security and foreign policy initiatives). Studying the structure, processes, procedures, oversight, and capabilities of the Intelligence Community will enhance understanding of how intelligence supported or failed policymakers in national security decision-making, including the areas of deterrence, conventional war, counterinsurgency, and counterterrorism. The course concludes with the study of asymmetric warfare in our modern age and how intelligence might be used to better understand the changing dynamics of future global conflict. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 294 Central and Eastern European Politics Program: Perceptions of Otherness in Modern Eastern and Central Europe Is nationalism fundamentally flawed in its inclusionary capacity? Can the same power of imagination to bring strangers together, which made nation-building possible, be deployed for inventing post-national forms of solidarity? The course will explore representations of strangers and foreigners in Central and Eastern Europe, throughout the nineteenth and twentieth century, with a special focus on Roma and Jews. The aim will be to understand how these representations will work to legitimize different forms of exclusionary politics. An important part of the course will explore the role that exiled and displaced people can play in reimagining identities on a cosmopolitan level. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 295 Central and Eastern European Politics Program: Nation-Building in Central and Eastern Europe between Politics and Art The state and its cultural politics played a pivotal role in building the Romanian nation. The first part of the course will analyze the difficulties of nation-building in modern Romania, with a special emphasis on the incapacity of Romanian liberalism to prevent the rise of extreme right wing politics. The second part will explore different images of Romanian national identity that art provided both during the communist regime and in the post-1989 decades, also in a comparative perspective with Hungary, Bulgaria, and Serbia. The course will include visits to galleries, architectural sites and neighborhoods in Bucharest and its surroundings. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 296 Central and Eastern European Politics Program: Challenges to the Nation-State in Eastern and Central Europe: Immigrants and Minorities How do democracies react when confronted with massive bodies of immigrants? Do the problems that Eastern and Central European countries face in dealing with immigrants reflect deeper challenges to their capacity of thinking of the nation along inclusionary lines? We will explore the legal and political issues that EU countries and their societies, particularly, in Eastern and Central Europe, face when confronted with a migration crisis. Then we will look at Roma's history of exploitation and injustice in Eastern and Central Europe. The course will include visits with community groups and NGOs, as well as encounters with minority rights activists. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 300 Political Research Experience This course is a collaborative, hands-on, research seminar related to a faculty member's research program. Students should expect to meet regularly with the faculty supervisor and, depending on the stage or type of research, collect and analyze data, read and interpret primary literature and engage its criticism, submit written material and prepare presentation content. To enroll, students must complete the application form (available on line or in the department office) in consultation with the professor. Prerequisite: Instructor Permission. 1-6 credit; S/CR/NC; NE; Fall; Dev Gupta POSC 302 Subordinated Politics and Intergroup Relations* How do social and political groups interact? How do we understand these interactions in relation to power? This course will introduce the basic approaches and debates in the study of prejudice, racial attitudes, and intergroup relations. We will focus on three main questions. First, how do we understand and study prejudice and racism as they relate to U.S. politics? Second, how do group identities, stereotyping, and other factors help us understand the legitimation of discrimination, group hierarchy, and social domination? Third, what are the political and social challenges associated with reducing prejudice? 6 credits; SI, IDS; Spring; Christina E Farhart POSC 303 Political Communication: Political Advertising in Elections and Public Policy* Crosslisted with POSC 203. How does political advertising influence the electorate? How does political advertising influence our understanding of policy proposals? Election ads along with the 6-second "sound bite" are now among the major forms of political communication in modern democracies. Add to these forms a battery of visual "arguments" seen in news media, film, and paid ads aimed at persuading us to adopt various policy positions. We will study how ads are created and "work" from the standpoint of political psychology and film analysis. Our policy focus for 2016 will be on climate change and the 2016 general election. Students enrolled in the 303 version will conduct more extensive analysis of data for their seminar papers. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 305 News Media and Democratic Electoral Processes* How have news media affected democratic elections in the U.S., UK, and EU? Case studies show traditional and new media-from citizen journalism to bots-shaping views of candidates and issues-and democracy itself. Using recent elections worldwide as a base, we will investigate traditional media as an institution in a challenging environment of new media sources and charges of "fake news." Coursework includes learning about research design through original data collection, data analysis, and visual representation of data. POSC 223 is recommended as a way to learn quantitative and qualitative methods of social science research. Research paper required. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IDS; Fall; Barbara Allen POSC 307 Go Our Own Way: Autonomy in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement* "Every civil rights bill was passed for white people, not black people. I am a human being. I know … I have right(s). White people didn't know that. … so [they] had to … to tell that white man, 'he's a human being, don't stop him.' That bill was for the white man…. I knew [my rights] all the time." Stokely Carmichael spoke for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee viewpoint in 1966. The Black Panther Party enacted basic civic responsibilities in their programs. Ella Baker spoke of autonomy in community. This seminar brings voices across generations speaking to current affairs. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 313 Legal Issues in Higher Education This seminar will explore pressing legal and policy issues facing American colleges and universities. The course will address the ways core academic values (e.g., academic freedom; the creation and maintenance of a community based on shared values) fit or conflict with legal rules and political dynamics that operate beyond the academy. Likely topics include how college admissions are shaped by legal principles, with particular emphasis on debates over affirmative action; on-campus speech; faculty tenure; intellectual property; student rights and student discipline (including discipline for sexual assault); and college and university relations with the outside world. 3 credits; SI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 314 Constitutional Convention 2020 Students in this 5-week course will organize a mock constitutional convention to consider proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Proposed amendments will be developed by students in other courses at Carleton, St. Olaf, and other participating institutions. Students in this course will serve as the program committee for a two-day convention, to be held at the end of the course. Students will review and select proposals to be debated, as well as recruit speakers and the audience. Each proposal will be voted on, resulting in a set of recommended proposals as the chief outcome of the course. Similar conventions may be conducted at other participating Latin America, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, the post-Soviet countries, and East and Southeast Asia. Topics covered in the course include vote-buying and other forms of electoral fraud, the influence of money in campaigns, kickback schemes and governance, crony capitalism, clientelism and political machines, and varieties of accountability systems and institutional reform. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 328 Foreign Policy Analysis* Foreign policy analysis is a distinct sub-field within international relations that focuses on explaining the actions and choices of actors in world politics. After a review of the historical development of the sub-field, we will explore approaches to foreign policy that emphasize the empirical testing of hypotheses that explain how policies and choices are formulated and implemented. The psychological sources of foreign policy decisions (including leaders' beliefs and personalities and the effect of decision-making groups) are a central theme. Completion of a lower level IR course and the stats/methods sequence is recommended. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 330 The Complexity of Politics* Theories of complexity and emergence relate to how large-scale collective properties and characteristics of a system can arise from the behavior and attributes of component parts. This course explores the relevance of these concepts, studied mainly in physics and biology, for the social sciences. Students will explore agent-based modeling to discover emergent properties of social systems through computer simulations they create using NetLogo software. Reading and seminar discussion topics include conflict and cooperation, electoral competition, transmission of culture and social networks. Completion of the stats/methods sequence is highly recommended. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 331 Cooperation and Conflict* Why do countries go to war? What conditions promote a lasting peace? These may well be the two most important and enduring questions in international politics. The course combines an exploration of various theoretical approaches to war and peace-including rational, psychological and structural models-with an empirical analysis of the onset, escalation, and resolution of conflict. We investigate changing patterns in the frequency of global violence and identify where it occurs more (and less) often and assess whether there is an overall trend toward a more peaceful world. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Winter; Greg Marfleet POSC 333 Global Social Changes and Sustainability* This course is about the relationship between social changes and ecological changes to understand and to be able to advance analytical concepts, research methods, and theories of society-nature interactions. How do livelihoods of individuals and groups change over time and how do the changes affect ecological sustainability? What are the roles of human institutions in ecological sustainability? What are the roles of ecosystem dynamics in institutional sustainability? Students will learn fundamental theories and concepts that explain linkages between social change and environmental changes and gain methods and skills to measure social changes qualitatively and quantitatively. 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 334 Global Public Health* This seminar covers a variety of public health issues in advanced capitalist and developing countries, including communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases and scourges such as malaria, dengue, and AIDS, the effectiveness of foreign aid, and the challenges of reforming health care systems. Emphasis will be on how these issues interact with patterns of economic and social development and the capacity of states and international regimes. Students will develop a perspective on public policy using materials from diverse fields such as political science, epidemiology, history, economics, and sociology. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 336 Global Populist Politics* Are populist politicians scoundrels or saviors? Regardless of the answer, populism is undeniably a growing force in politics around the world: in democracies as well as autocracies, rich and poor countries, and involving different ideologies. How can we understand this diversity? In this class, we will explore populism using a variety of comparative frameworks: temporal (situating the current crop of populism in historical context), ideological (comparing populisms of the left versus the right), as well as geographic. We will try to understand the hallmarks of populism, when and why it emerges, and its impact on political institutions and society. 6 credits; SI, IS; Fall; Dev Gupta POSC 337 Political Economy of Happiness* This course explores the political determinants of happiness in the United States and around the world. What makes citizens happier in one country compared to another? When might political institutions be most successful at producing happiness among people? What is the relationship between economic inequality, development, redistribution and happiness? The course starts by examining how happiness is conceptualized and measured in public opinion data, before exploring the political economy of happiness globally. 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 338 Politics of Inequality and Poverty* The unequal distribution of income and assets is arguably the most important issue in many political systems around the world, and debates over the appropriate role of government in fighting inequality form a primary dimension of political competition. In this course, we will explore the politics surrounding economic inequality around the world. We will discuss how inequality influences political participation in democracies and dictatorships, shapes prospects for democratic transition/consolidation, and affects economic growth and social well-being. We will also examine when and how political institutions can mitigate negative aspects of inequality. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 345 Politics of Dictatorship* With over half of the world's population living in non-democracies, understanding the nature of authoritarian regimes is a critical component of comparative political science. We will examine the variety of authoritarian regimes around the world, the nature of statesociety relations in different authoritarian regimes, as well as the strategies employed by dictators to maintain stability and control. We will supplement the more general theories of authoritarian rule with detailed case studies of particular regimes. 6 credits; SI, IS; Winter; Kent Freeze POSC 348 Strangers, Foreigners and Exiles* The course explores the role that strangers play in human life, the challenges that foreigners create for democratic politics, the promises they bring to it, as well as the role of exiles in improving the cultural capacity of societies to live with difference. We will read texts by Arendt, Kafka, Derrida, Sophocles, Said, Joseph Conrad, Tzvetan Todorov, and Julia Kristeva. Special attention will be given to the plight of Roma in Europe, as a typical case of strangers that are still perceived nowadays as a menace to the modern sedentary civilization. 6 credits; SI, IS; Spring; Mihaela Czobor-Lupp POSC 349 Justice Among Nations Crosslisted with POSC 259. The purpose of this course is to bring to bear great works of political philosophy on the foundational questions of international politics. Our primary text will be Thucydides gripping History of The Peloponnesian War. Thucydides was perhaps the greatest thinker about international relations that the world has seen. He was also a political philosopher--and psychologist--of the first rank. His book teaches much not only about politics but about human nature. Students enrolled in the 349 version will complete a more detailed and longer seminar paper that may be the basis for comps in a subsequent term. 6 credits; SI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 350 Ancient Political Philosophy: Plato's Republic* Cross-listed with Political Science 250. In this course we will examine ancient political philosophy through the intensive study of Plato's Republic, perhaps the greatest work of political philosophy ever written. What is morality? Why should a person behave morally? Wouldn't it be more satisfying to be a tyrant? What is the best way of life? What would a perfect society look like? What would be its customs and institutions, and who would rule? What would it demand of us, and would that price be worth paying? These are some of the politically (and personally) vital questions addressed by the book. 6 credits; HI; Fall; Laurence D Cooper POSC 350 Political Philosophy and the Book of Genesis* Cross-listed with Political Science 270. Much of the moral and political architecture of the post-modern, secular world traces back to pre-modern, religious scriptures--especially Genesis, the first book of the Bible. For this reason alone Genesis deserves attention. But there are even stronger reasons: With its accounts of creation, humanity's relation to nature and the divine, human aspiration and failure, the origins of community, and the good life for both individuals and societies, Genesis offers enormous riches even for those who approach it from an "external" philosophic standpoint (as we will in this class) rather than an "internal" religious one. Readings include Genesis and commentary. POSC 352 Political Theory of Alexis de Tocqueville* This course will be devoted to close study of Tocqueville's Democracy in America, which has plausibly been described as the best book ever written about democracy and the best book every written about America. Tocqueville uncovers the myriad ways in which equality, including especially the passion for equality, determines the character and the possibilities of modern humanity. Tocqueville thereby provides a political education that is also an education toward self-knowledge. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 354 Freedom, Excellence, Happiness: Aristotle's Ethics* Cross-listed with POSC 254. What does it mean to be morally excellent? To be politically excellent? To be intellectually and spiritually excellent? Are these things mutually compatible? Do they lie within the reach of everyone? And what is the relation between excellence and pleasure? Between excellence and happiness? Aristotle addresses these questions in intricate and illuminating detail in the Nicomachean Ethics, which we will study in this course. The Ethics is more accessible than some of Aristotle's other works. But it is also a multifaceted and multi-layered book, and one that reveals more to those who study it with care. Seminar paper required. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 355 Identity, Culture and Rights* This course will look at the contemporary debate in multiculturalism in the context of a variety of liberal philosophical traditions, including contractarians, libertarians, and Utilitarians. These views of the relationship of individual to community will be compared to those of the communitarian and egalitarian traditions. Research papers may use a number of feminist theory frameworks and methods. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 357 Politics and Ambition* Cross-listed with POSC 258. Is personal ambition a threat to peace and the public good or is it a prod to nobility and heroism? Does it exemplify the opposition between self and society or does it represent their intersection and mutual support-or both? And what is the nature of political ambition, especially the ambition to rule: what does the would-be ruler really want? We will take up these and related questions by studying several classic works of philosophy and literature. Readings will likely include works by Plato, Xenophon, and Shakespeare as well as American founders, statesmen, and moral leaders. Seminar paper required. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 358 Comparative Social Movements* This course will examine the role that social movements play in political life. The first part of the course will critically review the major theories that have been developed to explain how social movements form, operate and seek to influence politics at both the domestic and international levels. In the second part of the course, these theoretical approaches will be used to explore a number of case studies involving social movements that span several different issue areas and political regions. Potential case studies include the transnational environmental movement, religious movements in Latin America and the recent growth of far right activism in northern Europe. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 359 Cosmopolitanism* Stoic philosophers saw themselves as citizens of the world (cosmopolitans). In the eighteenth century, Kant thought that the increasingly global nature of the world requires international political institutions to guarantee peace and human rights. After the Cold War cosmopolitanism was back in fashion. Even the favorite drink of the girls on TV's Sex and the City was called Cosmopolitan. This course explores different meanings of cosmopolitanism: moral, political, and cultural. The intention is to show that cosmopolitanism is a complex reality that requires political institutions, as well as a new ethics to be cultivated through a particular engagement of culture. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 361 Approaches to Development* The meaning of "development" has been contested across multiple disciplines. The development and continual existence of past civilizations has been at the core of the discourse among those who study factors leading to the rise and fall of civilizations. Can we reconcile the meaning of development in economic terms with cultural, ecological, political, religious, social and spiritual terms? How can we measure it quantitatively? What and how do the UNDP Human Development Indexes and the World Development Reports measure? What are the exemplary cases that illustrate development? How do individual choices and patterns of livelihood activities link to development trends? 6 credits; SI, WR2, QRE, IS; Fall; Tun Myint POSC 366 Urban Political Economy* City revenue is increasingly dependent on tourism. Cities manufacture identity and entertainment, whether we think of Las Vegas or Jerusalem, Berlin or Bilbao, the ethnoscapes of Copenhagen or the red light district of Amsterdam. As cities compete in the global economy to become playgrounds for a transnational tourist class, what is the role of urban residents? Who governs? Who benefits? A research paper will be required. Students who have taken POSC 266 remain welcome to take POSC 366. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 POSC 371 Modern Political Philosophy: Liberalism and Its Critics* Cross-listed with POSC 251. Liberalism is the dominant political philosophy of our time. Living in a liberal polity, each of us has been shaped by liberalism. But is liberalism the best political order? Do we even know what liberalism is? What are the strongest arguments in its favor, and what are the deepest criticisms we might level against it?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychology</head><p>Psychology at Carleton provides a systematic approach to the study of behavior and experience. It examines processes of physiological functioning, human and animal learning, human and animal cognition, cognitive and social development, personality, social influence, and psychopathology, and treats particular topics (e.g., prejudice, real-life decision making, and psychopharmacology) that are representative of the diversity and complexity of psychology. It also strongly emphasizes the development of analytic and expressive skills that are the basis of investigation, evaluation, and communication in the field.</p><p>Psychology 110 is the basic introductory course in the department and is a prerequisite for all other courses in psychology. Only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., an AP score of 4 or 5 or a higher level IB score of 6 or 7) will a student be allowed to enroll in an upper-level psychology course without having taken Psychology 110.</p><p>Majors are advised to plan their schedules carefully in light of the prerequisites listed for upperlevel courses in each area and the schedule of course offerings. A major in psychology prepares students for graduate study toward an advanced research degree in psychology and for a variety of professional programs and careers in psychological and social service areas. It also serves those intending to pursue careers in law, medicine, education, and business. • Four core courses (courses cannot count in two groups):  <ref type="bibr">(3 credits)</ref> Particular courses in biology, education, linguistics, mathematics and computer science, economics, philosophy, and sociology-anthropology may also be recommended, depending on an individual's interests and plans.</p></div>

They will develop a deeper understanding of how scholars ask and answer questions, refine their writing and critical thinking skills, and learn about relevant and interesting topics in Psychology. We will review scientific studies regarding the psychology of creativity, and students will write up a review paper that integrates scientific studies about a topic that they are most interested in that relates to creativity. The papers will be compiled for publication in "The Journal of the Creative Brain" (a fictional Journal). Students will act as editors and reviewers to evaluate the content of the review articles and provide feedback. 6 credits; AI, WR1; Fall; Gisel Flores-Montoya PSYC 110 Principles of Psychology This course surveys major topics in psychology. We consider the approaches different psychologists take to describe and explain behavior. We will consider a broad range of topics, including how animals learn and remember contexts and behaviors, how personality develops and influences functioning, how the nervous system is structured and how it supports mental events, how knowledge of the nervous system may inform an understanding of conditions such as schizophrenia, how people acquire, remember and process information, how psychopathology is diagnosed, explained, and treated, how infants and children develop, and how people behave in groups and think about their social environment. PSYC 218 Hormones, Brain, and Behavior In this course, students will learn about how hormones act in the brain and the body to affect behaviors. This course draws heavily on biological psychology and students learn about techniques in neuroendocrinology to better understand cellular function, neural circuits, and the display of behaviors. Team-based learning and case studies are used to explore the endocrine system, sexual differentiation, the stress response, thirst and digestion, and reproductive behaviors. The experimental evidence upon which our understanding of hormones, brain, and behavior is constructed is emphasized. Prerequisite: Psychology 110. Psychology 216 recommended or permission of the instructor. 6 credits; NE, WR2, QRE; Spring; Sarah H Meerts PSYC 220 Sensation and Perception We will address the question of how humans acquire information from the world to support action, learning, belief, choice, and the host of additional mental states that comprise the subject matter of psychology. In other words "How do we get the outside inside?" We will initially consider peripheral anatomical structures (e.g. the eye) and proceed through intermediate levels of sensory coding and transmission to cover the brain regions associated with each of the major senses. Readings will include primary sources and a text. In addition to exams and papers, students will conduct an investigation into an area of personal interest. A grade of C-or better must be earned in Psychology of Language This course will cover a range of aspects of language use. We will spend time discussing language production and comprehension, discourse processing, the relationship between language and thought, and language acquisition.

This course explores the psychological science of human memory. We will examine different types of memory, how we encode new memories and retrieve old ones, how to ensure a memory is never forgotten, and how to implant a false memory in someone else. In doing so we will look at both old and new research, and discuss how memory research can be applied to some real world environments, such as courtrooms and classrooms. By the end of the course you will be familiar with the major issues in the field of memory research and be able to evaluate the quality of the studies used as evidence in these debates.

Psychology 252 is recommended. 6 credits; SI; Fall; Steven F Kozberg PSYC 358 Cross-Cultural Psychology Seminar in Prague: Psychopathology In the West mental illness has traditionally been approached with a biomedical model that views it as independent of culture. By contrast the "relativist" position assumes that, to a large extent, human behaviors are culturally determined and that the etiology and manifestation of mental disorders are affected by society and culture. This course will address such issues as well as their implications for assessment and treatment through an examination of several Western and non-Western societies, with a special emphasis on Czech society. There will be several guest lectures by Czech psychology professors as well as excursions within Prague to psychiatric hospitals and clinics, where students will meet with Czech clinicians and patients. Prerequisite: Acceptance in Cross-Cultural Studies in Praque program. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 PSYC 362 Psychology of Spoken Words This course explores the cognitive and perceptual processes that allow humans to understand and produce spoken words. We will review major findings on word perception and production, and then focus on specific topics including the perception of accents in speech, language disorders, the links between music and speech, the connection between sounds and meaning, the influence of gesturing on word production, slips of the tongue, bilingualism, tip-of-tonguestates (being temporarily unable to recall a word), and other related issues. Prerequisite: Psychology 220, Psychology 232/Cognitive Science 232, Psychology 234, Psychology 238, Computer Science 322, any 200 level linguistics course, or permission of the instructor. 6 credits; NE; Not offered 2019-20 PSYC 365 Science and Pseudoscience in Psychology In this seminar we will explore the differences between scientific and pseudoscientific approaches to the study of human behavior. Common characteristics of pseudoscientific approaches as well as tools for critically evaluating claims to knowledge will be identified. Topics covered will include controversial assessment techniques (astrology, hypnosis), treatments for psychological conditions (homeopathy, facilitated communication), treatments for medical conditions (psychic surgery, faith healing), and paranormal phenomena (extrasensory perception, UFO abductions). Students will be encouraged to maintain a healthy degree of skepticism toward controversial claims and utilize a high standard of evidence before accepting them. Prerequisite: Psychology 110 or consent of the instructor. 6 credits; SI; Spring; Ken Abrams PSYC 366 Cognitive Neuroscience It should be obvious that every process that goes on in the mind has physiological underpinnings. But, whether we can unlock the secrets of learning, memory, perception, language, decision-making, emotional responding, empathy, morality, social thinking, deception, and manipulation as they are supported by neurons and neural connections is a longstanding and elusive problem in psychology. Contemporary primary source articles are mostly used for this discussion-driven course, but a brief textbook/manual on brain processing is also required. The student should leave the class with a working understanding of brain processes and of contemporary theories of brain processes that may support many mental processes in humans. Prerequisite: Psychology 110 or Biology 125 or Psychology 216 or Neuroscience 127 or permission of the instructor. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 PSYC 367 Neuropsychology of Aging With the aging population comes a variety of challenges, including those to cognitive health and decline. Neurodegenerative diseases create various forms of dementia and cause unique problems beyond those that are an outcome of healthy aging. The disabling effects of aging and dementia extend beyond the person to family, friends and wider community. The need to understand and extend knowledge of both healthy aging and the pathological changes that occur with neurodegenerative diseases with aging is of great importance. By understanding how the brain is impacted by age, dementia, and other clinical syndromes, both management of the cognitive issues and advances in treatments to improve mental functioning can be made. This course takes a neuropsychological approach to study healthy aging and neurodegenerative disease. In this seminar, lectures and discussions explore the cognitive, behavioral, and molecular aspects of healthy aging and neurodegenerative disease processes in humans. Cognitive topics include working memory, long term memory, attention, familiarity and recollection, emotion, and social factors that interact with aging. The physiological and cognitive outcomes of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and various types of dementia are compared with the physiology and cognitive decline evident in healthy aging. Students will read primary articles on these topics, and propose a project based on course discussion and interactions with people at senior centers and convalescent centers in Northfield. Prerequisite: Neuroscience 127 or Psychology 216 and Psychology 110 or instructor permission. 6 credits; SI; Fall; Julie J Neiworth PSYC 368 Hot Off the Bench: Advanced Study of Neuroscience Topics This seminar will use research to be presented at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting as the basis for discussions. We will read the most recent publications relating to neural control of behavior to prepare to attend poster sessions, symposia, and talks at the conference. Each topic will be considered in light of the role of the brain and the interpretation of behavior to better understand the development of research questions and the use of evidence to expand scientific knowledge. Travel to the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in Washington, DC is a required part of the course; funding for the trip is available. Prerequisite: Psychology 216 and 217 and Neuroscience Minor or instructor permission. 6 credits; NE; Not offered 2019-20 PSYC 370 Behavioral Neuroimmunology The immune system directly influences the central nervous system and behavior during both health and disease. The course will have an emphasis on animal behavior (e.g. memory and sociability assays) and techniques in neuroimmunology that range from genetic engineering (e.g. CRISPR and DREADD) to immune cell function, detection of surface receptors, and protein expression (e.g. flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, immune cell migration assays, ELISA, and western blot.) The topics that will be covered range from how cytokines influence behavior to effects of gut microbiota in brain function and behavior. This course will primarily use empirical research that will help you develop a deeper understanding of molecular techniques, cell biology, and develop strong analytical skills of biological findings in immunology and its connection with animal behavior. Prerequisite: Psychology 216 recommended or instructor permission. 6 credits; WR2, QRE, NE; Not offered 2019-20 PSYC 371 Evolutionary and Developmental Trends in Cognition Recent findings have brought to light some very compelling examples of humanlike cognition in nonhuman primates: tool use and tool making, family bonding, complex social behaviors such as cooperation, altruism, communication, and emotion. The study of infant cognition has also revealed more complex cognitive abilities in developing humans. Each of these topics is considered in the context of the cognitive workings of the primate mind, with emphases on apes (gorilla, chimpanzee), monkeys (particularly cebus and rhesus varieties) and human children. The goal is to evaluate the uniqueness of primate cognition, both human and nonhuman. Prerequisite: Psychology 110 or Biology 126 or Psychology 216 or instructor permission. 6 credits; SI, QRE; Not offered 2019-20 PSYC 373 Topics in Professional Psychology This seminar will examine topics in professional psychology, including professional standards, assessment, case formulation, evidence-based treatments, interdisciplinary issues, and selected mental disorders. Prerequisite: Psychology 110 or permission of the instructor, Psychology 254 or Psychology 354. 6 credits; SI; Spring; Steven F Kozberg PSYC 374 Applying Cognitive Psychology to Education In this seminar we will we explore how findings from cognitive psychology can be used to improve education. The course will cover three main areas. First we will review research on learning and memory and the effectiveness of different student study strategies, such as highlighting, rereading, and quizzing yourself. Then we will explore some metacognitive aspects of learning--what students know about their own thinking--and how motivation affects performance in school. Finally, we will discuss some current issues in education (do learning styles exist? are standardized tests good for education?) and examine research exploring those issues. Students will be asked to evaluate basic research and consider how such research can be applied to educational contexts. Prerequisite: Psychology 110 required and a course in cognitive psychology is recommended. 6 credits; NE; Not offered 2019-20 PSYC 375 Language and Deception In this course we will examine deception and persuasion in language use. We will take up three main issues. The first is what it means to deceive and how people deceive others through language. What methods do they use, and how do these methods work? The second issue is why people deceive. What purposes do their deceptions serve in court, in advertising, in bureaucracies, in business transactions, and in everyday face-to-face conversation? The third issue is the ethics of deception. Is it legitimate to deceive others, and if so, when and why?

Thus, an analysis of gender can inform most aspects of social psychology. In this course, we will systematically review and analyze psychological theory and empirical research related to gender roles, gender stereotypes, and power differentials in society. We will discuss how and why social norms are related to gender and influence the experiences of men and women. Topics will include historical and theoretical perspectives on gender, differentiation of sex versus gender, gender similarities and differences, masculinity, sexism, feminism, body image, and media influence. We will also discuss gender issues important to contemporary society such as sexual orientation, transgender identities, and intersectionality approaches.

This class takes an exciting tour through selected themes and puzzles related to the fascinating and diverse expressions of religion throughout the world. From politics and pop culture, to religious philosophies and spiritual practices, to rituals, scriptures, gender, religious authority, and more, students will explore how these issues emerge in a variety of religions, places, and historical moments in the U.S. and across the globe. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Fall, Winter, Spring; Sonja G Anderson, Asuka Sango, Kristin C Bloomer RELG 120 Introduction to Judaism This course provides an overview of Judaism as a religion, exploring its history, modes of expression, and characteristic polarities as they have emerged in various times and places. The contours of classical Jewish life and thought are explored, as well as the crises, challenges, and choices confronting Jews and Judaism today. Our uniting theme will be the question of defining Jewishness: who gets to claim an identity as a Jew, and who has (and has had) the authority to decide who is and is not Jewish? 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 121 Introduction to Christianity This course will trace the history of Christianity from its origins in the villages of Palestine, to its emergence as the official religion of the Roman Empire, and through its evolution and expansion as the world's largest religion. The course will focus on events, persons, and ideas that have had the greatest impact on the history of Christianity, and examine how this tradition has evolved in different ways in response to different needs, cultures, and tensions--political and otherwise--around the world. This is an introductory course. No familiarity with the Bible, Christianity, or the academic study of religion is presupposed. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Spring; Sonja G Anderson RELG 122 Introduction to Islam This course provides a general introduction to Islam, as a textual and lived tradition. Students will read from the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad, engaging them both as historical resources and as dynamic and contested objects that have informed Muslim life in diverse ways throughout the centuries. Through following a thread from scripture, through the interpretive sciences (chiefly law and theology), and into an analysis of Muslim life in the contemporary world, students will explore answers Muslim thinkers have given to major questions of our shared existence, with both fidelity to the texts and flexibility to present demands. Though the focus of this course is not on Islam's role in current events, through attaining a solid introduction to the tradition--its sociology, its history, and its modes of reasoning--students will attain the knowledge necessary to begin to engage those events with a critical and informed mind. We also will discuss issues crucial in the study of religion, such as the relation between religion and violence, gender, modernity, nationalism and war. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 153 Introduction to Buddhism This course offers a survey of Buddhism from its inception in India some 2500 years ago to the present. We first address fundamental Buddhist ideas and practices, then their elaboration in the Mahayana and tantric movements, which emerged in the first millennium CE in India. We also consider the diffusion of Buddhism throughout Asia and to the West. Attention will be given to both continuity and diversity within Buddhism--to its commonalities and transformations in specific historical and cultural settings. We also will address philosophical, social, political, and ethical problems that are debated among Buddhists and scholars of Buddhism today. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Spring; Asuka Sango RELG 155 Hinduism: An Introduction Hinduism is the world's third-largest religion (or, as some prefer, "way of life"), with about 1.2 billion followers. It is also one of its oldest, with roots dating back at least 3500 years. "Hinduism," however, is a loosely defined, even contested term, designating the wide variety of beliefs and practices of the majority of the people of South Asia. This survey course introduces students to this great variety, including social structures (such as the caste system), rituals and scriptures, mythologies and epics, philosophies, life practices, politics, poetry, sex, gender, Bollywood, and-lest we forget-some 330 million gods and goddesses. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 161 The Jewish Bible This course explores the text known to scholars as the "Hebrew Bible," to Jews as the "Tanakh," and to Christians as the "Old Testament." Composed, compiled, and redacted over a millennium, the Bible is a remarkably complex document that affords its readers the opportunity to ruminate on questions of divinity and humanity, judgment and redemption, slavery and bondage, history and memory, life and death. Through examining the contents and historical contexts of the Bible's constituent parts, we will gain insight into how ancient and modern writers, readers, and thinkers dealt with these same questions. Requires no previous knowledge and will use sources in translation. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Spring; Daniel M Picus RELG 162 Jesus, the Bible, and Christian Beginnings This course introduces students to the diverse literature and theologies of the New Testament and to the origins and social worlds of early Christianity. Possible topics include: Jesus and his message; Paul and women's spiritual authority; non-canonical gospels (Mary, Thomas, Judas, etc.); relations between Christians and Jews in the first century; and conflict with empire. Attention is given to the interpretation of New Testament texts in their ancient historical setting, and to the various ways contemporary scholars and groups interpret the New Testament as a source for theological reflection. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 210 The Arts of Islam This course focuses on arts in different shapes and forms created by artists and artisans influenced by Islamic thought and culture across different times and places. The goal is to raise questions about the aesthetics, praxis, and politics of art and the possibilities it offers for navigating, negotiating with, and responding to local and global dynamics. We will look at a diverse range of artistic productions, including photographs in the museums of New York, illustrated fourteenthcentury manuscripts of a wine-drinking ceremony in Herat, and graffiti on the streets of Cairo during the Arab spring. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Fall; Ahoo Najafian RELG 211 Race and Religion: Slavery, Colonialism, and their Afterlives This course examines the emergence and entanglement of "race" and "religion" as categories, especially in relation to slavery and colonialism, and with regard to the study of Islam as well as other traditions. By touching on themes in postcolonial theory, psychoanalysis, black liberation theology, and decolonial studies, we will ask questions such as: What is the relation between the invention of the "infidel" and the invention of the "negro"? How did the classification of non-Christians by missionaries help shape the emergence of racial "science"? Is the construction of the "enemy combatant" in our contemporary age of terror informed by the fifteenth century classification of natives as "savages"? 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Winter; Tanzeen R Doha RELG 215 Muslim Misfits: Islam and the Question of Orthodoxy "Islam began strange, and it will return to being strange in the same way as it began. So good tidings to the strange ones!" So goes a famous saying (hadith) attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, placing the virtue of nonconformity to social norms at the very heart of what it means be Muslim. Islam's beginnings as something strange and rebellious within the context of its polytheistic Arabian birthplace, and the virtue of truth over numbers more generally, is seen by many not only as a noble past from which Islam emerged, but its inevitable future as well. This course will examine several non-conformist movements throughout Islamic history. The movements will be discussed for their unique contributions to Islamic theology, practice and social life as well as in regards to what they tell us about the orthodoxies against which they came to rebel, all within the context of submission to a higher power and truth. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 220 Justice and Responsibility How can we understand the demands of justice, the meaning of responsibility, and the relation of both to power and politics? This course draws heavily on Christian theology and modern European philosophy to explore a range of questions about religion, ethics, and society. Is pacifism, resistance, political force, or compromise the most appropriate way to bring justice to human relations? How should the ideals of faith inform questions about political authority, struggles for equality, and tolerance of difference? As we explore these topics, we encounter diverse models of human selfhood, moral obligation, and the role of religion in public life. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 221 Judaism and Gender Questions raised by feminism and gender studies have transformed religious traditions and dramatically changed the way scholars approach the study of religion. In this course, we will consider how reading Jewish tradition with attention to gender opens up new ways of understanding Jewish history, texts, theology and ritual. We will also consider how women and feminism have continually and newly envisioned Jewish life. We will interrogate how Jewish masculinity and femininity have been constituted through, reinforced by, and reclaimed/transformed in Jewish texts, law, prayer, theology, ethics and ritual, in communal as well as domestic contexts. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 222 Politics, Medicine, and the Self in Asian Religion What is a self? What does it mean for a person to be "in" the world? Is a person really a discrete entity, set apart from everything else? We will explore how Asian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism answer these questions and compare those answers to ones offered in the West. By drawing on a wide variety of sources including ancient texts, artworks, and architecture, we will examine how the idea of "self" acts as a lens through which Asian religions conceptualize health and disease, as well as political power and spiritual liberation. Topics will include yoga, medicine, kingship, sacrifice, and sorcery. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 223 Religion, Madness, and Modern Psychology Madness is one of the most socially and intellectually fraught notions today. At the same time, it has long been a vital lens for exploring the human mind. But what exactly is madness, and why do some people give it religious significance? This course traces the relationship between biomedical and spiritual understandings of madness. We will discuss debates about whether madness is a matter of biochemistry, religious experience, or disrupted social norms, as well as different forms of care (including psychopharmacology, psychoanalysis, spiritual care, and moral reform). Finally, we will consider what a cross-cultural perspective might add to these debates. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 224 Religion, Science, and the Modern Imagination This course explores the relationship between religion and science through a focus on imagination. Throughout history, science and medicine have animated the theological imagination (and vice-versa). In many shared cultural contexts, scientific and religious thought rely on shared conceptions of time, space, nature, and the infinite. We will examine images, analogies, and metaphors that both scientific and religious writing use to visualize unseen realities and to depict visible subjects. At the same time, we will use imagination as a lens to consider questions of power through examining assumptions about gender, race, and sex that undergird conceptions of the human self. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 225 Losing My Religion What happens when religion loses its plausibility--whether because of its lack of intellectual or moral credibility, or because it just doesn't make sense of highly ambiguous or deeply troubling or powerfully novel experiences? This course explores how modern Western theologians and philosophers have grappled with the loss of traditional religious beliefs and categories.</p><p>What is the appropriate response to losing one's religion? It turns out that few abandon it altogether, but instead find new ways of naming the religious and the sacred, whether in relation to existential meaning, aesthetic experience, moral hope, prophetic insight, or passionate love. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Fall; Lori K Pearson RELG 227 Liberation Theologies An introduction to liberationist thought, including black theology, Latin American liberation theology, and feminist theology through writings of various contemporary thinkers. Attention will be directed to theories of justice, power, and freedom. We will also examine the social settings out of which these thinkers have emerged, their critiques of "traditional" theologies, and the new vision of Christian life they have developed in recent decades. Previous study of Christianity is recommended but not required. 6 credits; HI, IDS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 228 Martyrdom What does it mean to be a martyr? How have various traditions understood bodily suffering, violence, and integrity in relation to gender, piety, the divine, empire, and conflicts with other groups? We will examine the noble death tradition in Greco-Roman antiquity, various Jewish and Christian martyrdom accounts, the artistic depiction of martyrdom, and the cultural function this material has had from antiquity into modernity. The course will also consider martyrdom in Islam and the rhetoric of persecution in contemporary religious and political events. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 229 Monks and Mystics Is mysticism just a religious word for what are actually natural, neurological processes? Is prayer a dressed-up form of positive thinking? Does mindfulness meditation have medical benefits, and should it be promoted by clinicians? Have monks been practicing a spirituality that science is now vindicating? Are these even the right questions to ask? This course offers a historical, comparative, and theoretical exploration of the techniques of rigorous bodily and mental discipline (asceticism) that humans in different cultural contexts have used as a strategy for union with the divine (mysticism). We will focus on ancient Jewish, Christian, and pagan texts that advocate ascetical practices for mastering the body's passions, disciplining the imagination, and uncovering the deceits of the visible world, and we will trace the reception of these traditions in modern monastic and mystical movements. This course emphasizes close reading, active discussion, and critical reflection on constructions of the ideal body and the ideal mind in antiquity and the present day. Conditions permitting, there will be two field trips to monasteries in Minnesota. Each trip will take place on a weekend and will last for nearly a whole day. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 231 From Luther to Kierkegaard Martin Luther and the Reformation have often been understood as crucial factors in the rise of "modernity." Yet, the Reformation was also a medieval event, and Luther was certainly a product of the late Middle Ages. This class focuses on the theology of the Protestant Reformation, and traces its legacy in the modern world. We read Luther, Calvin, and Anabaptists, exploring debates over politics, church authority, scripture, faith, and salvation. We then trace the appropriation of these ideas by modern thinkers, who draw upon the perceived individualism of the Reformers in their interpretations of religious experience, despair, freedom, and secularization. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Spring; Lori K Pearson RELG 232 Queer Religion Passions, pleasures, ecstasies, and desires bear on religion and sexuality alike, but intersections and tensions between these two domains are complicated. This course wagers that bringing the hotly contested categories "queer" and "religion" together will illuminate the diverse range of bodies, activities, and identities that inhabit both. The course explores religion and sexuality in Modern Western thought, erotic elements in religious texts and art, and novels and narratives of religious belief and practice in queer lives. The course combines concrete cases with theoretical tools that queer and feminist scholars have used to analyze religious and sexual communities, bodies, and identities. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 233 Gender and Power in the Catholic Church How does power flow and concentrate within the Catholic Church? What are the gendered aspects of the structure, history, and theology of Catholicism? Through a combination of readings, discussions, and conversations with living figures, students will develop the ability to critically and empathetically interpret issues of gender, sexuality, and power in the Catholic Church, especially as these issues appear in official Vatican texts. What are the political implications of calling a book "sacred"? How does reading a sacred text, such as the Bible or Qur'an, become a subversive act? How does it become a strategy of domination? Focusing mainly (but not exclusively) on Judaism and Christianity, we will explore these questions through a variety of examples from acts of reading and textuality among rabbis and ancient Mediterranean bishops to politicians and political leaders in the U.S. today. We will consider not only how books are read, but also how they are banned, burned, put on trial, and used to divine the future. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 236 History of Antisemitism This course explores the historical, theological, and social foundations of the phenomena variously known as antisemitism, anti-Judaism, and Judeophobia. Starting in the Roman period, we will trace the discursive arc of Jews as problematic Others throughout history. Forever mindful that antisemitism is not just theoretical, we will also examine its specific manifestations in various historical contexts. We will also pay close attention to antisemtism's relationship to other forms of oppression, bigotry, and discrimination. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Winter; Daniel M Picus RELG 237 Yoga: Religion, History, Practice This class will immerse students in the study of yoga from its first textual representations to its current practice around the world. Transnationally, yoga has been unyoked from religion. But the Sanskrit root yuj means to "add," "join," or "unite"-and in Indian philosophy and practice it was: a method of devotion; a way to "yoke" the body/mind; a means to unite with Ultimate Reality; a form of concentration and meditation. We will concentrate on texts dating back thousands of years, from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras to the Bhagavad Gita-and popular texts of today. Come prepared to wear loose clothing. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Winter; Kristin C Bloomer RELG 238 The Sacred Body The human body has been a focus of reflection throughout history and across traditions. This course will draw particularly on Hawaiian, South Indian, Native American, Euro-American-Christian, and ecological approaches to "the sacred body," from ancient to contemporary times. We will explore numerous ways of cultivating, imagining, representing, disciplining, inhabiting, and adorning the body--in daily life and in religious fields. Theoretically, we will consider the body in relation to gender, subjectivity, personhood, and performativity. We will also enjoy "live" visits ranging from a male Hawaiian hula halau (hula school), to a yoga teacher, and educational excursions in the Arb.  <ref type="bibr">(whaling, fishing, hunting)</ref> and critically examines the conceptual framework of "religion" as it has been applied to the practice of Native American traditions. Service projects will integrate academic learning and student involvement in matters of particular concern to contemporary native communities. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Spring; Michael D McNally RELG 245 Buddha Buddha, "the awakened," is the ideal being--and state of being--in all Buddhist traditions. This course will explore the contours of the Buddha-ideal as revealed in legendary narratives, devotional poems, ritual texts, visionary accounts, philosophical treatises, meditation manuals, and artistic representations. We will draw primarily on classical South Asian and Tibetan sources from the Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantric traditions, but also will consider East Asian (e.g., Pure Land and Zen) conceptions of Buddha and modern reinterpretations of the idea. In addition, we will compare Buddha with the "ideal being" of other traditions, e.g., Brahman, the Dao, and God. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 247 The Islamic Republic: Explorations in Religion and Nationalism This course examines processes of nation-building in the modern Middle East, when competing enterprises were at work to establish an "authentic national character" with a focus on religious identity. We will look at political essays, literary creations, images, and songs to study the diverse ways in which the nation is imagined and critiqued in the region, along with sources on modern political thought. Our primary countries of focus will be Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 249 Religion and American Public Life This course explores the contentious place of religion in American public life. What roles do religious organizations and religious motivations play in the public arenas of electoral politics, policy-making, schools, courts, social service delivery, media, and marketplace? What roles ought they play? In a pluralistic society, how are Americans to balance diverse moral positions with our shared civic life? Engaging the insights of sociologists of religion, legal scholars, ethicists, political theorists, and cultural critics this course will refine the language with which we address such broad questions. Students will apply those insights to focused critical analyses of issues they choose. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS, QRE; Fall; Michael D McNally RELG 254 Zen Buddhism An exploration of the "meditation" school of East Asian Buddhism. We will trace Zen back to its purported origins in India, through its development in China, while focusing on its history in Japan. In addition to its philosophy and practice, we will study its influence on various aspects of Japanese culture--ink painting, calligraphy, Noh theater, tea ceremony, samurai ethics, and martial arts. We will also consider Zen's participation in Japan's nationalism and wartime aggression as well as its place in America, where it has influenced art, literature, and religion for over a century. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 262 Islamic Africa This course rethinks how we understand Africa through attention to the role of Islam and Arabic culture in its past and present. Through religious texts, novels, and critical commentary from the continent, students will get a strong introduction to key trends in Islamic thought and activism, while exploring how attention to them might reshape our perceptions of both its history and present. Equally addressing Africa as geographic space and analytic category, we will examine its features--from the Sahara to the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and beyond--not as barriers, but as sites of complex, creative and often fraught exchange with the broader Muslim world. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 263 Sufism From Rumi to the Whirling Dervishes, Islam's Sufi mystical tradition has sparked the fascination of Western observers for many decades. Its music, its poetry and its esoteric sciences have been embraced as part of global heritage. However, where these colorful practices fit into the Islamic tradition is less well understood. This course will situate the Sufi tradition within Islam's broader framework, tracing its development from an elite philosophical system to a mode of popular practice. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 264 Islam, Politics, and the Secular From the Islamic state to Islamic secularism, from progressivism to jihadism, this course examines a broad range of Islamic political thought and practice. Through exploring thinkers and movements both classical and modern who have shaped contemporary conversation, students will get beneath the headlines and come to a robust understanding of the role of Islam in modern politics across the globe. 6 credits; HI, IS, WR2; Winter; Tanzeen R Doha RELG 265 Religion and Violence: Hindus, Muslims, Jews Whether seen on TV screens or in history books, the horror of war, genocide, terrorism, communal violence, and land disputes often prompts the question: is religion the problem? Conversely, one may point to the peaceful aspirations and non-violent social movements that have been led by religious leaders, and motivated by religious philosophies and impulses and ask: can religion be the solution? This course will explore the complex, and sometimes paradoxical roles religious ideas, practices, communities, and leaders play in both the perpetuation and cessation of violence. Case studies will be drawn from Hindu, Muslim, and Jewish conflicts in recent history. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 268 The Perfumed Life: Islamic Sources of the Self This course will examine the multiple ways the ideal life has been imagined in the Muslim world, from antiquity to modernity, in both Shi'i and Sunni renderings. Through putting biographical/auto-biographical narratives from the Muslim world into conversation with readings about the nature of selfhood and subjectivity that emerge in philosophy, psychology and anthropology, we will examine together what unique resources the Muslim tradition has to explore the self, its capabilities and its limits, and in what ways it participates in dilemmas shared across traditional boundaries. Rather than merely studying concepts of the self as they pass through history, this course will ask students to inhabit authors' worldviews long enough to see how they might grapple with some of the most vexing and intractable issues of our time: from the nature of freedom and submission, to the politics of identity, to the boundaries between humans and their environment. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 270 Philosophy of Religion A study of classic issues in the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology. Possible topics include: the existence and nature of God; the status and nature of religious experience; the problem of evil; the meaning of faith, belief, and truth; definitions of the self and salvation; and the significance of religious pluralism for claims about truth and God. Readings are drawn from the work of modern and contemporary philosophers and theologians. Prerequisites: Previous work in religion or philosophy will be helpful but is not required. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 271 Religion and Critical Theory This course examines the purpose, influence, and erasure of religion in the history and methods of critical theory. We will ask: How is religion examined in modern continental philosophy? What is the relationship between the declaration of the "death of God" and critique as a mode of inquiry? How does messianic time interrupt teleological accounts of history? How does the commodity form come to supplant religion? What is the function of libidinal economy in organizing our pleasures, desires, anxieties, and passions in relation to religion? The course focuses broadly on religion and covers specific topics within Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Spring; Tanzeen R Doha RELG 273 Religious Approaches to Death As the inevitable conclusion of every human existence, our lives are profoundly shaped by death. Consequently, we are all in the process of approaching deathboth our own and that of others. This course examines the stunning variety of ways in which humans have approached death and mortality throughout history and across the globe. We will (1) develop a vocabulary of human mortality and death that will allow us to <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> illuminate the structural and functional continuities/discontinuities present across human approaches to death and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>  RELG 282 Samurai: Ethics of Death and Loyalty This course explores the history of samurai since the emergence of warrior class in medieval times, to the modern developments of samurai ethics as the icon of Japanese national identity. Focusing on its connection with Japanese religion and culture, we will investigate the origins of the purported samurai ideals of loyalty, honor, self-sacrifice, and death. In addition to regular class sessions, there will be a weekly kyudo (Japanese archery) practice on Wednesday evening (7-9 pm), which will enable students to study samurai history in context through gaining first-hand experience in the ritualized practice of kyudo. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Fall; Asuka Sango RELG 287 Many Marys The history of Christianity usually focuses on Jesus: the stories and doctrines that have revolved around him. This course will focus on Mary and the many ways she has contributed to the various lived traditions of Christianity. We will, for example, consider the mother of Jesus (Miriam, as she was first called) as she has figured in literature, art, apparition, and ritual practice around the world. We will also consider Mary Magdalene, her foil, who appears in popular discourse from the Gnostic gospels to The Da Vinci Code. Case studies, texts, images, and film will be our fare. Or are they evidence of a disturbed mind disconnected from reality? This seminar takes a deep dive into the contours of apocalyptic thought, which in its most basic form is about unmasking the deceptions of the given world by revealing the secret workings of the universe. We will begin with the earliest apocalypses, found in ancient Jewish and Christian texts, and move into modern religious and "secular" visions of cosmic collapse. Our approach will be historical and comparative, and we will explore topics ranging from doomsday cults to climate catastrophe, visions of heaven to tours of hell, malevolent angels to meddling UFOs, all the while asking how the apocalyptic imagination creates, as one thinker put it, "another world to live in. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociology/Anthropology Courses</head><p>SOAN 100 Cosmos and Consciousness: Understanding Creation Myths Creation myths are the most profound and significant of all myths because they concern both the underlying patterns of existence and the ultimate meaning of life. How did the universe begin? Who are we? Why are we here? How should we behave and not behave and why? Do cosmogonies reflect the structure of our psyches? Drawing on approaches from anthropology, psychology, religion, and literary studies, this course will examine how different cultures and theoreticians have sought answers to these questions. Developing a comparative perspective, we will examine Biblical, Native American, Middle Eastern, European, Asian, African, and Oceanic origin myths, among others. 6 credits; AI, WR1, IS; Fall; Jerome M Levi SOAN 110 Introduction to Anthropology An introduction to cultural and social anthropology which develops the theoretical rationale of the discipline through the integration of ethnographic accounts with an analysis of major trends in historical and contemporary thought. Examples of analytical problems selected for discussion include the concepts of society and culture, value systems, linguistics, economic, social, political and religious institutions, as well as ethnographic method and the ethical position of anthropology. 6 credits; SI, IS; Fall, Winter, Spring; Jerome M Levi, Constanza Ocampo-Raeder SOAN 111 Introduction to Sociology Sociology is an intellectual discipline, spanning the gap between the sciences and humanities while often (though not always) involving itself in public policy debates, social reform, and political activism. Sociologists study a startling variety of topics using qualitative and quantitative methods. Still, amidst all this diversity, sociology is centered on a set of core historical theorists (Marx/Weber/Durkheim) and research topics (race/class/gender inequality). We will explore these theoretical and empirical foundations by reading and discussing influential texts and select topics in the study of social inequality while relating them to our own experiences and understanding of the social world. SOAN 233 Anthropology of Food Food is the way to a person's heart but perhaps even more interesting, the window into a society's soul. Simply speaking understating a society's foodways is the best way to comprehend the complexity between people, culture and nature. This course explores how anthropologists use food to understand different aspects of human behavior, from food procurement and consumption practices to the politics of nutrition and diets. In doing so we hope to elucidate how food is more than mere sustenance and that often the act of eating is a manifestation of power, resistance, identity, and community. 6 credits; SI, IS; Winter; Constanza Ocampo-Raeder SOAN 239 Social Statistics What does it for something to be statistically significant? This course will ask and answer this question by teaching social science students how to interpret data. This elementary statistics course covers descriptive and inferential statistics up to regression. Whenever possible, we will 'flip' the classroom --using class time for activities and problem sets, and using out of class time for online lectures to introduce new material. We will focus on calculating and applying social statistics, rather than statistical theory. In tandem, efforts to stem the flow of Muslim migrants into the U.S. and Europe, under the logic of combating terrorism, has shaped world events, from Trump's election to Brexit. Through a reading of works in political ethnography and the anthropology of religion, this course will examine the presuppositions that inform discourses on Muslim migration as a threat, as well as the "countering violent extremism" (CVE) programs directed at Muslim communities here in the U.S. We will look at the assumption of an affinity between religion, particularly Islam, and violence that undergird CVE programs; the tensions such programs expose between a liberal secular democracy's commitment to religious freedom and its aspiration to govern and reform religious traditions; and the culture of surveillance and the marginalization of Muslim communities these programs spawn. Prerequisite: Previous courses in anthropology or religion would offer helpful background, but are not required. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IDS; Winter; Ahmed S Ibrahim SOAN 268 African Popular Culture Contrary to popular imaginaries in the Global North that posit African cultural production in the tradition versus modernity debate, contemporary African popular culture is part and parcel of cosmopolitan, transnational, and diasporic exchanges of rhythms, sounds, images, and movement. In this class, we will engage several different forms of popular culture in Africa to ask how social worlds are made and remade in the public sphere. The anthropologists we will read in this class have tackled topics ranging from Egyptian soap operas to Ghanaian rap music to South African rugby to understand how people produce shared forms of meaning-making in their everyday lives. Prerequisite: The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 by taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 <ref type="bibr">SOAN 270</ref> Performance Ethnography What are the choreographies of everyday life? How do we perform cultural notions of race, class, or gender? What do formal performance practices such as athletics, dance, or even courtroom procedures tell us about our larger social worlds? At the intersection of performance studies and anthropology, this class takes on the aesthetic, political, economic, and social dimensions of performance. We will explore both the spectacular and mundane performances that bring to the fore the forms of discipline and control that shape people's lives around the world. Topics range from professional body-building in California to classical ballet in South Africa. Prerequisite: The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses number 200 or above. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 272 Sociological Perspectives on Race and Ethnicity in the United States The purpose of the course is to provide a broad overview of the scholarly literature on race and ethnicity from a sociological perspective, paying particular attention to racial inequality in the U.S. When feasible, we will include research to highlight how social class, citizenship, and to a lesser extent gender and sexuality, intersect with race and ethnicity. Drawing on population-based research and qualitative studies, we will explore several facets of racial identity and racial categorization including (but not limited to): the evolution of racial categories and the U.S. Census, the role of genetic testing and racial/ethnic identity formation, and racial disparities in housing and health, and the movement toward multiracial identification. Prerequisite: The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above. 6 credits; SI, IDS, QRE; Fall; Liz Raleigh SOAN 278 Urban Ethnography and the American Experience American sociology has a rich tradition of focusing the ethnographic eye on the American experience. We will take advantage of this tradition to encounter urban America through the ethnographic lens, expanding our social vision and investigating the nature of race, place, meaning, interaction, and inequality in the U.S. While doing so, we will also explore the unique benefits, challenges, and underlying assumptions of ethnographic research as a distinctive mode of acquiring and communicating social knowledge. As such, this course offers both an immersion in the American experience and an inquiry into the craft of ethnographic writing and research. Prerequisite: The department strongly recommends that 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 288 Diversity, Democracy, Inequality in America Does social difference always lead to conflict and inequality? Can we forge common ground with justice across deep differences? What forms of respect, recognition, reciprocity, and redistribution do democratic citizens owe one another? We will explore these and related questions through a roughly equal mix of democratic theory and empirical studies of race/class/gender/religion diverse grassroots democratic movements in the U.S. We will consider the demands and challenges of "different types of difference" (racial-ethnic, gender-sexuality, class-culture, citizenship, language, and religion) for fighting inequity and pursuing ethical democracy in the United States (and beyond Whereas once the answer was relatively straight forward, the growth of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adoption has changed the field of potential answers. Nowadays babies can come from birthmothers, egg donors, and surrogates. In this course we will examine the meaning and making of families across these different types of formations and contextualize the popularity of ART relative to the decrease in adoption. We will take a sociological approach to analyzing these issues, paying particular attention to questions surrounding women's rights, baby "markets," and the racialization of children placed for adoption in the U. </p></div>

The Old and the New in Contemporary Peru This class focuses on the cultural manifestations of social fragmentation brought to Peru by the uneven development resulting from increasing insertion of both "traditional" and "modern" sectors of society into global capitalism. We will examine a variety of cultural artifacts simultaneously and indelibly marked by traditional-popular culture and by the changing effects of mass-media culture and technology. Classes will be supplemented by visits to relevant sites and events, and lectures by local experts. 6 credits; NE; Not offered 2019-20 SPAN 277 The Poem as Artifact: Art and Work in Contemporary Spanish American Poetry Poetry will be studied as an activity that shares a common ground with other social practices. In particular, we will examine particular moments and cases of Latin American literature in which the poem (the making of poetry and the form of the text) has been conceived in its connection with work, that is, with the process of transformation of materiality into specific "objects," involving a necessary social use of time and space. We will explore this topic starting with Modernismo and, after covering the Vanguardias, will get to some key developments from the 1960s to present. Prerequisite: Spanish 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA; Fall; José Cerna-Bazán SPAN 278 Introduction to the Study of Hispanic Linguistics After an overview of the history of the Spanish language, we examine its sound system, and then concentrate on the morphology and syntax of modern Spanish. The final portion of the course is devoted to an introduction to the linguistic variation of the Hispanic world areas. A main course objective is to improve the students' ability to analyze and thus increase their knowledge of the language. The course consists of lectures, group activities, problem solving assignments, and discussion. Prerequisite: Spanish 205 or equivalent. 3 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 SPAN 321 Murder as a Fine Art: The Detective Novel in Latin America We will study the socio-historical factors that gave rise to the genre as well as some of its classical predecessors (Poe, Chandler). We will then turn our attention to some prominent heirs of this genre in Latin America <ref type="bibr">(Borges, Piglia, Bolaño)</ref> and end by studying why in contemporary Central American literature the genre is enjoying a resurgence (Menjívar, Castellanos Moya and Rey Rosa). We will study the specific traits the genre has adopted in Latin America and how it has become a mirror that often reflects the political and social realities confronting the region, particularly in Central America. Prerequisite <ref type="bibr">: Spanish 205</ref>  We will also study the relationship between "postmodernism," the late-capitalist era and what has been called the "culture of contentment" or "culture of well-being." In addition, we will attempt to understand the interactions that exist between consumer culture, market societies and dominant ideology. To develop this theme we will focus on Spain, but will also continually establish cross-cultural comparisons with other countries. This course addresses many different genres (e.g. fictional essays, documentaries, gag cartoons, graphic novels, comics Revolution. We will study the political and historical background that sustained this revolution for over fifty years. We will read historical, political, philosophical, and cultural texts to understand this process and the fascination that it commanded around the world. We will also examine the different exoduses that this revolution provoked and the exile communities that Cubans constructed in different parts of the world. Prerequisite: Spanish 205 or above. 6 credits; LA, IS; Fall; Jorge Brioso SPAN 358 The Spanish Civil War Considered by many historians the beginning of the II World War, the Spanish Civil war served as the arena where the main ideologies of the twentieth century--Capitalism, Fascism, and Communism--first clashed. The result was not only one of the bloodiest wars in history, but also was of the most idealistic, with 40,000 volunteers from all over the world willing to die in defense of a country they did not even know. This course will explore the meaning of the war through a variety of mediums and disciplines, including literature, history, graphic arts, and films. Prerequisite: Spanish 205 or above. 6 credits; IS, HI; Not offered 2019-20 SPAN 360 Race and Nation in Caribbean Literature We will study the Caribbean as the space, par excellence, of imperial, racial and cultural intersections. With a special emphasis on literary production in the Spanish Caribbean, we will focus on the formation of hegemonic nationalist discourses that often silenced the region's great racial and cultural diversity. We will analyze symbolic and cultural constructions of power rationalized with complex racialized beliefs to sustain the social and political structures in these countries. We will read texts by José Martí, Juan Francisco Manzano, Lydia Cabrera, Nancy Morejón, Nicolás Guillén, and Derek Walcott among others. Prerequisite: Spanish 205 or above. 6 credits; LA, IS; Spring; Yansi Y Pérez SPAN 366 Jorge Luis Borges: Less a Man Than a Vast and Complex Literature Borges once said about Quevedo that he was less a man than a vast and complex literature. This phrase is probably the best definition for Borges as well. We will discuss the many writers encompassed by Borges: the vanguard writer, the poet, the detective short story writer, the fantastic story writer, the essayist. We will also study his many literary masks: H. Bustoc Domecq (the apocryphal writer he created with Bioy Casares) a pseudonym he used to write chronicles and detective stories. We will study his impact on contemporary writers and philosophers such as Foucault, Derrida, Roberto Bolaño, etc. Prerequisite: Spanish 205 or above. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 SPAN 371 Yours Truly: The Body of the Letter This course will focus on letters and their significance as acts of symbolic and material exchange, as objects that bear the mark of the bodily act of writing, and as a staging of the scene of writing itself. We will study different types of letters (love letters, prison letters, literary letters, letters imbedded in other texts, fictional letters, epistolary novels, etc.), but always as the site of production of a modern and gendered self. SPAN 376 Mexico City: The City as Protagonist This seminar will have Mexico City as protagonist, and will examine the construction of one of the largest urban centers of the world through fictional writing, cultural criticism, and visual/aural culture. We will critically engage the fictions of its past, the dystopias of its present, the assemblage of affects and images that give it continuity, but which also codify the ever-changing and contested view of its representation and meaning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theater and Dance</head><p>The Department of Theater and Dance offers courses spanning the major areas of interest in both disciplines. Theater offerings include acting, voice, movement, directing, design-technical, and devised performance as well as courses in literature, history and criticism. In all of our courses our goal is to examine the intersection of critical thought and creative practice. Theater is an ever-changing art, and we strive to expose students to its most recent innovations and the cultural currents that influence them.</p><p>Dance gives students at all levels opportunities for active participation in three basic areas: technique, choreography and analysis, and performance. The broadest goal of these offerings is to increase understanding of the art of dance as a contribution to a liberal arts education and to connect theory and practice through embodied learning. Goals that are more specific are the development of a trained, articulate body; somatic research; increased choreographic skill and performance skills; and the awareness of Dance Studies as a way to understand current issues and arts from a global perspective.</p><p>While there is a regular major in Theater Arts, advanced students may apply to the chair of Dance for a special major in Dance.</p></div>

Using "Authentic Movement," experiential anatomy practices and compositional strategies, students will generate several small compositions and one larger gallery project exploring alternative spaces and the influx of various media (movement, text, images, technology, objects, sites, fabric). This choreography "lab" will help answer the question: How do you make a dance? For both beginning and advanced dance students. 6 credits; ARP; Winter; Judith A Howard DANC 295 Dance Lab DANCE LAB will provide an adventurous space where students of various levels can explore the elements and creation of group pieces: a place to try out ideas in your chosen dance or performance style. We will look at, analyze, and explore methods for moving multiple bodies around the space including trios, quartets, and larger groups. Formal elements of choreography, from traditional to experimental, will be presented as choices for developing one's work. The class will be guided by the interests of its members and work will be developed through discussion, peer and guest artist feedback, and regular meetings with the faculty mentor. All interested choreographers, whether making work for student performance groups or for personal and independent projects, are invited to join a cross section of peers in a supportive environment where you can take time to work on your ideas. Choreography that is developed in class will be eligible for the main stage Spring Dance Concert and inclusion at a professional venue in the Twin Cities. One public works-in-progress showings run by students in the class will be part of the course. Work for the class will include your own rehearsals, some readings, viewings, and a field trip. A student participating in a department production is automatically enrolled in THEA 190, which is allotted one academic credit. Students with significant roles in a production can earn three credits in THEA 199 with permission and must waitlist for the class.</p></div>

The course includes analysis of plays as bases for performance, with a strong emphasis on characterization. 6 credits; ARP; Fall, Spring; Malinda Palani, David E Wiles THEA 115 Principles of Design Explores the process of communicating ideas and experience through visual means. Whether that process begins with a written text, choreographed movement or abstract idea, such elements as color, shape, space, value and balance inevitably come into play in its visual representation. This course teaches these fundamental principles and how to apply them in practice. Principles of Design is an essential course for students interested in any aspect of theater, dance, or performance. 6 credits; ARP; Not offered 2019-20 THEA 185 The Speaking Voice This course seeks to provide a practical understanding of the human voice, its anatomy, functioning and the underlying support mechanisms of body and breath. Using techniques rooted in the work of Berry, Linklater and Rodenburg, the course will explore the development of physical balance and ease and the awareness of the connection between thinking and breathing that will lead to the effortless, powerful and healthy use of the voice in public presentations and in dramatic performance. 6 credits; ARP; Winter, Spring; David E Wiles THEA 190 Carleton Players Production Each term students may participate in one Players production, a hands-on, faculty-supervised process of conceptualization, construction, rehearsal, and performance. Credit is awarded for a predetermined minimum of time on the production, to be arranged with faculty. Productions explore our theatre heritage from Greek drama to new works. Students may participate through audition or through volunteering for production work. 1 credit; S/CR/NC; ARP; Fall, Winter, Spring; David E Wiles THEA 195 Acting Shakespeare Though widely read, Shakespeare's plays were written to be performed. This acting class, designed for students with no prior experience with Shakespeare, will explore approaches to performance with an emphasis on the use of the First Folio. Students will create performances using Shakespeare's approaches to rhetoric, imagery and structure while examining some of the plays' principle themes. Video and audio recordings will be used to develop a critical perspective on acting Shakespeare with an emphasis on the differing demands of live and recorded performance. 6 credits; ARP; Fall; David E Wiles THEA 199 Theater Practicum This course is designed for students who have major responsibilities in Carleton Players productions as Stage Managers, Actors and Designers. Students enrolled in this class will have more responsibility and be expected to commit to more time than the students registered in Theater 190, including additional time for research, design and role preparation. Students in this course will get in-depth learning experiences in the processes most central to the discipline; the creation of performances. Students will waitlist for the course; enrollment in the course will be by instructor's permission depending on the responsibilities students have. Prerequisite: Waitlist only, instructors permission required. 3 credits; S/CR/NC; ARP; Fall, Winter, Spring; David E Wiles THEA 225 Theater History and Theory The theater has often had a vexed and volatile relationship with its cultural moment, and its history is as much one of revolution as of evolution. This course will look across the broad contours of theater history to examine the questions and challenges that consistently recur, including the relationship between representation and the real, between politics and aesthetics, and between the text and the body. Historical eras covered will include ancient Greece, medieval Japan, early modern Europe, and twentieth and twenty-first century Europe and America. Some class time will be spent doing performative explorations of historical texts. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 THEA 226 Avant-garde Theater and Performance "Make it new!" was the rallying cry of the modernists, and ever since, the theater has never ceased its efforts to break both aesthetic and social conventions, boundaries, and taboos. Beginning with some of the important precursors of the twentieth century--Artaud, Brecht, and Meyerhold--this course will explore the history and theory of the contemporary avant-garde, charting the rise of interdisciplinary "performance" and exploring such topics as politics and aesthetics, site-specificity, body art, solo performance, and multimedia. Students will also spend significant time creating their own performance works.  <ref type="formula">(2003)</ref> in the context of larger American themes and cultural preoccupations. The premise of this course is that these plays define the modern American theatre. By studying them we will gain a deeper understanding of American theater and the links that connect it to the larger culture and to some of the transformative events of American history. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 THEA 245 Directing Although many directors begin their artistic careers in some other discipline (usually acting), there is a set of skills particular to the director's art that is essential to creating life on stage. Central is the ability to translate dramatic action and narrative into the dimensions of theatrical time and space: the always-present challenge of "page to stage." In this course, students will learn methods of text analysis strategic to this process as well as the rudiments of using that analysis to generate effective staging and powerful acting. Having mastered the fundamentals, students will then explore and enhance their theatrical imagination, that creative mode unique to the medium of live performance. Class time will be devoted to work on three major projects and almost daily exercises. 6 credits; ARP; Not offered 2019-20 THEA 256 Costume Construction This is a specialized course in costume design and technical theater which will focus on theatrical sewing techniques. In section one basic sewing techniques are introduced to the beginner. In section two more advanced techniques are explored for those with sewing experience. This course will include some participation in the creation of the costumes for one of the departmental productions, either the theater production or the dance production. Section one is for the student with little or no sewing experience. Section two is for the student with sewing experience. 3 credits; ARP; Spring; Mary Ann Kelling THEA 312 Topics in Theater Topics in Theater Acting will encompass a series of specialized courses in acting at the advanced level. Topics offered may include non-Western performance forms, Restoration comedy, Theater of the Absurd, Chekhov, and other period-or genre-based modes. Prerequisite: Theater 110. 6 credits; ARP; Not offered 2019-20 THEA 320 Live Performance and Digital Media Digital media has so infiltrated live performance that it has become almost as common as sets, lights, and costumes. With video technology becoming increasingly powerful and affordable, the screen has become ubiquitous on stage, sometimes eclipsing the performers. Media culture has also become a recurrent subject for critical exploration both on and off stage. In this class, students will learn the software and hardware skills necessary to incorporate digital media into performance projects, as well as the historical and theoretical context necessary to bring a critical approach to their work. Prerequisite: Any course in Theater Arts, Dance, Cinema and Media Studies, Studio Art, creative writing or musical composition. 6 credits; ARP; Spring; Roger K Bechtel THEA 345 Devised Theater and Collective Creation A usual evening in the theater consists of seeing a text--the play--staged by a director and performed by actors. While this is certainly a collaborative endeavor, recent decades have seen a marked increase in "devised theater," a mode intended to upset the traditional hierarchies of theatrical production. In practical terms, this means the abandonment of the extant text in favor of a performance "score"--sometimes textual, often physical--developed improvisationally in rehearsal by the performers. This course will explore the methods and approaches used to work in this collective and highly creative manner, and will culminate in a public performance. We will also discuss the history and cultural politics that inform devised practice • In addition to these 24 credits, students must complete an additional 42 credits from the offerings listed below. Of these 42, no more than 12 credits should be at the 100-level and at least 12 credits should be at the 300-level. Ordinarily, no more than 18 credits may be applied to the major from outside of Carleton.</p><p>Students will plan these courses in consultation with the Program Director or a designated faculty adviser when they declare their major, and review their plan each term.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Women's and Gender Studies Courses</head><p>WGST 110 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies This course is an introduction to the ways in which gender structures our world, and to the ways feminists challenge established intellectual frameworks. However, because gender is not a homogeneous category but is differentiated by class, race, sexualities, ethnicity, and culture, we also consider the ways differences in social location intersect with gender. 6 credits; HI; Winter, Spring; Meera Sehgal, Iveta Jusová WGST 112 Introduction to LGBT/Queer Studies This course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary examination of sexual desires, sexual orientations, and the concept of sexuality generally, with a particular focus on the construction of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender identities. The course will look specifically at how these identities interact with other phenomena such as government, family, and popular culture. In exploring sexual diversity, we will highlight the complexity and variability of sexualities, both across different historical periods, and in relation to identities of race, class, and ethnicity. 6 credits; HI, IDS; Fall; Candace I Moore WGST 130 Politics of Sex The politics of sex are everywhere--in media, law, medicine, and everyday life. To say that sex is political is to imply that sex intersects with other interests--nation and market building, globalization, and so forth. In this course, we will explore various "sex panics," as they ask us to revisit the boundaries of the "normative" in relation to sex and its intersections with race, class, gender, sexuality, nation, and ability. Sex panics--and, as we'll also explore, "sex scandals" occasion not only the revision of discourses on sex but on identity, politics, and cultures more broadly. 6 credits; NE, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 WGST 140 Politics of Women's Health This course will explore the biopolitics of women's health in the context of the U.S. health care system and the roles that female-assigned and women-identified people play as health-care consumers, practitioners and feminist activists in women's health and reproductive justice movements. We will pay particular attention to the social construction, medicalization and politicization of physiological processes such as menstruation, sexual activity, reproduction and menopause. Some questions we will consider are: How do class, race, gender, sexuality and disability intersect to produce inequalities in women's health and in their access to the health care system? How do different communities of women mobilize for reproductive justice? What impact does the medicalization of reproductive processes have on women's health? Why and how is violence against women a mental and physical health issue? 6 credits; SI; Fall; Meera Sehgal WGST 180 Power and Desire: Gender Relations in the Middle East This course investigates how gender identities and relationships between "men" and "women" have been articulated, constructed, and refashioned throughout the Middle East. Starting with problematizing fixed notions of gender and sexuality, we map prominent attitudes through visiting a diverse array of sources from the Qur'an, Sunna, and legal documents to historical and anthropological case studies, literature, and film from across the region. Exploring notions of femininity and masculinity, as well as attitudes towards homosexuality and transgendered populations, we witness their implications in case studies and stories, from a divorce court in Iran to a vampiric dystopia. 6 credits; SI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 WGST 200 Gender, Power and the Pursuit of Knowledge In this course we will examine whether there are feminist ways of knowing, the criteria by which knowledge is classified as feminist and the various methods used by feminists to produce this knowledge. Some questions that will occupy us are: How do we know what we know? Who does research? Does it matter who the researcher is? How does the social location (race, class, gender, sexuality) of the researcher affect research? Who is the research for? How can research relate to efforts for social change? While answering these questions, we will consider how different feminist researchers have dealt with them. 6 credits; SI, IS; Fall; Meera Sehgal WGST 234 Feminist and Queer Theory We will explore feminist and queer debates about changing the world using a historical framework to situate these theories in the context of the philosophical and political thought of specific time periods and cultures. Thus, we will follow feminist and queer theories as they challenged, critiqued, subverted and revised liberalism, Marxism, critical race theories, multiculturalism, postmodernism and post-colonialism. We will focus on how theory emerges from and informs matters of practice. We will ask: What counts as theory? Who does it? How is it institutionalized? Who gets to ask the questions and to provide the answers? 6 credits; HI, IDS, WR2; Spring; Candace I Moore WGST 240 Gender, Globalization and War This course examines the relationship between globalization, gender and militarism to understand how globalization and militarism are gendered, and processes through which gender becomes globalized and militarized. We will focus on the field of transnational feminist theorizing which both "genders the international" and "internationalizes gender." We will take up the different theoretical and disciplinary approaches to this project, as well as the perspectives and methods put forth for studying gender, race and class transnationally. We will explore how economic development, human rights, and the politics of resistance (particularly in the NGO sector) are gendered. 6 credits; SI; Spring; Meera Sehgal WGST 241 India Program: Gender &amp; Sexuality in India This course explores gender and sexuality as key institutions that structure and stratify Indian society through intersections with other systems of stratification (like class, caste, and region). We will focus on family and gender relations, heteronormativity, homosociality and queer subversions as well as feminism, women's and queer movements--situating these historically and regionally in South Asia. We will also consider how gender and sexuality in India have been represented in the western imagination. Toward the end of the course, we will pay close attention to the gendered and sexualized politics of globalization, economic development and tourism in India. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 WGST 243 Women's and Gender Studies in Europe Program: Situated Feminisms: Socio-Political Systems and Gender Issues Across Europe This course examines the historical emergence and contemporary conditions of women's, feminist and LGBTQ activisms in four different Western and East Central European countries. We will study the impact of the European colonial heritage on the lives of women and minorities in various European communities, as well as the continuing legacies of the Second World War, the Cold War and of the EU expansion into Eastern Europe. We will zoom in onto such topics as reproductive rights, LGBT and queer politics, homonationalism, backlash against "gender ideology," sex work, trafficking, immigrant/refugee issues, challenges faced by women of color and by Jewish people in Europe, the legacy of state socialism in Eastern Europe, as well as the implications of European feminisms in the history of colonialism. These topics will be addressed both comparatively and historically, stressing the 'situated' nature of women's, feminist and LGBTQ issues and responses and taking into account the different sociopolitical national frameworks in which they occur. Prerequisite: Acceptance into the WGST Europe Program required. 8 credits; NE, IS; Fall; Iveta Jusová WGST 244 Women's &amp; Gender Studies in Europe Program: Cross-Cultural Feminist Methodologies This course is devoted to selected questions of (1) theory: what are the contours of feminist research in the social sciences and the humanities? and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> practice: how does one actually conduct feminist research and, more specifically, how does one conduct feminist research cross-culturally? We will explore some of the following questions: What is the relationship between methodology and knowledge claims in feminist research? How do language and narrative shape experience? How do the practices of interpretation intersect with questions of the authority of the researching subject and her respondents? What are the power interests involved in keeping certain knowledges marginalized/subjugated? How do questions of gender/sex/ethnicity/class, as well as of national and cultural location, figure in these debates? And how is the traditional social science relationship between the researcher and the examined objects redefined within frameworks of feminist research? We will also pay close attention to questions arising from the hegemony of English as the global language of academia and of WGS as a discipline, and will reflect on what it means to move between different linguistic communities, with each being differently situated in the global hierarchies of power. The course will be centered around feminist approaches to these epistemological and methodological cross-cultural questions, foregrounding such schools of thought and such concepts as social constructivism, standpoint theory, situated knowledges, intersectionality, queer epistemology, and cross-cultural communication as a feminist practice. Prerequisite: Acceptance into the WGST Europe OCS Program required. 8 credits; NE, IS; Fall; Iveta Jusová WGST 310 Asian Mystiques Demystified This class will focus on the topic of Asian sexuality and gender, considering traditional, transnational, and transgressive representations of Asian sexualities, femininities, masculinities and bodies. Often associated with paradoxical images of sensuality, spirituality, repression, and femininity, Asian sexuality has a long history, shaped by enduring colonial imaginaries and our transnational, capitalist present. Tracing a genealogy of Asian mystiques, we will study classical sources that have served as "prooftexts" for these images, and will then focus our attention on Asian literature, film, art, religious traditions, and social movements that have produced their own, often alternative, conceptions of Asian sexualities and gender. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 WGST 325 Women's &amp; Gender Studies in Europe Program: Continental Feminist, Queer, Trans* Theories This course frames several central debates in feminist and queer theory in the context of historical and recent local and global pressures on feminist and LGBTQ scholarship and activism across Europe. Addressing the impact of Anglo-American influences in Women's/Gender Studies, the course examines European, including Eastern European, approaches to key gender, ethnicity, and sexuality topics, raising questions about the transfer of feminist concepts across different cultures and languages. Some of the topics and themes explored include nationalism and gender, gendered dimensions of Western and Eastern European racisms, the historical influence of psychoanalysis on Continental feminist and queer theories, the implications of European feminisms in the history of colonialism, the biopolitics of gender, homonationalism, as well as Eastern European socialist/communist theories of women's emancipation. Unique to the WGSE program is a focus on theories exploring symbolic (and gendered) dimensions of Eastern Europe as a location, and on Eastern European feminist responses and contributions to WGS scholarship. This course works hand in hand with the Situated Feminisms and Cross-Cultural Feminist Methodology courses taught on the WGSE program, and it centrally informs and frames the independent research that students conduct while in Europe. Prerequisite: Acceptance into the WGST Europe OCS program required. 8 credits; NE, IS; Fall; Iveta Jusová WGST 389 Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Popular Culture This course will read representations of racial, gender, and sexual minorities in popular culture through the lenses of feminist, critical race, postcolonial, and queer theories. Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality in the late 1980s to describe an approach to oppression that considered how structures of power act multiply on individuals based upon their interlocking racial, class, gender, sexual, and other identities. "Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Popular Culture" takes up the charge of intersectional analysis-rejecting essentialist theories of difference while exploring pluralities-to interpret diversity (or lack thereof) in film, television, and digital media. Prerequisite: Women's and Gender Studies 110 or 112 or Cinema and Media Studies 110 or instructor consent. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IDS; Winter; Candace I Moore WGST 391 Independent Field Research in Europe This project is to be self-designed, and the topic and methodology as well as form of the presentation will be determined by the individual student's major, research interests and needs. It should build on readings and work done by European women and/or sexual and ethnic minority populations, feminist and/or queer theory, feminist research, cross cultural theory and (if applicable) principles of field research. It should be transnational, cross-cultural and comparative, and ideally should involve active field work. Drawing on skills developed in the feminist and queer theory and methodology seminars, students will select appropriate research methods and will conduct a sustained research project based on resources located/developed by the student in three of the countries visited. The progress of each research project will be evaluated at regular intervals in relation to parameters established in conjunction with the Program Director (or an external project supervisor if applicable). Prerequisite: Acceptance into the Carleton-Antioch Program required. 8 credits; NE; Fall; Iveta Jusová WGST 396 Transnational Feminist Activism This course focuses on transnational feminist activism in an era of globalization, militarism and religious fundamentalism. We will learn about the debates around different theories of social change, the challenges and pitfalls of global sisterhood and the various "pedagogies of crossing" borders. We will explore case studies of how feminists have collaborated, built networks, mobilized resources and coalitions for collective action, in addition to the obstacles and constraints they have encountered and surmounted in their search for gender and sexual justice. 6 credits; SI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 WGST 400 Integrative Exercise 6 credits; S/NC; Winter, Spring</p></div>

Carleton does not provide a set curriculum for professional/graduate school preparation, and does not offer pre-professional (i.e. pre-law, pre-med) majors. Instead, a regular program of studies in one of the established major fields is recommended as the best preparation for further training. In consultation with their faculty advisers, department chair, and other academic and career advisers, students can arrange a program of study which best suits their own needs and objectives.</p><p>Students planning to enter any of the professions listed below should see the chair of their department and the appropriate pre-professional adviser. The staff at the Career Center can provide assistance to students who are seeking more information about these career fields as well as internship and other exploratory opportunities and information.</p><p>ARCHITECTURE: Graduate schools of architecture do not require a specific major but most require or recommend drawing (ARTS 110, see also ARTS 113 and 210), calculus, and physics. A portfolio of visual materials is also required; students may want to take additional courses in studio art in order to build up their portfolio. Courses in the history of art and architecture are further recommended. For information consult the chair of the Department of Art and Art History.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT:</head><p>Many Carleton grads obtain careers in the management of business firms, government agencies, and nonprofit enterprises. Potential employers as well as graduate schools of business urge students to take courses in economics, mathematics, and statistics. Interested students can discuss careers in these fields with the chair or any member of the economics department, as well as with advisers in the Career Center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHEMISTRY:</head><p>The American Chemical Society Certified Chemistry Major. The American Chemical Society (ACS) is a professional society for chemists that has provided guidelines to baccalaureate institutions on best practices for teaching chemistry to undergraduate students. An ACS certified chemistry major requires more breadth and advanced study than the regular chemistry major. Students interested in continuing in chemistry after graduation in either graduate school or industry should consider the guidelines of the ACS certified chemistry major when planning their studies. ENGINEERING: Carleton provides an option for a 3-2 Engineering Program, also called the Dual-Degree Program. The 3-2 program allows students to spend three years at Carleton and two years at an engineering school receiving dual degrees, a B.A. from Carleton and a B.S. in engineering from a partner engineering institution. We currently have a formal partnership with Washington University. There are also 4-2 (B.A./B.S.) and 3-3 (B.A./B.S./M.S.) versions of the program available to interested students.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LAW:</head><p>The best pre-law education is a rigorous liberal arts education. You won't find a "prelaw" major at Carleton. In fact, most law schools discourage such programs. Any Carleton major can be a great background for someone considering a career in law. There are no specific courses you need to take to prepare for law school, but your schedule should include as many courses as possible requiring writing, oral analysis, research, and significant quantitative work. To help you prepare for the types of logic problems that appear on the LSAT and in law school courses, PHIL 210 (Logic), may be helpful.</p><p>A Combined Plan in Law is offered in cooperation with the Columbia University Law School. Under this plan a student combines three years of study at Carleton with three years at Columbia Law School. After completion of the six year program, the student is awarded two degrees, a BA degree from Carleton and a JD degree from Columbia. Application should be made early in the junior year.</p><p>Any student interested in pursuing a career in law, should meet with Carleton's pre-law adviser, Laura Clemens in the Career Center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE:</head><p>People with degrees in library and/or information science are employed in a wide range of settings, including academic, public, school and specialized libraries, archives, historical societies, and museums, as well as in business, government, and information technology. A master's degree from a school of library and information science accredited by the American Library Association is the credential usually needed by those planning a career in librarianship or related fields.</p><p>Any undergraduate major is acceptable for those planning to go to library school; however there is a particular demand for people with science and social science backgrounds. Course work and practical experience in organizing, retrieving, manipulating, and presenting information are highly valued, as is teaching and working directly with information seekers. Students with an interest in librarianship or related fields can gain practical experience through a wide variety of student jobs in the College library and Archives. Carleton's librarians and archivists are always eager to talk with students about work in library and information management settings. Contact the College Librarian for a referral to a local librarian or other information professional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HEALTHCARE:</head><p>Students interested in pursuing careers in healthcare fields (medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public health, physical therapy and nursing, for example) should discuss their plans and questions with pre-health advisor Pam Middleton during their first year at Carleton. Most students who plan to enter schools of allopathic or osteopathic medicine major in a science, but a major in any field is acceptable providing certain basic science courses are included. For detailed information, see the pre-health program website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admissions</head><p>Admission to Carleton is based on several considerations. Of importance are superior academic achievement, as demonstrated in the applicant's school record and scores on the required entrance examinations; personal qualities and interests; participation in extracurricular activities; and potential for development as a student and a graduate of the College. The Committee on Admissions weighs all factors to ensure that those students offered admission are not only adequately prepared for the academic work, but also will benefit from their total experience at Carleton and add significantly to the College through their individual talents and personal qualities.</p><p>Carleton strives to enroll a diverse student body with varied racial, ethnic, socio-economic, religious, cultural and political backgrounds, as well as geographic origins of its students. The College believes such diversity promotes spirited classroom discussion, provides an opening to a variety of viewpoints and life experiences, helps prepare students for a diverse workplace, and develops interpersonal skills for a pluralistic world.</p><p>* Applications may be submitted after this date, but priority will be given to those applying on or before the deadline.</p><p>The initial $300 payment will only be refunded in case of illness which makes it impossible for a student to enter the College at the time for which he or she has been accepted.</p><p>Late Applicants: Students who submit applications after January 15 each year must recognize they are applying on a space-if-available basis. In some years, the College is able to offer admission to late applicants; in other years, the first-year student class may be filled and students to whom we would like to offer admission must be placed on a waiting list to see if vacancies occur in late spring or early summer.</p><p>Early Admission: Each year, a number of students apply for admission following the junior year of high school. Some may be graduating early, others may be willing to forego the senior year to begin college early. The College will consider such applications with the following understanding: Successful Early Admission candidates almost always display a high degree of social and emotional maturity, present unusually strong academic credentials and have exhausted their secondary school curricular possibilities.</p><p>Deferred Admission: Deferred admission is not for an alternative college academic experience. If a deferred student chooses to study elsewhere, credit will not be transferred to Carleton. Deferred students who take post-secondary courses elsewhere cannot do so on a full-time basis or as a degree-seeking student without violating the terms of their deferral.</p><p>Candidates who wish to defer college for a year (a gap year) following completion of secondary school may apply for admission during their senior year. The application should be accompanied by a statement describing the candidate's reasons for desiring a gap year, plans for the interim year and perceived benefits of the delay. Such requests should be made by May 1 if at all possible.</p><p>Transfer Students: Carleton accepts a number of transfer students for each fall term. Students wishing to apply for the fall term should submit applications prior to March 31 and will be notified of the Admissions Committee's decision before May 15. All transfer applicants are expected to submit results from the College Board's SAT or ACT. To qualify for the Carleton degree, students must spend at least two years in residence including the senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Admission:</head><p>The strongest candidates for admission to Carleton have taken four years of English, three or more years of mathematics, two or more years of science and three or more years of social science. At a minimum, applicants should have three or more years of English (with a stress on writing), at least two years of algebra and a year of geometry, two years of social science and one year of a laboratory science. Most Carleton students go well beyond this minimum, and the Admissions Committee is usually attracted to candidates who take advantage of the opportunity to do honors, advanced placement work or international baccalaureate work. Normally, students will be expected to take two or more years of a foreign or classical language unless it is not offered in the school. The greater the number of courses in the subjects listed above, the more the applicant's qualifications for admission are strengthened. An applicant of unusual ability and interest whose secondary school program does not include all of these courses may be granted admission on the basis of his or her school record, the scores on standardized tests, and the recommendations of school officials.</p><p>Carleton recognizes achievement in the arts and encourages students to submit a CD, DVD, weblinks or other evidence of their work with their application. Once a student has applied to Carleton, they will receive a link and password to their own application status page. They can submit supplementary material on their application status page at go.Carleton.edu/appstatus.</p><p>By mid-August, enrolling students must provide a final high school transcript, or its equivalent, showing successful completion of their secondary course work. Additionally, students must have maintained an academic and personal record consistent with the records on which their admission to Carleton was granted.</p><p>Admissions Testing: Believing that the Admissions Committee is best able to make sound judgments about candidates' academic abilities when the secondary school record is supplemented by the results of standardized examinations, Carleton requires each applicant to submit results of the SAT or ACT prior to admission. Further, we recommend, but do not require, that candidates submit the results of their SAT II subject tests. We have found these tests valuable aids in the assessment of the quality of student achievement in a wide variety of secondary school programs.</p><p>Students whose first or native language is not English should submit official TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) scores or IELTS (International English Language Testing System).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interviews and Visits:</head><p>When possible, each applicant may have a personal interview with a member of the admissions office staff, an alumni admissions representative or a designated representative of the College. Information on campus visits is detailed at our website go.Carleton.edu/visits. The admissions office is open for appointments on weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 to 4:30 p.m., and during the academic year on many Saturdays from 8:30 a.m.to 12 noon. From June through September, the office is closed on Saturdays. The admissions office is located in Scoville Hall, 100 South College Street (GPS address: 105 College Street North, Northfield, MN).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rooms:</head><p>In the summer, all new students are assigned rooms which will be held until the first day of registration. The College reserves the right to change students' room assignments whenever such changes are deemed advisable and to use student rooms for its own purpose during vacation periods.</p><p>Financial Assistance: Carleton's financial aid policy is based on the premise that the family has the primary responsibility for meeting the expenses associated with attending the College, to the extent they are able. Families applying for financial aid will undergo a "need analysis" to determine their ability to contribute. The difference between the cost of attendance, as set by the College, and a family's expected contribution equals the demonstrated financial need, which Carleton will endeavor to meet through grants, loans and work-study.</p><p>There is no separate Carleton application for financial aid. Carleton requires financial aid applicants to complete both the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Board's Financial Aid CSS Profile form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expenses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comprehensive Fee</head><p>Students attending Carleton pay an all-inclusive fee, called a comprehensive fee, which is regarded as an annual charge rather than the sum of charges for each term covering tuition, room, board, and student activities. There are no special fees charged for laboratory work or field trips, or for diplomas upon graduation. All students are entitled to admission without charge to most athletic contests, concerts, plays, movies, lectures and other campus events. These activities as well as subscriptions to the student publications are covered by the Carleton Student Association (CSA) activity fee. For 2019-20 the comprehensive fee totals $71,769 and it is allocated as follows:</p><p>• Tuition: $56,778 • Room: $7,704 • Board: $6,954 • CSA Activity Fee: $333</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Fees</head><p>The department of music offers private lessons in applied music. The fees for 2019-2020 per term for individual instruction in all instruments, and use of practice facilities are: after the drop/add deadline, a term fee of $336 is billed to each student for weekly (normally 9) half-hour lessons (1 credit) per term, or $672 for weekly (normally 9) hour lessons (2 credits). Class Guitar and Class African Drum are $93 each. Junior and senior music majors receive up to 4 credits per term of lessons free of charge. Students on financial aid who experience difficulty in meeting the cost of private lessons may apply for financial assistance for such expenses directly to the Student Financial Services Office.</p><p>Many art classes and various other classes require consumable materials and supplies which are not included in the comprehensive fee; special fees may apply to these classes. Contact the Student Financial Services Office for financial assistance eligibility requirements.</p><p>Student health insurance is available at additional cost for those not covered by another plan. Note: proof of health insurance is required. For possible financial assistance to cover the cost of health insurance, contact the Student Financial Services Office for eligibility requirements.</p><p>Students residing in the Village Apartments and Carleton owned houses, except for Parish House, are assessed a $25 per term laundry facilities fee for use of non-coin operated machines in these facilities.</p><p>For off-campus independent study, including summer reading not required for a fall term course, the fee for each two credits or fraction thereof is the tuition for one credit during the academic year in which the credit is granted.</p><p>Students participating in non-Carleton off-campus programs will be assessed a $500 administrative fee. The fee will be charged to the student's Carleton student account after the Off-Campus Studies Petition has been approved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Deposit</head><p>In addition to the comprehensive fee, all enrolling students are required to pay and maintain an enrollment deposit of $300, which functions as a confirming admissions deposit. $250 of this total becomes a continuing enrollment deposit for subsequent years and the remaining $50 of the deposit is used as a lifetime transcript fee, where students may request college transcripts from the Registrar without cost. The deposit ($250) will be returned upon graduation. Any unpaid student account obligation will be applied against this deposit at the time of graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calendar of Payments</head><p>When filing for admission (application fee, only applies to paper applications) $30</p><p>When accepted (enrollment deposit) $300</p><p>August <ref type="formula">15</ref>  Students are held responsible for payment of their college fees. Students receive e-mail notifications, using the student's Carleton e-mail address, when the term bills are available online.</p><p>A monthly payment plan is available through an outside vendor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Penalties</head><p>Students' accounts are regarded as delinquent and subject to penalty if payments are not made at the specified times, or if arrangements have not been made for later payment. The penalty for late payment of fees is $35.</p><p>A student will not be permitted to register for the following term until his or her account has been cleared by the Business Office. The student will be withdrawn from the College if the Business Office has a financial block on the student's account for a prior term's past due balance. The student will not be permitted to return to campus when classes start for the upcoming term. If otherwise eligible, the student may apply for readmission for the subsequent term.</p><p>In cases of postponed account settlement, for which special arrangements are made in the Business Office, a note must be signed covering the amount of the unpaid balance. An 8% per annum charge will be made on postponed accounts.</p><p>College policies on deposits and refunds apply to Carleton off-campus study seminars; in addition, a $500 penalty is assessed for late withdrawals before the start of the program. See the Carleton Seminars Withdrawal policy.</p><p>Students who withdraw from a non-Carleton program are responsible for informing the program provider and abiding by their withdrawal policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Refunds before a term starts</head><p>Students are eligible for a 100% refund of tuition, room, board and student activity fees if they have paid for the upcoming term and subsequently withdraws or takes a leave of absence with notification to the Dean of Students before the term starts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Refunds after a term starts</head><p>If a student withdraws during the first ten days of classes and notifies the Dean of Students Office by 5:00 p.m. on the tenth day of class a 25% tuition refund is available:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Term Last day for a 25% tuition refund</head><p>Room charges will not be refunded if a student leaves after the term starts.</p><p>Board charges will be refunded for the remaining weeks of the term.</p><p>Financial aid will be reduced according to the Return of Title IV Federal Student Aid Policy.</p><p>Applied music fees will not be charged to students who drop by the end of the drop/add period. After the drop/add period music fees will be refunded pro-rata when a late drop is made for medical reasons or in similar emergency situations.</p><p>Special provisions for military service are addressed by the Registrar.</p><p>If a student wishes to transfer to another institution he or she must settle their student account in the Business Office by making necessary payments or arrangements for extension before a transcript of credits will be issued.</p><p>No refunds will be made to students suspended, dismissed or expelled from the College.</p><p>A more restrictive refund policy governs withdrawal from Carleton off-campus programs. This policy is explained in the Carleton Seminars Withdrawal policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Balance Policy</head><p>If a credit balance is created by federal Title IV funds it will be sent to the student with 10 business days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Housing and Residential Life</head><p>As a residential college, Carleton requires all students to live in College operated residences and participate in the College dining plan for all four years.</p><p>Residence halls and campus houses are an integral part of the Carleton learning experience.</p><p>Living with other students provides many informal opportunities for students to learn about themselves, develop friendships, and discuss new ways of thinking. The mission of Residential Life is to create a healthy, safe and thriving environment where students can gain experience, be involved and develop their interpersonal, academic, and leadership potential. Our professional Area Directors and student Resident Assistants (RA's) help plan social, educational, and recreational activities in the halls and houses. These staff members are available to assist students in many ways throughout the academic year.</p><p>Carleton College offers a variety of housing options because we recognize that multiple residential options are desirable and beneficial for students. Housing opportunities include traditional residence halls, suites, houses, apartments and Northfield Option. Northfield Option is a program that allows a very limited number of seniors to live in non-College owned housing. Students must receive prior approval from Residential Life to be eligible for this option.</p><p>Students who are married or have dependent children living with them will be exempted from the residency and board requirements upon providing documentation to the Residential Life Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head><p>Financial Aid Philosophy</p><p>Carleton's tradition of extending educational opportunities to academically qualified students and meeting their financial need is based on a deep commitment to the belief that a true liberal arts education exposes students to varying backgrounds and points of view outside as well as inside, the classroom. For this reason, in addition to the more pragmatic one that many parents cannot afford the cost of education today, Carleton encourages high school students to apply for admission without regard to their financial circumstances. The basic philosophy underlying the student financial aid program at Carleton is that families have the primary responsibility to finance their children's education to the extent that they are able. When a family cannot afford our costs, Carleton is committed to meeting a student's need with various types of aid for all those admitted, for all four years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How to Apply</head><p>Carleton is a member of the College Scholarship Service (CSS), a division of the College Board, which processes the confidential statements submitted by families in support of their application for financial assistance. The many colleges using the service join in the belief that financial aid should be awarded to students only after careful consideration of the family's ability to contribute to the cost of their children's education and determination of their demonstrated financial need. All families who wish to be considered for financial aid must complete the CSS PROFILE. In addition, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be completed to qualify for any applicable federal and state assistance. No separate Carleton aid form is required for students. However, all student applicants and their parents must submit completed copies of the appropriate year's W-2's. Carleton reserves the right to request copies of tax returns from the family or directly from the IRS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Terms of Assistance</head><p>When financial need is demonstrated, assistance will be granted under the following conditions:</p><p>All financial aid awards are made for only one year at a time. It is customary to meet the student's total demonstrated need by utilizing a combination of Carleton grants/scholarships, student employment, and student loans. With the exception of student employment, financial aid is usually distributed equally at the beginning of each term (i.e. fall, winter, spring terms). Student employment earnings are direct deposited to the student and are paid according to the number of hours worked at the end of each pay period. The student may arrange with the Business Office to have all or part of these earnings applied directly to their tuition account.</p><p>Receipt of any financial assistance from sources other than Carleton College must be reported to the Office of Student Financial Services. These outside awards will result in an adjustment in the financial aid package in order to remain within a student's calculated financial need and to utilize all resources available to that student. Under Carleton's outside aid policy, outside or private scholarships first reduce the student's self-help awards (student loans and/or student employment) on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This way, students benefit directly by reducing their loan debt and/or their work hours. It is the College's policy to not reduce Carleton grants/scholarships until all self-help components of the award have been eliminated. The exception to this policy involves Federal Pell Grants, Minnesota State Grants, and other needbased federal or state grant programs. Adjustments to the student loan or student employment awards resulting from outside aid are made in succeeding years upon receipt of those funds.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the student to submit a complete financial aid application (CSS PROFILE, FAFSA, parent and student federal tax returns and follow-up forms) before established deadlines. Deadline dates are "priority deadlines" and will be enforced according to the availability of aid funding for that year. Those that meet the deadline will be given consideration for assistance first. Other applications will be considered according to the date received and current funding levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renewal of Aid</head><p>Financial aid forms must be completed each year. A student and his or her family may assume that the College will continue to provide comparable assistance for subsequent years insofar as the family's financial circumstances remain stable. As those circumstances change, financial aid may also change. It is important to understand that financial aid administered by the College is not renewed automatically. Parents and students must complete and submit the necessary forms and need analysis documents each year (i.e. CSS PROFILE, FAFSA, parent and student W2's and if requested, their federal tax returns). At Carleton, financial aid is related to demonstrated financial need rather than academic measures. However, students must make satisfactory academic progress toward graduation in order to have their aid renewed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of Financial Aid Available</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Merit Aid</head><p>A small proportion of Carleton's financial aid is given as non-need or merit based aid. The scholarships that are merit based are the National Merit Scholarship, and the National Hispanic Recognition Scholarship. Those students who select Carleton as their first-choice college with the National Merit Scholarship Corporation will receive a scholarship worth $2,000 per year, for four years. The Bailey Instrumental Music Scholarship is also considered merit based aid available to students majoring or intending to major in music and who study and perform on orchestra strings, woodwinds, or brass instruments. Auditions are required and the scholarship is worth a minimum of $2,000 per year, plus approved music lessons. Bailey scholars are eligible to apply for a summer of music study at a national or international music institute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need-Based Aid</head><p>There are two major categories of need-based aid: gift aid and self-help aid. Gift aid is given to the student in the form of grants/scholarships and does not need to be repaid. Self-help aid needs to be either earned (student employment) or repaid (student loans).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gift Aid</head><p>Gift aid includes grants and scholarships. The majority of the dollars received by students at the college is in the form of Carleton grants and Carleton scholarships. To the student, there is no difference whether they have received a grant or scholarship from the College. Any student who is eligible for need-based aid is reviewed to determine if they have the appropriate characteristics for one of the many Carleton scholarships (no separate scholarship application is required). Students receiving a Carleton scholarship are informed of the donor or source of their scholarship and may be asked to recognize them for their gift. All students are also reviewed for eligibility for federal and state grants.</p><p>To be eligible for gift aid, a student must apply for financial aid by completing the CSS PROFILE and FAFSA and submitting parent and student federal tax forms before the established deadline. The majority of gift aid that Carleton distributes includes the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Minnesota State Grant, and Carleton grants/scholarships. A description of each of these aid types may be found on the Student Financial Services website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Help Aid</head><p>Self-help aid comes in two forms. The first is student employment. Most students receiving need-based financial aid are awarded student employment, with first-year students authorized to work up to eight hours per week and returning students up to ten hours per week. The dollars awarded for the hours worked represent an opportunity for students to earn money toward college expenses, and represent a maximum that can be earned during the academic year. The exact dollars earned may be influenced by the hours available from the employer and student schedule for a term. Hours not worked and awarded dollars not earned may be converted to additional self-help aid (i.e. loans).</p><p>Students are usually assigned campus jobs, although some students are assigned off-campus jobs at non-profit organizations. Student employees may choose to apply all or a portion of their earnings to their tuition account through the Business Office website. Otherwise, earnings are directly deposited into the student's checking or savings account at the end of each pay period.</p><p>The second form of self-help aid is student loans. Loans allow students to finance a portion of their education through utilization of future earnings resulting from and enhanced by the benefits of their college education. These loans must be repaid after the student has graduated or enrollment has ceased. Most student loans may be deferred if the student continues their education beyond their Bachelor's Degree.</p><p>The self-help aid distributed most commonly at Carleton College includes student employment, Federal Direct Stafford Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) and Federal Direct PLUS (Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students). A description of each loan, including eligibility, annual loan limits, current interest rates, and repayment terms can be found on the Student Financial Services website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Financing Option</head><p>Families at Carleton College may participate in an interest-free monthly payment plan that allows for payment of the comprehensive fee for a particular academic year. Equal payments for a 12 month or 11 month period begin June 1 and July 1 respectively. The plan may be used to cover all or a portion of the annual tuition, fees, room and board charges. There is a $55 annual fee to enroll. The deadline to enroll is August 15. The exact terms and conditions of the monthly payment plan are determined annually and may differ from what is described here.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the Business Office website, or contact Carleton Student Accounts at studentaccounts@carleton.edu.</p><p>The monthly payment plan is administered by Cashnet and requires online enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Return of Title IV Federal Student Aid</head><p>A student recipient of Federal Title IV funds (i.e., Federal Pell, SEOG or TEACH grants or Perkins, Direct Stafford or PLUS loans) who withdraws or takes a leave of absence from the school before completing 60% of the term is subject to the Return of Title IV Calculation to determine the percentage of Title IV funds required to be returned to the federal government. The Return of Title IV calculation is a federally mandated formula to determine how much federal funding was "earned" up to the time of withdrawal.</p><p>The Title IV funds that were disbursed in excess of the earned amount must be returned to the federal government by the school and/or the student. If you received a refund/credit balance from financial aid, which was to be used for education-related personal expenses or housing expenses, you may be required to return a portion of those funds to the school. This portion represents funds that were intended to pay your education-related expenses through the end of the term. The amount to be returned to the school will be determined by your institutional costs, refunds you might have received for non-school expenses and the funds that must be returned to the government.</p><p>The amount to be returned to the federal government will be calculated from the date you officially withdrew from classes or, in the case of an unofficial withdrawal, the last date you were involved in an academically related activity. An official withdrawal occurs when a student follows the published process for withdrawing from the school prior to the end of the term.</p><p>To determine the amount of aid you earned up to the time of withdrawal, Carleton College Student Financial Services (SFS Office) will determine the percentage of the term you attended. The percentage used to determine the return of federal student aid funds is equal to the number of calendar days remaining in the term divided by the number of calendar days in the term. Scheduled breaks of more than five consecutive days are excluded. The resulting percentage is then used along with your school costs and total federal funds that you received (funds that were disbursed directly to your school student account and possibly refunded to you) or that you were eligible to receive, to determine the amount of aid that you are allowed to keep.</p><p>Any unearned Title IV aid must be returned to the federal government within 45 days of the date of the determination of your withdrawal. Carleton College SFS Office will notify you with instructions on how to proceed if you are required to return funds to the government. Any funds returned after the Return of Title IV Aid calculation is completed and processed are then used to repay Carleton College funds, state funds, other private sources, and the student, in proportion to the amount received from each non-federal source, as long as there was no unpaid balance at the time of withdrawal. All aid sources are repaid accordingly before any funds are returned to the student.</p><p>Funds that are returned to the federal government are used to reduce the outstanding balances in individual federal programs. Financial aid returned by you and/or your parent or the school must be allocated in the following order:</p><p>A student may be eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement if, prior to withdrawing, the student earned more federal financial aid than was disbursed. If a student is eligible for a postwithdrawal disbursement for Title IV funds, it will be processed for the student and a refund will be issued within 14 days of the credit balance.</p><p>If the post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan funds, Carleton College must get the student's permission before it can disburse the loan. Students may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds so that they do not incur additional debt. A notice will be sent out to the student, and the signed, original document must be returned to the School within 14 days. Carleton College may, at their discretion, still disburse if the signed document is returned after 14 days.</p><p>Carleton College may automatically use all or a portion of the post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition and fees. However, the school needs the student's permission to use the post-withdrawal grant disbursement for all other school charges. If the student does not give his/her permission, the student will be offered the funds. However, it may be in the student's best interest to allow the school to keep the funds to reduce the student's debt at the school.</p><p>It is also important to understand that accepting a post-withdrawal disbursement of student loan funds will increase a student's overall student loan debt that must be repaid under the terms of the Master Promissory Note. Additionally, accepting the disbursement of grant funds will reduce the remaining amount of grant funds available to the student should the student continue his/her education at a later time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Official Withdrawal Policy</head><p>Students must contact the Dean of Student Office to withdraw or take a leave of absence.</p><p>For tuition refunds and financial aid refunds, the date of withdrawing is the date the student notifies the Dean of Student Office they are withdrawing or requesting a leave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unofficial Withdrawal Policy</head><p>In the event a student leaves campus without notifying the institution, all efforts are taken to reestablish contact. In the unlikely event contact is not re-established, the institution will consider it an unofficial withdrawal. The last date of academic activity will be used as the effect date of the withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>If you have any questions about refund calculations please contact Student Financial Services</head><p>Office at 507-222-4138 or financialaid@carleton.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Funds</head><p>Support of the College: As an independent, privately endowed institution, Carleton's development has been made possible by the support of interested individuals, foundations, and corporations. Student tuition payments cover only about one-half of the College's educational and general expenses. Most of the balance comes from gifts for current purposes and from income earned by the College's endowment, which was itself provided by gifts.</p><p>Honorary Scholarships: WILLIAM CARLETON SCHOLARSHIPS, given to entering students in memory of the man for whom Carleton is named, are honorary awards in recognition of outstanding qualities of scholarship, character, and promise of achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endowed Scholarship Awards</head><p>Income from the endowed funds described here provides scholarship assistance to enable qualified students to attend Carleton College. All scholarship recipients must maintain academic excellence and must, unless otherwise noted, demonstrate financial need. Students need not apply for these scholarships directly; they are awarded at the discretion of the College and administered as an integral part of Carleton's financial aid program. The minimum amount currently designated for endowing and administering a new scholarship fund is $100,000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Scholarship Awards</head><p>The following grants and awards provide scholarship money for students demonstrating financial need. As with the endowed scholarship funds, students need not apply for these scholarships directly; they are awarded at the discretion of the College and administered as an integral part of Carleton's financial aid program.</p></div>

We will also examine how the material legacies of imperial Rome, Byzantium, and early Christianity served as both resources for and constraints on the political, cultural, and religious evolution of the Italian peninsula and especially Rome and its environs from late antiquity through the twelfth century. Among the principal themes will be the development of the cult of saints, the development of the papal power and authority, Christianization, reform, pilgrimage, and monasticism. Prerequisite: Acceptance to Carleton Rome Program. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 HIST 202 Icons, Iconoclasm, and the Quest for the Holy in Byzantium and Its Neighbors This course examines the nature, theory, and functions of religious images in Byzantium and surrounding regions (Armenia, Coptic Egypt, Ethiopia, the Slavic world, and the Latin West) as well as the perspectives of those who criticized them. Special attention will be paid to debates over the nature of icon veneration within Byzantine society itself and across religious boundaries; the role of images in the cult of saints; and the role of icons in the formation of religious, social, and political identities. 6 credits; WR2, HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20</figDesc></figure>

It can be argued that animals face a relatively small set of basic challenges: they must acquire food, water, and mates, and they must avoid danger. Yet we see a rich diversity of solutions to these problems. Consider foraging behavior, for example. All animals must acquire energy, but some filter particles out of sea water, others graze on nearly inedible grasses, while still others hunt in cooperative packs. In this course we will consider such topics as foraging, communication, sociality, and conflict. By focusing on the functions and evolutionary histories of behaviors, we strive to better understand the puzzle of behavioral diversity. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how organisms cope with environmental extremes (e.g., temperature, low oxygen, pH, salinity and pressure) and in using metabolic theory to predict the ecological impacts of climate change (e.g., global warming, ocean acidification, hypoxia). Associated laboratory will emphasize experimentation and application of physiological concepts in living organisms.

Course materials include works by Octavia Butler, Shakespeare I A chronological survey of the whole of Shakespeare's career, covering all genres and periods, this course explores the nature of Shakespeare's genius and the scope of his art. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between literature and stagecraft ("page to stage"). By tackling the complexities of prosody, of textual transmission, and of Shakespeare's highly figurative and metaphorical language, the course will help you further develop your ability to think critically about literature.

However, the Robin Hood we know only appeared in English literature in the Late Middle Ages and his story was not established until the Renaissance. This course traces the development of the outlaw figure from Anglo-Saxon poetry through Irish and Icelandic traditions to the rebels that arose in the Middle English period. We examine the outlaw from several theoretical standpoints, including the postcolonial, anthropological, ecocritical, and gender studies perspectives. All readings are either in Middle English or in Modern English translation. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 206 Arthurian Tradition: From Medieval to Modern King Arthur is a figure from Western tradition whose name conjures a clear series of associations: the Sword in the Stone, the Round Table, the Holy Grail. This course traces the development of this tradition, from its origins in an obscure corner of the British Isles to its dominance within both European literature and the popular imagination. Similarly, Arthur himself takes on multiple, sometimes contradictory guises-an enemy of the English and yet a symbol of England, the archetype of the perfect king but a champion of democracy, the epitome of Christian devotion yet suffused with pagan imagery. Our texts range from medieval Welsh legend to modern film; everything is in modern English translation. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 207 Princes. Poets. Power Can you serve power without sacrificing your principles or risking your life? We examine the classic explorations of the problem--Machiavelli's Prince, Castiglione's Courtier, and More's Utopia--and investigate the place of poets and poetry at court of Henry VIII, tracing the birth of the English sonnet, and the role of poetry in the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn. 3 credits; LA; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 208 The Faerie Queene Spenser's romance epic: an Arthurian quest-cycle, celebrating the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I, and England's imperial destiny.

We will investigate the play's historical, political, religious, and theatrical contexts as we try to understand not only the world that produced the play, but the world that came out of it. How should what we learn of the past inform a modern production? How can performance offer interpretive arguments about the play's meanings? Individual and group projects may involve research, writing, dramaturgy, program design, and exhibition curation.urbanization and industrialism.

We examine texts from writers like Anzaldúa, Butler, Cervantes, Dick, Eugenides, Haraway, and Muñoz first to understand how borders act to constrain our imagi(nation) and then to explore how and to what degree the borderlands offer hybrid identities, queer affects, and speculative world-building. We will engage the excess of the borderlands through a broad chronological and generic range of U.S. literary and visual texts.

This course studies the literature of the period to understand the attitudes and motivations that initiated it, and takes a postcolonialist approach to characterize texts from the Crusades as an attempt to define the Self against the Other-not just on the part of the Crusaders, but from the perspective of Muslims, Jews, Orthodox Greeks, and others. Readings include poetry, novels, and short stories by John Agard, Jackie Kay, George Lamming, Grace Nichols, Helen Oyeyemi, Samuel Selvon, and Zadie Smith, and foreground issues of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IS; Fall; Corrine E Collins ENGL 238 African Literature in English This is a course on texts drawn from English-speaking Africa since the 1950's.

However, the Robin Hood we know only appeared in English literature in the Late Middle Ages and his story was not established until the Renaissance. This course traces the development of the outlaw figure from Anglo-Saxon poetry through Irish and Icelandic traditions to the rebels that arose in the Middle English period. We examine the outlaw from several theoretical standpoints, including the postcolonial, anthropological, ecocritical, and gender studies perspectives. All readings are either in Middle English or in Modern English translation.

Prerequisite: One English foundations course and one other 6 credit English course. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Not offered 2019-20ENGL 329 The City in American Literature How do American authors "write the city"? The city as both material reality and metaphor has fueled the imagination of diverse novelists, poets, and playwrights, through tales of fallen women and con men, immigrant dreams, and visions of apocalypse. After studying the realistic tradition of urban fiction at the turn of the twentieth century, we will turn to modern and contemporary re-imaginings of the city, with a focus on Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Selected films, photographs, and historical sources will supplement our investigations of how writers face the challenge of representing urban worlds.

Through the study of fiction, poetry, and essays, the class explores changing definitions of LGBTQ+ culture at the intersections of race, ability, size, class, and ethnicity. We will examine how queer political movements create radical spaces to rethink identity politics, and investigate queer literature's portrayal of queer themes and culture. Authors and theorists include: Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, Audre Lorde, Jose Munoz, Leslie Feinberg, Michael Cunningham, James Baldwin, Carmen Maria Machado, and Roxane Gay. Prerequisite: One English foundations courses and one other six credit English course. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IDS; Spring; Corrine E Collins ENGL 350 The Postcolonial Novel: Forms and Contexts Authors from the colonies and ex-colonies of England have complicated understandings of the locations, forms and indeed the language of the contemporary English novel.

Prerequisite: One English foundations course and one additional 6 credit English course. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 ENGL 352 Toni Morrison: Novelist Morrison exposes the limitations of the language of fiction, but refuses to be constrained by them. Her quirky, inimitable, and invariably memorable characters are fully committed to the protocols of the narratives that define them. She is fearless in her choice of subject matter and boundless in her thematic range. And the novelistic site becomes a stage for Morrison's virtuoso performances. It is to her well-crafted novels that we turn our attention in this course. Prerequisite: One English foundations course and one other 6 credit English course or instructor permission. 6 credits; LA, WR2, IDS; Winter; Kofi Owusu ENGL 359 World Literature in the Twenty-First Century Our focus will be on contemporary writers who tend to localize the global and/or globalize the local in their decidedly textured fiction and nonfiction published since 2001.

Published at the college for two decades, from 1960-1980, the Miscellany featured the work of a dozen Pulitzer Prize winning authors and that of numerous Carleton faculty. The magazine had a cosmopolitan, international perspective but also reflected its origins in a small, leafy Midwestern college town.

Topics may include transportation, cuisine, rituals and rhythms of Italian life, urbanism, religious diversity, immigration, tourism, historic preservation, and language. Class discussions and projects will offer students opportunities to reflect on their own encounters with contemporary Italian culture. Prerequisite: Participation in OCS Rome Program. 3 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 EUST 231 Economics and European Studies in Cambridge: Britain in Europe: Brexit and its Aftermath As of March 29 2019 Britain will no longer be a member of the European Union. To understand the process that led to this remarkable and unexpected event, this course will introduce students to the institutions of the European Union and of Britain through reading, discussion, guest lectures and on-site visits in Brussels and London. Prerequisite: Participation in OCS Cambridge Program. 4 credits; SI, IS; Summer; Paul Petzschmann EUST 232 Economics and European Studies in Cambridge: The Great War in Poetry, History and Memory The memory of World War I looms large in British politics, especially around the centenary of the treaty of Versailles. While it has done much to unite European elites around ideas of shared governance and economic cooperation, it continues to divide historians and the general public in Britain. Beginning with a tour of the battlefields of Ypres and the Somme, we will be reading about these ongoing controversies. These readings will be accompanied by further visits to the Imperial War museum in Manchester and the war memorials in Cambridge and London. Prerequisite: Enrollment in Cambridge OCS Program. 3 credits; S/CR/NC; LA, IS; Summer; Paul Petzschmann EUST 233 Economics and European Studies in Cambridge: Capitalism and Crises: Political Economy from Marx to Hayek Britain was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution during the eighteenth and nineteenth century. That rapid economic growth unleashed by free competition brought with it the constant threat of crisis was an insight developed by Marx and later Keynes. Britain was home to capitalism's cheerleaders as well as to its most important critics. Its economic dominance was accompanied by a tradition of tolerance, of open public discussion and free academic enquiry that made London and Cambridge attractive to students of political economy from Europe and across the world. Readings from the most important representatives will be supplemented by visits to industrial sites and museums in Manchester. Prerequisite: Enrollment in OCS Cambridge Program. 3 credits; SI, IS; Summer; Paul Petzschmann EUST 249 The European Union from Constitution to Crisis It has become commonplace to say that Europe is in crisis--yet what does that mean? It is difficult to overestimate the importance of crises considering that the European Union played a large part in overcoming Europe's "Long Civil War" between 1914 and 1945. The collective decision-making processes created by European treaties are often credited with bringing peace and prosperity to Europe. Yet they have also instituted idiosyncrasies, asymmetries and inequities that stand in the way of solving the continent's most pressing problems. We will examine decision-making processes in the European Union and the much-debated "democratic deficit" of its institutions. These debates about the foundations of the Union will be rounded off by an overview and brief history of Euroscepticism. The course will include a discussion of a number of case studies that confront member states of the European Union across the board: the reconstruction of the welfare state, immigration and the refugee crisis, and the rise of the far right. 6 credits; SI, IS; Winter; Paul Petzschmann EUST 278 Cross-Cultural Psychology Seminar in Prague: Politics &amp; Culture in Central Europe-Twentieth Century This course covers important political, social, and cultural developments in Central Europe during the twentieth century. Studies will explore the establishment of independent nations during the interwar period, Nazi occupation, resistance and collaboration, the Holocaust and the expulsion of the Germans, the nature of the communist system, its final collapse, and the post-communist transformation. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 EUST 290 Economics and European Studies Program: Studying Britain in Europe: from the Great War to Brexit This course provides guided readings for students on the Economics and European Studies OCS in Cambridge. The course introduces students to the study of European Institutions and their development in the context of major political events of the day. It also covers the different crises that led to the Union's establishment after the experience of two World Wars, the post-war settlement, and Britain's awkward relationship with the EU from Churchill to Brexit. 2 credits; S/CR/NC; HI, IS; Summer; Paul Petzschmann EUST 398 Senior Colloquium Culminates in a final oral presentation that will allow concentrators to synthesize and reflect upon their diverse European studies, including on-campus and off-campus classwork, internships, and cross-cultural experiences. 3 credits; NE; Winter; David G Tompkins</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

It also attempts to answer the following questions: how does French cinema reflect, contradict, or create cultural norms? What in a particular historical moment incites the production of a particular film and catapults it to fame? In what ways does film provide another medium through which to "read" French culture? Prerequisite: French 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 FREN 237 Page and Stage: The Performance of Culture What better place to study notions of gender, identity, class, race (and more) than in the performative arena of the theater? In this class we'll examine a broad range of plays while staging excerpts of many of them. What is the importance of blocking and costume? How do modernizations and other modifications affect the reception of a dramatic work? We'll put these questions to the test while engaging with such authors as Molière, Marivaux, Beckett, Ionesco, Genet, and Reza. Prerequisite: French 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA, IS; Not offered 2019-20 FREN 238 Back to the Future: French Classics Reimagined What if Little Red Riding Hood wore a red burqa? And if Eurydice willingly relocated to the Underworld to join her cancan-crazed lover Pluto? In this course, we will explore bold and inventive acts of rewriting the French classics in a wide assortment of contexts. To do so, we will immerse ourselves in the often irreverent world of literary, musical, comic strip, and film retellings, adaptations, sequels, and spin-offs. Works by Perrault, Molière, Baudelaire, Offenbach, Camus, Ben Jelloun, Daoud, Prévert, Truffaut, and more. Songs from the cabaret era to raï. Special emphasis on developing analytical and communicative skills. Conducted in French. Prerequisite: French 204 or equivalent. 6 credits; LA, IS; Fall; Éva S Pósfay FREN 239 Banned Books Recent events in France have highlighted the issues of free speech and religious intolerance, among other cultural questions. Some of the most fascinating and now canonized works in French and Francophone literature were once banned because they called into question the political, religious, or moral sensibilities of the day. Even now, books deemed to be subversive are routinely censored in certain Francophone cultures. Through readings of such writers as Rabelais, Voltaire, Sade, Camus, Franz Fanon, Assia Djebar, and Hergé (Tintin), as well as contemporary articles from Charlie Hebdo, we will explore the crucial role of forbidden works in their cultural contexts.

Instead of what we heard or think about Confucius, we will examine what his contemporaries, both his supporters and critics, thought he was. Students will scrutinize various sources gleaned from archaeology, heroic narratives, and court debates, as well as the Analects to write their own biography of Confucius based on a particular historical context that created a persistent constitutional agenda in early China. Students will justify why they would call such a finding, in hindsight, "Confucian" in its formative days. Themes can be drawn from aspects of ritual, bureaucracy, speech and writing 6 credits; AI, WR1, IS; Fall; Seungjoo Yoon Slavery and the Old South This seminar studies the differences in approach and emphasis of historians and the history of the history of antebellum slavery in the United States South. The main theme is revisionism since Ulrich Bonnell Phillips's foundational studyAmerican Negro Slavery (1919). Our understanding during the 1970s accentuated slave culture, community, and enslaved females. Current scholarship zeroes in on topics such as commodification, violence within the slave community, and white women as slave owners. Special attention paid to analytical thinking skills. 6 credits; AI, WR1, IDS; Fall; Harry M Williams HIST 100 The Black Death: Disease and Its Consequences in the Middle Ages In the 1340s, the Black Death swept through the Middle East and Europe, killing up to a third of the population in some areas.</figDesc><table><row><cell>6 credits; AI, WR1, IDS, QRE; Fall;</cell></row><row><cell>Tyran K Steward</cell></row><row><cell>HIST 100</cell></row></table><note>HIST 100 History and Memory in Africa, Nineteenth through Twenty-first Centuries This course explores how Africans have remembered and retold their own history in the colonial and post-colonial contexts (nineteenth-twenty-first centuries). Students will examine memories of origin, the slave trade, conversion, and colonialism as well as of personal and communal triumphs and tragedies. Both long- standing historical texts like praise-names and rituals and modern texts like journals, court records, and letters will be explored. What is the relationship between the historical medium and the memory? Drawing from select cases in West, East and South Africa, students will come to understand the rich and varied history of Africa's creative expression. 6 credits; AI, IS, WR1; Fall; Thabiti Willis HIST 100 Indians, Spaniards, and Empire Starting in 1492, a few Spanish explorers conquered continents and subdued several Native American empires. At least that is what they wanted everyone to believe. Is it possible to tell the history of Spanish and Indigenous encounters in Latin America from the perspective of native peoples? How can historians recuperate the voices of those written out of history itself? How do contrasting visions of history, politics, and culture itself inform how historians practice their craft? In this course, we will explore new histories of Latin America that center the indigenous experience of empire, colonization, and contact. 6 credits; AI, WR1, IS; Fall; Elena C McGrath HIST 100How can we understand what this catastrophe meant for the people who lived and died at the time?</note></figure>

Cold War in East Asia How is the Cold War in East Asia related to the global Cold War? Many argue that Cold War came prematurely in East Asia and outlasts the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Students will examine evolving patterns of the region's engagement with global dimensions of war, diplomacy, and trade and conduct a case study (e.g., Roosevelt on China, Stalin on North Korea, Kennedy on Japan, Khrushchev and Nixon on China, or Bush on North Korea). Themes may be drawn from sports and pop culture or urban renewal projects in terms of post-colonial nation building, market fundamentalism, and new empire formation. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 HIST 161 From the Mughals to Mahatma Gandhi: An Introduction to Modern Indian History This is an introductory survey course; no prior knowledge of South Asian History required. The goal is to familiarize students with some of the key themes and debates in the historiography of modern India. Beginning with an overview of Mughal rule in India, the main focus of the course is the colonial period. The course ends with a discussion of 1947: the hour of independence as well as the creation of two new nation-states, India and Pakistan. Topics include Oriental Despotism, colonial rule, nationalism, With a critical lens, we examine the forms and limits of U.S. imperial domination and coercion, as well as different strategies of collaboration, negotiation, and resistance devised by Latin Americans, from nineteenth century U.S. expansionism, to the challenges of the Mexican, Cuban and Nicaraguan Revolutions, to U.S. support for dictatorial regimes, and the evolution of neoliberal globalization, as well as recent disputes in the realms of the economy and migration. 6 credits; HI, IS; Not offered 2019-20HIST 172 Latin America's Global Migrations This course looks at Latin America as a site of global migrants and migrations.

Disaster and Society in Latin America Did an earthquake in the 1740s cause an anti-colonial uprising in Peru? Did a hurricane in Puerto Rico help justify U.S. colonization in 1899? Did the Sandinistas provide better disaster relief than the Nicaraguan state in 1976? In this class we will explore the relationship between natural disasters and social change in Latin America, paying attention to how environmental historians and social historians answer these questions differently.

Nat Turner, an extraordinary man inspired by religious visions, led what many historians consider to be the most significant slave rebellion in American history in 1831. Booker T. Washington's ideas about racial uplift dominated African American life in the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century.

Territorial expansion over three-and-a-half centuries had brought under Russian rule a vast empire of immense diversity. The empire's subjects spoke a myriad languages, belonged to numerous religious communities, and related to the state in a wide variety of ways. Its artists produced some of the greatest literature and music of the nineteenth century and it offered fertile ground for ideologies of both conservative imperialism and radical revolution. This course surveys the panorama of this empire from its inception in the sixteenth century to its demise in the flames of World War I. Among the key analytical questions addressed are the following: How did the Russian Empire manage its diversity? How does Russia compare with other colonial empires?

Students will learn about musical form, expressive conventions such as the doctrine of affections and musical topoi, performance practice, and the social function of music. Music, and the Virtuoso From Paganini to Esperanza, Liszt to Lang Lang, Wieck to Hahn, audiences have long adored and obsessed over musical virtuosity. But what do we mean when we call someone a musical virtuoso? How is virtuosity enmeshed with ideas of genius, race, and gender? How have both historical and contemporary discourses conflated musical and sexual prowess? This class explores the above questions, concentrating on music and figures operating within the world of Western art music along with references to jazz and popular music. An ability to read music is required.</figDesc><table><row><cell>moon guitar), hulusi, bawu and dizi (Chinese bamboo flutes). 1 credit; S/CR/NC; ARP; Fall, Winter,</cell></row><row><cell>Spring; Gao Hong</cell></row><row><cell>MUSC 182J Chinese Musical Instruments (Juried) Beginning through advanced study on traditional</cell></row><row><cell>Chinese instruments, pipa (Chinese lute), erhu (Chinese violin), guzheng (Chinese zither), zhongruan</cell></row><row><cell>Not offered 2019-20 MUSC 150 Piano Weekly half-hour lessons, with repertoire selected as appropriate for the individual student's experience.

What about an opera's music creates drama? What emotions can be spurred by listening to a symphony? In this class, students will encounter different genres and styles of music from the Baroque and Classical period and ask whatand how-each one communicates to its audience. Repertory will be drawn from Bach, Gluck, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven and will be placed in the context of major intellectual and political movements.

While the course focuses on art music of the 1950s-1970s (from concert pieces by Stockhausen and Cage, to the "intermedial" art forms promoted by Fluxus, to the avant-jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane), students will also consider what a musical avant-garde in 2020 might sound like, look like, or act like. 6 credits; LA, WR2; Winter; Caitlin R Schmid MUSC 220 Composition Studio This course focuses on creating new music, through several exercises as well as a substantial term composition.

Can music tell a story, express an emotion, or convey a proposition? And if music can do any of these things, how does it do it? Last but not least, how are we to judge the value of musical pieces and musical practices? Do we need to judge popular music differently from so-called "art" music? To address these questions we will listen to a wide range of musical examples, from Bach and Mozart to the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, and we will read a wide range of writings about music, from Plato, Rousseau, and Kant to current philosophers, including Scruton, Kivy, Davies, Carroll, and Gracyk.

A writer for the well-known jazz appreciation magazine Down Beat, Lucas taught courses about jazz in the 1950s, and donated his large historic record collection to the College. We will read early written criticism and consider issues of canonization of jazz. Students will create their own compilation of early jazz recordings according to a theme, revisiting a common form of agency among jazz critics during the 1950s. 6 credits; HI, WR2 Prerequisite: Music 126.

How are new musics made, and old musics repackaged, to help mobilize social movements and create collective identity? We'll approach these questions through the work of diverse scholars and participants, through focused listening, and ultimately through guided student research projects. Among the social/musical movements we'll consider: Nueva cancíon, Rastafari, anti-Apartheid; the labor, civil rights, women's, anti-war, anti-nuclear and environmental movements, the Black Arts Movement, American Indian, Jesus, Hippie, and white nationalist Movements, and Black Lives Matter.

Lake Wobegon stereotypes aside, Minnesota has always been characterized by some diversity but the realities of immigration, dispossession, dislocation, economics, and technology have made religious diversity more pressing in its implications for every arena of civic and cultural life. This course bridges theoretical knowledge with engaged field research focused on how Midwestern contexts shape global religious communities and how these communities challenge and transform Minnesota. 6 credits; HI, IDS, WR2; Spring; Michael D McNally RELG 300 Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion What, exactly, is religion and what conditions of modernity have made it urgent to articulate such a question in the first place? Why does religion exert such force in human society and history? Is it an opiate of the masses or an illusion laden with human wish-fulfillment? Is it a social glue? A subjective experience of the sacred? Is it simply a universalized Protestant Christianity in disguise, useful in understanding, and colonizing, the non-Christian world?

Is there anything stable about a religious tradition-an essence, or a set of practices or beliefs that abide amidst diversity and mark it off from a surrounding culture or religion? How do people live out or re-invent their traditions in the modern world? In this seminar we explore questions about pluralism, identity, authority, and truth, and we examine the creative ways beliefs and practices change in relation to culture. We consider how traditions grapple with difference, especially regarding theology, ethics, law, and gender. 6 credits; HI, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 344 Lived Religion in America The practices of popular, or local, or lived religion in American culture often blur the distinction between the sacred and profane and elude religious studies frameworks based on the narrative, theological, or institutional foundations of "official" religion. This course explores American religion primarily through the lens of the practices of lived religion with respect to ritual, the body, the life cycle, the market, leisure, and popular culture. Consideration of a wide range of topics, including ritual healing, Christmas, cremation, and Elvis, will nourish an ongoing discussion about how to make sense of lived religion. 6 credits; HI, IDS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 353 Saints, Goddesses, and Whores Saint or sinner? Goddess or demon? Perfect virgin or (im-)penitent whore? Repeatedly across cultures and religious traditions, the female figure has been split-in religious texts and practices as well as in popular culture and quotidian life. This course investigates the sexualization and/or containment of women-as female sexuality is often equated with dangerand the varied responses to such containment that often produce fascinating alternatives. Christian and Hindu traditions (sometimes overlapping) will serve as fields for case studies, including: Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, mystics, Mother Theresa, Hindu goddesses and demonesses, bhakti poet-saints, politicians, and film divas. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 357 Televangelists and Cyber-Shaykhs: Explorations in Religion and Media Beyond the mystic ideal of approaching the divine without intermediary, all believers have encountered religious truth only by the use of certain material objects, certain media that act as tools to help the believer develop piety or communicate theological truth. This course is interested in these "in-betweens," these media, objects and material that religious people use to approach the divine, as well as the impact of new medias (electronic or otherwise) on the development of modern religiosity. Students will be asked to roll-up their sleeves and delve into primary source material gathered from internet, television, popular literature and material culture. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IS; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 359 Buddhist Studies India Program: Buddhist Meditation Traditions Students will complement their understanding of Buddhist thought and culture through the study and practice of traditional meditation disciplines. This course emphasizes the history, characteristics, and approach of three distinct meditation traditions within Buddhism: Vipassana, Zazen, and Dzogchen. Meditation practice and instruction is led in the morning and evening six days a week by representatives of these traditions who possess a theoretical as well as practical understanding of their discipline. Lectures and discussions led by the program director complement and contextualize the three meditation traditions being studied. Prerequisite: Acceptance into the Carleton-Antioch Program required. 8 credits; NE, IS; Fall; Arthur P McKeown RELG 362 Spirit Possession This course considers spirit possession in relation to religion, gender, and agency. Through surveying a number of works on spirit possession--recent and past, theoretical and ethnographic--we will analyze representations of the female subject in particular and arguments about agency that attend these representations. This class will explicitly look at post-colonial accounts of spirit possession and compare them to Euro-American Christian conceptions of personhood. We will consider how these Euro-Christian conceptions might undergird secular-liberal constructions of agency, and contribute to feminist ideas about the proper female subject. 6 credits; HI, WR2, IS; Winter; Kristin C Bloomer RELG 365 Mysticism Drawing from selected traditional texts and modern analyses, we will investigate the human encounter with ultimate reality. Questions we will consider include: What is the definition and typology of mysticism? Is mystical experience truly ineffable? What are its modes of expression? Do all mystics experience the same reality? Is unmediated experience possible? Do mystical experiences show us the truth? Is there a place for reason on a mystical path? What is the role of the body and brain in mystical practice? Does mystical experience make us good? Does it free us? Are mystics critics of institutional religion or social injustice? 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 380 Radical Critiques of Christianity This course introduces students to some of the most radical critiques brought against the foundations of Christian theology (by philosophers and theologians, outsiders and insiders, alike) in the modern period. We examine critiques concerning the authority and historical veracity of scripture, the nature and status of Christian doctrines, the true meaning of faith, the relation between Christian theology and oppressive power, and the value of Christian morality. We also consider the work of Christian theologians who have embraced these critical perspectives and who have put them to use in their efforts to reform and redefine Christianity. Prerequisites: Prior coursework in philosophy or Christian theology is desirable, but there is no prerequisite for the course. 6 credits; HI; Not offered 2019-20 RELG 399 Senior Research Seminar This seminar will acquaint students with research tools in various fields of religious studies, provide an opportunity to present and discuss research work in progress, hone writing skills, and improve oral presentation techniques.

How has the conception of kinship and the 'normal' family changed over the generations? In this introductory class, we examine these questions, drawing on a variety of course materials ranging from classic works in sociology to contemporary blogs on family life. The class focuses on diversity in family life, paying particular attention to the intersection between the family, race and ethnicity, and social class. We'll examine these issues at the micro and macro level, incorporating texts that focus on individuals' stories as well as demographics of the family. 6 credits; SI, QRE, IDS; Fall; Liz Raleigh SOAN 134 Economic Anthropology This course examines the ways that economies are embedded in social relations. How should we define affluence? Is barter a useful system for today? What relationships exist between ecology and culture? Formulating an anthropological perspective for the interpretation of pre-capitalist economies, what practical lessons can we learn from the study of hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, and peasants? We will also discuss the meaning of money, articulation between local and global economies, gender bias in classical exchange theory, Mauss on gift-giving, and Marx on "commodity fetishism." Theoretical material will be illustrated with ethnographic examples from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 140 Animals and Society Other-than-human animals are an overwhelming presence in our collective and individual lives. In this course, we will explore questions regarding the intersection of the lives of human and non-human animals from a sociological perspective. Such questions include: Why do we love some animals to the point of considering them family members, but vilify and even eat others? Are "pets" monsters of dependence created by human oppression, or do pets and people co-exist interdependently? Is human treatment of non-human animals related in significant ways to such enduring social problems as racism, sexism, and violence against vulnerable groups? 6 credits; SI; Fall; Emily A Bowman SOAN 151 Global Minnesota: An Anthropology of Our State The state of Minnesota, like the rest of the U.S., has been formed by the migration and settlement of peoples from across the world at different historical moments. Though often hidden from public view, the state is home to peoples with diverse cultural and religious practices, making Minnesota a microcosm of the global. This course will provide an anthropology of Minnesota by examining the different migration histories and experiences of Minnesota's varied population groups. Through a study of the making of Minnesota and its population groups, the course will examine borders and movement from a global and historical perspective, as well as explore the presence of different cultural and religious groups in Minnesota and the social relations they form. This course will help students see Minnesota and the people that call it home in new ways. 6 credits; SI, WR2, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 160 Anthropology of the Body We often think about our bodies as natural and self-evident. But, what bodies can do and how bodies are understood changes dramatically across historical and cultural contexts. In this class, we investigate how human bodies are valued, transformed, and experienced in different societies around the world. Through engagements with ethnographic research on such topics as sports training, bodily modification and beauty, and biomedical technologies, the class demonstrates how bodies are key sites for understanding politics, economics, and social change in our contemporary world. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 170 Investigating (In)Equality: Comparative Welfare States Is health care coverage a right of citizenship, or a commodity purchased in the marketplace? Where does the responsibility of caring for children and the elderly lie? Nations around the world answer these and similar policy questions quite differently, resulting in wide-ranging consequences. Sociologists use the phrase "welfare state" to refer to the role the government plays in protecting and promoting citizens' well being. By comparing the U.S. welfare state with that of other countries, we will examine the socio-cultural mechanisms that shape equality/inequality and investigate the impact of the welfare state on both social institutions and people's life chances. 6 credits; SI, IDS; Winter; Emily A Bowman SOAN 180 Anthropology and Colonialism in Africa How has Africa been shaped by colonialism and what has been the relationship of anthropology to colonialism? Between 1884 and 1960, Africa was restructured by colonial rule. This course will examine how colonialism transformed the laws, political structures, political economy, and religion of different colonial states. It will also examine the complicated relationship between the discipline of anthropology and colonialism. In doing so, we will draw from ethnographies and historical studies and analyze the role of anthropologists in Africa during the colonial era and its aftermath. 6 credits; SI, IS, WR2; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 203 Anthropology of Good Intentions Is the environmental movement making progress? Do responsible products actually help local populations? Is international AID alleviating poverty and fostering development? Today there are thousands of programs with sustainable development goals yet their effectiveness is often contested at the local level. This course explores the impacts of sustainable development, conservation, and AID programs to look beyond the good intentions of those that implement them. In doing so we hope to uncover common pitfalls behind good intentions and the need for sound social analysis that recognizes, examines, and evaluates the role of cultural complexity found in populations targeted by these programs. Prerequisite: The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above. 6 credits; SI, IS; Fall; Constanza Ocampo-Raeder SOAN 222 Anthropology of Humor Laughter is found in all human societies, but we do not all laugh at the same things. In this course we will discuss why, cross-culturally, some things are funny and others are not, and what forms humor may take (jokes, riddles, teasing, banter, clowning). We will look at such topics as joking relationships, evolutionary aspects of laughter and smiling, sexual inequality in humor, ethnic humor, and humor in religion and language. Some prior exposure to anthropology is desirable but not required. The main prerequisite for the course is a serious sense of humor. Not open to students who have taken Sociology/Anthropology 122. Prerequisite: Previous coursework in Sociology/Anthropology. 6 credits; SI; Winter; Jerome M LeviSOAN 226  Anthropology of Gender This course examines gender and gender relations from an anthropological perspective. We discuss such key concepts as gender, voice/mutedness, status, public and private spheres, and the gendered division of labor, and explore the intellectual history of these terms and how they have been used. The course focuses on two areas: 1) the role of sex, sexuality, and procreation in creating cultural notions of gender, and 2) the impacts of colonialism, globalization, and economic underdevelopment on Third World women. Readings include both theoretical articles and ethnographic case studies from around the world.

Classical sociologists devoted enormous attention to the topic of religion, famously linking it to the development of capitalism and Western modernity (Weber), to social solidarity and symbolic classification systems (Durkheim), to political passivity and social conservatism (Marx), and to the varying forms of social, economic, and political life found in the world's great civilizations. This course focuses on special topics in the contemporary sociology of religion, with a particular emphasis on religion in public and political life in American and global civil society.

Topics covered include research design, data collection, and analysis of data. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are considered. Student will demonstrate their knowledge by developing a research proposal that is implementable. What is the difference between ethnocide, genocide, and other forms of mass violence? Can there be genocide without the intent to commit genocide? What are the ethical implications of relativism and limits to state sovereignty? How can genocide be prevented? This course considers these and related questions though the lens of the field's foundational thinkers, such as Raphael Lemkin, Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi, and Zygmunt Bauman, and focuses on specific cases of genocide, including those of indigenous peoples (with emphasis on Native America), Armenia, Stalin's Terror, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 256 Africa: Representation and Conflict Pairing classics in Africanist anthropology with contemporary re-studies, we explore changes in African societies and in the questions anthropologists have posed about them. We address issues of representation and self-presentation in written ethnographies as well as in African portrait photography. We then turn from the visual to the invisible realm of African witchcraft. Initiation rituals, war, and migration place selfhood and belonging back in this-world contexts. In-depth case studies include, among others: the Cameroon Grassfields, the Bemba of Zambia, and the Nuer of South Sudan.

We will explore social structures in India--through a focus on key areas of everyday life such as family, religion, economy, systems of stratification and social movements. Close attention will be given to religious nationalism, globalization and militarism as dominant trends affecting contemporary India. We will consider: How has India been represented in the Western imagination and why do such representations matter? What are the forces of modernity and tradition in India? What are the similarities and differences in systems of stratification in India and the United States? Prerequisite: The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above. 6 credits; SI, IS; Not offered 2019-20 SOAN 259 Comparative Issues in Native North America This course examines the cultural and historical situation of indigenous groups in the United States, Mexico, and Canada to develop a comparative perspective for understanding native peoples in North America. How have indigenous peoples variously coped with continuity and change? What strategies have they employed in pursuit of political sovereignty, economic survival, and cultural vitality? In answering these questions, we will explore the politics of representation regarding "the Indian" as a symbol in national consciousness; the negotiation of identity in inter-ethnic contexts; patterns of resistance; the impact of European powers and state agendas; and the resurgence of tradition.

Our focus is on the United States with topics under examination including white collar crime, racial disparities in the criminal justice system, mass incarceration and other transformations in punishment, prisoner reentry, and the risk of recidivism. In addition to understanding both classic and contemporary sociological research and theory, we will seek answers to questions like: What is crime? Who is considered a criminal? What social changes drove the United States to get "tough" on crime? What effects does incarceration have on prisoners, their families, their neighborhoods and communities? What happens when prisoners return to society?

Why is poverty depicted as having a woman's face? Is the solution to the environmental crisis in the hands of women the nurturers? From overly romantic notions of stewardship to the feminization of poverty, this course aims to evaluate women's relationships with local environments and development initiatives. The course uses anthropological frameworks to evaluate case studies from around the world.

This course focuses on influential texts and ideas generated by these and other theorists from sociology's "classical era," how these texts and ideas are put to use by contemporary sociologists, and on more recent theoretical developments and critical perspectives that have influenced the field. Prerequisite: The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above. These questions are commonly asked in public and academic forums but what discussions often overlook is the fact that these are fundamentally social questions and thus social analysis is needed to understand them fully. This course aims at exploring key issues of human/nature interactions by using anthropological critiques and frameworks of analysis to show how culture is a critical variable to understanding these interactions in all their complexity.

We will examine and analyze the structural processes that have shaped contact among indigenous, European, and non-European immigrants (e.g. African and Asian peoples) in Latin America since the Conquest and through colonial periods to understand today's Latin American societies. We will pay special attention to the impacts of global capitalist expansion and state formation, sites of resilience and resistance, as well as the movement of Latin American peoples throughout the world today. Course themes will address gender, identity, social organization, indigeneity, immigration, social inequality and environment.

He or she possesses a variety of qualities not measurable in test scores: warmth, openness, a sense of humor, an active interest in social service and in community involvement, initiative, resourcefulness, motivation and personal courage. Although many applicants rank in the top tenth of their high school classes with SAT critical reading or math scores above 700, or an ACT composite score above 32, many attractive candidates do not. A sizeable number not possessing such lofty credentials are admitted in the belief that these are restrictive measures of ability and success and do not always assess adequately the human characteristics which are so important to the quality of a student's success in Carleton's residential liberal arts environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application for Admission: Students interested in applying for admission should visit</head><p>Carleton's Admissions website. Each applicant is responsible for providing the admissions office with all items requested.</p><p>Early Decision: Those who decide that Carleton is their first choice college are encouraged to apply under the Early Decision program. Early Decision is a commitment to attend if accepted. Students may submit applications to other colleges or universities, but not under another early decision plan. Those accepted will be expected to withdraw all other applications.</p><p>Early Decision candidates are reviewed at two different times of the year, but whenever the student applies the criteria for selection are identical. Students electing the Early Decision option should submit all necessary materials by one of the following dates:</p><p>• November 15. Applicants will receive decisions by December 15, and admitted candidates will have until January 15 to submit the $300 confirming deposit. • January 15. Applicants will receive decisions by February 15, and admitted candidates will have until March 1 to submit the $300 confirming deposit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regular Decision:</head><p>Application deadline is January 15. Applicants on Regular Decision will receive notification from the College by April 1 of the senior year. Those offered admission will have until May 1 to make the $300 confirming deposit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Yueh-Townsend Asian Fellowship</head><p>The Yueh-Townsend Asian Fellowship Fund was created by Emily Yueh '02 and Seth Townsend in 2013. Emily's studies at Carleton included an off-campus experience with Professor Roy Grow, which ultimately led to Emily's passion and curiosity for international studies. By establishing this fund, Emily is giving Carleton students who have completed their first year a similar opportunity to expand their cultural understanding and complement their academics through study in Asia. The Yueh-Townsend Asian Fellowship Fund will support research or other experiences in Asia (defined as East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia) during either summer or winter breaks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trophy Awards</head><p>The following trophy awards are made annually to individual students in the groups indicated.</p><p>The Warren L. Beson Memorial Award for athletic and academic excellence is given to a senior who has won one or more awards in any sport, has a high scholastic average, and is unanimously recommended by the Director of Athletics, the Dean of Students, the faculty representative to the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and the officers of the "C" Club. The award is not necessarily given annually. Alumni support Carleton through both organized and individual activities, on and off campus, including assistance to the Office of Admissions (through the Alumni Admissions Program) the Career Center, the Alumni Annual Fund and academic departments of the College. Alumni are also represented on the Board of Trustees and on the College Council. In turn, Carleton serves its alumni by keeping them informed through publications like The Carleton Voice, regional and class communications and the Carleton web site. The College also sponsors reunions, meetings, seminars, workshops, off-campus activities, lifelong learning opportunities, and other functions which bring together alumni, faculty, parents, friends, and students. The Office of Alumni Relations is the primary point of contact between the College and its alumni.</p></div>			</div>
