<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pepperdine is a Christian university committed to the highest standards of academic excellence and Christian values, where students are strengthened for lives of purpose, service, and leadership.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>As a Christian university, Pepperdine affirms:</head><p>That God is That God is revealed uniquely in Christ That the educational process may not, with impunity, be divorced from the divine process That the student, as a person of infinite dignity, is the heart of the educational enterprise That the quality of student life is a valid concern of the University That truth, having nothing to fear from investigation, should be pursued relentlessly in every discipline That spiritual commitment, tolerating no excuse for mediocrity, demands the highest standards of academic excellence That freedom, whether spiritual, intellectual, or economic, is indivisible That knowledge calls, ultimately, for a life of service</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>President's Message</head><p>Pepperdine is a premier, global, Christian university. Our mission is to strengthen students for lives of purpose, service, and leadership. Our world is in need of brave, young leaders who know the difference between truth and its counterfeit and possess the character to stand for the truth at all cost. However, these kinds of leaders are not born-they are built-and I believe that Pepperdine is uniquely positioned to deliver on the promise of building and sending these leaders into the world. That promise is for you.</p><p>Over the course of history, nearly every college or university that began as a faith-based institution felt it had to choose between excellence in academics and excellence in faith. But at Pepperdine, we believe they are intertwined and that they can-and they must-ascend together. Intellectual excellence starts with the academic culture created by our nationally esteemed faculty through their scholarship and teaching. We refuse to compromise on the rigor, scholarship, and mentoring that it takes to shape brilliant leaders.</p><p>Equally important, Jesus modeled an "open arms" and "open table" approach to life and faith. At Pepperdine, we are unapologetically Christian, which means . <ref type="bibr">.</ref> . we invite and welcome the world into our community. We invite everyone here because God designed life that way. He designed us to do life together. He designed us to need each other-to belong to each other. He designed us with different gifts and different views, and he strengthens us and teaches us through the vehicle of different perspectives.</p><p>Welcome to Pepperdine. I hope and pray that you are challenged and equipped here to be the best leader you could possibly be.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERAL INFORMATION</head><p>leaders in technological innovation and collaborative learning environments. Students in the psychology programs are educated in human-service fields, including clinical psychology and marriage and family therapy.</p><p>broadly, present papers at meetings of professional societies, hold offices in professional organizations, and conduct innovative research. While engaging in many scholarly activities, faculty members remain committed to the challenge of nurturing the intellectual growth of students. Students at Seaver College have the unique opportunity of establishing close, professional mentoring relationships with their professors.</p><p>A degree from Seaver College signifies that the recipient has completed a rigorous undergraduate education under the guidance of professors who are committed to high academic standards and to Christian values. The graduate leaves Seaver College with a rich foundation of knowledge essential to a meaningful personal life and a system of values necessary for coping with the complexities of modern society.</p><p>immunizations complete and uploaded in their patient portal before arriving on campus will prevent delays in registration or class selection. Students who do not meet posted deadlines for the health requirements will have a hold placed on their WaveNet account until the requirements are complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Insurance</head><p>The University requires that all students have a US-based health insurance plan. All Seaver students registered on the Malibu campus, both domestic and international and including those studying abroad, are required to provide either proof of US-based health insurance plan OR enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP).</p><p>It is highly recommended that all students purchase health insurance coverage that includes local care close to Malibu. Students who choose not to enroll in SHIP must provide proof of US-based health insurance plan each academic year through the online waiver system.</p><p>For more information on the insurance requirement, the waiver process and deadlines, visit community.pepperdine.edu/healthcenter/ healthinsurance.</p><p>This section provides basic information regarding admission to undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate programs at Seaver College. The Seaver College Office of Admission will provide further admission information upon request. Prospective students are encouraged to experience Pepperdine University by setting up a campus visit. Please contact the Office of Admission for more information.</p><p>Seaver College is a faith-based university committed to the highest standards of academic excellence and Christian values. As a student at Seaver College, you will be strengthened for a life of purpose, service, and leadership. Applicants are admitted on the basis of academic and personal qualities. While the University believes that families and students have the primary responsibility for meeting the cost of an education, the Office of Financial Assistance is dedicated to providing the tools and resources necessary to help bridge the gap between the cost of Pepperdine and the family's contribution. For further information, see the "Financial Assistance" section of this catalog.</p><p>Students are advised that admission is contingent upon the truthfulness of the information contained in the application file. Discovery of false or incomplete information subsequent to the offer of admission is, at the college's discretion, grounds for withdrawal of the offer of admission or for immediate dismissal at any point in the student's course of study. Such dismissal shall result in forfeiture of all charges paid and academic credits earned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Admission</head><p>Seaver College seeks to enroll students who show significant promise of achieving academic success. The Admission Committee reviews the student' s current academic record to determine and evaluate the GPA, the number and kinds of classes taken, the trends in the grades, and scores from the SAT I or <ref type="bibr">ACT.</ref> Personal qualities that will enable a student to benefit from the educational and social experience at Seaver College and to contribute positively to the campus community are also important considerations. The information included in the application for admission and the recommendations the student submits are vital to the personal approach taken in the admission process. Seaver College wishes to view the total person and let all the information contribute to the appropriate admission decision for the college and for the student.</p><p>In the belief that students benefit greatly from living on campus, all new students are required to live in Pepperdine housing and carry a meal plan for four semesters. All candidates who are admitted will need to complete their housing contract. All new transfer students entering as juniors are required to live on campus for two semesters. To ensure availability of campus housing, a request for housing must be made of the Housing and Residence Life Office. Students should contact the Housing and Residence Life Office (community.pepperdine.edu/housing) for the most current information about housing policies and availability.</p><p>A limited number of students are admitted for the spring semester. Applications and supporting documents for students seeking admission to the spring semester, which begins in early January, should be completed by October 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Conditions</head><p>Offers of admission are conditional on the receipt of official academic records. To enroll in course work at Seaver College, all students must submit an official, final high school transcript with a posted graduation date, and an official standardized test score report directly from the testing agency that matches the student's self-reported scores. If a student's academic performance significantly declines between the time of application submission and the receipt of final transcripts, or if their self-reported test scores are inaccurate, an offer of admission may be revoked. Admitted students are also expected to uphold the policies and character expectations of the school, as well as federal and state laws and policies. Therefore, an offer of admission may be revoked for conduct incidences that occur between the time of application and the point of enrollment.</p><p>An admission offer is valid for the term indicated on the admission decision. An admitted student who desires to enter Seaver College in a term other than indicated on the acceptance notification must complete the reapplication process. Complete instructions for the Reapplication Process may be secured from the Office of Admission website at seaver.pepperdine.edu/admission. Students who reapply will be reevaluated with all other applicants for the new term. Admission to a future term is not guaranteed.</p></div>

If currently attending a US high school, students should have their counselors upload copies of transcripts from all secondary schools attended outside and within the United States via the Common Application. Grades transferred or translated from a previous school onto a current transcript are not accepted. For specific questions regarding submission of transcripts, please contact admission-oiss@pepperdine.edu.</p><p>• Students from educational systems with external exams (i.e., (I) GCSE/ AS/A level, IB, CSEC/CAPE, CBSE/CISCE, etc.) should submit certified external exam certificates/results in addition to internal marks to finalize the high school transcript requirement.</p><p>• Students must take the SAT I or ACT by October in order to meet the November 1 Early Action deadline or by December in order to meet the January 15 Regular Decision deadline.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission of Transfer Students</head><p>Students may enter Seaver College for the first time as transfer students. Seaver College welcomes students who have achieved a level of maturity and competence through college experiences elsewhere.</p><p>Transfer students must supply the following:</p><p>• An application for admission, including a response to all essay questions and a nonrefundable $65 application processing fee.</p><p>• An academic letter of recommendation.</p><p>• Official transcripts from the high school of graduation and from each college attended, whether or not work was completed. In addition to the official high school transcript indicating any completed course work, applicants who did not graduate from high school must also submit official GED (General Educational Development) or CHSPE (California High School Proficiency Examination) documentation indicating a passing score.</p><p>• Students who have attended institutions or high schools outside of the United States must arrange for their secondary schools to send official transcripts, along with English translations.</p><p>• ACT or SAT I scores are required if the applicant has completed fewer than 30 transferable semester units of college work elsewhere at the time of application.</p><p>Students who have attended regionally accredited colleges will receive advanced standing according to the number of acceptable college units previously completed. Credit received on a basis other than the semester unit will be converted to the semester system. Seaver College grants unit credit for all transferable courses completed with a grade of C or higher at other regionally accredited colleges within seven years of the term of matriculation at Pepperdine. The Academic Advising Center will review other courses on a case-by-case basis. All such credits are transferable, with the exception of remedial-level courses, and nonacademic courses as determined by the Academic Advising <ref type="bibr">Center. No</ref> grades from courses transferred to Seaver College will count toward the student's GPA.</p><p>Students transferring to Seaver College from two-year or four-year colleges will receive credit for a maximum of 64 semester units. No student may count more than 4 units of physical education course work toward graduation. Credits taken at a two-year college after the student has earned a total of 64 units at any college, including Seaver College, will not be transferred. At least 64 units of course work must be taken at Seaver College. The last 28 units worth of requirements must be taken at Seaver College. No more than 15 units of extension credit will be accepted in transfer. These units will be accepted as elective units; however, with divisional dean approval, these courses may fulfill major or general education requirements.</p><p>Degree audit reports will be issued to transfer students by the Academic Advising Center following acceptance into Seaver College. Students wishing to explore the possibility of elective courses counting for major or general education requirements should submit a Request for Transfer or Substitution of Units Form to the Academic Advising Center. Students must provide documentation from the school catalog or copies of the specific pages of the course descriptions in question. For courses from international institutions, the Office of International Student Services will review international institutions and courses internally using consistent and reputable resources. International evaluations by outside vendors will not be utilized.</p><p>Transfer students who enter with 30 or more transferable semester units are not required to take the first-year seminar.</p></div>

After eight regular semesters of aid, students will no longer be eligible to receive institutional, federal, or state aid. Students pursuing additional major(s) and/or minor(s) are also limited to the maximum of eight regular semesters of financial assistance as well as summer sessions completed before graduation. If students want to pursue an additional degree, they may be eligible to borrow through federal loans, provided they have not yet reached their aggregate loan limits, and/or may qualify for outside sources of financial assistance such as outside scholarships and/or private loans. Students may also inquire within their major's department regarding departmental scholarship opportunities.</p><p>Financial assistance is intended for full-time students (12-18 units) per semester. Students enrolled in 19 units or more may qualify for loans to cover the difference. If during the fall/spring semester(s) a student's enrollment drops below full-time status, their institutional financial assistance (grants and scholarships) will be prorated based on the revised tuition charges. Institutional grants/scholarships will be prorated using the same tuition grant percentage (TGP) that they receive based on full-time enrollment during the current regular academic year. This TGP is not the same TGP used to calculate summer grant tuition percentages. The academic year federal and state aid will also be prorated. Students must enroll in a minimum of six units to qualify for most federal and state financial assistance. Students are encouraged to reference the proration guide and to utilize the online proration calculator on our website for additional information.</p><p>Students enrolled in the five-year bachelor of science/MBA program will no longer qualify for Seaver undergraduate financial assistance once they are no longer enrolled at Seaver. Financial assistance may be available at the Pepperdine Graziadio Business School for the remaining semesters if they qualify.</p><p>• Classes with grades of A, B, C, D, and Cr (credit) are considered to have been completed. Classes with grades of F, NC (no credit), I (incomplete) and WD, W, WF (grade withheld) will not be considered as completed but will be calculated in the attempted units.</p><p>• Courses graded as Incomplete, Failed, Not Passed, or Withdrawn count toward attempted units.</p><p>• In the event that a student receives permission to repeat a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. Only the first repeat of a passed course may be covered using federal financial aid. Any second or subsequent repetition of a passed course may not be covered using federal financial aid funds.</p><p>• Transfer units will be counted toward both the attempted and completed units that have been accepted by the University for degree credit.

The maximum time frame is calculated by multiplying the units/time normally required to complete an academic program by 150 percent. An undergraduate degree requires 128 units, and students are expected to complete their undergraduate degree by the end of four years of full-time study. Therefore, the maximum time frame for an undergraduate student's degree completion is 192 attempted units (128 required units x 150% = 192 possible attempted units), or six years of fulltime enrollment (4 years x 150% = 6 possible years), whichever comes first.

The Office of Financial Assistance will monitor compliance with the SAP policy for each student. Students must meet the requirements of the SAP policy outlined below to be eligible to receive financial aid. Questions about SAP policy should be addressed to the Office of Financial Assistance. The SAP standards consist of the following:</p><p>• GPA Standard: Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative 3.000 GPA.</p><p>• Pace Standard: students must maintain a 67 percent completion rate of all attempted units per semester, which will be re-evaluated at the close of each term.</p><p>• Classes with grades of A, B, C, D, and Cr (credit) are considered to have been completed.

The process of disputing a grade assignment must be initiated by the student before the midpoint of the next non-summer semester which immediately follows the course in question.</p><p>Most grade issues can and should be resolved privately between the student and instructor. This is the starting point with all grade disputes. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by these means, the following appeals procedure shall apply: 1. The student shall submit a written appeal to the divisional dean with a copy to the instructor, identifying the course, semester, grade received, and the reason for the appeal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>The student shall assemble all relevant class materials (syllabi, returned assignments, tests, papers, etc.) distributed or returned by the instructor to the student. These materials need to be compiled within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. If the student cannot assemble all such documents, the grade dispute is concluded with no grade change.</p><p>3. Concurrently, the instructor will assemble all relevant class materials retained for this student (final exams, midterms, etc.) within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. A copy of these documents along with the syllabus, grade book, and the instructor's written response to the student appeal is to be forwarded by the instructor to the divisional dean. If the instructor cannot produce all relevant documents pertinent to the student's work in the course, the grade dispute will be taken up by the instructor's divisional dean in consultation with the associate dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>The divisional dean will appoint an ad hoc committee of two faculty members within the division who teach the course (or a similar one) in question. This committee will then evaluate the student's course materials based on the following criteria:</p><p>• Have all assignments and examinations been administered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the course syllabus?</p><p>• Has all student work been graded fairly, consistently, and accurately?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies</head><p>At the conclusion of the committee's evaluation of the course material, it will submit a written recommendation and explanation to the divisional dean. The recommendation must be one of the following:</p><p>• Uphold the grade given by the instructor, or • Require that the instructor re-grade one or more assignments, followed by a recalculation of the student's grade, or</p><p>• Require that the instructor formulate a repeat of one or more class assignments or assessments, followed by a recalculation of the student's grade, or</p><p>• Recommend a specified grade change.</p><p>Based on the ad hoc committee's findings, it shall be the divisional dean's decision, in consultation with the associate dean of Seaver College, as to whether the grade shall be changed. This decision will be final. No further appeal in possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete and In-Progress Courses</head><p>A grade of I, indicating incomplete work, is assigned to a student who has attended class but, because of a documented emergency in the last quarter of the term, fails to complete required course work. The student must initiate the I request at the Academic Advising Center and upon approval, must complete a contract with the professor in order to receive an I. If an I is assigned at the end of the fall semester, the course work must be completed by the date specified in the student's contract with the instructor but no later than the end of the subsequent spring semester or the I will default to an F. If an I is assigned at the end of either the spring semester or the summer term, the I will default to an F at the end of the following fall semester. Courses taken on a Cr/NC basis will default to NC if not completed on time. A shorter period of time for completion may be assigned at the instructor's request. In such cases, the student will not be notified by the Office of Student Information and Services that the I grade has lapsed into the F grade. Students requesting an extension of the I deadline must petition the Credits Committee before the deadline. (See "Exceptions to Academic Policy.") Students with financial assistance should refer to the financial assistance policies and how these grades may affect eligibility.</p><p>A grade of IP is assigned at the end of the semester only in courses which, by catalog definition, are allowed more than one semester for completion, e.g., student teaching, graduate readings, graduate theses, and graduate projects. Students who receive a grade of I or IP should not re-enroll in the course for the subsequent semester. Different policies may apply for Incompletes resulting from disciplinary action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructor-Initiated Drop</head><p>Students who improperly register for any course may be subject to an instructor-initiated drop. That is, prior to or during the add/drop period, the division or the instructor of the course in question may notify the registrar to drop the student from the course. Improper registration includes registering without the prerequisites stated in this catalog, registering in upperlevel courses before having successfully completed 30 units if placement examination requirements have not been met, and registering without the instructor's permission as specified in certain courses.</p><p>Students who fail to attend a course within the first 100 minutes of scheduled class meeting time may be dropped from the course by the instructor. Instructor-initiated drop is not automatic for students who improperly register or who do not attend the first 100 minutes of class. It is the student's responsibility to drop or withdraw from a class that he or she fails to attend since instructor-initiated drops do not apply automatically.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximum Credit Policy for Summer Sessions</head><p>Students may not register for more than eight units per summer session without permission from their academic advisor. Summer courses, while taught in a compressed time period, still require work equivalent to a semester-length course. Even a single course can create a considerable workload, and consideration of this workload should weigh heavily in decisions to take more than one class per session.</p></div>

In addition, many courses have prerequisites, which are listed in the Seaver College catalog. Students who have not met the prerequisites for a course may be dropped from the course by the instructor or division prior to or during the first week of class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission of Military Service Members</head><p>Students who cannot attend Pepperdine because of military service will be readmitted with the same academic status achieved when they last attended or were accepted to the University. The student must notify Pepperdine of the military service and the intention to return to school as follows:</p><p>• Notification of military service. The student (or an appropriate officer of the armed forces or official of the Department of Defense) must give oral or written notice of such service to the school as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances.</p><p>• Notification of intent to return to school. The student must also give oral or written notice of an intent to return to Pepperdine within three years after the completion of the period of service.</p><p>A student's readmission rights terminate in the case of a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, general court-martial, federal or state prison sentence, or other reasons as described in 34 CFR <ref type="bibr">668.18(h)</ref> federal regulations.</p><p>For additional information, please contact the Veterans Affairs Office: (310) 506-7999.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration</head><p>An official registration period is scheduled for each semester. After the official registration period, a late registration fee is charged. Students who do not complete registration properly or who fail to secure final approval from the Office of Student Information and Services are not considered officially enrolled, may not attend courses, and will be denied all credit for the semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcripts of Academic Records</head><p>Official transcripts of academic records are furnished upon payment of a fee for each transcript issued. Normally, official transcripts are delivered by mail. Official transcripts can be given to the student only in a sealed envelope. If the seal is broken, the transcript ceases to be official. Students may request transcripts at OneStop or at pepperdine.edu/registrar/transcripts. For pickup or walk-in service, the request should be filed at OneStop at least one day before the transcript is needed. More time may be required for transcripts from semesters prior to January 1987. At the end of each semester, two weeks may be required to process a transcript request due to grade processing and degree postings. Requests for partial transcripts will not be accepted. No transcript will be supplied for course work taken at other institutions. Current students may obtain unofficial transcripts through WaveNet.</p><p>Outstanding balances on a student account, or defaulting on other financial obligations with the University by the student, will prevent him/her from registering for classes and will result in the University not publishing the student's grades for the last term in attendance on his/her transcripts.</p><p>Additionally, degrees and/or certificates will not be conferred nor posted on the student's transcript until all University obligations (academic, financial, and otherwise) are fulfilled. Every student with a loan must complete an exit interview with the Office of Financial Assistance before their student records will be released.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Veterans and Standards of Progress Information</head><p>Veterans, service people, and qualified dependents intending to use VA benefits should contact the VA coordinator and be aware of the following policies:</p><p>• It is the student's responsibility to notify the VA coordinator immediately when increasing or decreasing unit load, withdrawing, or taking a leave of absence.</p><p>• Appropriate credit for previous education will be granted.</p><p>• All students using VA benefits must make satisfactory progress toward their educational objectives. In general, unsatisfactory progress for veterans' benefits is considered attainment of less than a 2.000 GPA for two consecutive semesters (3.000 for graduate students). In addition, the VA will only reimburse students for classes required to earn their degree. Students who withdraw from the college may have their benefits terminated as of the date of withdrawal. Students who fail to complete all courses attempted in a semester will have their benefits adjusted.</p><p>• Students who withdraw from a course (or courses) in the middle of the semester will have their benefits adjusted based on the date of withdrawal.</p><p>• For graduate students who are veterans: in the academic year, full-time enrollment is defined as eight or more units; three-quarter is five to seven units; half-time is four units, and less than half-time is one to three units. In the summer, full-time enrollment is four units; threequarter time is three units; half-time is two units; less than half-time is one unit. Students granted permission to enroll in GR 699 are classified as full-time. For information on status definitions for federal financial aid, please see "Full-Time and Part-Time Student Status" in the catalog sections dealing with academic policies for graduate students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from Courses</head><p>Prior to the end of the eighth week of a semester (second week during the summer session), a student may withdraw from any course by contacting OneStop by Pepperdine email or in person. The transcript will indicate a grade of W for such withdrawals. No financial adjustment will be made for withdrawals after the fifth week of a semester or the second week of a summer session. Students should be aware that adding and withdrawing from classes may result in charges over and above the flat-rate tuition charge. Special policies are in effect for students enrolled in classes that do not follow the traditional semester calendar.</p><p>Students wishing to withdraw from a course after the end of the eighth week of the semester must do so through OneStop no later than one week prior to the last day of regular class meetings. The instructor will assign a grade of WP indicating withdraw passing, WF indicating withdraw failing, or WP/NC in Cr/NC classes, depending on the student's status at the time of last attendance. The WF will be calculated as an F in the GPA.</p><p>Students who have attended classes but who do not officially withdraw will automatically be assigned an F by their instructors. Students may not withdraw from a first-year seminar unless they are completely withdrawing from the <ref type="bibr">University.</ref> Withdrawals are official only upon timely written notification to OneStop. Information or changes in the registration of any student receiving veterans' benefits will be forwarded to the Veterans Administration whenever such changes occur.</p><p>International students in F-1 visa status must obtain permission from the Office of International Student Services before withdrawing from courses if they cannot maintain full-time enrollment, consisting of at least 12 units.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from the College</head><p>A student who fails to attend class or leaves Seaver College for any reason must officially withdraw through OneStop. In addition, students living on campus who withdraw after the add/drop period must check out with the Housing and Residence Life Office. Only those students who follow these procedures are considered to have withdrawn officially. The withdrawal fee policy applies. (See Add/Drop Policy in this section.) International students in F-1 visa status must notify and be advised by the Office of International Student Services before withdrawing from the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies for Undergraduate Students Academic Probation and Dismissal</head><p>A minimum GPA of 2.000 (C) for work taken at Seaver College and for work done in the major(s) is required for the bachelor's degree. When a student's cumulative GPA falls below 2.000, that student is placed on academic probation, which is considered a warning. Any student on academic probation must: (1) earn a minimum GPA of 2.000 in the next term of enrollment, and (2) be removed from academic probation within one calendar year. Failure to meet either stipulation will result in academic dismissal. Before requesting readmission, students who are academically dismissed must demonstrate successful completion of a full load of classes elsewhere for at least one term and fulfill all other requirements as specified by the Credits Committee.</p><p>A student is considered in good academic standing unless he or she is placed on continued academic probation. Continued academic probation occurs when a student on academic probation earns a term GPA of 2.000 or higher in the subsequent academic semester, but his or her cumulative GPA remains below 2.000. Students on continued academic probation may remain enrolled but will no longer be considered in good academic standing.</p><p>International students in F-1 visa status who are placed on continued academic probation should promptly make an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO) in the Office of International Student Services for important immigration advisement.</p><p>Please consult the Academic Advising website for additional information: community.pepperdine.edu/seaver/academicadvising/probation. Registration will be cancelled for any student who is dismissed after having registered in advance for a subsequent term.</p><p>Students receiving veterans' benefits should consult the special veterans' information section in this portion of the catalog for more important information concerning standards of progress for veterans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Status</head><p>Class status is based on earned units and is defined as follows: 0-29 First-year 30-59 Sophomore 60-89 Junior 90 and more Senior</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent Enrollment</head><p>Students may not be jointly enrolled at Seaver College and at another academic institution for purposes of transferring units to Seaver College without receiving the written approval of the Academic Advising Center in advance of such joint enrollment. Students must request such permission by completing a "Seaver Student Exception Request" form at OneStop Students in F-1 visa status who wish to concurrently enroll at another institution should meet with a Designated School Official (DSO) in the Office of International Student Services to obtain a permission letter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convocation Series</head><p>From its beginning, Pepperdine has included regular assemblies where students gather to worship, hear engaging speakers encourage and challenge them with God's word, and learn more about how they can make a difference in the world. The Seaver convocation program honors the vision of George Pepperdine, the University founder, as it endeavors to present, through teaching and example, the diverse manifestations of the Christian life.</p><p>Convocation seeks to create open spaces, methods, conversations, and attitudes of Christian worship that cultivate continued growth through spiritual practices. Numerous convocation opportunities are offered each semester through weekly chapel services, small groups, and one-on-one mentoring. All Seaver undergraduate students participate in at least 14 events to earn an A.</p><p>All full-time Seaver undergraduate students will be enrolled each fall and spring semester in "SEAVER 200: Convocation Series," which carries one half unit of credit for each semester, with a letter grade assigned according to the number of convocation events attended. This course applies to every regular semester of a student's attendance up to, but not exceeding, eight semesters. Thus, the maximum number of SVR 200 credits that can be earned is four units, which do not count toward the 128 units required for degree completion. No tuition is charged for SVR 200, and all convocation credit accrued each semester is applied solely to the grade for that term.</p><p>Grading System: Attendance at convocation programs will be used to determine a grade that will be averaged into the student's cumulative Pepperdine GPA. Units earned and grades assigned for SVR 200 will be calculated as part of the overall GPA of all Seaver graduates and will be counted in the calculation of all graduation honors. The grade earned each semester is determined as shown below: <ref type="table">Grade  programs attended  14  A  13</ref> A-12 B+ 11 B</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of</head><p>Number of Grade programs attended 10 B-9 C+ 8 C 7 or fewer F Attendance Credit: Attendance is recorded by card readers. Students must have their Pepperdine student ID cards scanned upon entering and exiting to receive attendance credit, unless otherwise instructed. Card readers will automatically enter a "tardy" if a student arrives five minutes after the beginning of the program, and three tardies will result in the reduction of one attendance credit. Card readers will not count students present who are scanned in more than 10 minutes late or who are scanned out before the conclusion of the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exemptions and Exceptions:</head><p>Graduate, non-degree-seeking, part-time students, students over the age of 25, student teachers, and students enrolled in specific mandatory internships are automatically exempt from enrollment in the Convocation Series but have the option to do so. Students wishing to request an exemption from attending the Convocation Series must complete an Exemption Request Form, located in the WaveNet "Convocation" pagelet, by the posted deadline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Load</head><p>The standard course load for each semester is 16 units. An undergraduate student enrolled for 12 or more units is considered a full-time student. Students may enroll in more than 18 units only with permission of the Academic Advising Center and/or dean of the division in which the student' s major falls. Permission to enroll in more than 18 units will be granted only if the student' s GPA, employment schedule, maturity, and seriousness of purpose indicate that the student can successfully complete the proposed program. Students enrolled in more than 18 units will be charged an additional per-unit fee for every unit over 18. Students enrolled in fewer than 12 units are not eligible for on-campus housing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Numbering System</head><p>Remedial-Level Courses: Courses numbered 000-99 are remedial in nature and do not count toward fulfilling any requirements for a degree. These units are not included in the total of 128 units required for the degree. Grades received for remedial courses are not calculated into the student's GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lower-Division Courses:</head><p>Courses numbered 100-299 are open to lowerdivision students and cannot be counted as upper-division work in any division. If a student receives permission to substitute a lower-division course for an upper-division requirement, the student receives lower-division units or credit for the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Upper-Division Courses:</head><p>Courses numbered 300-599 are open only to students who have successfully completed 30 units of work. A minimum of 40 upper-division units must be included in the 128 units required for the bachelor's degree. Students taking 500-level courses for graduate credit will be required to do assignments in addition to those required for undergraduates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit/No Credit</head><p>A limited number of courses at Seaver College are offered with the grade of Cr (credit) for acceptable work or NC (no credit) for unacceptable work. Undergraduate students may choose to receive grades of Cr/NC rather than the usual letter grades in any course except those fulfilling the general education requirements or major or minor requirements. (Consult course descriptions for some courses in the major that may be taken for Cr/NC.)</p><p>Students must notify OneStop of their desire to receive Cr/NC grades before the end of the second week of classes in the fall and spring semesters and before the end of the fourth day in each summer session. A maximum of 16 units required for graduation at Seaver College, including physical education, may be taken as Cr/NC.</p><p>For undergraduate students, a grade of Cr is assigned to indicate work equivalent to an A, B, or C. A grade of NC is assigned to indicate work equivalent to a C-, D, or F. Credit/no credit grades are not computed into the overall semester GPA. If there is a question of academic probation or academic dismissal, each NC will be considered evidence of poor academic work.</p><p>Once a student has chosen the Cr/NC grading option, letter grades may not be assigned. When the grade of NC is assigned to a student in a course which is a prerequisite or a requirement, that course must be repeated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit by Examination (Challenge Procedure)</head><p>Seaver College students may challenge certain courses designated as "challengeable" by each division's faculty and receive credit by performing satisfactorily on examinations in the courses challenged. Students may challenge a particular class only once. Students who want to challenge a course must obtain written permission from the appropriate divisional dean and supervising faculty member. The divisional dean will designate a faculty member to compose or administer a challenge exam. The fee for the examination is listed in the "Financial Information" section of this catalog. Any credits earned are on a Cr/NC basis.</p><p>A maximum of two languages (totaling 16 units) offered at Seaver College may be challenged by examination. Students taking a language examination may earn credit for courses numbered 251 and 252 (four or eight units, including AP and CLEP credit) by scoring at the third-and fourth-semester college level on an objective exam and satisfactorily completing extra assignments given by a language professor. International students may not take challenge exams in their native language for credit. They may, however, take a placement exam in their native language in an attempt to qualify for a language substitution. Please see Placement Examinations for further information.</p><p>A maximum of 32 units may be earned by examination, including credit from AP, IB, and CLEP. Within a given discipline, a student cannot challenge a course which is at a lower level than one in which credit has been earned. A student may not challenge a course which has been failed or previously audited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit for Courses Taken at Other Institutions after Initial Enrollment at Seaver College</head><p>After initial enrollment at Seaver College, students can transfer at most 12 units from another school. Students who are dismissed by the Credits Committee in order to complete a full term at another school before returning to Pepperdine may transfer at most 16 units. Courses taken at a two-year college are transferable only if the student has earned fewer than 64 units, including work at Seaver College. Academic and non-remedial courses completed at other regionally accredited institutions within seven years of the term of matriculation at Pepperdine normally transfer to Seaver College as elective units. The Academic Advising Center will review other courses on a case-by-case basis. The Office of International Student Services will review international institutions and courses internally using consistent and reputable resources. International evaluations by outside vendors will not be utilized.</p><p>Approval must be obtained in advance from the Academic Advising Center to apply transfer courses to general studies or major requirements. Only those courses with grades of C (2.000) or higher may transfer to fulfill requirements at Seaver College. No grades from transferred courses will apply to the GPA. Credit received on a basis other than the semester unit will be converted to the semester system. Lower-division classes taken at another college will transfer only as lower-division credit, even if they are upper-division classes at Seaver College. Some extension courses, up to a maximum of 15 units, are transferable as elective units only. With divisional dean approval, these courses may fulfill major and general studies requirements. Transferable extension courses are only those which are automatically accepted for degree credit by the institution offering them. (See the separate section regarding the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) for further information.)</p><p>Regardless of the number of units accepted for transfer, students are required to satisfy the residence requirement at Seaver College (see "Residence Requirements" in this section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dean's List and Honors</head><p>A Dean's List of undergraduate students achieving high scholarship is compiled each semester. A letter is sent to each student to recognize this memorable achievement. To be eligible, a student must complete at least 12 letter-graded units during the semester, receive no grade below C for the semester, receive no grades of I or NC, and be in the top 10 percent of the class. In any case, the GPA must not be less than 3.500.</p><p>Students who achieve a GPA of 3.500 in their entire Pepperdine undergraduate career are graduated cum laude; those with a 3.700 GPA are graduated magna cum laude; and those with a 3.900 GPA are graduated summa cum laude. GPAs will not be rounded. Eligibility for valedictorian and salutatorian honors at the Seaver College graduation ceremony is limited to students earning their first bachelor's degree. A student who has earned previous bachelor's or advanced degrees is ineligible for valedictorian and salutatorian honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of the Grade-Point System</head><p>The quality of achievement in a course is measured as follows: For undergraduates, A indicates excellent achievement; B, good; C, average; D, below average; and F, failure. Grades are calculated as follows: Academic divisions or programs have designated certain courses that require students to achieve a minimum C-grade before advancing to the next course in the sequence, or for admission to the major, or for satisfying minimum competency requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Major</head><p>Students may simultaneously complete the requirements for two majors (e.g., English and theatre or biology and chemistry) which will be reflected on both the transcript and the diploma. Pepperdine University awards one diploma for each level of academic degree earned (e.g., bachelor, master). This diploma reflects all majors/programs completed for that level of degree. General studies requirements must be fulfilled only once whether a student is working for two majors or one. However, as a general rule, no more than two upper-division courses from the specific requirements of one major can apply to the requirements of another major. In those cases in which more than two courses are common requirements for both majors, the student must take sufficient additional work to earn a minimum of 16 upper-division units which are unique to each major. Students pursuing a double major should refer to the Seaver Undergraduate Financial Assistance Policy regarding maximum limitations for institutional and federal aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Full-Time and Part-Time Student Status</head><p>Full-time enrollment for an undergraduate student is defined as 12 or more units per semester; three-quarter time is nine to 11 units; half-time is six to eight units; and less than half-time is one to five units. This information is essential to the student who is receiving financial assistance and is unable to maintain continuous enrollment for loan deferment purposes.</p><p>In accordance with federal regulations, international students in F-1 visa status must obtain specific authorization from the Office of International Student Services before withdrawing from courses which would result in less than a full course load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation and Undergraduate Degree Requirements</head><p>A minimum of 128 units is required for a degree, including no more than four units of physical education. Forty units must be in upper-division courses. All requirements for a particular degree must be completed, including those for the major, the minor, areas of concentration or emphasis, and general education courses. All residence requirements must be met (see Residence Requirements in this section). The student is responsible for completing all degree requirements outlined in the catalog for the intended degree. Note: students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 in work completed at Seaver College ("Pep GPA") and in their major ("major GPA"). Students must consider how institutional and federal aid eligibility might impact their ability to utilize financial assistance while pursuing undergraduate degree requirements. (See Seaver Undergraduate Financial Assistance Policy.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Cancellation</head><p>Students who apply to graduate in the spring or complete their degrees in the following summer term but withdraw from registered courses during the semester will lose their eligibility to march in the graduation ceremony and will be removed from the graduation roster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Programs</head><p>Exceptional students may wish to pursue the honors programs that are offered in selected disciplines. Interested students should contact the divisional dean for further information concerning these programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hybrid and Online Courses</head><p>Seaver College defines an online course as one where online or learning technologies are used to deliver 70 percent or more of the instructional content. In an online course, the faculty member and student do not share a common coincident location and course content is delivered either synchronously or asynchronously to the student. A hybrid course combines the features of both traditional and online courses and typically supplements the traditional synchronous face-to-face faculty/student instruction with online instructional engagement. In a hybrid course, online or learning technologies are used to deliver somewhere between 20 percent and 70 percent of the instructional content.</p><p>Seaver College offers a limited number of hybrid or online courses and will grant credit for hybrid or online courses completed both before and after initial enrollment at Seaver College in accordance with existing academic policies (see "Admission of Transfer Students" in the Admission Information section of the catalog and "Credit for Courses Taken at Other Institutions After Initial Enrollment at Seaver College" and "Residence Requirements" in this section). After initial enrollment at Seaver College, a maximum of 18 total units of hybrid or online courses may act in fulfillment of the 128 units required for graduation. Within the 18 units of allowable hybrid or online course work, a maximum of 8 units may act in fulfillment of general education requirements and a maximum of 8 units may fulfill requirements in an academic major. A maximum of 4 units of hybrid or online course work may act in fulfillment of the requirements in an academic minor.</p><p>When participating in a Seaver College international program, undergraduate students may enroll in a maximum of 4 units of hybrid or online courses offered at Seaver College in an academic term. Additionally, students may not enroll in a hybrid or online course if a materially equivalent course is offered in residence at the international program site in the same academic term.</p><p>According to U.S. federal regulations, international students in F-1 status are allowed each semester to enroll in one online class that has no amount of physical attendance requirement and may count up to three units of the class toward the regulation requiring a full course of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Involuntary Military Service</head><p>Students who are involuntarily called to active military duty may withdraw from courses and the University at any time during the term. Transcripts will be coded as WM (withdrawal due to military service) for withdrawals that occur after the add/drop period. The student will receive a 100 percent tuition refund. No withdrawal fees will be charged.</p><p>If the involuntary withdrawal occurs during the period of a term when the grade of incomplete (I) can be granted, students may request an incomplete from the professor. All appropriate rules for incomplete courses apply with one exception: if the student is still on active duty when the expiration date to complete the course and remove the incomplete occurs, the grade will default to WM (rather than F), and a full refund will be made to the student.</p><p>Furthermore, once students complete their involuntary tours of duty, upon request, Pepperdine will readmit them within the first 12 months following completion of their tours of duty without requiring them to reapply to the University. The students' tours of duty time will not count as part of the time limit set for degree completion. Students who cannot attend Pepperdine because of military service will be readmitted with the same academic status achieved when they last attended or were accepted to the University. The student must notify Pepperdine of the military service and the intention to return to school as follows:</p><p>• Notification of military service. The student (or an appropriate officer of the armed forces or official of the Department of Defense) must give oral or written notice of such service to the school as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances.</p><p>• Notification of intent to return to school. The student must also give oral or written notice of an intent to return to Pepperdine within three years after the completion of the period of service.</p><p>A student's readmission rights terminate in the case of a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, general court-martial, federal or state prison sentence, or other reasons as described in 34 CFR <ref type="bibr">668.18(h)</ref> federal regulations.</p><p>For additional information, please contact the Veterans Affairs Office: (310) 506-7999.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major and Minor</head><p>Students may simultaneously complete the requirements for an academic major and one or more minors, which will be reflected on the transcript. However, as a general rule, no more than two upper-division courses from the specific requirements of a major or the General Education program can apply to the requirements of a minor. In cases in which more than two courses are common requirements for both the major and a minor, the student must take sufficient upper-division courses unique to the minor to meet the minimum upper-division unit requirement for the minor. Students must consider how institutional and federal aid eligibility might impact their ability to utilize financial assistance while pursuing one or more minors. (See Seaver Undergraduate Financial Assistance Policy.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Military Training (ROTC)</head><p>Through arrangements with neighboring institutions, two-, three-, and four-year programs in Air Force Reserve Training Corps and Army Reserve Officers Training Corps are available to qualified Seaver College students, and both lead to a commission as a second lieutenant. Academic units earned in these programs are counted as elective, lower-division units toward fulfillment of graduation requirements. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Examinations</head><p>Placement examinations in language, math, and written English (for international students) may be administered to incoming students. Performance on these examinations determines placement in course levels. There is no credit earned nor is there any effect on the GPA as a result of scores achieved on these exams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission</head><p>Students who withdraw after being accepted to or attending Seaver College must follow readmission procedures that vary depending on circumstances of the withdrawal and the length of time that has passed.</p><p>• New students who choose to withdraw before the start of their first term at Seaver College must withdraw through the Office of Admission. Should a student wish to return to Seaver College within two semesters of the original application term, a brief reapplication form will need to be submitted to the Office of Admission. If the return date is past two semesters of the original application term, the student must reapply through the Common Application and submit new supplemental materials to the Office of Admission.</p><p>• New students who attend a course during their first term at Seaver College must withdraw through the Office of Student Information and Services. Students who wish to return to Seaver College must file an application for readmission with the Office of Student Information and Services at least two weeks prior to registration. Allow at least four weeks for credits committee action if a student has been placed on academic probation or dismissed.</p><p>• Students who completed one semester with full-time status at Seaver College but have been withdrawn for more than two calendar years must file an application for readmission with the Office of Student Information and Services at least two weeks prior to registration. Allow at least four weeks for credits committee action if a student has been placed on academic probation or dismissed.</p><p>• Students who have been absent for two or more calendar years but did not complete one full semester with a full-time status must file a new application for admission with the Office of Admission and pay the regular application fee. These students must complete the degree requirements stated in the catalog of the academic year of reenrollment.</p><p>• Students who attended other institutions after leaving Seaver College must submit official transcripts from those institutions prior to readmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Courses</head><p>Required courses for which a student earns a grade of F, WF, WP, W, or NC must be repeated. When repeating a course (one or more times) for which a grade of C-or lower was earned, all grades are calculated into the GPA and the units count only once toward graduation. Courses for which a student earns a grade of C or better may be repeated, but any succeeding grades will not be calculated in the GPA or the unit total.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Residence Requirements</head><p>Undergraduate students must complete at least 64 units in residence at Seaver College, including at least 24 units of upper-division work in the major. It is required that their last 28 units of required courses and/or units toward the bachelor's degree be taken in residence at Seaver College. Up to 64 units are transferable from an accredited two-year or four-year college. Once the total of all units earned from all schools has reached 64, no further twoyear college courses are accepted. Once enrolled, Seaver students can transfer at most 12 units from another school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second Bachelor's Degree</head><p>Students who transfer to Seaver College with a bachelor's degree from another accredited college or university may earn a second bachelor's degree, provided they: (1) complete at least 64 units in residence at Seaver College; (2) fulfill the final 28 units of required courses and/or units in residence at Seaver College; (3) complete the Seaver College general education requirements; and (4) complete the courses required for a major, including a minimum of 24 upper-division units in the major in residence and courses in the area of concentration or emphasis required in the major.</p><p>Students who have previously received a bachelor's degree from Seaver College and return to complete the requirements for another major will not be given a second diploma, nor will their transcripts reflect a second degree, unless that degree is a different type. They will, however, be certified as having completed an additional major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Graduates</head><p>Students who are planning to complete the bachelor's degree during any of the summer sessions or by the end of the summer term will be eligible to march in the spring graduation ceremony only if they meet the following criteria and agree to the stipulations below. There will be no exceptions.</p><p>• Students must be within 12 units of graduation by the end of the spring semester and must be preregistered for these units in the following summer term.</p><p>• Students must be in good standing (GPA 2.000 or better) in both the major GPA and the Pepperdine GPA.</p><p>• Students participating in an overseas or offsite program must present proof of acceptance in the program in order to graduate.</p><p>• Students who withdraw from summer courses after participating in the spring graduation ceremony will be charged a forfeit fee equal to 100 percent of tuition charges for courses in which they were enrolled.</p><p>• All summer degrees will be posted at the end of the third summer session. (See calendar for actual date.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time Limit</head><p>All requirements for the bachelor's degree must be completed within seven calendar years from the date on which the student begins undergraduate work at Pepperdine University. If seven years elapse from the time of initial enrollment, the student must meet the requirements of a catalog dated no earlier than seven years prior to the anticipated date of graduation.</p><p>A student who has been absent for a period of two years must reapply for admission and fulfill the degree requirements of the catalog of the academic year of re-enrollment. A student who has been absent for two or more semesters (excluding summer terms) but less than two years must be readmitted by the Office of Student Information and Services and may fulfill the degree requirements of the original catalog. For further information, see the Readmission section of this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Registration in Graduate Courses</head><p>An undergraduate student enrolled in the final semester before graduation and within nine units of graduation may be permitted to enroll in courses for graduate credit. However, before the last semester of undergraduate work, the student must submit a program to the dean of the division of the student's major and a petition to the senior associate dean of Seaver College for approval of the program. If the graduate study is in a different division from the undergraduate work, the student must obtain approval from the dean in the appropriate division of graduate study as well. Graduate credit will not be permitted to count for work that is required for the bachelor's degree except as otherwise stated. The applicant will be notified in writing concerning the petition and admission status.</p><p>Candidates for the California Preliminary Teaching Credential may be permitted to enroll in professional development courses for post-bachelor's degree credit reflecting a dual career enrollment. However, the student must obtain permission from the director of Teacher Education prior to enrollment. This policy may apply to any credential-required course that a student chooses not to apply toward undergraduate graduation requirements. Courses will be applied toward post-bachelor's degree credit and annotated as such on the transcript.</p><p>International students who are in F-1 visa status are required to maintain 12 units each term. Therefore, they should consult a Designated School Official (DSO) in the Office of International Student Services before deciding how to incorporate the teaching credential requirements into their course load each term prior to completion of their degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies for Graduate and Post-Baccalaureate Students</head><p>Advisor and Committee During a student's first semester in graduate school, the divisional dean or a member of the faculty designated by the divisional dean will advise students concerning their program. As students near the comprehensive exam and/ or thesis stage of their programs, a committee will be appointed to facilitate either the exam or the thesis defense or both in applicable programs. The student's advisor normally chairs this committee, and students should consult with their advisors for information specific to their programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal Process</head><p>If the student feels that his or her interests were not sufficiently dealt with, a written appeal must be submitted to the divisional dean or director of the graduate program. The divisional dean or the director of the program must sign the appeal indicating his or her recommendation and forward it to the senior associate dean. Neither the divisional dean nor the program director can suppress or withhold such a signature. If the student is petitioning regarding a particular course, the recommendation should come from that instructor instead of the divisional dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comprehensive Examination</head><p>Some programs require both written and oral examinations. In programs that require a comprehensive exam, the exams are coordinated by the student's academic advisor in consultation with the other members of the student's academic advisory committee. The academic advisory committee serves as the examining committee. The committee has the authority to require the student to repeat the examination in whole or in part. Specific procedures and grading policies for the examination may be obtained from each of the divisional programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuance in the Program</head><p>Students admitted to graduate or post-baccalaureate study may continue in the program as long as their academic performance and their personal conduct meet the standards set by the University. Students must maintain a GPA of 3.000 (B) on all graduate work done at Pepperdine University and on all work for a master's degree. Students falling below a GPA of 3.000 in their work taken at Seaver College ("Pep GPA") will be placed on academic probation. Students will also be placed on academic probation upon receipt of a second C+ or below regardless of their cumulative GPA. Any student who is on probation and (1) shows lack of progress or (2) fails to clear probation within one semester is subject to academic dismissal. Registration will be canceled for any student who is dismissed after having registered in advance for a subsequent term.</p><p>No grade lower than a B-will carry graduate credit unless the student's graduate program director recommends and the associate dean of Seaver College approves that such credit be allowed, although all courses attempted will be counted in the student's GPA. Such approval must be granted before the end of the semester following the one in which the course was taken. No student will be allowed to apply more than eight units (two courses) of C+ or below grades toward meeting the requirements of a master's degree.</p><p>Students receiving veterans' benefits should consult the special veterans' information section in this portion of the catalog for more important information concerning standards of progress for veterans. This information is also available at pepperdine.edu/registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuous Enrollment</head><p>Graduate and post-baccalaureate students must maintain continuous enrollment. Continuous enrollment means that students must register for two semesters each academic year (fall, spring, or summer) from the time of first enrollment until completion of all requirements for the graduate degree. A student who is unable to maintain continuous enrollment prior to the completion of academic course work should apply for a leave of absence (see "Leave of Absence").</p><p>A student who has completed all academic course work for a graduate degree but who has not passed the final comprehensive examinations and/or successfully completed the thesis or project and received all the appropriate signatures on their thesis or is in the process of completing an "in progress" in a final directed readings course must maintain continuous enrollment by registering in GR 699, Reading for Master's Comprehensives, and by paying the associated fee each semester as described in the Financial Information section of the catalog. The fee permits the student to use the library and research facilities of the University. The student is considered active, full-time, and eligible to defer payments on government loans.</p><p>Any student who has not maintained continuous enrollment and has been absent from Seaver College for one semester but less than two years must file an Application for Readmission with the Graduate Program Office at least two weeks prior to registration. Applications for readmission must be accompanied by readmission fees of $100 per semester for each semester in which the student was not enrolled. A student who has been absent for two or more calendar years must file a new application for admission with the Graduate Program Office and pay the regular application fee. These students must complete the degree requirements stated in the catalog of the academic year of re-enrollment.</p><p>Students are encouraged to complete their degree in a timely manner. Students with numerous enrollments in GR 699 may be asked by the director of the program or the divisional dean to submit a degree completion plan in advance of GR 699 registration.</p><p>A student must also be enrolled in a course during the semester in which a degree is granted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Numbering System</head><p>Upper-Division Courses: Courses numbered 500-599 are open to upperdivision undergraduate or graduate students.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education Program</head><p>The General Education Program at Seaver College is the heart of a liberal arts curriculum and complements the University's Christian mission by grounding students in the skills, knowledge, and perspectives that will equip them to serve purposefully and become leaders in their chosen fields. Upon completion of this curriculum, students will have a sound foundation in the core competencies and thus will be well prepared to write and speak effectively, think critically, conduct informed research, and interpret quantitative data. Recognizing that an awareness of difference/ diversity is essential to success in the modern world, the curriculum provides opportunities to explore cultures, values, and ideas that situate the student within the global community and foster the ability to empathize with others. The variety of courses introduces each student to academic disciplines and ways of thinking that are different from his or her own and thus broadens each student's perspectives.</p><p>Since deep learning occurs in community, the GE curriculum has been designed to cultivate that community through shared experiences such as the first-year seminar. Students also have the freedom to select courses that speak to their own interests and vocational inclinations through multi-semester colloquia such as Great Books or Social Action and Justice, and students can further individualize their GE experience by selecting from a variety of courses that satisfy the requirements in most of the areas. At Seaver College, each student's chosen major and the general education curriculum work together to provide the necessary tools that will equip him or her to make meaningful and ethical decisions in his or her professional and personal endeavors.</p><p>The requirements for the general education program include 19 courses, totaling 63-64 units. To develop further the fundamental core competencies introduced in the general education curriculum, students also fulfill the junior writing portfolio requirement and the presentation skills, research methods, and writing intensive course requirements in their majors.</p><p>Each of the various areas of emphasis in the General Education Program has learning outcomes that address knowledge, skills, and/or perspectives:</p><p>• The student who completes each course that emphasizes knowledge will be able to demonstrate an introductory understanding of a body of knowledge in a specific discipline and of the ways of thinking about that knowledge. This understanding may provide a foundation for future study and/or a framework for relating that body of knowledge to an overall understanding of theoretical and real life issues.</p><p>• The student who completes each course that emphasizes skills will be able to demonstrate an increased level of proficiency in the core competencies-critical thinking, written communication, oral communication, information literacy, and quantitative reasoningand in other skills, such as making informed, meaningful, and ethical decisions based on logical reasoning and consistent, thoughtful, and appropriate methodologies; acquiring language skills; or appreciating artistic, musical, or theatrical performance.</p><p>• The student who completes each course that emphasizes perspectives will be able to demonstrate habits of mind characterized by openmindedness and empathy toward local and global communities through a transformed awareness of self and others.</p></div>

This requirement will be fulfilled through presentation skills/research methods skills courses in the student's major discipline.</p><p>Each major has designated courses that fulfill the presentation skills/ research methods requirement: Please refer to major requirement listings.</p><p>In the presentation skills/research methods requirement, students will:</p><p>• Acquire and demonstrate both introductory and advanced methods of research and discovery used in a particular academic discipline.</p><p>• Use research language effectively.</p><p>• Develop extensive methods and procedures for conducting and recording effective research in different formats and settings.</p><p>• Identify, synthesize, and assess research literature.</p><p>• Plan, structure, and write a research paper.</p><p>• Present research findings both formally and dynamically to an academic audience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics (3)</head><p>This requirement develops in the student an appreciation of the beauty and creativity of mathematics. It enhances reasoning ability and the grasp of logical principles, improves problem-solving skills, provides exposure to the pervasiveness of mathematics in our modern society and some of its historical underpinnings, and provides an understanding of the basic principles of analyzing numerical data using statistical methods.</p><p>Courses fulfilling the mathematics requirement: MATH 120. This requirement may also be satisfied by MATH 140, MATH 141, MATH 150, MATH 220, COM 240, POSC/PSYC/SOC 250, MATH 270 (for the liberal arts for education major), or MATH 316. Each of these courses assumes that the student has completed at least two years of high school algebra or MATH 99 or MATH 103 or MATH 104 with a grade of C-or higher.</p><p>In the mathematics requirement, students will:</p><p>• Recognize the beauty of mathematics and be able to cite examples illustrating how mathematics is a creative endeavor similar to many other liberal arts.</p><p>• Demonstrate enhanced reasoning ability through the study and application of formal logic.</p><p>• Improve their problem-solving skills through the study of various mathematical strategies.</p><p>• Recognize the pervasiveness of mathematics in our modern society and be able to cite some of its historical underpinnings.</p><p>• Demonstrate an understanding of the creation, use, and limitations of mathematical models.</p><p>• Apply knowledge of the basic principles of analyzing numerical data using statistical methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language (4)</head><p>This requirement helps students attain a functional competency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing at the intermediate level in a language of their choice. The equivalent of third semester language is required. Students are placed at the course level (151, 152, or 251) indicated by the Foreign Language Placement Exam. To be successful in languages, students should take all classes in sequential semesters; that is, a student should not skip a semester between courses. Should this happen, it may be necessary to require a student to repeat the previous course. As with the placement exam, finishing a language course ensures only admittance to the next course level for one year. The language requirement is waived for students who place at the 252 level on the Foreign Language Placement Exam proctored in the International Studies and Languages (ISL) Division. However, no unit credits can be earned through the placement exam process. Unit credit may be earned only by the challenge procedure through the ISL Division, which is available only for languages taught in that division. (See "Credit by Examination" for further information about this procedure.)</p><p>The requirement is waived for international students who verify academic study of their native language. Transfer students may receive credit for language courses taken at a regionally-accredited college or university; such students do not need to take the Foreign Language Placement Exam. The Seaver College requirement is not second language acquisition, but rather language proficiency that supports the global world view of the liberal arts. American Sign Language therefore does not meet the criteria by which Seaver's general education language requirement is defined.</p><p>Courses that fulfill the language requirement: ARBC 251, <ref type="bibr">CHIN 251,</ref><ref type="bibr">FRE 251,</ref><ref type="bibr">FRE 282,</ref><ref type="bibr">GER 251,</ref><ref type="bibr">GER 282,</ref><ref type="bibr">GRE 351,</ref><ref type="bibr">HEB 351,</ref><ref type="bibr">ITAL 251,</ref><ref type="bibr">JAPN 251,</ref><ref type="bibr">SPAN 251,</ref><ref type="bibr">SPAN 282.</ref> In the language requirement, students will:</p><p>• Understand simple phone conversations, announcements and media reports, and face-to-face dialogue using learned material.</p><p>• Engage in a variety of communicative tasks in social situations, ask and answer questions using learned materials, and participate in conversations about topics beyond the most immediate needs.</p><p>• Recognize sufficient vocabulary when reading at the intermediate level and consistently read texts dealing with a variety of basic and social needs.</p><p>• Write short, simple passages with accuracy, expressing present time and at least one other time frame.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Typical First-Year Program</head><p>• All first-year students will be enrolled in a first-year seminar (GS 199) during their first semester.</p><p>• All first-year students must complete English Composition (ENG 101) within the first year of study.</p><p>• Students who are continuing the study of a language learned in high school should do so during the first year.</p><p>• First-year students are encouraged to begin the Western Culture sequence no later than their second semester. Students who have completed HUM 111 may be able to complete the Western Culture courses during any given academic year in Heidelberg, London, Florence, Buenos Aires, or Lausanne.</p><p>• REL 101 should be completed during the first year.</p><p>• COM 180 should be completed during the first year.</p><p>• Students who have declared a major should refer to the "First-Year Program" sections for information on major courses to be taken during the first year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Programs</head><p>Students who plan to study in Pepperdine's international programs should visit the International Programs web page or consult the International Programs Office to obtain current course offerings and program information. Courses regularly taught overseas include HUM 212 and HUM 313 of the Western Culture sequence and courses that satisfy the general education requirements, which may include courses in fine arts, modern languages, world civilizations, political science, sociology or psychology, mathematics, and natural science. The Seaver College curriculum has also been designed with the aim that any student from any major can study in an international program for at least one semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Great Books Colloquium</head><p>The Great Books Colloquium is a four-course sequence on masterpieces of Western civilization. The purpose of the colloquium is to engage students in close, critical reading and small-group discussions of selected works from the time of the Greeks to the modern day. The courses are conducted by discussion under the leadership of a qualified professor dedicated to fostering open, shared, and rigorous inquiry.</p><p>The Great Books Colloquium is a limited-enrollment program. The only prerequisites for entry into the colloquium are eligibility for English 101 and a willingness to commit oneself to the time and effort required by the courses. Students should be advised that the reading and writing assignments are substantial. However, past students have testified that the greater challenge has given them precisely what they desired from a university education: an opportunity to read fine works, rigorous training in writing and discussion, a forum for sharing ideas, and a close-knit group in which to grow intellectually.</p><p>Students should remain in the colloquium for the entire series of seminars. Students completing all four Great Books courses receive credit for the First-Year seminar, two courses from Group A: ENG 101, upper-division literature, and one course in the Humanities Sequence (HUM 111, HUM 212, or HUM 313); and two courses from Group B: REL 301, COM 180, POSC 104, and SOC 200. Students completing Great Books I receive credit for First-Year Seminar, even if they choose not to complete the sequence. Students who do not complete the sequence but complete a course or courses beyond Great Books I will receive unit credit toward graduation, but no General Education credit besides the First-Year Seminar.</p><p>Usually, students enter the colloquium in the fall of their first year and finish in the spring of their sophomore year. However, many students may wish to participate in an international program during their sophomore year. This is entirely compatible with participation in the Great Books seminars. Students may take the first two courses in their first year, spend their sophomore year abroad, and finish the colloquium when they return in their junior year. In addition, it is sometimes possible to finish the colloquium at one of the international campuses when an experienced Great Books teacher is assigned to such a campus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Social Action and Justice Colloquium</head><p>The Social Action and Justice (SAAJ) Colloquium is a four-course, interdisciplinary program focused on issues of social justice such as human rights, wealth and poverty, the environment, the interplay of religion and culture, and the role of media in shaping social movements.</p><p>The colloquium includes historical, theoretical, and practical perspectives on social issues, providing knowledge and opportunities for social action to students interested in a variety of vocations. The colloquium encourages students to reflect on how their choices of world view and vocation will affect their lives and society in the 21 st century.</p><p>In each of the first two semesters, students and faculty members engage in service-learning activities appropriate to the issues they are studying, providing opportunities for students to be in the community exploring possible vocational choices. Each of the first two courses in the colloquium is a small seminar composed of 18 students and a faculty member. Based on student interests and with faculty guidance, each class will read, discuss, research, and write about primary texts related to social justice issues.</p><p>To develop a historical and theoretical basis for social action, students in the first-semester course examine how each of the following has affected social justice in the United States from the 18th century to the present: the social construction of racial identity, the role of gender in social equality, and the influence of socio-economic background. In the second semester, students examine the impact of religious activism, the social construction of ability and disability, social perceptions of sexual difference, and concerns about the environment.</p><p>In the third semester, students may choose more specialized courses that provide an in-depth examination of a particular social issue. Faculty members will encourage students to select courses related to their particular concerns and possible vocation.</p><p>In the fourth semester, students will complete extended experiential learning assignments appropriate to their talents, concerns, and values. Ideally, the third-semester course on a particular issue will provide research opportunities and particular preparation for these experiences. As they complete the experiential learning component, students will continue to meet in biweekly seminars and for in-common activities.</p><p>Students who complete the four-semester SAAJ sequence will receive credit for the following general education requirements: first-year seminar, ENG 101, literature, and REL 301. If students drop out of the colloquium before finishing the four-course sequence, they will receive unit credit toward graduation but will not have fulfilled the above-named general education requirements. SAAJ 123 may be fulfilled by a course in the student' s major, but only one major course may fulfill the SAAJ requirements. No student may fulfill SAAJ 123 with a GE course. (See the Course Descriptions in the Humanities and Teacher Education Division section for information about each course in the SAAJ sequence.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Majors</head><p>Each student must complete all requirements for a major as outlined in the academic divisions section of this catalog. Students wishing to earn the bachelor of arts degree will choose one of the following majors: The master of arts degree is offered in the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies Religion</head><p>The master of science degree is offered in the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ministry</head><p>The following professional degree is offered:</p><p>Master of Divinity (may be earned jointly with a law degree from Pepperdine Caruso School of Law)</p><p>The following master of fine arts degree is offered:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screen and Television Writing</head><p>The following post-baccalaureate certificate is offered:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nutrition</head><p>Students at Seaver College may seek a SB2042 Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential or a Single Subject Teaching Credential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Minors</head><p>Seaver College offers academic minors in the following: Students may select one of these minors or take elective courses in addition to the required general education and major courses in order to complete the 128 units required for graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Law</head><p>Students who want to attend law school should plan their undergraduate programs with care. While law schools do not expect the incoming student to be knowledgeable in the field of law, the expectation is that the applicant will be well prepared for the rigors of graduate work in this field. This means that the pre-law student should complete an academic major which will equip him or her with the skills and discipline necessary to perform well in law school. No specific major is required for admission, so it is up to each student to make a responsible choice.</p><p>In selecting the major, the student should place emphasis on such skills as research, writing, analytical reading, logic, and organized expression of ideas, both oral and written. The student should be concerned with obtaining a broad liberal arts education that should help in developing insightful understandings of our culture and institutions. Beyond the chosen major, a judicious use of elective units can fill in additional areas of expertise that might otherwise be overlooked. Involvement in such extracurricular activities as Seaver College's chapter of Phi Alpha Delta (International Law Society), and participation in intercollegiate debate may also benefit the student. Prelaw advisors in several divisions will be glad to aid all interested students in planning for their success in law school.</p><p>Frequently, students request that the advisor recommend elective courses which will be helpful in their pre-law education.</p><p>More specific information, including recommended courses, is available in the Social Science Division Office or through a pre-law advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contract Major</head><p>As an alternative to one of the above majors, students with at least 30 earned units of college credit and a minimum GPA of 2.500 may initiate a special contract for an individualized major. Application for an individualized contract major, including a rationale and proposed courses, must be submitted to the Academic Advising Center. Divisional deans will appoint a committee of faculty members to review and approve or disapprove the combination of courses being proposed as a contract major. The student must complete at least 45 units at Seaver College, at least 30 units of which must be part of the contract, following the signing of the contract for the individualized major. Contract majors will only be authorized in cases where a student's academic goals are so specialized that they cannot be met by another existing program of study. As a result, no student with an approved contract major may pursue a double major when the second major is one that already exists in the Seaver catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Progr ams</head><p>The experience of study and travel overseas provides an essential dimension to a liberal arts education that can be obtained in no other way. For this reason, international programs have been designed to provide any Seaver College student, regardless of major, the opportunity to study, live, and travel overseas without interrupting other studies or postponing a career.</p><p>Year-round or semester program locations in Heidelberg, Germany; London, United Kingdom; Florence, Italy; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Shanghai, China; Lausanne, Switzerland; and Washington, DC, offer students a unique opportunity to gain both an academic and a personal understanding of other cultures, institutions, and languages. Summer language programs in Switzerland and Spain or Argentina allow beginning students to complete their language requirement and offer advanced students the opportunity to study both the language and the culture of the country. Other summer programs provide special opportunities to focus on business, humanities, religion, science, medicine, theatre, music, or studio art. Upon graduation, many students conclude that participation in an international program was the single most significant experience of their undergraduate years.</p><p>Each program is a serious adventure in study and scholarship. A sufficient number and variety of courses are offered at each location to allow the student to arrange a full academic schedule. Classes are taught by visiting University faculty members from the Malibu campus, by Pepperdine University faculty members who reside in the host country, and by a group of well-qualified and distinguished local professors who have been specially selected to teach in the program. The curriculum has been designed so that students may complete a substantial portion of their general education requirements while enrolled. Many students elect to participate during the sophomore year, although any qualified student may apply.</p><p>The program design recognizes that selective travel is a valuable part of the educational process, but class attendance and academic performance are regarded as first priorities. Classroom instruction is augmented each semester by educational excursions to significant locations lasting several days. These educational field trips to locations of historic, literary, musical, or other significance may include guided city tours; visits to museums and historical sites; attending concerts, plays, and operas; or listening to guest lecturers.</p><p>Students in Heidelberg, London, Florence, Shanghai, Lausanne, and Washington, DC, live in University housing along with the Seaver faculty family. The same residential housing rules that prevail in Malibu apply insofar as possible, with certain exceptions made necessary by local conditions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Division</head><p>The mission of the Business Administration Division is to provide students with a superior business and liberal arts education that prepares them for lives of ethical service and professional achievement in a competitive world.</p><p>The program at Seaver College is unusual in that it is embedded in a college of arts, letters, and sciences. More than tolerating or coexisting with the traditional goals of liberal baccalaureate education, the division seeks to embrace fully a liberal arts education as an essential component of the educated man or woman. The division expects its graduates to do well in business, yet of most importance is that they do well as individuals who are finding meaning and significance in life and are contributing to making the world a better place. Our goal is to educate students for ethical, fulfilling lives of service.</p><p>A liberal arts education has to do more with a spirit of inquiry than content; therefore, rather than taking a narrow approach, the division emphasizes broadly applicable skills: personal judgment and responsibility; an active, questioning mind sensitive to contexts; and the ability to make sense of "facts" and their implications for society. Questions of why or why not are more important than those of "how to."</p><p>In addition to preparing students for life, the curriculum prepares students for careers in accounting, business, or management, and is an excellent foundation for graduate work in business administration. Special emphasis is currently available in the areas of economics, computer science, marketing, management, and finance if students choose their elective courses to match their interests. The various emphases allow students to prepare for entry-level jobs, while the other business requirements ensure a broader background for future professional advancement.</p><p>An accounting major is available for students who plan to do graduate work in accounting or to enter the fields of public or private accounting. This major involves more course work than the other majors. Its requirements are outlined below in the course requirements.</p><p>An international business major is available for students who are specifically interested in global business careers. This major requires some educational work abroad unless one is an international student.</p><p>The degrees offered by the Seaver College Business Administration Division are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimum Grade Requirements</head><p>Students majoring in any field within the Communication Division must earn a minimum grade of C-in designated courses in order to receive credit in the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Programs and Opportunities</head><p>The Communication Division sponsors a variety of programs and societies to supplement the regular academic schedule.</p><p>These organizations provide opportunities for communication majors to meet and work with professional journalists, broadcasters, advertising agencies, communication managers, organizational consultants, and public relations experts, and to enter professionally-sanctioned state and national competitions. Regular activities for journalism and broadcasting majors include the annual journalism and screen arts award banquets and participation in the Associated Collegiate Press convention, and the national conference of the Public Relations Student Society of America. There are active chapters of Lambda Pi Eta, the communication honor society; and the Public Relations Student Society of America.</p><p>The Pepperdine Communication mentoring fellowship offers students an opportunity to be mentored by members of the broadcast industry. Broadcast students participate in national video festival competitions at BEA and Reelstories.</p><p>Internship programs provide opportunities for all majors to work in a professional capacity with advertising and public relations agencies, with local radio stations, TV stations, and newspapers, and with governmental and industrial concerns. Students perform communication functions at the same time they complete their academic training.</p><p>Campus media and the forensics team, centered in the Communication Division, are important parts of student life. Students on the forensics team compete in British Parliamentary debate in the US and abroad. The University-operated television and radio stations provide entertainment and information to the campus and the Malibu community, and also provide invaluable on-air opportunities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies</head><p>The student who majors in communication examines the role of verbal and nonverbal communication in human relationships. Since the process of communication is profoundly affected by contexts, modes, and media, as well as by personal characteristics, the major requires a broad range of courses.</p><p>The study of communication is crucial to a broad liberal arts education.</p><p>Not only is the ability to communicate with symbols uniquely human (and, hence, central to understanding the human condition), but it is also of practical value. Communication skills are important in work and leisure, profession and home, politics and religion, and in many other areas. Many careers require a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of communication.</p><p>Because of our commitment to the liberal arts and the interdisciplinary nature of communication theory and inquiry, students in this major take course work in human communication, in mass communication, and in other complementary areas.</p><p>Students may apply for full admission to the major after completing a minimum of 24 units at Seaver College with a minimum 3.200 overall GPA. Additionally, a student must be admitted to the major before completing 85 academic units unless the student has received an advance waiver from the Communication Division.</p><p>Students must have completed all prerequisites for elective courses and are encouraged to check this catalog for minimum requirements. Some courses must be completed in a prescribed sequence.</p></div>

Student media include a newspaper, a magazine, a cable television channel with entertainment and news programming, and a website. Students also participate in internships at professional media outlets, especially in Southern California.</p><p>The best preparation for journalism includes a strong background in one or more academic areas beyond the journalism major. Thus, in addition to general education requirements and at least 47 units in the major, each student is required to take a minimum of 9 to 12 upper-division units in a field other than media selected in consultation with the student's advisor. The selection should supplement and support the major and the career goals of the student.</p></div>

We hold students to the highest standards of academic excellence, using rubrics to evaluate their work and to ensure that we are rigorous in our class assignments. Believing that our students need to know how to behave professionally if they are to be successful in their work, we run our rehearsals according to the rules of Actors Equity, which places high expectations on both the actors and the production team. Realizing that the theatre is a public laboratory in which performers and audience members engage in the exploration of ideas, we select plays that pose fundamental questions about what it means to be a human being, created in the image of God, living in the midst of a fallen world.</p><p>The theatre program presents four main stage productions each year in the Smothers and Helen Lindhurst Theatres. Participation in department productions is open to all students.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Art History</head><p>Study of the visual arts prepares students for leadership in the global, connected, and dynamic world of the 21st century. To truly understand the significance of a work of art, the art historian must comprehend not only its formal qualities, but also the political, social, and religious contexts in which the work was created. Students of art history place art in its comprehensive historical context, assess art and the field of art history critically and analytically, master research, writing, and presentation skills, and foster community engagement in art through outreach and education. By examining works of art from multiple perspectives, students develop an appreciation for diverse cultures and the vital role that art plays in human expression across time and space.</p><p>Students planning to major in art history spend the first two years taking two foundational courses, completing general education requirements, and mastering language skills. The junior and senior years are spent concentrating on the major. In consultation with an art history faculty advisor, art history majors can select one or more areas of concentration depending on interests and career goals. Majors are strongly encouraged to participate in at least one of Pepperdine's international programs after consulting with an art history advisor regarding which international programs and courses would be most appropriate.</p><p>Art history majors should consider selecting German or French for their language requirement, as these languages are generally required in graduatelevel art history programs. Students who test out of the Seaver College language requirement are strongly encouraged to take a 252-level language course and one upper-division language course in their language of choice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Division</head><p>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division believes that undergraduate education is the special place where students can refine their values and learn the ideas and methods of thinking that will enrich their lives and vocations. Its programs develop the excellence of mind and qualities of soul that foster intellectual independence: spirited inquiry and disciplined imagination; intelligent interpretation and persistent questioning of texts; reverence for language and rigorous exposition, argumentation, logic, and problem solving; attentiveness to the phenomena of time and the ordering of history; and aesthetic and ethical understanding. These programs of study are morally inscribed, mobilizing the virtues that go hand-in-hand with academic inquiry-courage and confidence in one's undertakings, charity and civility, honesty and humility-all of which sustain communities of learning. This education aims to develop the whole person, whose habits of reflection and sound judgment strengthen students for lives of thoughtfulness, service, and responsible influence.</p><p>This academic division offers degrees in the several areas of study listed above. Students majoring in the humanities disciplines have gone on to careers in elementary, secondary, and college-level education; law and advocacy; business and nonprofit corporations; professional writing and editing; stage and the arts; and television, radio, and film. The division's emphasis on independent, rigorous thought and on collaborative analysis provides excellent preparation for graduate study in many fields. Graduates have achieved advanced degrees in business, creative writing, education, English, law, librarianship and information management, ministry and religion, and philosophy. Because the courses in this division develop skills and practices in written and verbal communication and in the arts of inquiry, they also complement any major. Double majors with non-humanistic disciplines are always welcomed.</p><p>The course offerings in the Humanities and Teacher Education Division are designed to:</p><p>• Develop the skills that underpin meaningful learning experience, including critical thinking, research acumen, and effective oral and written communication.</p><p>• Inculcate spiritually grounded habits of thought, supporting the ideal of a dignified and fully integrated self.</p><p>• Develop an appreciation of the breadth and richness of world cultures.</p><p>• Encourage integration of learning from various disciplines.</p><p>• Convey sophisticated, discipline-specific knowledge and theoretical comprehension in degree areas.</p><p>• Orient students toward lives of purposeful action on the basis of intellectual depth, cultural competence, and keen social awareness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Preparation</head><p>Teaching and the Humanities The Teacher Education department, housed in the same division with Humanities, maintains completely current instruction on all requirements toward a California teaching credential. The liberal arts for education major provides the breadth required of candidates for the multiple subject credential, while the English major provides the breadth and depth required of candidates for the single subject credential in English. (Single-subject teaching credentials are offered in a variety of other curricular areas as well.) Students can acquire both subject matter preparation and skills preparation, including: interpretation of literature; knowledge of the structure, history, and diversity of the English language; oral and written language skills; uses of technology; and (if they choose) teaching foundations and methodology. This study will prepare students for the appropriate credential examinations and for effective, well-informed teaching in their future occupation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Business and the Humanities</head><p>The modern business world recognizes the value of a strong background in the liberal arts and the humanities for management positions in business. Corporate leaders have found that students majoring in the humanities have acquired the skills and training valuable for success in business: communication skills; flexibility; decision-making ability; research skills; appreciation of creativity and excellence; and sensitivity to cultural and ethnic differences. Humanities students considering business careers may take a number of business courses along with their Humanities Division courses. With this combined background they will find broad opportunities in the business field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Law and the Humanities</head><p>Since the student will learn the content of law in law school, the best preparation in pre-law is an education that hones skills in analytical and logical thinking and in written and oral communication. A complete education should be the primary purpose of any liberal arts program, and the knowledge and intellectual maturity which the study of the humanities provides are aimed toward that goal. The English, history, and humanities degree programs are designed to provide training and practice in the skills needed in the field of law: logical thinking and analysis of arguments; close reading and analysis of texts; and effective writing and speaking. These skills will prepare students for the LSAT, for successful performance in their legal studies, and for a fulfilling career.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Writing and Editing</head><p>The ability to write well has become a highly valued specialization; persons skilled in this area find careers in writing and editing not only in publishing companies and magazines, but in businesses and government agencies of all sorts, and in the creative arts. The degree programs in creative writing and in the English writing and rhetoric emphasis provide profession-oriented training and practice that foster creativity in a variety of genres and for a variety of purposes, critical appreciation of written texts, refinement of communication skills, and knowledge of language conventions. These degree programs coordinate classroom learning with practical application through University creative writing publications and internships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Programs and Opportunities</head><p>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division offers students many opportunities to broaden the study of their chosen discipline and to apply their knowledge in practice through tutoring, writing internships, and guided research. These activities prove valuable in developing knowledge and skills needed in graduate study and in various careers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minors</head><p>Students have the opportunity to add to their major in one of the humanities disciplines and minor in one (or more) of the following: African American studies, digital humanities, film, Great Books, creative writing, writing, and women's studies. In addition, the English and history disciplines offer minors as well as majors. In consultation with their advisors, students may design a rich and varied undergraduate experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Application</head><p>Students who distinguish themselves in writing have the opportunity to gain practical experience applying their skills. After studying in a Writing Center practicum, they may be recommended for a paid position as a tutor in the Writing <ref type="bibr">Center.</ref> In addition, writing internships are available in business, nonprofit organizations, and publishing companies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research</head><p>Students may participate in a summer research program under a faculty member who will direct a small group in a focused project. Summer research helps students to expand and refine their research skills, gain advanced knowledge in the field, develop professionalism, and identify their career goals. The summer research experience is especially valuable for students planning on graduate study in their discipline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honor Societies Kappa Delta Pi</head><p>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division includes a chapter of Kappa Delta Pi, the international professional honor society in education. Members are offered opportunities for professional and scholarly development, networking, and service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phi Alpha Theta</head><p>History majors will find a chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, the international honorary society in history, in the Humanities and Teacher Education Division. Membership for faculty and students alike is a recognition of excellence in scholarship. The activities include participation in various professional gatherings and other events designed for the serious student of history. Members receive the society's journal, The Historian.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sigma Tau Delta</head><p>Pepperdine University shelters the Eta Psi chapter of Sigma Tau Delta, the international English honor society. Membership for students and faculty is a recognition of excellence in scholarship and creativity. The Pepperdine chapter sponsors activities related to the creative interests, scholarly and professional concerns, and service commitments of students of English. Students have the opportunity to submit creative writing and essays to the national society's two journals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing</head><p>The creative writing major is primarily designed to prepare students for inspiring careers as professional writers of screen and television, the novel, poetry, and the short story. Through intensive practice in our three-tiered creative writing sequence, students hone not only their skills but their understanding of the expectations and challenges of writing and publishing.</p><p>The major also prepares students for advanced graduate degrees in creative writing, literature, and other fields, as well as a variety of professional careers. Many careers demand a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of writing; while providing this understanding, creative writing also fine tunes the student's ear for language. These skills are important in work and leisure, written and oral media, self-exploration and politics, and in many other areas.</p><p>To complete the major requirements, students will choose from one of three emphases (fiction writing, poetry writing, or screen and television writing) and complete a 36-38 unit sequence, which includes a course in spiritual writing and foundational courses in English literature or Film.</p><p>Choose one from the following: 2 units CRWR 480 Senior Project (PS) <ref type="bibr">.</ref> (2) FILM 480</p><p>Senior Project <ref type="bibr">.</ref> (2)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in English</head><p>The English major at Pepperdine University, with its focus on writing and rhetoric, literary study and criticism, and digital humanities, provides students with facility in the spoken and written word, a keen understanding of the power of language, and a more finely attuned moral and global awareness. Students who major in English possess the creativity and critical thinking skills sought by firms in media, technology, and business. They are prepared upon graduation to work in teaching and publishing, and they are well prepared for graduate and professional study that leads to careers in higher education and law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course of Studies</head><p>Two lower-division and nine to 11 upper-division courses are required for the major. Completion of any course in the English sequence from 330 to 380 satisfies the general education literature requirement. Students should complete ENG 101 or its equivalent in their first semester. All English majors must take ENG 201 and ENG 205 as the first classes in the major; students emphasizing literature or English education should take ENG 330 and ENG 350 by the end of their second year. The fourth year is dedicated to the core completion courses: ENG 489 is offered only in the fall and is a prerequisite for ENG 490, which is offered only in the spring for graduating seniors. Students emphasizing writing and rhetoric or literature may take the required internship course, ENG 495, any time during the last two years. Transfer students or students participating in International Programs should meet with their major advisors to plan a comparable sequence.</p></div>

More information about the credential program can be found in the Teacher Education section of this catalog.</p><p>Graduates of the English Education Program who have earned a Single Subject Teaching Credential in English will be certified to teach English at the secondary level in California. This is an integrated program; students work on their BA in English Education as well as teacher certification simultaneously. Since this is a subject matter-approved program, students do not need to take the CSET. This certification also includes the areas of creative writing, speech, journalism, and drama; students who wish to specialize in one of these fields are encouraged to take additional courses in these areas.</p></div>

Successful applicants are approved based on GPA, a recommendation from the ENG 201 instructor, and a demonstrated potential for successful completion of the honors thesis. In the fall semester of their senior year, students will work with a faculty advisor to develop a research proposal, which must be approved by the English Honors Committee by the end of the fall semester. The proposal should include a bibliography of relevant material (primary and secondary) as well as an abstract of the project. Students should work closely with their faculty mentor on the thesis. During the spring of their senior year, honors students will enroll in ENG 490 (an existing course that also includes non-honors students) and write an article-length thesis. The thesis will be submitted in April of the students' senior year to their thesis advisor and to the English Honors Committee, who will determine whether honors will be awarded. Students are encouraged to present their research at local and national meetings and/or submit a revised article-length manuscript to a scholarly journal for publication. Students on whom the committee has conferred Honors on the basis of their theses will graduate with the notation "Honors in English" on their transcripts and diplomas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Film</head><p>The bachelor of arts in Film is an interdisciplinary, critical study of motion pictures. Students will be grounded deeply in the humanities as they examine the historical, cultural, societal, aesthetic, and spiritual nature of American and international films.

Such strengths are invaluable in the pursuit of advanced degrees in film or screenwriting and highly prized in a variety of fields, such as entertainment, business, and law. A candidate for the bachelor of arts degree in Film must complete all general education requirements and 40-49 units in the major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teaching Credential Programs</head><p>The objective of the Seaver teacher education program is to provide teacher candidates with the professional preparation and clinical experiences necessary to qualify them for the SB2042 Multiple Subject Preliminary Teaching Credential or the SB2042 Single Subject Preliminary Teaching Credential. The teaching credential program at Seaver is integrated into the bachelor's degree so that a candidate can work toward a bachelor's degree and a teaching credential simultaneously. Completing a bachelor's degree and the teacher education program generally requires eight or nine semesters; therefore, careful attention should be given to course scheduling. EDUC 461, 462, and 463/464 should be taken before the Teaching and Content Area Methods course (EDUC 510 or 520). Teacher candidates should plan their schedules in order to be ready to take the methods courses and clinical experiences during their last two semesters. Teacher candidates are encouraged to complete all major course work before their full-day student teaching clinical experience begins and may choose to complete it either during their senior year or immediately upon graduation.</p><p>The credential programs were developed in compliance with requirements of the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The SB2042 credential issued by CTC includes English Learner authorization. To learn about California Teaching Credentials, see the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing at ctc.ca.gov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Education Admission Requirements</head><p>Students are encouraged to seek advising from an education faculty member during their first year if they are interested in earning a teaching credential. All applicants to the Seaver teacher education program are admitted conditionally pending evaluation and clearance on University and state of California credential requirements. Admission to Seaver College does not guarantee admission to a teaching credential program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimum teacher education admission requirements include:</head><p>• An application, a one-page writing sample, and two letters of reference.</p><p>• An overall GPA of 2.500 or better. This must be maintained if the student is to remain in the program.</p><p>• Completion of a minimum of 45 semester units of undergraduate study at a regionally accredited institution of higher learning.</p><p>• A Certificate of Clearance conforming with state of California requirements.</p><p>• A tuberculosis clearance.</p><p>• Successful completion of EDUC 251, EDUC 461, and EDUC 462.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credential Requirements</head><p>The following are general requirements for all teacher credential candidates to be recommended to CTC for approval by Seaver College of Pepperdine University. Students must satisfy these as well as teacher education admission requirements.</p><p>• Be admitted to Seaver College.</p><p>• Complete a course at Seaver College or another regionally accredited institution giving instruction in the principles of the Constitution of the United States.</p><p>• Complete the bachelor's degree with a state-approved subject matter preparation or pass the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) exam.</p><p>• Complete the approved professional education program.</p><p>• Pass the Education Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA).</p><p>• Meet the Basic Skills Requirement (BSR).</p><p>• Multiple-subject candidates must pass the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA).</p><p>• Complete training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) that covers infant, child, and adult CPR skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple-Subject Credential</head><p>The multiple-subject teaching credential is generally considered to be an elementary school credential, most applicable to kindergarten and grades 1 through 6, where one classroom teacher traditionally is responsible for multiple subjects in the curriculum. This credential entitles the holder to teach a self-contained program, individually or as part of a teaching team, from preschool through grade 12.</p><p>Multiple-subject credential candidates must demonstrate subject-matter competence in the broad range of school curricula and teaching topics by passing the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET), which is offered regularly throughout the region by Evaluation Systems, Pearson. The state of California requires that students must have established subjectmatter competence prior to beginning EDUC 510 and EDUC 521. This is a state requirement and cannot be waived. Other qualifications may need to be met through course work and/or tests. Students may discuss additional requirements with their advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single-Subject Credential</head><p>Single-subject credential candidates may teach a single subject, specified on the credential, from preschool through grade 12. However, this credential is generally recognized as most appropriate for for those who want to teach middle and high school, grades 6 through 12.</p><p>Prior to beginning EDUC 520 and EDUC 521, teacher candidates must take and pass the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) to establish subject-matter competence. English majors in the commission-approved subject-matter program at Seaver are exempt from taking the CSET. All other candidates are required to take the CSET. This is a state requirement and cannot be waived.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Sequence Requirements</head><p>Students must complete the teacher education courses with a grade of C-or better and may only repeat a course one time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Division</head><p>In this age of technology, the liberally educated individual must understand the nature of scientific thinking, its power, and its limitations. The goal of the Natural Science Division is to provide accurate theoretical and practical information and offer students the opportunity to observe and participate in scientific problem solving.</p><p>The disciplines within the Natural Science Division foster scientific inquiry and provide students with an understanding of the nature of science and its place in society. Every Seaver College student has the opportunity to study science and mathematics by completing a general education course in the sciences with an accompanying laboratory experience as well as a mathematics course. The majors in the division offer an opportunity to study scientific principles in depth.</p><p>Integrated into University, division, and major curricula are several common goals of scientific understanding:</p><p>• To gain an understanding that the foundations of science are built upon the scientific method, a system of inquiry that requires curiosity, skepticism, tolerance for ambiguity, openness to new ideas, and, ultimately, the communication and sharing of knowledge.</p><p>• To participate in laboratory and research experiences, allowing students to learn the processes of scientific data collection through careful observation and sound experimental design.</p><p>• To discover that there are limits to scientific knowledge and to learn to articulate an understanding of what science can test and what it cannot. Students discover that scientific knowledge is not absolute but tentative and subject to revision.</p><p>• To be able to employ those mathematical and statistical concepts which are required to explain and understand scientific phenomena.</p><p>• To investigate the integration of faith and knowledge in science and to seek to articulate the distinctive roles that faith and science play in answering important questions about how the universe works.</p><p>The goals of the mathematics program are designed:</p><p>• To provide useful tools in mathematics for the various majors.</p><p>• To develop skill in logical thinking.</p><p>• To foster an understanding of the nature of mathematics.</p><p>The Natural Science Division also includes pedagogy study in the sciences in order to develop an understanding of the disciplines in science and a knowledge of how to teach others to learn sciences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Programs and Opportunities</head><p>Many opportunities exist for students to work as research and laboratory assistants and tutors. Experience in these capacities can be extremely valuable in developing knowledge and skills that are of great use in graduate study and in career endeavors. Internships are available in several areas, allowing students to obtain on-the-job experience while earning credits toward graduation.</p><p>Students in natural science laboratory classes utilize the facilities of the Keck Science Center, the Rockwell Academic Center, a variety of smaller research and special-project laboratories, a greenhouse, and nutritional science laboratories.</p><p>There is a long-standing commitment within the division to facultydirected undergraduate research. Students in these research programs present their findings at undergraduate research conferences, at natural science seminars, and in professional journals. These programs help students identify career goals, increase technical competence and confidence, develop professionalism, and enhance chances for success in pursuit of prestigious appointments to graduate and professional schools and in industry.</p><p>The undergraduate research programs have provided the primary impetus for the Natural Science Seminar series. In addition to student presentations, the series has included a number of distinguished scientists chosen for their ability to reinforce undergraduate course material and research interests in the division.</p><p>Seaver College's unique location affords students the opportunity to enroll in outdoor education and activity courses as diverse as surfing, triathlon training, and golf.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Health Professional Curricula</head><p>The University offers pre-health professional curricula for those students who plan to apply for admission to the following programs: medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and nursing. These curricula are not degree programs, and students who wish to complete the requirements for a bachelor's degree before admission to a professional school should select a major within the University, usually biology, chemistry, sports medicine, or other science major. In addition to fulfilling the requirements of the chosen major, specific requirements of the professional programs should be satisfied.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Research Program in Biology</head><p>Biology majors are encouraged to participate in the Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how scientists design experiments, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community. Students apply to the program in their sophomore or junior year and are admitted to the program based upon GPA, recommendations, career goals, and potential for successful completion of the program. Students are selected by a committee at midyear and, upon acceptance, develop research proposals in close consultation with a faculty member. After proposals are reviewed and approved by the committee, students begin preliminary experimentation. All students are required to spend the summer following acceptance to the program in full-time data collection and analysis. In order to complete the program, students must present their data in thesis form to an examining committee. After each candidate successfully completes an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student's transcript and diploma be marked "Honors in Biology." Thesis projects are often presented at local and national meetings and published in national and international scientific journals.</p></div>

Students are selected by a committee at mid-semester and, upon acceptance, develop research proposals in close consultation with a faculty member. After proposals are reviewed and approved by the committee, students begin preliminary experimentation. All students are expected to spend the second semester of their junior year, and possibly the summer between their junior and senior years, in data collection. The senior year is spent analyzing the data and preparing an honors thesis. To complete the program, students must present their data in thesis form to the examining committee. After successful completion of an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student's transcript and diploma be marked "Honors in Sports Medicine." It is expected that thesis projects will also be presented at local and national meetings and be published in national and international scientific journals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Division</head><p>With an emphasis on academic rigor and intellectual inquiry based on the personal commitment of each faculty member to Christ and the Christian faith, the Religion and Philosophy Division seeks to lead students into a deeper understanding of religion, especially of Christianity.</p><p>Academically, the division focuses on the one hand on biblical studies, Christian history, systematic theology, and practical theology/ministry; and on the other hand it explores matters of human knowledge and experience, morality and ethics, and reasoning. To those ends the division offers courses that introduce the student to the study of religion and philosophy within a variety of cultures, both ancient and modern.</p><p>Through its undergraduate majors, the division prepares students for a variety of undertakings. Some religion majors become ministers in local churches. Some will go on to earn graduate degrees (MA, MS, or MDiv) to enhance their ministerial skills and/or to pursue a career in university teaching. Majors in religion or philosophy provide students with a broad, liberal arts degree that prepares them well for graduate work and careers in law, journalism, business, psychology, counseling, government, and public service, to name but a few.</p><p>Through its three graduate degrees (MA in Religion, MS in Ministry, and MDiv), the division prepares students for a variety of Christian ministries, and for further graduate study in several related fields. Students who wish to combine their theological training with the training of the legal profession may earn the master of divinity degree jointly with the Juris Doctorate from the Pepperdine Caruso School of <ref type="bibr">Law.</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy</head><p>The philosophy major is designed to offer students a broad education in historical and contemporary philosophical explorations of various regions of human experience, including the nature of knowledge and reality, the theoretical foundations of morality and ethics, and the distinction between cogent and fallacious reasoning. Philosophy examines the fundamental assumptions and problems implicit in the framework of human experience, critically assesses those assumptions, and seeks to articulate and defend alternatives for their improvement. Consequently, the philosophy major offers students a valuable educational background for the pursuit of careers in law, journalism, government, Christian ministry, public service, and business.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Requirements</head><p>Two lower-division and seven upper-division four-unit courses are required for the philosophy major.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Division</head><p>The Social Science Division pursues inquiry about people and their social relations and institutions. Each of the separate disciplines in the divisioneconomics, political science, psychology, social work, and sociologyoffers its own unique perspective. Combining theory and research from these disciplines yields a more comprehensive, complex, integrated, and, ultimately, helpful view of humanity.</p><p>The objectives of the Social Science Division are:</p><p>• To provide knowledge and understanding of the social sciences and their historical and philosophical antecedents, major theoretical systems, research methods, and major research findings.</p><p>• To enhance the understanding that one's present perspective is a product of previous experience, that present behavior and attitudes have implications for the future, that alternative value systems have different implications and outcomes, and that some knowledge may be gained only through experiential contact.</p><p>• To develop skills in analytical thinking, synthesizing knowledge, quantitative methods, interpersonal relations, and application of theory to life situations.</p><p>• To foster attitudes that lead to social responsibility and political efficacy, respect for each individual and all cultures, a positive self-image, an appreciation for the ongoing learning process, adaptability to a dynamic society, and an appreciation for the vital institutions of a free society.</p><p>• To prepare students for careers after graduation or advanced study and training, active involvement in society, and life fulfillment through service to humankind.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Research Program in Political Science</head><p>Political science majors are encouraged to participate in the Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how professional political scientists design research projects, collect and analyze data or interpret philosophical texts, and communicate their results to the academic community. Students apply to the program in the spring semester of their junior year and are admitted to the program based on their GPA, career goals, successful completion of a course or courses in political methodology (such as POSC 250, 310, and/or 460), and the degree of congruence between the topic of the student's proposed honors project and the expertise of the regular members of the political science faculty. Students are selected by a committee in the spring semester of the student's junior year and are notified in time for preregistration for the fall semester of the next academic year. Upon acceptance into the program, students enroll in POSC 491: Honors Seminar. During the spring semester, the student will research and write an article-length manuscript under the supervision of one of the regular political science professors. In order to complete the program, students must present their findings in thesis form to an examining committee composed of the thesis supervisor and two other regular political science faculty. After each candidate successfully completes an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student's transcript and diploma be marked "Honors in Political Science." It is expected that the thesis will be presented as an academic conference paper and that a revised version will be submitted for publication as an article in a scholarly social science journal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Psychology</head><p>The psychology major is designed for students who (1) plan careers as professional psychologists, (2) regard psychology as a liberal arts undergraduate foundation for subsequent training in other professions, and (3) are generally interested in understanding human behavior. Because graduate study is usually required for careers in the psychological professions, the major is designed to give adequate preparation for such study.</p><p>A total of 43 units is required for the major. These include 16 units of foundation requirements, 13 to 16 upper-division units selected from each of four basic content areas, and three to four upper-division units chosen from capstone courses, from either applied or integrative areas. Remaining units may be selected from the four basic content areas, capstone courses, or special interest areas. Scientific writing and service learning are important components of the psychology curriculum. Students wishing more information about the major and careers in psychology should pick up the Psychology Advisory Handbook in the Social Science Division office and attend functions of Psi Chi, the national honor society in psychology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Research Program in Psychology</head><p>Psychology majors are encouraged to participate in the two-semester Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how psychological scientists design research projects, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community.

Upon acceptance into the program, students enroll in PSYC 493 (Honors Research Seminar I) and</p><p>PSYC 442 (Intermediate Statistics and Computer Applications) for the spring of their junior year, and then enroll in PSYC 494 (Honors Research Seminar II) for the fall of their senior year. During the first semester of the program, the student will design an original experiment including the formulation of a hypothesis, completion of a literature review, and creation of a research design under the supervision of one of the psychology professors. Students will be required to present their research proposals formally to the psychology faculty and the other students in the class. During the second semester of the program, students will collect and statistically analyze their data. In order to complete the program, students must present their research findings in written, APA format as a manuscript for publication as well as successfully complete an oral research presentation before the psychology faculty and students. Upon successful completion of these research requirements, the psychology faculty will recommend that students' transcripts and diplomas be marked "Honors in <ref type="bibr">Psychology."</ref> It is expected that the research will be presented at a local, regional or national professional psychological conference.</p></div>
