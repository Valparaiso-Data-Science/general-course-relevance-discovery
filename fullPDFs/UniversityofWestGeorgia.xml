<H1>The University System of Georgia </H1>

<P>The University System of Georgia's Board of Regents was created in 1931 as a part of a reorganization of Georgia's state government. With this act, public higher education in Georgia was unified for the first time under a single governing and management authority. The governor appoints members to the Board, who each serve seven years. Today the Board of Regents is composed of 19 members, five of whom are appointed from the state-at-large, and one from each of the 14 congressional districts. The Board elects a chancellor who serves as its chief executive officer and the chief administrative officer of the University System. The Board oversees 28 colleges and universities that comprise the University System of Georgia and has oversight of the Georgia Archives and the Georgia Public Library System. </P>

<H1>The University </H1>

<P>Overview </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia is a coeducational, residential, liberal arts institution located in Carrollton. A state university in the University System of Georgia, it enrolls students from most counties in Georgia as well as from other states and many foreign countries. Enrollment at West Georgia reached an all-time high with 13,520 students in the 2017 fall semester. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The University is situated on the western side of Carrollton, the county seat of Carroll County and one of Georgia's fastest growing industrial areas. Carrollton, an hour's drive from Atlanta, serves a regional population of more than 114,500 as a center for retail shopping, medical and educational services, entertainment and recreational activities, and financial services. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>History </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia originated in 1906, the date of the founding of the Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical School, one of twelve such institutions established by the State of Georgia between 1906 and 1917. Twenty-five years later, Carrollton's A&amp;M School became West Georgia College, a junior college established by an act of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. Dr. Irvine S. Ingram, who had been principal of the A&amp;M School, was named the institution's first president. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In 1939, the College was authorized by the Board of Regents to add a three-year program in elementary education. In 1957, the institution was authorized to confer the B.S. degree in education, making it a four-year senior college unit of the University System of Georgia. Two years later, West Georgia College added the Bachelor of Arts degree in the fields of English, history, and mathematics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>During the following years, West Georgia College became one of the fastest growing institutions of higher learning in the South. From an enrollment of 576 in 1957, the institution's student body now numbers 13,520. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In 1967, the Board of Regents authorized the initiation of a graduate program at the master's level. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In 1983, the Board of Regents approved the External Degree Program as a cooperative effort between Dalton College and West Georgia. Since its inception, close to 400 degrees have been conferred through the center. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Board of Regents in 1988 approved opening the Newnan Center (UWG Newnan), a joint effort involving the Newnan-Coweta Chamber of Commerce and other business, civic and educational leaders in the area. In 2013, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia voted to approve the acquisition of the real property at 80 W. Jackson Street, the site of the historic Newnan Hospital facility. UWG began serving students from this new site in summer 2015. With an enrollment of just under 1,000 students, the UWG Newnan provides a core curriculum, as well as full bachelor and masters programs, and dual enrollment for high school students. (See Public Services chapter) </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In June, 1996, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia awarded the institution university status and officially changed the name of West Georgia College to the State University of West Georgia, and in 2005 it became the University of West Georgia. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The University has seen significant growth in recent years. Two phases of residential housing provide variety to on-campus students including the apartment-style Center Pointe Suites, the Oaks </P>

<P>and the East Village Dining Hall, and Bowdon Hall. The Campus Center (student recreational facility), University Bookstore and the Visual Arts Building provide more access to students, while the Coliseum and the Athletic Operations Building offer space for UWG's expanding Athletics program. The gross asset value of the University's facilities is proximately $300 million. The University has grown to nearly 645 acres. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Presidents of the University </P>

<P>Dr. Irvine Sullivan Ingram served as West Georgia College's first president from 1933 to June 30, 1960, the longest presidential tenure in the history of the University System of Georgia. He was succeeded by Dr. William Hamilton Row, who served from July 1, 1960, until his death on March 15, 1961. At that time, Dr. Ingram was named acting president. He served in that capacity until Dr. James Emory Boyd was appointed president on August 16, 1961. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>After a decade of service to West Georgia College as president, Dr. Boyd retired on March 30,  </P>

<P>1971, to become vice-chancellor for academic development of the University System of Georgia. Vice-President George Walker served as acting president from April 1 to August 15, 1971. On August 16, Dr. Ward B. Pafford became the institution's fourth president. Dr. Pafford announced his resignation, effective June 30, 1975, in the fall of 1974. Dr. Maurice K. Townsend, vice president for academic affairs at Indiana State University, was named West Georgia's new president, effective July 1, 1975. Dr. Townsend served as the College's Chief Executive Officer until his death on May 16, 1993. Dr. Bruce W. Lyon, Vice President and Dean of Student Services, was named Acting President, effective June 1, 1993. The University System of Georgia, following an extensive national search, named Dr. Beheruz N. Sethna to head West Georgia, effective August, 1994. When the Board of Regents officially changed the name of the institution to the University of West Georgia in June, 1996, Dr. Sethna became the first president of the University under the new name. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Dr. Sethna retired as UWG president on June 30, 2013, after 19 years of service. The University System of Georgia performed a complete national search and named Dr. Kyle Marrero as the institution's seventh president, effective July 1, 2013. </P>

<P>The Campus </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia's award winning campus is a unique blend of old and new. Boasting abundant trees, shrubs, and flowers, the campus is dotted with structures of the early 1900's as well as buildings exemplifying the most contemporary modes of architecture. </P>

<P>Front Campus Drive, a three-block-long expanse of rolling hills shaded by scores of towering oak, elm, and maple trees, features historic structures such as Kennedy Interfaith Chapel and Bonner House, two of the oldest buildings on campus. In 1964, after the Chapel was moved to the campus, the late Robert F. Kennedy dedicated it to the memory of his brother, the late President John F. Kennedy. The Bonner House, constructed in 1843 as a plantation home, is the oldest building on campus. The frame colonial structure has served various purposes through the years. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A modern academic complex composed of a renovated library, the Technology-enhanced Learning Center, as well as social science, humanities and math-physics buildings lies beyond Front Campus Drive. Other buildings in the area include the Richards College of Business; the three-story University Community Center; the Campus Center, which boasts a full gym, indoor track, and rock-climbing wall; the Townsend Center for Performing Arts; and the newly-constructed Visual Arts Building. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>UWG also features some of the region's most impressive athletic facilities. The Coliseum, with a capacity of 6,500 for athletic events, has hosted concerts, graduations and community events. </P>

<P>University Stadium, a 9,500-seat home to UWG football, anchors the university's Athletic Complex. There are also football and soccer practice fields, as well as the Women's Complex, which features competition soccer and softball fields. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Greek Village and suite-- and apartment-- style residence halls offer comfortable and convenient living options for students on campus. The most recent additions include Center Pointe Suites and The Oaks residential community. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The UWG Bookstore, conveniently located across the street from both the TLC and the Greek Village, offers textbooks, spirit wear, snacks, and more. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The university's newest facility is the Tanner Health System School of Nursing building. With 64,000 square feet of technology-equipped space, the new building provides nursing students with unprecedented access to state of the art equipment. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>UWG is completing a $24-million renovation and expansion of its Biology Building and is constructing a new student health center that will be twice the size of the current facility.  The University is in the planning stages for a new building to house the Richards College of Business. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A commitment to campus growth and expansion will continue to be a priority for our institution, with several construction projects on the horizon. </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Irvine Sullivan Ingram Library </P>

<P>https://www.westga.edu/library/ </P>

<P>As the academic heart of the campus, Ingram Library provides both online and in-house collections and services to meet curricular needs. The four story building provides seating space for 800, three electronic classrooms, small group study rooms, and computers and other equipment for accessing materials retained in print, online, recorded and micro for-mats. Wireless access to internet resources is available throughout the building as well as in the Starbucks cafe and adjacent patio overlooking Love Valley. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The library is named in honor of Irvine Sullivan Ingram, 1892-1981, the institution's first president. The glass enclosed lobby overlooks a study garden designed in honor of Maurice Townsend, fifth president of the university. The lobby area provides study tables and casual seating and displays of new books, current newspapers and periodicals. Ingram Library houses a collection of student and faculty art, including &quot;The Prophet,&quot; a bronze by Gary Coulter, presented by the Class of 1968. A bowl by renowned artist Phillip Moulthrop, Class of 1969, which Mr. Moulthrop donated to the College of Arts &amp; Humanities in 2012, is displayed on the main floor. The third floor features the 1980 ceramic mural &quot;Sporangium Disseminating Spores&quot; by Cameron Covert and Bruce Bobick of the Department of Art. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Library collections include some 450,000 cataloged volumes, some 1,000,000 microforms, and more than 20,000 maps and charts. The library provides access to over 70,000 print and electronic serials, including magazines, scholarly journals, and newspapers. As a selective depository for federal documents, the library houses United States government publications and provides access to government information available in online and other electronic formats. Library users have access to Georgia Library Learning Online (GALILEO), an online library of databases, full text electronic journals, and reference resources available to all Georgians, as well as to an extensive range of electronic materials selected to support the university's academic programs. All licensed electronic materials are available to university students, faculty and staff through any computer with internet access. By providing access to an extensive range of online materials, through its chat reference service, by developing an electronic reserve system and online request systems for obtaining materials from other libraries, the library ensures that students enrolled at the university's remote class sites and in online courses are afforded the same level of library support as those who attend classes on the Carrollton campus; the Library's Off-Campus Services unit provides materials to such students as needed, upon request through its interlibrary loan system. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The library participates in state and regional consortia, facilitating extensive access to the collective resources of university system and other libraries. The library catalog, provided through Georgia Interconnected Libraries (GIL), lists materials available in Ingram Library collections, and provides links to catalogs of other libraries. West Georgia students, faculty, and staff may request books from any university system library through the online GIL Express service, a feature of the universal catalog, and they also have check out privileges when visiting system libraries. In addition, the University of West Georgia is a member of the Atlanta Regional Council for Higher Education (ARCHE), which allows students, faculty and staff to utilize the resources of member libraries. Ingram Library provides interlibrary loan service through its web site, facilitating the borrowing of books from libraries throughout the country. Articles requested through interlibrary loan are transmitted to patrons electronically. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The library pursues an active instruction program. LIBR 1101 , a for-credit course which is part of Area B of the Core, is taught face to face as well as online. The course is designed to orient students to doing research in academic libraries and to critically evaluating information and media resources. Library skills classes are also arranged at the request of faculty and tailored to specific assignments and class needs. Individuals seeking assistance with library resources and research needs can utilize reference services at the reference desks, via telephone, and through the </P>

<P>24/7online chat reference service available through the library web site. Students can make personal research appointments with librarians through the GoPRO service. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Annie Belle Weaver Special Collections area on the ground floor of Ingram Library provides access to information about the history of the university and the geographic area it serves. Photographs, family histories, and other materials associated with the west Georgia region are included in Special Collections, as are materials on sacred harp music and American psalmody. The Humanistic Psychology and Parapsychology collections include the papers of Sidney Jourard, Carmi Harari, William Roll, Ingo Swann, and Edith Weisskopf-Joelson. A special effort is made to acquire the manuscript collections of individuals who have represented the region in state or national legislative bodies. One of the most notable collections is that associated with Georgia's Political Heritage Program, be-gun by university faculty in 1985. The collection includes taped interviews with state and national leaders, among them most of Georgia's post-World War II governors, U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy. Senator Herman Talmadge was the first interview subject for the program. The Talmadge collection is particularly significant as it includes some thirty-five interviews recorded between 1985 and 1995 as well as interviews with his staff and some of his supporters. The Thomas B. Murphy Reading Room and State Capitol Office installation, dedicated in 2012, honors Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy who left office in 2002 with the distinction of serving as the nation's longest-serving House speaker.

<P>The Antonio J. Waring, Jr. Archaeological Laboratory is a unique facility within Georgia. As part of the University's Anthropology Department, it holds a large collection of historic and prehistoric artifacts from archaeological sites all across Georgia. The collections curated here for governmental and private agencies provide essential research data for the West Georgia faculty, as well as for visiting scholars from across the country, and also offer undergraduate students at West Georgia special opportunities for academic training and research experience. Anthropology majors and other undergraduate students are encouraged to enrich their academic experience through laboratory and field research methods courses in which they participate directly in active research projects under the direction and supervision of archaeologists on the faculty at the University.

<P>Weather/Emergency Closing </P>

<P>Because of the difficulty in making up lost time, classes or examinations are cancelled only in extreme circumstances. In the event of an emergency University closing, announcements will be made over radio stations in Carrollton and the surrounding area, and radio and television stations in Atlanta. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>At times of bad weather or other emergencies, University officials make decisions on whether or not to close the campus based on current conditions, recommendations provided the the Director of Emergency Operations Management and University Police and other considerations. In such cases, the safety and security of the majority of the students is a prime consideration; however, we recognize that there may be special circumstances that pertain to individual students that are more serious than those that apply to the majority. Students are advised to use their best judgment about their safety and that of their families in those situations. Students should consult with individual faculty members about making up lost time. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Official announcements about class/examination cancellations will be made only by the President and/or the office of University Communications and Marketing via Wolf Alert text, e-mail and UWG's website. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The University reserves the right to schedule additional classes or examination sessions should some be cancelled. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Information on cancelled or rescheduled classes or examination sessions may also be obtained by calling the Department of University Police Weather Line, 678-839-6200 (day and night) - Please Do Not call the Emergency Number; the office of University Communications and Marketing, 678-</P>

<P>839-6464 (daytime only); or visiting the University Web-site at www.westga.edu or enroll in Wolf Alert - the University's emergency warning system. To register, log into the Portal and within the University Police box, click on the Wolf Alert icon and enroll your phone(s) and e-mail addresses. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Awards and Honors </P>

<P>West Georgia encourages and rewards excellence among its students. Qualified students are invited to join approximately twenty honor societies, some representing specific academic disciplines and others representing groups of a general nature. These honor organizations, many of which have national affiliations, are listed in the Student Organizations section. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Annually, each of the thirty-one institutions in the University System of Georgia is asked to select one student as its representative for Academic Recognition Day honors awarded by the Board of Regents and the Georgia Legislature. The student chosen must be representative of outstanding scholastic achievement on his or her campus, have a GPA of 4.0 or very close to it, be an undergraduate, and be a resident of Georgia. Nominations are made to the President of the University by the Honors College Dean, who reviews the academic and University service record of the nominees in consultation with the Honors College Committee. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Held annually in the spring, the Academic Honors Convocation is devoted to the recognition of superior academic achievement by students. This occasion is marked by a procession of student honorees accompanied by faculty in academic regalia, the presentation of individual and special awards, and an appropriate program. In addition, during the winter there is a special Academic Awards Ceremony for Minority Students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>One of the most prestigious student awards is named for the late Professor of Education and Dean of Students at West Georgia, Dr. John J. Pershing. It is presented annually by the West Georgia Chapter of the American Association of University Professors to the senior who has earned the highest academic average over a four-year period. The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi also presents annual Awards of Excellence to the outstanding student in the undergraduate colleges at West Georgia. These students are selected on the basis of scholarship, character, citizenship, service to the University, and potential for leadership. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who excel in other ways are acknowledged through the Campus Activities and Awards Program, which is held each spring to honor students who have made outstanding leadership contributions in the areas of student life and extra- and co-curricular activities. Similarly, an annual Athletic Awards Banquet commemorates outstanding achievements among student athletes. Various individual departments sponsor occasions to recognize excellence and reward outstanding contributions by students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Who's Who in American Universities and Colleges </P>

<P>The names of a limited number of West Georgia juniors, seniors, and graduate students are included each year in Who's Who in American Universities and Colleges. Students are nominated by a student, faculty, or staff member. A campus nominating committee then selects students based on their academic achievement, service to the community, leadership in extracurricular activities and potential for continued success. </P>

<P> </P>

<H1>Expenses </H1>

<P>Business Policy </P>

<P>The University year is divided into two semesters of approximately fifteen weeks each and a summer semester of approximately eight weeks. Expenses are charged and payable by the semester since each semester constitutes a separate unit of operation. A student may enroll at the beginning of any semester. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students are responsible for meeting all financial obligations to the University when they fall due. West Georgia reserves and exercises the right to deny admission, to withhold transcripts and other educational records, to cancel the enrollments of students, and to delay the graduation of students who fail to meet promptly their financial obligations to the institution. Each student is responsible for keeping informed of all registration and fee payment dates, deadlines, and other requirements by referring to the official calendar and announcements published in the course bulletin, students UWG email account, and other printed and posted announcements. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who fail to satisfy financial obligations in a timely manner will be referred to an outside collection agency and will be held responsible for any additional charges not to exceed 33.3% associated with the collection of an unpaid debt. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>To insure that financial operation is in conformity with the policies of the Board of Regents, certain regulations must be observed. Fees and charges must be paid by the published deadlines. Fees and charges may be paid in cash, by MasterCard, Discover, American Express, VISA, or by check in the exact amount of the student's bill. If any check is not paid on presentation to the bank on which it is drawn, a service charge of $25 or 5%, whichever is greater, will be made. When one fee check or two non-fee checks have been returned by any student's bank without payment, his check cashing privileges will be suspended for a year. Registration at the beginning of each semester is not complete until all fees and charges have been paid. If a student's fee check is returned for non-payment by their bank, the registration is subject to cancellation and a late fee of $75 will be due in addition to a service charge of $25 or 5%, whichever is greater. In the event, a student's registration is cancelled and the student seeks the reinstatement of classes, a $200 fee will be assessed to the student and is due upon reinstatement along with all other charges on the student's account. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Tuition and Other Student Fees </P>

<P>All students pay the established tuition and mandatory fees (e.g., health, athletic, technology, activity, campus center, transportation fees, and etc.) which are listed on the Bursar's website at https://www.westga.edu/bursar/.  A few courses require special fees, such as private music lessons, aquatic, and science courses, and are listed at https://www.westga.edu/student-services/bursar/assets-bursar/docs/fy18_special_course_misc_fees.pdf. These fees are an estimation and are subject to change per the Board of Regents. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Table of Charges </P>

<P>Registration at the beginning of each semester is not complete until all fees and charges have been paid, including for previous semesters. Fees and charges are due by the published deadlines. A late fee is charged beginning the day after new student registration. See the Bursar's site at https://www.westga.edu/bursar/ for tuition and fees. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Residence Hall Charges Per Semester </P>

<P>Housing rates can be viewed on the Housing and Residence Life website. Contracts are for 9 months, although rates are listed per semester. The Housing Rates page includes the rates for the Application Fee, Special Interest Housing Fee, and Social Fee, which is assessed each semester to all on-campus residents except Greek Village residents (due to Comprehensive Fee). The social fee is used to support resident hall activities. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>6. In addition to the minimum test score requirement, a minimum Freshman Index of 2120 is required for any level of freshman or transfer freshman admission. </LBody>

<LI>
<LBody>8. A high school senior who is earning college credit in a joint enrollment program while completing the senior year should apply to West Georgia as a beginning freshman but should indicate enrollment in a joint enrollment program on the application for admission. West Georgia will grant transfer credit for this work under the following conditions: (1) Work must be earned through an accredited college. (2) Individual courses must meet the normal guidelines for acceptability (see Transfer Student section). </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Transfer Student </P>

<P>A transfer applicant is one who has been enrolled in any regionally accredited college or university. All previous college attendance must be reported at the time of application. Those who have earned fewer than 45 quarter hours/30 semester hours of transferable work or the equivalent will be asked to comply with both freshman and transfer requirements for admission (see freshman requirements for additional details). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A transfer applicant should request the registrar of each college or university he or she has attended to send a transcript to the Office of Admissions. Credits from one former institution appearing on the transcript of another institution can neither be officially evaluated for admission nor accepted for credit until a transcript has been received from the institution originating the credit. </P>

<P>Transfer students will be considered for admission on the basis of their previous college records: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. They must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 in all transferable college work attempted (non-traditional transfer students with greater than 45 quarter hours/30 semester hours of transferable work may be considered with a lower GPA on a case-by-case basis in order to determine their ability to be successful). </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. Students not meeting the minimum GPA requirement may be admitted if they hold an associate degree in a college transfer program from an accredited college and if they have not attempted any college coursework since completing the associate degree. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>3. Students must be in good social and academic standing at their former institutions. Students who have been away from high school for less than five years must have completed all RHSC deficiencies and/or Learning Support requirements prior to being admissible and show both English and math proficiency through course credit. Students who have been away from high school for greater than five years may prove proficiency in English, Reading, and Math either through placement testing, valid SAT/ACT scores (less than seven years old), or completion of college coursework. Transfer students from an out-of-state institution may also prove proficiency via the placement test on a case by case basis. Please contact the Admissions Office for further policy details. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>4. Admission acceptance by the Office of Admission does not guarantee admission to a specific program or department. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Transfer credit is normally awarded for all college work earned through any college or university approved by its regional accrediting association, so long as similar credit is offered at West Georgia. Credit earned at a post-secondary institution that is not regionally accredited may be accepted at West Georgia if the course work is similar to course work in the student's degree program at West Georgia and if the course work is deemed to be collegiate level work. Credit earned at proprietary schools and technical institutions that are not Commission of Colleges (COC) accredited is not reviewed for transfer credit. The following stipulations on the transfer of credit are upheld: </P>

<P>The amount of academic credit that the University will allow for work done in another institution within a given period of time may not exceed the normal amount of credit that could have been </P>

<P>earned at the University during that time. The maximum number of academic hours accepted is 90 from all institutions. Not more than a combined total of 30 hours of extension, correspondence work and military education/training will be accepted. </P>

<L>

<LBody>1. The amount of academic credit that the University will allow for work done in another institution within a given period of time may not exceed the normal amount of credit that could have been earned at the University during that time.

Not more than a combined total of 30 hours of extension, correspondence work and military education/training will be accepted </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. According to Board of Regents policy, if a student transfers to West Georgia with an A.A. or A.S. degree from an institution within the University System of Georgia, he/she will receive full credit for having completed Core Areas A - F. If the major differs between the A.A. or A.S. degree program and the major the student decides to pursue at West Georgia, there may be additional courses required at the 1000 or 2000 level that are specific to that degree major and/or are prerequisite for higher level courses that the student would have to take (example: Some majors require the student to have had Precalculus or Calculus I in order to enroll in some higher level courses in the program of study. If the student had College Algebra as a part of his/her A.A. or A.S. program, he/she would still receive credit for having completed the Math section of Area A of the Core, but he/she would still be required to take Precalculus or Calculus I to complete the requirements of the major.). The Core credit policy does not apply to career degrees (A.A.S. and A.S.); in those cases, each course is evaluated individually and credit is given in areas where comparable courses are offered at West Georgia, including some courses that may be counted as Core or electives. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>3. Dual/Joint Enrollment Credit: College credit earned at an accredited institution prior to high school graduation will be considered as transfer credit if the student was enrolled as a joint enrollment/early admission student. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>4. Transfers from Technical College System of Georgia Colleges The Board of Regents and the Technical College System of Georgia have entered into an agreement referred to as the &quot;Mini-Core Project.&quot; The agreement states that course credits for basic skills courses in English and mathematics with common course content will be transferable between schools in the University System of Georgia and COC-accredited institutions in the Technical College System of Georgia. Comparable placement and exit test results will be honored between the two systems as well. The transfer agreement is effective for students from COC-accredited Technical College System of Georgia institutions who have taken ENG 191 and/or MAT 190 or 191 since January 2002, and who meet the minimum test score requirements for exemption from developmental studies, or successfully complete and meet the minimum test score requirements for exit from developmental studies English and/or mathematics. Courses other than those approved for the mini-core agreement will be evaluated on an individual basis for possible transfer credit. In order to be eligible for mini-core transfer credit, students must have earned satisfactory scores on either placement or exit tests. Students with minimum old SAT Critical Reading 430; RSAT Reading Section 24 (ACT 17) + SAT Math 410; RSAT Math 450 (ACT 17) + high school diploma/GED and four years of college prep English, Algebra I and II, and Geometry, and a college prep math higher than Algebra II will be exempt from placement testing. Exit from Learning Support at a COC-accredited TCSG institution will be honored if the student has a record of meeting the TCSG minimum test score requirement for exit at UWG within the past year. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>5. Students who apply for undergraduate admission and have attended a non-accredited institution will be requested to provide an official transcript from that institution. For the purposes of the evaluation of credit, the Admissions Office will request the student provide a catalog, course syllabi, and the names and credentials of the faculty who taught their courses. The student may be able to obtain this information from the institution's Website. The Admissions Office will forward all materials received to the Registrar's </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>Office for review of credit. Lower division courses will be evaluated by the Registrar's Office and credit awarded based upon the materials provided by the student. The decision to award credit may be referred to the appropriate department in some cases. Upper division courses will be evaluated by the appropriate academic department. Departmental decisions on UWG equivalents are final. There is no appeal beyond the departmental level. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>6. Provided all other stipulations regarding transfer credits are met, West Georgia will grant transfer credit for the following: All courses with grades of &quot;C&quot; or better All Core Curriculum courses earned at University System institutions with grades of &quot;D&quot; or better, with the exception noted in #7 below Other courses with grades of &quot;D&quot; provided the average for all academic courses being transferred does not fall below &quot;C&quot; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>7. A grade of &quot;D&quot; in English composition is not acceptable. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>8. Credit for specific courses designated as major courses will not be allowed unless grades are &quot;C&quot; or above. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>9. A grade of &quot;C&quot; or above is required for all professional sequence courses in education and those courses listed under content field. None of the professional education sequence may be completed by extension or correspondence. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>10. Students who experience problems with transfer of credit should contact the Registrar's Office to determine the nature of the problem. If the problem is not resolved, students should contact the University Chief Transfer Officer to seek resolution to the problem. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>11. The University System of Georgia Board of Regents authorizes the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs to make decisions about exceptions on a case-by-case basis when questions arise about course substitutions in the Core curriculum. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Transfer course equivalencies may be viewed at http://westga.edu/transfer. Courses listed reflect results from previously reviewed transcripts and in no case should this list be considered a final and/or a complete listing. </P>

<P>Advanced Placement, College Level Exam Programs, Departmental Exams, Cambridge International &quot;A&quot; Levels, and International Baccalaureate (IB) Exams </P>

<P>The Advanced Placement (AP) Program is available through many high schools and enables a high school student to earn credit toward college in a variety of subjects. Usually these courses are equivalent to college freshmen/sophomore level courses such as American Government, World History, Composition, and so forth. College credit will be awarded based on standardized exams administered at the high schools in mid to late May. If you have questions, contact the Admissions Office. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>High school students who earn AP exam scores of 3 or higher (on a scale of 1-5) on most exams and who submit official score reports to the University of West Georgia will automatically receive credit for coursework. Scores of 4 or higher are required to receive credit for history exams. Scores of 4 or 5 count as &quot;Honors credit.&quot;  For a list of scores accepted by UWG and the UWG course equivalents, please visit the UWG Registrar's Office website at http://www.westga.edu/registrar. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) is offered at West Georgia by appointment and allows persons to earn college credit by achieving appropriate cutoff scores on nationally standardized exams. Exams available cover a range of courses including math, history, government, literature, and sciences.  For a list of scores accepted by UWG and the UWG course equivalents, please visit the UWG Registrar's Office website at http://www.westga.edu/registrar. Test registration information is available through the Testing Office (678-839-6435). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>As with AP testing, CLEP is a great way to earn college credit. Not only will a person save time by not having to take a course containing material he already knows, but he will also save money by not having to pay for a college class. Thus, CLEP enables a student to move through his or her freshman and sophomore years at a faster pace. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>International Baccalaureate (IB) scores are also reviewed for possible college credit. Credit is awarded International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level tests with a score of 5 or higher. In some areas of study, credit is awarded for scores of 4. Credit is awarded IB Standard Level tests with a score of 6 or higher if the student completes the IB diploma. Please see specific course equivalencies on the Registrar's Office web page at http://www.westga.edu/registrar/ Freshman and sophomore level credit is awarded for the Cambridge International &quot;A&quot; levels. Please contact the Assistant Registrar for Transfer Equivalency http://www.westga.edu/registrar/ for more details. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Note: CLEP, AP, and IB scores for equivalent credit may be viewed on the UWG's Registrar's Website at http://www.westga.edu/registrar/ </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Departmental Exemptions </P>

<P>Transient Student </P>

<P>A student who has taken work in a college or university may apply for the privilege of temporary registration. Such a student is one who expects to return to the college or university in which he or she was previously enrolled. The normal application procedure consists of filing an application form with a $40 non-refundable fee for each semester of transient study. The dean or registrar of the college where the student has been enrolled must give written approval for the student to attend West Georgia. The following policies shall govern the admission of a transient student: An applicant will be accepted as a transient student only when it appears that the applicant's </P>

<P>previous academic work is of satisfactory quality. A student must not be under suspension or exclusion from the previous institution. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. Enrollment as a transient student is limited to one semester.

</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>5. Transient students are not eligible for financial assistance (grants, loans, HOPE scholarship, etc.) through the University of West Georgia. Transient students must make financial assistance arrangements with their &quot;home&quot; institution. </LBody>

<P>All applicants who hold baccalaureate degrees should apply for admission through the Admissions Office. </P>

<P>Students accepted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions as unclassified/post baccalaureate are only required to show academic proof of a degree for admittance but are not eligible for financial aid consideration. Unclassified students are eligible to begin registering for courses three days prior to the start of each semester. A student admitted as Unclassified, and who wishes to seek an undergraduate degree from UWG, must reapply for transfer admission to the Undergraduate Office of Admissions and must meet University transfer admission requirements. The undergraduate transfer application and transcripts from each college attended must be received by the announced application and document deadline date. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Auditor </P>

<P>Auditors are students who enroll as observers or listeners only. They are regarded as official visitors and are eligible to begin registering for courses three days prior to the start of each semester. An application form must be submitted to the Office of Admissions (including a $40 non-refundable fee) prior to the application deadline date of the semester for which they plan to enroll. Auditors who do not stay continuously enrolled must reapply each term they wish to be an auditor. The minimum requirement for participation as an auditor is verification of graduation from an accredited high school or the possession of a GED certificate. Credit is not awarded for audit and no grade other than V (symbol for audit) is given. Auditors pay the regular fees for enrollment. Students are prohibited from receiving credit for courses for which they were registered as auditors unless the course is repeated for credit. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>International/Permanent Resident Student </P>

<P>An international applicant is defined as an individual that is not a 'legally domiciled resident' of the United States and plans to pursue studies on an F-1 (student) or J-1 (exchange student) visa. A permanent resident is an applicant from another country who has obtained permanent residency in the United States (holds a &quot;green card&quot;). It is recommended that international students apply four (4) to six (6) months prior to the semester of desired enrollment. </P>

<P>Students who were previously enrolled, but have not been in attendance for three semesters, and students who have been academically suspended for one year or dismissed must apply for readmission with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at least three weeks before the semester for which they are applying begins. Students who have attended another college or university since last attending West Georgia must submit official transcripts from each institution attended. If the student desires to live in a university residence hall, he or she must submit a housing application with the required deposit to the Housing and Residence Life Office. </P>

<P>  </P>

During the readmission application process, the student will be given the option of selecting to return as a degree seeking (2nd degree) or non-degree seeking (professional development) student. </P>

<P>Once the readmission application is processed, the student will need to meet with an academic advisor to be able to register for an upcoming semester. Students who are not currently enrolled will be able to register during the open registration period once they have been accepted and met with an academic advisor. See Registrar Calendar inside the SCOOP for registration dates. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Graduate Student Admission </P>

<P>Admission to a Graduate Program involves submitting to the Office of Admissions, an application and a $40 application fee. Each program has its own unique academic requirements. See the Graduate Catalog for details. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Definition of a &quot;Georgia Resident&quot; for Purposes of Applying and Paying Fees </P>

<P>A student who is not a legal resident of the State of Georgia is charged out-of-state tuition. Hence, the determination of whether a student is classified in-state or out-of-state for tuition purposes is </P>

<P>significant, and the applicant must indicate his or her classification on the application for admission. For more detailed information, see Regents' Policies Governing the Classification of Students. </P>

<P>Additionally, in accordance with Board of Regents Policy 4.3.4, all applicants who are accepted for admission or readmission to institution for fall 2011 or any academic semester thereafter, and who seek to be classified as in-state for tuition purposes, will be required to provide validation of residency and lawful presence in both the state of Georgia and the United States. </P>

<P> </P>

<H1>Financial Aid </H1>

<P>www.westga.edu/finaid </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The primary purpose of financial aid programs is to provide assistance to those whose personal and family resources are not sufficient to pay for the total cost of their education. Federal and state governments, the University, foundations, companies, and individuals provide these funds for worthy students. The university community also believes that academic excellence should be rewarded, and, as a result, some scholarships are awarded each year based exclusively on merit. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>All applicants interested in federal and state financial aid programs must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and any required documentation regarding their own and their family's financial resources. The exact composition of an aid package depends upon several factors. The extent of a student's financial need, the availability of funds, the student's academic record, and the date of application may affect the aid package. In order to receive financial aid at the University of West Georgia, students must be in good academic standing or they must be accepted for admission. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The principal programs available to the University of West Georgia students are outlined below. More detailed information can be found on the Financial Aid website: www.westga.edu/finaid. To obtain more information, telephone the office at 678-839-6421 or visit the website at www.westga.edu/finaid. Questions may be sent by e-mail to finaid@westga.edu. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Financial assistance is not available to those admitted to the University of West Georgia as transient or non-degree post baccalaureate students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Requirements for Receiving Financial Aid </P>

<P>In order to qualify for financial aid, students must have a high school diploma or GED or have completed homeschooling at the secondary level. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress </P>

<P>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements are meant to ensure that students are able to complete their academic program in a timely manner through achieving minimum academic standards. In an age of increasing accountability for the use of federal, state, and institutional student aid funds, institutions of higher education and their students must demonstrate that financial aid funds are being used to assist students in efficiently completing their academic goals. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia (UWG) has developed the following Satisfactory Academic Progress policy for Financial Aid recipients to encourage student success and accountability in the use of Financial Aid funds for educational purposes. While the University of West Georgia maintains an academic progress policy for the determination of a student's continued academic eligibility for enrollment purposes, the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy for Financial Aid purposes may be more stringent in some components in order to maintain compliance with Federal Student Aid regulations (34 CFR 668.34). </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>I. Consistency of Application of SAP Standards Unless otherwise noted, the SAP requirements as stated apply to all students regardless of the student's receipt of financial aid funds, the student's academic classification as an undergraduate or graduate student, or the student's academic program. Exceptions (as noted below) will include but are not limited to the minimum GPA requirement and maximum time frame hours for graduate students. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>II. Frequency of SAP Evaluation The UWG Financial Aid Office will evaluate all students' Satisfactory Academic Progress status at the conclusion of each term of enrollment. At </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>UWG, the term of enrollment is the semester. Students enrolled in summer semester will be evaluated for SAP at the conclusion of the summer semester. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>III. Grade-Point Average (GPA) Requirement  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>A. Undergraduate students will be evaluated each semester on the basis of cumulative GPA and the total number of hours attempted. Hours transferred will be included in determining the total hours attempted; however, the cumulative GPA will be computed only on the work completed at UWG (institutional GPA). The cumulative GPA required to maintain SAP for the total number of hours attempted is given below:  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> 0 - 30 attempted hours = 1.8 minimum institutional GPA </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> 31 - 60 attempted hours = 1.9 minimum institutional GPA </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> 61 attempted hours &amp; above = 2.0 minimum institutional GPA </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>B. Graduate students will be evaluated each semester on the basis of cumulative institutional GPA. The minimum cumulative GPA required to maintain SAP is 3.00. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>C. Impacts on GPA regardless of undergraduate or graduate level:  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Transfer credits will not be included in the quality points or GPA hours. The GPA standard is based on UWG credits only. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The first 30 hours of Learning Support (remedial) credits will be excluded from the GPA calculation. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Incomplete courses taken at UWG will be excluded from the GPA calculation. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Grades of W will be excluded from the GPA calculation (not from the pace of progression requirement; see next section) </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Grades of F or WF will count in the GPA calculation as 0 quality points. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> For courses which are repeated at UWG, the last attempt will count in the GPA calculation. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> These Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress standards do not consider an Academic Renewal GPA. All prior institutional grades are included in the SAP GPA. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>IV. Pace of Progression All students will be evaluated each semester to determine that they are making satisfactory pace of progression through their academic program. A minimum 67% cumulative completion ratio will be required at each evaluation period. Pace of progression is defined as the ratio of the cumulative number of credit hours completed divided by the cumulative number of credit hours attempted: </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Cumulative hours earned/Cumulative hours attempted &gt;= 67%  </P>

</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Satisfactory - Student is meeting the GPA, Pace of Progression, and Maximum Time Frame requirements. Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Warning - Student is not meeting either the GPA or Pace of Progression requirements (or both). Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid for one semester only. Continued eligibility beyond the warning semester will be contingent on the student bringing the deficient requirements to the required minimum standards. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> FA Suspension - Student is not meeting either the GPA or Pace of Progression requirements (or both) after a Warning semester. Student is not eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid until the deficient requirements return to the required minimum standards. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Maximum Time Frame Warning - Student is within 10 attempted hours of the allotted attempted hours for Maximum Time Frame for the student's degree program. Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid until the completion of the semester during which allotted attempted hours is crossed. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Maximum Time Frame - Student has exceeded the number of attempted hours for the academic program. Student has exhausted all eligibility to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> FA Probation - Student placed on FA Suspension or Maximum Time Frame provided an SAP Appeal which was approved by UWG review procedures. Student must complete the requirements of an academic plan which will be monitored by the Financial Aid Office in conjunction with other academic support offices. Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid for one semester only in coordination with the details of the academic plan. The student's continued eligibility beyond the probation semester will be determined at the conclusion of each semester in coordination with the details of the academic plan. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>VII. Appeals A student who has been placed on FA Suspension or Maximum Time Frame may appeal the SAP status decision only in cases of extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances for which a student may file an SAP appeal may include a student's injury or illness, serious illness or death of an immediate family member, or other special circumstances. Each SAP appeal will be reviewed individually and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis as outlined in the procedures given below.  The SAP appeal process requires the submission of a written statement by the student outlining the extenuating circumstances which led to their academic difficulties, how the circumstances have now changed, and the student's plan for improving the academic status. The written statement must be typewritten, signed by the student, and must specifically address the courses, grades, and terms of enrollment which are affecting the insufficient SAP standing. The appeal must be accompanied by supporting documentation from at least two individuals who can corroborate the student's circumstances. If the documentation is provided by a professional (business, medical, counselor, clergy, etc.), the documentation must include the institution's professional letterhead, the professional's credentials, and must be signed. If a letter of support is provided by a personal reference (teacher, family friend, etc.), the documentation must be signed by that reference.  App[eals may be submitted via Banweb for current students.  SAP appeals will be reviewed by a UWG committee comprised of FA staff and other faculty/staff representatives. A student who wishes to appeal the decision of the SAP Appeals Committee may submit a request for a review by the 2nd Appeal Committee. The decision of the 2nd Appeal Committee is final.  If a student's SAP appeal is granted by either the SAP Appeals Committee or the Director of Financial Aid, the student will gain eligibility for continued federal, state, or institutional Financial Aid eligibility for one semester only. The student and a representative from the Financial Aid Office will work cooperatively with the student's academic advisor and/or the Center for Academic Success to put together an academic success plan that will be monitored throughout the semester to be sure the student is making proper academic progress. In cases where it is mathematically impossible to bring the GPA or Pace of Progression ratio to required standards within one semester, the academic plan may be developed across multiple semesters, but it will be evaluated at the conclusion of each semester to be certain that the requirements at each checkpoint are being properly achieved by the student. If a student's SAP appeal is denied by either of the SAP Appeals Committees, the student will not be eligible for federal, state, or institutional financial aid until the student returns the GPA and Pace of Progression ratio to required standards. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>VIII. Notification of SAP Status At each SAP evaluation period, the student's SAP status will be recorded in BanWeb. Students who are placed on FA Probation, FA Suspension, or Maximum Time Frame will be notified via e-mail to their UWG email account as well as via a postal letter mailed to the permanent address as recorded in BanWeb. Students who are placed on FA Warning will be notified via e-mail to their UWG email account. All notifications will occur within 3 weeks of the conclusion of the semester against which SAP is evaluated. </LBody>
</LI>

Origination and processing fees are deducted from the loan amount borrowed. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan </P>

<P>Any eligible student, regardless of need, may borrow from the FederalDirect Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program. The annual loan limits are listed below and include any funds borrowed through the guaranteed program. Repayment of the loan is deferred as long as the student is enrolled at least half-time; however, interest on the loan continues to accrue while the student is enrolled in school. The interest can also be deferred, but would be compounded to the principal of the loan. </P>

<P>Veterans and Dependent Benefits </P>

<P>GI Bill benefits are available to qualified veterans and family members of deceased or VA determined 100% disabled veterans. For information contact the Muskogee, OK Regional Veterans Administration Office, P.O. Box 8888, Muskogee, OK, 74402-8888, or telephone 1-888-827-1000.

<P>Additional information may be found under Military-Connected Students on the Center for Adult Learners and Veterans website, https://www.westga.edu/calv/. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Veterans Certification </P>

<P>The VA School Certification Official (SCO), located in the Center for Adult Learners and Veterans (CALV), completes all GI Bill enrollment certifications for students participating in any of the Veterans Affairs educational assistance programs. As early as possible, preferably after being accepted by the university and at least one month before entering the university, any student planning on enrolling under one of these programs should contact the SCO in CALV to initiate enrollment certification procedures. Students requesting enrollment certification for the first time should already be in possession of a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the VA. Each VA educational assistance program has its own set of rules/guidelines and students should be prepared to sustain initial university costs since benefits will not begin until several weeks after certification. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Veterans and family members planning to study using GI Bill benefits at the University of West Georgia should apply for admission as any other student. Eligibility for Veterans benefits has no direct relationship to the institution. All financial transactions are directly between the student and Veterans Affairs. The institution serves only as a source of certification and information to Veterans Affairs. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students receiving Veterans benefits must adhere strictly to a planned program of study as indicated on the schools as well as all VA forms. Program changes must be reported promptly to the university's SCO in CALV. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students receiving VA educational benefits are also required to report to the university's SCO in CALV any changes in course load; or interruptions in attendance in order to minimize personal liability resulting from overpayment of benefits. Veterans Affairs regulations indicate that students receiving benefits are expected to attend classes regularly. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits </P>

<P>Vocational Rehabilitation (Voc Rehab) benefits are provided to promote the employment possibilities for disabled individuals. Applicants may be eligible to receive grants covering tuition, fees, books, and supplies.

<H1>Honors College </H1>

<P>Janet Donohoe, Dean http://www.westga.edu/honors/ 678-839-6636 </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Honors College includes all Honors curriculum and activities, the Office of Undergraduate Research and is the clearing house for Presidential Scholarships and the Select Student program. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Honors College Curriculum and Activities </P>

<P>The Honors Program was initiated at West Georgia College in 1975. In 1999 the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia elevated the status of the program to Honors College thereby creating the first Honors College in the State of Georgia. Unlike the other undergraduate colleges (Arts and Humanities, Education, Science and Mathematics, Social Sciences, Richards College of Business, and Tanner Health System School of Nursing), the Honors College does not award degrees. Instead, like almost all other honors colleges in the United States, the Honors College offers a distinctive curriculum featuring two types of courses - special sections of courses required in the core curriculum and junior and senior seminars. Because Honors classes are small, they typically provide more opportunities for discussion and more individual attention than is possible in the regular curriculum. Honors courses are designed to offer more opportunities for research in preparation for graduate or professional school; consequently, they are more challenging, and they do place more responsibility on the individual student. The Honors College is open to students in all undergraduate degree programs offered by the University. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Honors College Admissions Criteria </P>

<P>The Honors College invites all New freshmen and Transfer students who have been accepted to the University of West Georgia through General Admissions to apply for the Honors College based on the below listed Eligibility Requirements. </P>

<P>Honors College Learning Environment and Outcomes </P>

<P>The Honors College enables undergraduate students to realize their full potential through academic rigor and scholarship, leadership development and community engagement. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Honors College of the University of West Georgia is designed for highly motivated students who have demonstrated superior academic achievement and express a desire to continue on that path. Students accepted into the Honors College become immersed in a learning community, where they are expected to be actively engaged in an ongoing, interactive learning process with like-minded faculty and peers, both in and out of the classroom. To support and nurture such an environment, Honors classes are small, seminar-based, and taught by faculty members approved by the Honors College. Honors course work differs from general course work in both breadth and depth of exploration of subject matter, and as much as possible, inclusion of primary sources of information. Honors students are expected to exhibit and further develop genuine emotional and cognitive engagement in the learning process and reflect on the meaning of what they are learning in their own and others' lives, including a consideration of ethical ramifications when applicable. Ultimately, the goal of the program is to produce young adults who will become leaders and serve as transformation agents among their peers, in the campus community, and in the larger social world. To this end, all courses in the Honors College will incorporate one or more of the following learning outcomes: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Students will demonstrate the ability to examine topics and issues from diverse perspectives. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Students will demonstrate the ability to engage in higher order abstract, creative and critical thinking. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Students will demonstrate the ability to explore, and if feasible, experiment with possible applications of their learning toward the solution of &quot;real world&quot; problems. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Students will demonstrate the ability to explore and conduct discipline-specific independent research and creative activities using a variety of resources. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Students will demonstrate superior oral and written communication skills. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>UWG Honors College Academic Integrity Policy </P>

<P>Students in the Honors College at the University of West Georgia are expected to have exceptional academic integrity, based on honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility. Participation in the Honors College is based on academic performance, and all forms of cheating call into question the legitimacy of a student's grades. All Honors students are expected to adhere to the University's Honor Code and Policies of Academic Integrity. See Academic Honor section, or Connection and Student Handbook. Participation in the UWG Honors College is a privilege, as Honors students receive many advantages. Any violation of the University's Honor Code may result in &quot;penalties up to and including&quot; dismissal from the Honors College. All final decisions will be made by the Dean of the Honors College. </P>

<P> </P>

<H1>Extended Learning </H1>

<P>Dr. Melanie Clay, Executive Director and Dean, USG eCore http://www.westga.edu/exlearn/ 678-839-6248 </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Office of Extended Learning has responsibility for the administration of the Distance and Distributed Education (UWG Online), Continuing Education, and USG eCampus. </P>

<P>UWG Online/Distance Education </P>

<P>The University offers credit classes and degree programs to students at times and locations outside of the traditional classroom.  The University of West Georgia was one of the first institutions in the University System of Georgia to offer partially, fully, or entirely at a distance credit course, courses which utilize the Internet to deliver course materials and assignments, and to facilitate discussion and other appropriate interactions.  Distance Learning credit offerings are currently delivered partially, fully, or entirely at a distance through two-way live videoconferencing or through a combination of these technologies.  They are primarily delivered online through CourseDen (http://westga.view.usg.edu).  Online degree offerings, services and information for online students, and additional details are available at UWG Online (http://uwgonline.westga.edu). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>By providing support for fully online and partially online courses and programs, UWG Online makes higher education a possibility for those who face obstacles to taking undergraduate or graduate courses in a traditional face-to-face classroom setting. UWG seeks to extend the ability to earn credit toward a degree or certification program to those whose life circumstances, such as work, family, or distance, make attending face-to-face traditional classes impractical. Through distance learning (online learning), students can attend class whenever and wherever is convenient to them, with just the use of a computer and an internet connection. UWG was one of the first public schools in the state to offer online classes in 1997. Today, our diverse student population is spread across the country and internationally. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Our online courses are web-based and allow students to interact with the instructor and other students through discussion boards, email, and other various online tools. Course notes, assignments, projects, and grades are delivered using an online course management tool referred to as CourseDen (Brightspace powered by Desire2Learn). Some courses incorporate live sessions through two-way live videoconferencing technologies or other synchronous technologies. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Many of our online courses are fully online and do not require students to travel to our campus or other instructional sites. However, some courses may be only partially online and may require you to travel to the main campus or other sites for an orientation, exams, or meetings.  Be sure to check the 'instructional method' listed beside each course section in Banweb (the public course bulletin). Some instructors may require students to take proctored exams which can be taken at any approved testing center worldwide. Additional proctored testing site fees may apply, and tuition rates may be different. Review the special instructions noted in the online course bulletin, and review your bill carefully. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Online learning generally provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities. Nevertheless, online courses at UWG are not typically independent study or self-paced courses where students work by themselves or at their own pace. Each course has a syllabus and schedule to follow. Instructors specify the content to be covered in the course, dates for exams and quizzes, individual and group assignments, and other activities that students must complete by a particular date. Students who do not log in and participate by the initial participation deadline may be dropped for non-participation. </P>

<P>Online core courses - UWG offers options to meet all core course requirements completely online. Some of these online core courses are designed and taught exclusively by instructors at UWG while others may be part of a statewide initiative referred to as eCore (electronic core).  eCore courses may include students from other University System of Georgia schools and may be taught by non-UWG instructors. Start dates, end dates, policies, and procedures may be different for eCore than for other UWG courses. See http://ecore.westga.edu or contact 678-839-5300. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Upper-division undergraduate courses - Some upper-division courses may be offered fully at a distance or 94-99% online, requiring one face to face meeting, while some are offered partially at a distance or 51-94% online.  Others may be listed as Entirely at a Distance or 100% online.  Always be sure to check the special instructions noted on the public course bulletin site: http://banweb.westga.edu </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Online undergraduate degree program - Though many upper-level undergraduate courses are offered partially, fully, or entirely at a distance, UWG offers several hybrid programs, including a Bachelors of Business Administration in Marketing and a Bachelors of Business Administration in Real Estate.  Five undergraduate programs are available completely online - the Bachelor of Science in Criminology, the Bachelor of Science in Organizational Leadership (eMajor), the Bachelor of Science in Political Science, Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN to BSN), and the Bachelor of Science in Sociology.  In order to create the most convenient schedule possible, select undergraduate online programs are also taught on campus and allow students to enroll in both online and face-to-face courses.  See https://uwgonline.westga.edu/academic_programs.php. </P>

<P> </P>

<P> Other online offerings - UWG offers many other online degree programs and courses at the graduate and certificate levels. Online degree offerings, services and information for online students, and additional details are available at UWG Online (http://uwgonline.westga.edu). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A primary function of UWG Online/Distance and Distributed Education Center is to provide support services and training for faculty members and students participating in these courses. The Center also provides opportunities for collaboration and research for those who manage and administer Distance and Distributed Education programs throughout the nation through its online academic journal, its online non-credit certificate program, and its annual conference. For more information about Distance or Distributed Education (UWG Online), please visit the Honors House, telephone 678-839-6248, or visit http://uwgonline.westga.edu </P>

<H1>UWG Newnan Center </H1>

<P>The Board of Regents approved and established a University of West Georgia off-campus center in Newnan, GA, in August 1988. The University began offering courses in the Georgia Power Company's Shenandoah Environment &amp; Education Center in 1990.  In 1998, Coweta County purchased the Shenandoah Center from Georgia Power as a permanent location for the University's exclusive use.  In 2009, the Shenandoah Center was presented as a gift from Coweta County to the University System of Georgia Board of Regents and the University of West Georgia. The University utilized this site in the Shenandoah Industrial Park for 25 years. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In the summer of 2015, UWG Newnan relocated to 80 Jackson Street in downtown Newnan into the historic Newnan Hospital which was renovated for University use.  The $15M project was spearheaded by the City of Newnan in collaboration with Newnan Hospital, Inc., the University of West Georgia, USG Board of Regents, and Coweta County Commission.  The new building includes a 120-seat lecture hall, classrooms, computer labs, science labs, seminar rooms, study areas, and nursing skills and simulation labs. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>UWG Newnan offers the following bachelor's degrees: Nursing, Elementary Education, Social and Behavioral Health, Health and Community Wellness, and Interdisciplinary Studies.  UWG offers undergraduate courses in the University's core curriculum at UWG Newnan.  The renovated facility will provide access to over 3,000 students and allow expansion of current programs and addition of new ones, such as full or partial programs in criminology, undergraduate business, sociology and psychology.  Through the ACCEL program, high-performing high school juniors and seniors are encouraged to &quot;Go West Early&quot; and enroll in core classes at UWG Newnan while still in high school. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>UWG also offers graduate degrees in Newnan: Master of Business Administration and the Ed. S. in Educational Leadership.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Test Proctoring </P>

<P>UWG Newnan is a test proctoring site for eCore classes, UWG Online, and for online courses from other universities. For more information, visit the Test Proctoring page on the UWG Newnan website (http://www.westga.edu/newnan/test-proctoring.php). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Admission </P>

<P>The requirements for admission to UWG Newnan are the same as admission to the University. Applicants for undergraduate admission must consult the &quot;Admissions&quot; section in this catalog. Graduate students should see the Graduate Catalog for admission requirements for the Graduate School and the particular requirements of the degree program for which they are applying. The catalogs and applications are available online. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Registration </P>

<P>The course schedule for UWG Newnan is viewable on the University's schedule of classes each semester. Links to the Newnan section of the class bulletin can be found on the Center's website (www.westga.edu/newnan). Registration for UWG Newnan courses is conducted in the same way as for courses on the main campus. Students may register on Banweb during scheduled registration time. For more information, visit the Registrar's website (www.westga.edu/registrar). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Advising for eCore classes, and some general advising are offered at UWG Newnan. In addition, advisors from College of Education, RCOB, Tanner Health System School of Nursing, and Dual </P>

<H1>Public Services </H1>

<P>http://www.westga.edu/conted </P>

<P>Traditionally, public institutions of higher education state that they exist for the purpose of instruction, research, and public service. The public service mission has been paramount at West Georgia since its beginning. The faculty and staff have become well known for their efforts in extending the University into the communities of the West Georgia region. Furthermore, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia has placed special emphasis upon the role of public service and continuing education to serve as a catalyst for economic development. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Continuing Education and Public Services have emerged as an extension of the traditional on-campus learning process, available to adults wherever sufficient interest has been found. The Continuing Education/Public Services Department is responsible for coordinating and providing support relating to cooperative vocational and professional programs, institutes, workshops, conferences, and other community educational programs. Short courses and other non-credit studies, such as in-service training and customized training to local business and industry, are responsibilities of the Department of Continuing Education. Courses are conducted on campus and off campus with some in-plant workshops held at various facilities throughout the area and regularly feature West Georgia faculty as instructors. </P>

Furthermore, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia has placed special emphasis upon the role of public service and continuing education to serve as a catalyst for economic development. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Continuing Education and Public Services have emerged as a non-degree extension of the traditional learning process. The Department of Continuing Education is responsible for the assessment, development, and implementation of non-degree programs for those who wish to improve their job skills or otherwise enhance their personal development. This includes the coordination of community educational programs, institutes, workshops, conferences, and specialized training programs which serve as a catalyst for economic development. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Continuing Education Unit </P>

<P>The Continuing Education Unit (CEU) is defined as ten contact hours of participation in a qualified continuing education program. The CEU is recognized as the national standard for measuring an individual's participation in and an institution's production of non-degree programs. The CEU may be used within an institution in at least three ways. First, the CEU serves as a unit of measure to recognize an individual's participation in non-degree activities that meet appropriate criteria. Second, the CEU may serve as the accounting unit of the institution's total non-degree courses, programs, and activities. Third, the implementation of CEU criteria provides the basis for quality assurance in continuing education programming. The University of West Georgia follows the criteria and guidelines as set forth by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. </P>

<H1>Undergraduate Academic Policies </H1>

<P>  </P>

<P>Academic Calendar </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia is on a semester system, with academic credit being awarded at the end of each semester. The fall and spring semesters are approximately 16 weeks and include a final exam period.  The summer semester is approximately 10 weeks and is composed of four short sessions:  one two week, two four-week, and one seven week.  Each session includes a separate final exam period.  A student may take up to 18 total hours per semester.   For information regarding exceptions granted to complete above 18 hours in a semester, please refer to Academic Load. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Credit by Examination </P>

<P>The Advanced Placement (AP) Program is available through many high schools and enables a high school student to earn credit toward college in a variety of subjects. Usually these courses are equivalent to college freshmen/sophomore-level courses such as American Government, American History, Composition, and so forth. College credit will be awarded based on standardized exams administered at the high schools in mid to late May. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>High school students who earn AP exam scores of 3 or higher (on a scale of 1-5) on most exams and who submit official score reports to West Georgia's Admissions Office will automatically receive credit for coursework. Scores of 4 or higher are required to receive credit for history exams. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) is offered at West Georgia by appointment and allows persons to earn college credit by achieving appropriate cutoff scores on nationally standardized exams. Exams available cover a range of courses including math, history, government, literature, and sciences. Test registration information is available through the Testing Office (678-839-6435). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>As with AP testing, CLEP is a great way to earn college credit. Not only will a person save time by not having to take a course containing material he or she already knows, but the student will also save money by not having to pay for a college class. Thus, CLEP enables a student to move through his or her freshman and sophomore years at a faster pace. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Departmental Exams. A few of the academic departments at West Georgia also offer the opportunity for credit by examination. The English Department, for example, allows per-sons who feel confident about their writing skills to write an essay evaluated by a depart-mental committee. If a passing credential is earned, the person will be allowed to exempt English 1101 and/or 1102, depending on the score. The Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures also allows students to exempt certain introductory foreign language courses. To receive credit by examination, the student must pay a fee of $6/credit hour fee. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Test dates vary, so interested persons should contact the departments (English 678-839-6512; Foreign Language 678-839-6515) for details. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Advanced Placement Policy (AP) </P>

<P>Advanced Placement (AP) scores must be reported to the University of West Georgia directly from the College Board. The UWG college code is 5900. More information can be found by visiting the College Board's website at https://apscore.collegeboard.org/scores. </P>

<P>Please refer to the chart below to determine course equivalency, credit earned, and exemption information. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Scores of 4 or 5 on AP exams are granted &quot;Honors credit&quot; for the UWG course equivalents. These courses count toward the 10 honors classes required for Honors College graduation. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Questions concerning the policy should be directed to the Registrar's Office Transfer Team by emailing transfer@westga.edu or calling (678) 839-6438. </P>

<P>Academic Honor Code </P>

<P>At West Georgia, the student is expected to achieve and maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and excellence. Not only does academic honesty preserve the integrity of both the student and the institution, but it is also essential in gaining a true education. The West Georgia student, therefore, pledges not to lie, cheat, steal, or engage in plagiarism in the pursuit of his or her studies and is encouraged to report those who do. See Connection and Student Handbook, Appendix E, Academic Dishonesty. The Pledge follows: </P>

<P>Pledge: </P>

<P>Having read the Honor Code for UWG, I understand and accept my responsibility to uphold the values and beliefs described and to conduct myself in a manner that will reflect the values of the Institution in such a way as to respect the rights of all UWG community members. As a West Georgia student, I will represent myself truthfully and complete all academic assignments honestly. I understand that if I violate this code, I will accept the penalties imposed, should I be found guilty of violations through processes due me as a university community member. These penalties may include expulsion from the University. I also recognize that my responsibility includes willingness to confront members of the University community if I feel there has been a violation of the Honor Code. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Load (Course Load Limits) </P>

<P>Although a typical course load is 15 semester credit hours, a student may register for 18 semester credit hours without special permission (see summer exceptions below). A student on the Dean's List may register for 20 hours without special permission. Students within 30 credit hours of graduation with a cumulative average of 2.0 may carry up to the maximum of 21 credit hours for two semesters without special permission. A student who is required to enroll in Regents' Test remediation may not carry more than 18 credit hours. During the semester of student teaching, students may take one additional course. Students are advised not to take more than 10 credit hours if they work full time. Special permission must be obtained from the appropriate academic dean before any student may exceed loads authorized above. Academic deans may approve course loads of up to 25 semester credit hours in justifiable circumstances. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Due to varying session lengths for summer semester, the following schedule presents the maximum hours that can be taken by a student without special permission given by his or her dean. The maximum total load permitted for any combination of sessions without the permission of the appropriate dean is 18. If the student attends Session I for 6 hours, they can only enroll in an additional 12 hours total for the remaining sessions. </P>

<P>Academic Renewal </P>

<P>The Academic Renewal policy allows the University of West Georgia degree-seeking students who earned less than a 2.00 cumulative grade point average at the University of West Georgia to have one opportunity to make a fresh start at UWG after an absence of five calendar years from any postsecondary institution. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. Students must apply for Academic Renewal. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. All previously attempted coursework continues to be recorded on the student's official transcript. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>3. An Academic Renewal Grade Point Average is begun when the student resumes taking coursework following the five-year period of absence once Academic Renewal has been granted. The institution will place a statement on the student's transcript indicating the Academic Renewal status and the beginning of a separate Academic Renewal GPA in addition to an overall UWG GPA. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>4. The Academic Renewal GPA will be used for determining academic standing and eligibility for graduation. At least 50% (60 hours) of course work must be completed after the granting of academic renewal for a student to be eligible for graduation with honors. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>5. Academic credit for previously completed coursework - including transfer coursework - will be retained only for courses in which an 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'S' grade was earned. Retained grades are not calculated in the Academic Renewal GPA, but are counted in Academic Renewal hours earned. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>6. Transfer credit  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>A. Suspended/dismissed students: a student who has been suspended or dismissed from UWG and has attended one or more System institutions during the period of suspension or dismissal will not be eligible for Academic Renewal. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>B. Non-suspended/dismissed students: a student who has not been suspended or dis-missed from UWG, but who has been absent from UWG five years or more and who has attended a school other than UWG may choose only one of the following options:  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> A student may return to UWG subject to all relevant transfer and reentry policies. No renewal GPA is calculated and transfer credit will be granted for applicable courses taken during the absence, or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> A student may apply for Academic Renewal. If Academic Renewal status is approved, no transfer credit will be granted for course work completed during the absence. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>7. To earn a degree, a student must meet the University of West Georgia's residency requirements. UWG will apply the retained hours earned prior to Academic Renewal toward the residency requirement. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>8. All remaining courses for the current degree objective must be completed at UWG. No transient credit will be accepted. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>9. A student can be granted Academic Renewal status only once. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>10. Any previous notation of academic probation, suspension, and dismissal will remain recorded on the student's transcript. </LBody>

<P>Academic Standards of Progress </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia seeks to provide an environment suitable for promoting the systematic pursuit of learning. To ensure this primary goal, the University requires of its students, reasonable academic progress. The retention of those students who repeatedly demonstrate a lack of ability, industry, maturity, and preparation would be inconsistent with this requirement. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students will be evaluated each semester on the basis of cumulative grade point average and the total number of hours attempted. Hours transferred will be included in determining the total hours attempted; however, the cumulative grade point average will be computed only on the work completed at West Georgia (institutional grade point average (GPA)). The academic standing for a semester is not adjusted when a course taken that semester is subsequently repeated during a later semester and the first grade earned is re-moved from the calculation of the grade point average. The cumulative grade point aver-age required for the total number of hours attempted is given below: </P>

</Table>

<P>Under the provisions of the academic policies of West Georgia, students are classified as follows: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Warning </P>

<P>All students who fail to meet academic standards will be on Academic Warning the next semester of enrollment. Students on Academic Warning may be required to meet certain conditions to be eligible to register for future terms. Such conditions may include a reduced course load, meeting with an academic advisor, attending student success seminars, and/or other academic support interventions. There are three possible outcomes from a semester on Academic Warning: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>(1) A student who raises his/her institutional grade point average to meet the Academic Standards outlined above, will be removed from Academic Warning. (2) A student who receives a term GPA of 2.0 but does not raise the institutional GPA enough to meet above standards, will remain on Academic Warning. (3) A student who fails to achieve a semester grade point average of 2.0 while on Academic Warning will be placed on Academic Probation. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Probation </P>

<P>All students, who fail to meet the conditions to be removed from or stay on Academic Warning will be placed on Academic Probation the next semester of enrollment. Students on Academic Probation may be required to meet certain conditions to be eligible to register for future terms. Such conditions may include a reduced course load, meeting with an academic advisor, attending student success seminars, and/or other academic support interventions. There are three possible outcomes from a semester on Academic Probation: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>(1) A student who raises his/her institutional grade point average to meet the Academic Standards outlined above, will be removed from Academic Probation. (2) A student who receives a term GPA of 2.0 but does not raise the institutional GPA enough to meet above standards, will remain on Academic Probation. (3) A student who fails to achieve a semester grade point average of 2.0 while on Academic Probation will be placed on Academic Suspension. Once on Probation, a student will not return to Academic Warning, but will remain on Academic Probation unless he/she meets outcome 1 or 3. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Suspension </P>

<P>Students who do not earn a minimum semester grade point average of 2.0 while on Academic Probation regardless of the cumulative GPA will be suspended for one semester. Readmission on probation will be automatically allowed after one semester of suspension. Students on probation who do not make satisfactory progress after returning from an initial suspension will again be suspended, this time for one calendar year. A student who is suspended for the second time may apply for readmission on probation one calendar year from the date of suspension. An Academic </P>

<P>Suspension Appeal (term or one year) may only be reviewed through a grade appeal or hardship withdrawal. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Dismissal </P>

<P>Students on probation after a second suspension, who do not make a 2.0 on all work at-tempted in each subsequent semester of enrollment regardless of the cumulative GPA will be dismissed. Dismissed students are eligible to return only when they have earned an associate degree or are granted Academic Renewal after a five-year absence from any post-secondary institution. An Academic Dismissal Appeal may only be reviewed through a grade appeal or hardship withdrawal </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Advising and Course Selection (Course Level Rule) </P>

<P>Academic advising is considered an important element in a student's program of study, and West Georgia makes every effort to provide the service; however, students must ultimately be responsible for their own choices, their own course and program selections, and their own deadlines. Each student is responsible for completion of all requirements of his or her program. Advisors provide guidance. Any exception to a published program of study is not valid unless specifically authorized in writing by the dean of the college or department chair in which the major is housed.  Advisee records are compiled from admissions documents, grades and quality points, and test results. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who have declared a major within the Richards College of Business or the College of Education are assigned to a professional advisor in that college's advising center.  Students who have declared a major in the College of Social Sciences are assigned to a professional advisor in the Advising Center. Students who intend to apply to the Nursing Program are advised either in the Tanner Health School of Nursing or in the Advising Center. Students up to 60 credit hours in the College of Science and Math and the College of Arts and Humanities are assigned to a professional advisor in the Advising Center.  Students in those colleges with 60 or more credit hours are advised by a faculty member in their department.  Dual enrolled students are advising by a professional advisor in the Office of New Student Programs. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Every undergraduate student must officially declare a major at or before the completion of 60 semester hours (this includes transfer credits). A hold will be placed on registration until a major is declared.  It is important that students see their advisors prior to registration each semester. Each student is responsible for contacting his or her individual department to determine specific advisement procedures for that department. Freshmen and sophomores are required to consult with their advisors in order to register. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students are advised to select courses appropriate for their classification, i.e., stepping up or down no more than one level of course numbers. For example, a freshman may step up to a 2000-level course or a junior may step down to a 2000-level course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Air Force ROTC </P>

<P>University of West Georgia students may participate in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps through the ARCHE cross-registration program. It involves an elective curriculum taken alongside required college classes. Students participating in the pro-gram attend Air Force ROTC classes and training taught weekly at the Georgia Institute of Technology on Tuesdays and Thursdays in addition to courses taken to complete a degree at UWG. Students must balance their course schedule to allow for travel time to and from Georgia Tech. Students earn a college degree and an officer's commission in the U.S. Air Force at the same time. A student who completes the Air Force ROTC Program qualifies as a commissioned officer and will be allowed to enter active duty in the U.S. Air Force. Air Force ROTC offers competitive 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, and 2-year college scholar-ships to qualified college students based on merit. Non-competitive scholarships are also available based on major to include foreign languages. Scholarships vary from $3,000, $9,000, $15,000, all the way up to full tuition and required fees. Scholarship winners also receive a stipend of up to $400 for each academic month in addition to a $900 allowance for books and other </P>

<P>educational items. Non-scholarship students also receive the stipend and book allowance as contracted cadets in the program. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Audit of Courses </P>

<P>Regulations are listed in the Admissions, &quot;Auditors&quot; section, and in this section, under &quot;Grades, Grade Points.&quot; </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Class Absence </P>

<P>Instruction begins the first day of class. In face-to-face courses, if students fail to attend the first day and have not contacted the instructor to explain their absence, they may be dropped during the Drop/Add Period to make room for other students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In fully online or hybrid courses each instructor has the authority to specify in the syllabus what qualifies as attendance at the first class meeting and during the Drop/Add Period to drop students who fail to meet that requirement. Instructors may require students to attend a face-to-face meeting, to log in to the online course-delivery system by a specified date, or to take other specified steps at the beginning of the session. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>For those courses that meet for the first time after the end of the Drop/Add Period, see Faculty Handbook Section 204. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Class attendance policies are determined by each instructor for his or her courses and may be found in the syllabus. Since course policies differ, students are responsible for understanding attendance requirements for each course. Failure to comply with those requirements may significantly affect grades. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students are expected to attend each class meeting. Students absent from class while officially representing the University or observing religious holidays should generally not be penalized in the calculation of final grades, as long as they provide advance notice and expeditiously make arrangements to complete any missed work. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>University-sponsored activities include but are not limited to the following: intercollegiate athletic competitions; musical/theatrical/art performances or exhibitions associated with a degree program; debate competitions; and research conferences. Activities not considered to be university-sponsored include participation in clubs, even if they are affiliated with UWG, or events associated with social organizations such as fraternities or sororities. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Regardless of the reason for the absence, each student is responsible for the material covered in class, for completing any assignments, and for making specific arrangements with the instructor for any work missed. The degree to which missed work can be made up will depend upon the nature of the work and its intended purpose. Make-up is at the discretion of the instructor.  However instructors should be aware that students missing classes for university-sponsored activities or religious holidays should be given all appropriate courtesies and opportunities to make up missed work.  Students are responsible for alerting their professors about any expected absences prior to those absences </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Any student who must be absent for more than one week of class should notify the Patient Advocates in Health Services, telephone 678-839-6452. The student should also notify the instructor or department. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>College Preparatory Curriculum Deficiencies </P>

<P>Students who are admitted with College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies in the areas of social science, science, or foreign language are required to complete with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better one additional course in each area of deficiency (Social Science deficiency is satisfied with ANTH 1102 only). Credit will be given for courses used to satisfy </P>

<P>College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies, but such credit may not be used to satisfy Core Curriculum or degree requirements. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students with College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies in English must take and clear the English and reading portions of the placement test. Those with College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies in mathematics must take and clear the mathematics portion of the placement test. Students with English and mathematics deficiencies who are required to enter learning support are not admissible. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Deficiencies in science, social science, or foreign language should be satisfied during the student's first semester of enrollment. CPC/RHSC deficiencies must be completed before the student has earned 30 hours of credit. Students who earn 30 hours of credit and have not satisfied these deficiencies will not be permitted to enroll in any other university-level courses unless the deficiencies are included in their schedules. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Confidentiality of Student Records </P>

<P>Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, West Georgia has established policies concerning the confidentiality of student educational records. In accordance with the Act, students of West Georgia are notified that, among other rights, they have the right to seek correction of the contents of these records, to place an explanatory note in a record when a challenge is not successful, and to control (with certain exceptions) the disclosure of the contents of their records. For a full statement of the institutional policy regarding confidentiality of student records see Connection and Student Handbook. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>University officials may provide Directory Information concerning a student unless the student files a Non-Disclosure Form with the Enrollment Services Center. This form must be filed annually by September 15 to assure that locater information not be published in the student directory. Directory Information includes name, address, telephone listing, major field of study, dates of attendance, previous institutions attended, degrees and awards received, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, height and weight of members of athletic teams, photograph, and full or part-time status. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Course Changes (Drop-Add, Grade for Course Withdrawals) </P>

<P>Routine changes in the student's schedule must be made during the scheduled adjustment/drop/add periods for the semester or term. The precise deadlines can be found in the university academic calendar. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Except for Learning Support courses and Regents' Test remediation, a student may withdraw up to the midpoint of the semester without academic penalty. A grade of W is entered for such withdrawals. Except for cases approved by the dean of the college offering the withdrawn course, the only grade which is given after the mid-semester deadline is WF. </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Dean's List </P>

<P>Students who achieve a grade point ratio of 3.5 on a minimum of 12 semester hours of college level courses in which grades of A-F are given are placed on the Dean's List for that semester. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>English and Mathematics Requirements </P>

<P>Students must complete ENGL 1102 and MATH 1101, MATH 1111, MATH 1113, or MATH 1634 by the time they have accumulated 30 semester credit hours or must register for these courses and continue registering for them each semester of enrollment until they have been completed. Students should plan to complete ENGL 1101, if needed, by the time they accumulate 30 semester credit hours. All students must earn a grade of C or better in ENGL 1101 in order to enroll in ENGL 1102. They must also earn a grade of C or better in ENGL 1102. Unless this grade requirement is met, such courses will not be credited toward graduation. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Co-Requisite Workshops for English and Math </P>

<P>At UWG, ENGL 1101 and MATH 1111 are delivered with a required co-requisite lab (ENGL 1101L and MATH 1111L). These one-credit hour labs that meet two hours per week are taught by the same instructor teaching the ENGL 1101 or Math 1111 section. These labs provide structured supplemental instruction and support to help students in these core courses that are foundational to academic success. All UWG students are required to take the co-requisite lab during the semester that they are enrolled in ENGL 1101 and MATH 1111 unless they meet the exception criteria outlined below. However, even students who are exempt may elect to take the co-requisite labs if they choose. </P>

However, if a student takes MATH 1001 or MATH 1101 and subsequently enrolls in MATH 1111, they must also enroll in MATH 1111L unless they meet the exemption criteria above. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Examinations </P>

<P>Final examinations are held at the end of each term in accordance with a published schedule. No final examinations may be given in advance of the date scheduled unless authorized by the dean of the appropriate college. If a student has more than two final exams scheduled in a single day, he or she may reschedule all but two of them through the cooperation of faculty members, department chairs, college deans, and, if necessary, the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. During the term of his or her graduation, an undergraduate student may be excused from final examinations at the discretion of the instructor of each course in which the student is doing passing work. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Foreign Language </P>

<P>Students who have completed more than two years of a foreign language in high school should begin their college language study at the 1002 level or higher. Since high school programs vary in content and quality, those in doubt about the appropriate language pro-gram class should consult with the Department of Foreign Languages faculty before registration. </P>

<P>Please note: Students may retake a foreign language course for credit at the 1000 or 2000 level only if they have not completed a course with a higher number for credit. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Grade Appeal </P>

<P>Students have the right to appeal a course grade. Grade appeals must be submitted in writing, using the UWG Student Grade Appeal Form found on the Registrar's website at https://www.westga.edu/student-services/registrar/forms.php and following the procedures outlined below. All grade appeals, regardless of their nature, shall be initiated no later than the following semester after cause for the appeal occurred and concluded no later than one year (12 calendar months) after the assignment of the grade. There are two types of grade appeals: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. Dishonesty Grade Appeal - If the faculty member assigned the grade due to an allegation of cheating, plagiarism, or some other act of academic dishonesty and the student wishes to pursue the appeal, his or her case should be considered a Dishonesty Grade Appeal. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>Appeals of grades assigned due to an allegation of Academic Dishonesty may be made as soon as a grade penalty on the grounds of academic dishonesty has been levied against a student. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. Grade Determination Appeal - If the reasons underlying the appeal are based on policy disagreements or alleged charges of arbitrary or unfair treatment by the involved faculty member, the appeal should be considered a Grade Determination Appeal. Grade determination appeals must be initiated during the semester immediately following the semester in which the course grade is assigned. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Grade Appeal Review and Decision Process </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. Student Initiates the Grade Appeal: The student must complete and sign the Student Grade Appeal Form, attach a short memo or letter stating the exact nature of the appeal and reason, attach any supporting documentation, and submit the entire packet to the Department Chair of the department in which the course is taught. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. Department Level: The Chair consults with the student and with the faculty member and determines whether the appeal is a Dishonesty Grade Appeal or Grade Determination Appeal.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>a) The Chair examines the available evidence and renders a decision: Either grant the appeal and change the grade, or deny the appeal. The Chair notifies the student of his/her decision. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>b) If the appeal is granted, the Chair submits the grade change in writing to the Registrar and notifies the student that the appeal is granted. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>c) If the appeal is denied, the student may accept the Chair's decision and end the appeal process, or s/he may request that the appeal and all associated documentation be forwarded to the Dean's office (dean or designee) for further review. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>3. College Dean Level: The Chair forwards the appeal to the Dean/designee. The appeal packet should include the Student Grade Appeal Form (complete information, decision indicated, and signatures/initials from both the student and the Chair) and all associated documentation provided by the student and the faculty member, along with a brief statement from the Chair regarding her/his decision.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>a) The Dean/designee reviews the appeal and all associated documentation and available evidence and renders a decision: Either grant the appeal and change the grade, or deny the appeal. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>b) The Dean's Office notifies the student of his/her decision. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>c) If the appeal is granted, the Dean's Office submits the grade change in writing to the Registrar. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>d) If the appeal is denied, the student may accept the decision and end the appeal process, or s/he may request that the appeal and all associated documentation be forwarded to the Provost's office for submission to the Grade Appeals Subcommittee. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>4. Grade Appeals Subcommittee Level: An appeal forwarded to the Provost's office for referral to the Grade Appeals Subcommittee should include the Student Grade Appeal Form (complete information, decisions indicated, and signatures/initials from the student, Chair, and Dean/designee), documentation, and decision statements from the previous levels.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>a) The subcommittee's review purpose is described here: Dishonesty Grade Appeals: The purpose of the subcommittee in hearing this type of appeal is to (1) determine if academic improprieties did take place and (2) to re-view the appropriateness of the faculty member's corrective action as it related to the final grade assignment. Grade Determination Appeals: The purpose of the subcommittee in hearing this type of appeal is to review the totality of the student's performance in relationship to his or her final grade. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>b) The chairperson of the subcommittee will submit in writing to the Provost/designee the conclusions and recommendations of the subcommittee. If the appeal is granted, the Provost's office submits the grade change in writing to </LBody>

A student must remove an &quot;I&quot; grade during the succeeding semester of enrollment or within one year, which-ever comes first; otherwise, the grade will be changed to &quot;F&quot;. An instructor who assigns a grade of &quot;I&quot; must submit with final grade (through his or her dean) two copies of a statement indicating the level of performance (A,B,C,D) excluding the missed work and the work that must be done to remove the &quot;I&quot; grade. The Registrar's Office files one copy in the student's permanent record and sends one to the appropriate department chair. The instructor retains a copy.

<P>The institution grade point average is calculated by dividing the number of hours scheduled in courses attempted in which a grade of A,B,C,D,F, or WF was received into the number of grade points earned on those hours scheduled with adjustments for repeated courses according to the policies in place when the course was initially attempted. A grade of WF counts as an F. GPA's are truncated, not rounded up. The institution grade point average is recorded on the student's permanent record. Remedial credit shall in no way affect the institution grade point average. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Graduation with Honors </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia awards baccalaureate degrees with honors to those undergraduates which have a minimum GPA of 3.50 on all courses attempted. For students who repeat courses for grade replacement, both courses will be calculated into the honors GPA. Those candidates who have transferred from other institutions will qualify for honors if they attain an honors grade-point average on all work attempted at UWG and combined total of all courses attempted at UWG and other institutions. Baccalaureate degrees are awarded with honors based on the following grade point average range for all courses attempted: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>3.50 - 3.79 GPA - honors (cum laude) </P>

<P>3.80 - 3.89 GPA - high honors (magna cum laude) </P>

<P>3.90 - 4.00 GPA - highest honors (summa cum laude) </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Because grades are not official until after the commencement ceremony, the initial honors designation is based on the student's honors GPA at the end of the semester prior to the graduating semester. Students who have not met the GPA requirements to be designated as an honors recipient at the time of commencement will not be allowed to walk as an honors recipient or to purchase honors cords from the University Bookstore. Official honors designation will be determined after the commencement ceremony when term grades are official and the honors GPA is recalculated. GPAs are truncated to the second decimal place and will not be rounded (example, a 3.49 will not be rounded to a 3.50). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who graduate with honors will have their honors status (cum laude, etc.) notated on their official academic transcript and their diploma. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Hardship Withdrawal Policy </P>

<P>A Hardship Withdrawal is an exception that permits a student to withdraw from all courses after the official Drop/Add period during the semester. It is intended for the student who has experienced an acute, traumatic event that prevents him/her from completing the semester. That same event also makes it impossible for the student to take an In-complete and finish the work the next semester. Thus, the Hardship Withdrawal is based on unusual or emergency circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances are categorized as follows: Physical </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Examples include bodily injury or invasive surgery resulting in prolonged absences from class, or unexpected physical disability preventing completion of course work. Necessary documentation to support such claims would include a physician's report, including name, address, phone, nature of illness or accidents, dates of treatment, prognosis, and recommendation. Psychological </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Examples include extreme mental duress suffered from traumatic experiences, of the severity and frequency to prevent completion of course work. Necessary documentation to support such claims would include a memo from a Counseling Center counselor that includes dates of treatment and a clear recommendation of whether a hardship withdrawal be given. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Personal </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Examples include significant change in financial status or personal tragedy such as the death of a loved one or domestic disruptions, to the degree to prevent completion of coursework. Necessary documentation to support such claims might include copy of divorce papers, financial statements, police reports, obituaries, or other pertinent documents. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>The following list is illustrative of invalid reasons for a hardship withdrawal. A request using these reasons will not be approved. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Poor performance in one or more courses </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Registration for the wrong course </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Preference for a different professor or class section </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Failure to drop course during the drop/add period </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Failure to withdraw by the published deadline using normal procedures </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Under what conditions may a &quot;Request for Hardship Withdrawal&quot; be approved? </P>

<P>A Hardship Withdrawal is intended as relief for extreme circumstances and is granted only in special instances. The following conditions apply: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. Students may request a hardship withdrawal after the official Drop/Add deadline published in the semester term calendar until the Friday immediately prior to the final week of the term. Hardship Withdrawals requested after the Friday immediately prior to the final week of the term will be treated as a Retroactive Hardship Withdrawal.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Retroactive Hardship Withdrawals will not be approved if the student has completed all course requirements such as a final examination and/or a final project. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. The student must withdraw from all classes during the current term, and may not select only certain classes from which to withdraw.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Under unusual circumstances, a student may be granted a hardship withdrawal from only one class, while being allowed to remain in others. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> An example of unusual circumstances would be a student who is passing an applied piano course and injures a finger, thus being unable to play the piano the rest of the semester. A student would be allowed to complete other courses being taken concurrently. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>3. The student should follow Steps 1-6 below, with emphasis on providing documented evidence in support of the claims warranting the request. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Steps for Requesting a Hardship Withdrawal </P>

<P>In steps 1-6 below, the Dean may designate an Associate Dean to act on his/her authority. The Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs may designate the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs to act on his/her authority. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. The student completes the &quot;Request for Hardship Withdrawal&quot; form found online at https://www.westga.edu/administration/vpaa/faculty-resources.php.  The student should be prepared to provide documented evidence to substantiate the hardship being claimed. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. The student submits the completed Request for Hardship Withdrawal form and documented evidence to Health Services (HS) or the Counseling Center. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>3. The HS or Counseling Center professional staff will interview the student, review the documented evidence, and recommend to support or not support the request for Hard-ship Withdrawal. HS or Counseling Center professional staff will send the request form and a letter, which explains the recommendation, as a confidential document to the appropriate unit within Academic Affairs. HS or Counseling Center professional staff will retain the documented evidence in their confidential files.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> For students with a declared major, the form and letter will be sent to the Dean of the College where the major department is housed. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> For undeclared students, the form and letter will be delivered to the Dean of the Honors College. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>4. The Dean has the final authority to approve the Request for Hardship Withdrawal.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> If the Dean approves the request, the student will receive a W for each course. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The Dean's Office will notify the Registrar of the grade change/s to W. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The Dean's Office will notify the student that the request was approved. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>5. If the Dean does not approve the request, the Dean's Office will notify the student of the denial.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The student may appeal to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The Dean will forward the form and letter to the Provost upon receiving notification from the student that s/he intends to appeal. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Dean that s/he intends to appeal to the Provost. </LBody>

<LBody> The Provost will grant or deny the appeal and notify the student of the decision. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> If granted, the Provost's Office will notify the Registrar of the grade change/s to W. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Students should be aware of the following four points when a hardship withdrawal is approved: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> A hardship withdrawal does not remove courses from the academic record. Course grades are converted to W's for the hardship withdrawal semester. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The W grades do not count against the overall grade point average. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The W grades trigger a Financial Aid Warning, because none of the courses in the hardship withdrawal semester are completed. See the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy for financial aid eligibility at https://www.westga.edu/student-services/financialaid/satisfactory-academic-progress.php for more information. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Students who are granted a hardship withdrawal do not receive refunds of expenditures associated with the hardship withdrawal term. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Independent Studies </P>

<P>Some departments may offer independent studies, directed readings, and individual re-search projects. These are not substitutes for scheduled courses (though department chairs may authorize such substitutions in exceptional circumstances). When offered, independent studies are intended to provide students who are well advanced in their majors with the opportunity to explore research projects on their own with limited faculty supervision. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Limited Course Withdrawals </P>

<P>Undergraduate students may withdraw from courses with a grade of &quot;W&quot; (Withdraw Passing) a maximum of six times during their entire undergraduate enrollment at the University of West Georgia. Students must withdraw from courses during the Withdrawal &quot;W&quot; Period, as noted on the Registrar's Calendar in The Scoop. Retroactive withdrawals for prior terms are not permitted. The Withdrawal &quot;W&quot; Period typically begins after Drop/Add and closes at mid-term. Grades of &quot;W&quot; do not count toward the grade point average. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>It is recommended that students consult with the instructor, academic advisor, Financial Aid, Bursar, and International Student Admissions and Programs (if applicable) before making the decision to withdraw from a course, since undesirable consequences may follow. For example: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Student athletes must maintain full-time status to retain athletic eligibility </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> International students on an F1 or J1 visa must maintain full-time status to protect their immigration status </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Withdrawing from a course will delay progress toward graduation </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students who attempt to withdraw from a course after reaching their maximum of six withdrawals will continue to be enrolled and will receive a grade at the end of the term, unless the Dean (or Dean's designee) approves the exception. See Petition for Exceptions below. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Automatic Exceptions </P>

<P>The following exceptions do not count toward the maximum of six course withdrawals: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Grades of W placed on the transcript prior to Fall 2013 </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Grades of W included in transfer work </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Withdrawals from courses taken during Summer terms </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Hardship withdrawal </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Military withdrawal </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Administrative withdrawal </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Formal withdrawal from the university </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Petition for Exceptions </P>

<P>After the limit of six withdrawals is reached, students are permitted to request exceptions only for circumstances beyond their control. Students appeal in writing to the Dean (or Dean's designee) of the college or school that houses their major. Undeclared students should appeal in writing to the Dean of the Honors College (or Dean's designee). The written request (typewritten) should include the following: (1) description of the exact nature of the appeal, (2) reason for the appeal, and (3) supporting documentation, if applicable. Appeals are not heard unless the student has reached the maximum number of withdrawals allowed. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Orientation </P>

<P>To assist new students in becoming adjusted to college life as quickly as possible, West Georgia conducts an orientation program which consists of testing, preregistration advisement, special lectures, and social gatherings. All new students are required to participate. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Physical Education Policy </P>

<P>University policy allows each of the three colleges to set its own physical education requirements. For this catalog year, the requirements are as follows: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> The College of Arts and Humanities has no physical education requirement. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The College of Education requires 3 hours of physical education that must include one 2-hour Health and Wellness course and one 1-hour activity course. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The College of Science and Mathematics has no physical education requirement. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The College of Social Sciences has no physical education requirement. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The College of Business has no physical education requirement. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The Tanner Health System School of Nursing has no physical education requirement. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>All students are required to satisfy the physical education requirements of the college from which they graduate (not the college in which the student was first admitted as a degree candidate). The physical education activity requirement will be waived for veterans with two years active military duty. No PWLA course credit may be applied toward the number of academic hours required for a degree. </P>

<P>For detailed requirements and exceptions, see the specific degree program description section of the catalog. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Registration </P>

<P>Registration for a future semester is held for continuing students and new fully admitted graduate students during the preceding semester. Course listings are available on Ban-web, http://banweb.westga.edu/under Public Access, Class Bulletin. The Scoop gives detailed instructions for registering and paying fees. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Late Registration is held during the drop/add period of the semester. A $75 late fee is charged to continuing students who did not participate in on-time registration. </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Repeating a Course to Replace a Grade </P>

<P>A student may repeat a course taken at West Georgia in order to replace an earlier grade earned in a course taken Fall 1996 or later. Grades earned in courses taken at other institutions cannot replace grades earned in courses taken at the University of West Georgia. In the case of courses with variable course titles, the repeated course must have the exact same title as the original course. Beginning Summer Semester 2001, students can repeat XIDS 2001, 2002, and 2100 and use the grade replacement rules regardless of the titles of the courses taken. The academic standing and graduation GPA will be based on the last attempt at all courses taken at the institution. Note that the original grade remains on the transcript, although it is not included in the GPA. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Student Classification </P>

<P>Student classification is based on the number of earned semester hours of academic credit. The classifications are as follows: </P>

<P>Study Abroad </P>

<P>The University offers a range of study-abroad options for students at all levels of their academic careers. Freshman and sophomore students may participate in short-term programs that offer core-level courses; juniors and seniors may participate in programs lasting from two weeks to a year that offer specialized coursework in their majors. Students may select programs taught in English or may participate in language immersion programs in Spanish, French and German. The Office of Education Abroad provides advising to help each student choose the program and coursework that best fits his or her academic needs and interests. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Short-term program offerings vary from year to year, and students should visit the study abroad website (http://studyabroad.westga.edu) or the Office of Education Abroad on the first floor of Gunn Hall for a complete list of opportunities. Many short term programs are designed for students who have not traveled extensively and provide a mix of classroom instruction and site-specific field trips, with airfare, housing and some meals usually included in the program fee. For upperclassmen interested in specialized semester-long programs, the university offers exchange programs in several European countries, in South America and in Australia. Exchange students generally pay on-campus tuition and fees while studying at the exchange partner institution. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who participate in study abroad programs or semester exchanges may apply their current financial aid, including Hope scholarship funds, to their study abroad program fees. In addition, students may apply for study abroad scholarships through the study abroad website. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Technology Access Policy </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia requires all students to have ready access to a computer as students will be expected to use a computer for coursework. Purchasing a new or used computer is not required, but is recommended. The University provides some computer labs on campus; however, access to these labs at times may be limited. Students are responsible for making plans necessary for timely completion of their class assignments. All students must have access to e-mail, word processing, spreadsheet, and web browsing software. For more details on what is recommended see the TechLife Website. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Transfer of Credit </P>

<P>See section titled Transfer Students, for regulations regarding transfer of credit. </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Transient Student Status </P>

<P>Students wishing to complete classes at another college or university to count towards their degree at the University of West Georgia (UWG) must maintain good academic standing at UWG and hold active student status at UWG for the transient term. Prior to taking the course(s), students must complete a Transient Status Permission Form, which includes the signatures of their advisor, the chair of the department in which the credit shall be granted, and the dean/designee of their major college. If the transient status involves study abroad, students must also obtain the signature of the Director of Education Abroad. International students must also obtain the signature of the Director of International Services and Programs. It is each student's responsibility to consult the Undergraduate Transfer Student Policy, Transfer Course Equivalency Tool on the Registrar's website, or contact the Registrar's Office to determine if the course will be accepted as transfer credit at UWG. Grades earned in courses taken as a transient student do not replace previous grades earned in courses taken at UWG, and duplicate credit will not be awarded. Transient status is given for one semester at a time, and students must have the host institution send an official transcript of the completed coursework to the Registrar's Office at UWG in order to receive credit for the coursework. For final term transient status restrictions, see Graduation Policies in the Undergraduate Catalog. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Two-Year College Graduates/Former Students </P>

<P>For a one time option only, students who have been academically suspended or dismissed from West Georgia may, as two-year graduates of accredited colleges or universities, be readmitted as degree candidates. A minimum of 60 academic hours after the associate degree with at least a 2.0 grade point average is required for the bachelor's degree. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students accepted as transients from a two-year college to complete one or more courses needed for graduation at a two-year college will not be permitted to complete other work while enrolled as transients, or to include the transient credit in the 60 hours of work required at West Georgia. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The following notation shall be placed on the official transcript of two-year, college graduates readmitted to West Georgia: </P>

<P>&quot;Readmitted as two-year college graduate; must complete a minimum of 60 additional hours with at least a 2.0 average for a bachelor's degree.&quot; </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The University Year and Definition of a Credit Hour </P>

<P>The University is organized on the semester system. There are two semesters of approximately 15 weeks, a three-week term in May, and summer semesters of approximately four and eight weeks. </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia grants one semester hour of credit for work equivalent to a minimum of one hour (50 minutes) of in-class or other direct faculty instruction AND two hours of student work outside of class per week for approximately fifteen weeks. For each course, the course syllabus will document the amount of in-class (or other direct faculty instruction) and out-of-class work required to earn the credit hour(s) assigned to the course. Out-of-class work will include all forms of credit-bearing activity, including but not limited to assignments, readings, observations, and musical practice. Where available, the university grants academic credit for students who verify via competency-based testing, that they have accomplished the learning outcomes associated with a course that would normally meet the requirements outlined above (e.g. AP credit, CLEP, and departmental exams). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>U.S. and Georgia History and Constitution Requirements </P>

<P>USG institutions shall give instruction in the history of the United States, in the history of Georgia, and in the essentials of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Georgia.  No undergraduate student shall receive a certificate of graduation or a degree without successfully completing course-work or passing a satisfactory examination on the history of the United States, the history of Georgia, and the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Georgia. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students may meet these requirements by passing HIST 2111 or HIST 2112 and POLS 1101 at West Georgia. The U.S. and Georgia history requirements may also be satisfied by passing examinations developed by the History Department and administered by the Testing Office. The Georgia Constitution requirement may also be satisfied by passing an examination developed by the Political Science Department and administered by the Testing Office. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Transfer students who have fulfilled any or all of these requirements will be notified of that fact at the time of admission on the &quot;Evaluation of Transfer Credit&quot; form. Students transferring from institutions outside the state of Georgia who receive credit for HIST 2111 or HIST 2112 and/or POLS 1101 will not have satisfied the Georgia history and constitution requirements. The Georgia history and constitution requirements can be satisfied by passing examinations administered each semester by the Testing Office. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Withdrawal </P>

<P>Formal withdrawal from the University must begin with a written request to the Registrar's Office. At the time the request is presented, specific instructions are given to the student for the completion of formal withdrawal. Failure to officially withdraw may result in grades of F for the semester. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A student may be administratively withdrawn from the University when the Vice President for Student Affairs &amp; Enrollment Management in consultation, when appropriate, with the student's parents or spouse, the Director of the Counseling Center and the University Physician, determines that the student suffers from a physical, mental, emotional, or psychological health condition which (a) poses a significant danger or threat of physical harm to the person or property of others, (b) causes the student to interfere with the rights of other members of the university community or with the proper activities or functions of the University or its personnel, or (c) causes the student to be unable to meet institutional requirements for admission and continued enrollment as defined in the Student Conduct Code and other publications of the University. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Except in emergency situations, a student shall, upon request, be accorded an appropriate hearing prior to a final decision concerning continued enrollment at the University. </P>

<P> </P>

<H1>College of Arts and Humanities </H1>

<P>Pauline Gagnon, Dean http://www.westga.edu/coah </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The College of Arts and Humanities is charged with the responsibility of providing instruction not only to students majoring in traditional arts and humanities disciplines, but also for providing general education components of business and education programs. It does so with the realization that in order to prepare students to face the ever-changing, complex society in which we live, it is necessary to do more than teach them a number of facts and train them in a variety of skills. The faculty of the College of Arts and Humanities is dedicated to providing an education that will engage students to meet the future, not merely to live in the present. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The University of West Georgia's College of Arts and Humanities is committed to the academic success of our students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Physical Education Requirement </P>

<P>The college of Arts and Humanities does not have any physical education requirements. Physical Education classes will not count as electives. Note, however, that if a student changes from the College of Arts and Humanities to the College of Education, the student must satisfy that college's physical education requirement. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Graduation Requirement for Discipline-Specific Writing </P>

<P>All students majoring in disciplines in the College of Arts and Humanities must satisfy the requirements for Discipline Specific Writing (DSW) in order to graduate. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>DSW Requirements </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> ENGL 1101 and ENGL 1102 (or the equivalent of) are prerequisite to all &quot;W&quot; (writing-intensive) courses. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> W-courses will require a minimum of 4000 words of original, formal, graded writing, including one major assignment entailing instructor feedback and revision. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Students must take at least two 3000/4000-level W-courses (courses approved as writing-intensive courses and marked in the course bulletin with a W) for a total of at least 6 hours. Both courses must satisfy requirements or electives in the student's major, and at least one must be specific to the major. Departments may also elect to designate specific courses in allied disciplines that would fulfill the DSW requirement for the major. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> DSW requirements vary from department to department: students should consult the catalog and department DSW website for requirements specific to their major. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Certificate Option </P>

<P>A DSW certificate option is available for students who wish to gain additional experience in writing as well as to demonstrate a commitment to developing exemplary communication skills. A student may elect to double the basic DSW requirements, passing 12 hours of writing-intensive courses. These additional courses need not be in the student's major, unless the department specifies otherwise. Students who elect this option and earn a grade of C or above in each of their writing-intensive classes will receive: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> a Discipline-Specific Writing certificate, and </LBody>
</LI>

<P>UWG's Department of Art focuses on the individual student and their personal growth as a professional. The department is committed to excellence in education and making UWG the best place to work, learn and succeed. Our departmental goal is to prepare young professionals to be outstanding individuals in their field upon graduation and to successfully enter the highly competitive world of employment, both in and out of the Arts, and Graduate Studies. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>BA in Art: </P>

<P>The BA in Art degree provides students with opportunities to explore areas within the visual arts without necessarily specializing in any one discipline. As a liberal arts degree, this option is appropriate for students who wish to explore creative processes, develop and hone both creative and critical thinking skillsets, while developing abilities applicable to any number of employment opportunities. The degree is usually identified as appropriate for students who wish to pursue a professional career or graduate studies that may or may not be within the Arts. The Department of Art offers three BA in Art options: BA in Art (Art History), BA in Art (Pre-Medical Illustration), which includes a minor in Biology, and a BA in Art (Studio Art). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Art History Emphasis: </P>

<P>Focuses on various cultures of the past and present and challenges students to relate themselves to a larger world. Art History students are required to write about art critically and to conduct research, and their initiation into the practice takes place in these courses. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Medical Illustration: </P>

<P>Focus on preparing students for application into competitive graduate programs within Medical or Science Illustration with a specific minor in Biology. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Studio Emphasis: </P>

<P>Focuses on various arts' studio disciplines and practices and is appropriate for individuals who wish to enhance their creative and artistic abilities. Students can individualize their own approach; by exposure to all artistic media, focusing on two or more mediums or by taking a 2D or 3D approach, </P>

<P>or even working in a multi-disciplinary nature. This degree encourages broad-based, open-ended inquiry into the arts and is customizable to the interests of individual students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>BFA with a specific Concentration: </P>

<P>The BFA within a specific concentration is appropriate for students who have a strong desire to focus on a single area or medium within the visual arts and who are specifically focused on coursework, providing in-depth exploration within said specific discipline. All Programs are designed to provide students with increased opportunities for complexity and knowledge within their field as they progress. The degree is usually identified as appropriate for students who wish to pursue a professional career or graduate studies in the Arts. The Department of Art offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Art with concentrations in the following programs: Ceramics, Graphic Design, Painting, Printmaking, Photography, Sculpture and Art Education. </P>

<P>The University is an accredited associate member of the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. </P>

<P>Application to the BFA in Art and the BA in Art History Degrees </P>

<P>Students seeking the BFA in Art (Art Education, Ceramics, Graphic Design, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture) or the BA in Art History must submit an application / portfolio for a faculty review. For most applicants this review takes place in the second semester of the sophomore year, or during the semester following the completion of ART 3301, ART 3601 or ART 3602, ART 3802, ART 3801, and ART 3901. All transfer students that have completed 45 or more credit hours must complete one semester in residence before they are eligible to submit an application to BA Art History or any BFA degree program. The BFA and the BA in Art History application / portfolio evaluations focus on an applicant's potential for success within a particular program or professional field. Applicants are expected to show skills and knowledge applied to artistic, design or scholarly problems. Applicant's work should demonstrate their ability, originality, and commitment, which altogether exhibit the applicant's potential to function as a professional artist, designer or scholar. All applicants are observed by faculty during the semesters prior to the BFA/BA Art History application on their ability to conduct themselves as future professional artists/designers and scholars. It is imperative for an applicant's application and review to meet or exceed departmental standards to be successful in the BFA/BA in Art History application process. (See Department of Art website at http://www.westga.edu/art for full application description, requirements and dates). </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Internships for BFA in Art </P>

<P>Internships are available at local businesses and industries. Internships must be educationally relevant to one's area of study and must be approved by both the area advisor and the chair of the department. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Junior Portfolio Review </P>

<P>During the second semester of the junior year and with permission of student's Art advisor, all BA and BFA candidates must enroll and successfully complete ART 4078, while maintaining good standing. (See department website for specific requirements for ART 4078). The department will review juniors based on their portfolio, writings, and transcript progress. The faculty will assess the candidate's progress, skill base and knowledge gained. Successful candidates will be allowed to enroll into ART 4998 and ART 4999 Senior Capstone Experience sequence. Unsuccessful candidates can repeat ART 4078 up to two additional times. If a candidate receives an unsuccessful review on their third attempt, their degree status will be moved to the BA (Studio) or be subject for removal from the art program. (Be mindful of the minor and foreign language requirements FORL 2001, FORL 2002). ART 4078 must be taken during a semester where the student is enrolled in 12 credit hours. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Capstone Sequence for BA &amp; BFA in Art </P>

<P>After successfully completing ART 4078 and at the start of a candidate's final two semesters, BA and BFA in Art candidates will need to enroll in ART 4998 - Senior Capstone Experience I and ART 4999 - Senior Capstone Experience II. (ART 4998 is the prerequisite for ART 4999 and these courses cannot be taken simultaneously). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Candidates should discuss their approach and goals for the Senior Capstone with their advisor and formulate their Capstone Committee. Candidates will need to start developing a plan to assist in making the Capstone sequence a success. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Candidates should prepare a preliminary schedule of courses they wish to take prior to meeting with their advisors. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>During the advising appointment, the advisor and student should continue discussing the program requirements and review the student's course selection. Any other individual or special concerns should also be discussed. (See department website http://www.westga.edu/art or Art Office for complete information). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>GPA and Grade Requirements for all Art Majors </P>

<P>Art students are required to maintain a 2.5 overall GPA and a 3.0 Art GPA. A grade of C or better will fulfill Art requirements. No Art major may receive a D or lower in an Art course and have it fulfill the course requirement in any Art degree program. </P>

<P>Gender and Sexuality Studies Minor </P>

<P>Requirements </P>

<P>The interdisciplinary minor in Gender and Sexuality Studies provides an academic forum for the examination of gender and sexuality in contemporary and historical global cultures.

<P>Certificate </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Undergraduate Certificate in Public History </P>

<P>This Certificate introduces West Georgia students to the interdisciplinary field of public history and provides students with specific training to be successful in the field. The completion of this Certificate program gives students an edge in today's highly competitive job market. The training for the Certificate encourages students to engage in interdisciplinary research and community outreach activities. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>Public historians are historians who &quot;do history outside of the academy,&quot; whether in a museum, historical society, archives, historic preservation office, or other type of local or regional history association or organization. This Certificate introduces students to these careers and begins building skillsets in addition to those gained as part of the student's major. Students who engage in public history training build intercultural awareness and aptitude as community bridge-builders; these are less tangible traits but ones that are crucial to students' future civic life. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>The Certificate program is open to all UWG undergraduate students interested in career opportunities in this field. Because public history is interdisciplinary, students from a variety of fields may see the opportunity for potential careers in this field, including not only history but art history, studio art, anthropology, business, marketing, English, and other humanities fields. Regardless of your major, this Certificate will provide training for participants in areas such as career preparation, professionalism, and work experience. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>History majors can count the Public History Certificate as a minor field, if desired. Any non-major who completes the certificate program will also earn a minor in History. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>Students must formally apply with the Undergraduate Public History Advisor, Ms. Keri </P>

<P>Adams, in the Department of History. Please contact her at madams@westga.edu or </P>

<P>By phone at 678-839-5275. </P>

<P> Classical Studies Minor </P>

<P>What is Classical Studies, and why study it? </P>

<P>The study of the literature, languages, history, art, philosophy and political thought of the Greeks and Romans develops the mind by requiring students to engage critically with such timeless topics as beauty and esthetics, the ideal relationship of the citizen and the state, the roles of men and women in society, freedom and slavery, the nature of war and peace, the purpose of literature, and the role of religion in public and private life. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Classics have long been considered the ideal foundation of education for the informed citizen in any profession. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Program of Study for the Minor in Classical Studies: </P>

<P>Students are required to complete a total of 15 credit hours (5 courses) to be drawn from at least three different departments. At least 9 credits (3 courses) must be taken at the 3000-level and above. Courses are to be selected from the approved lists of courses in the Classical World and the Classical Tradition and its reception after Antiquity (see below), with the caveat that additional courses may qualify for the Minor, subject to the discretion of the Minor committee. Per USG rules, courses taken to satisfy Core areas A-E may not be counted as coursework in the Minor. </P>

<P>Students are strongly recommended to take Introduction to Classical Studies, a new XIDS 2100 course, to be taught for the first time in Fall 2012. </P>

<P>The Department of Music at West Georgia is dedicated to developing educators who are equally well trained as musicians and teachers, and to developing performers, composers, and scholars who contribute performances, works, and ideas of integrity. Bachelor of Music degrees are offered with majors in Music Education, Composition, Performance, Performance with an Emphasis in Jazz Studies, and Performance with an Emphasis in Piano Pedagogy. The program of study in music education leads to Georgia State Teacher Certification. Students who pursue a major in another field of study may qualify to pursue a Minor in Music. All instruction is delivered by distinguished artist-teacher faculty with extensive credentials and professional experience. The University of West Georgia is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Faculty and Facilities </P>

<P>Cultural events are presented in the Kathy Cashen Recital hall, which houses a two-manual, 16-rank Reuter pipe organ and a 9-ft. Steinway concert grand piano, and in the Townsend Center for the Performing Arts, which boasts a mainstage hall of 455 seats and the Richard Dangle &quot;black-box&quot; Theater. Gracing the mainstage of the Townsend Center are twin Bösendorfer Imperial grand pianos, making West Georgia one of only a few institutions in the nation to have two such instruments on the same stage. In addition to Kathy Cashen Recital Hall, the Humanities Building houses a state-of-the-art music technology lab, a well-equipped keyboard lab, a large percussion studio, multi-media classrooms, faculty studios, and numerous practice rooms. UWG is the first public university in the nation to be designated a Kawai EPIC Institution. In addition to the pianos mentioned above, our Excellent Performance Instrument Collection includes Kawai pianos in all classrooms, studios, practice rooms, and rehearsal rooms, an additional Steinway concert grand, and five Shigeru Kawai grand pianos of various sizes, including a designated rehearsal instrument reserved for Piano principals. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Opportunities in Music </P>

<P>Students at West Georgia, whether music majors, minors, or non-music majors, participate in a wide range of music activities for university credit. Music majors and minors follow a prescribed program of study, while non-music majors may select from a wide variety of offerings. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Many students perform in University ensembles, which include the Concert Choir, Chamber Singers, Opera Workshop, Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Chamber Winds, Jazz Ensemble, </P>

<P>Marching Band, Basketball Band, Keyboard Ensemble, Brass Ensemble, Woodwind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and various small chamber groups. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Private study is available in piano, organ, voice, and guitar, as well as in wind, brass, and percussion instruments. These private lessons are required of all music majors and minors (Principal Applied). Music majors who desire to study a second instrument may enroll in MUSC 4610: Secondary Applied. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students also enroll in music courses offered in the Core Curriculum, including Music Appreciation; Jazz, Rock, and Popular Music; and Survey of World Music. To determine which courses can most suitably meet your needs, contact the Chair of the Department of Music. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Entrance Auditions and Placement Examinations </P>

<P>All incoming freshmen and transfer students planning to major in music must audition before the music faculty on their principal performing instrument or voice. A scholarship audition may serve as a student's admission audition. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Credit by examination for any course in the Music Theory or Keyboard Skills sequence must be validated by the course's faculty and processed through the Music Office and the Office of the Registrar. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Transfer Student Admission </P>

<P>The music major entering the Department of Music by transfer must submit an official transcript of all previous college work to the University's Office of Admissions. The applicant should be prepared to validate achievements in the area of applied music, music theory, ear training and sight singing, keyboard proficiency, and the history and literature of music. Plans for the removal of any deficiency must be initiated during the first registration period. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Transfer students must pass the level-change examination in order to register for upper-division principal-applied study (MUSC 4600: Principal Applied). For transfer students who have completed 2 years of applied study, the level-change examination may take place during the entrance audition. Otherwise it will occur during the applied jury examination in the semester when the student is ready for advancement from the lower-division to the upper-division level of study.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Specific requirements regarding applied lessons are listed on the department website at: (http://www.westga.edu/music). For additional information about the performance standards for applied-music study, please see the faculty coordinator(s) in your area or the Chair of the Department of Music. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Music Scholarships </P>

<P>Music scholarship awards are available to qualified students as determined by a scholarship audition. Numerous students are served annually by these awards to music-major, music-minor, and non-music-major students. All awards are valid pending admission to and approval of funding by the University. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Music Scholarship Committee considers many criteria before recommending a candidate for a scholarship award. These criteria include the candidate's anticipated contribution to departmental ensembles, the needs within the department, the financial need of the candidate, and the amount of award money available. For continuing students, additional considerations include their actual contributions to the department through solo performances and ensemble participation, improvement and growth in applied study, and academic standing. </P>

<P>College of Education Mission </P>

<P>Locally connected and globally relevant, the Mission of the College of Education is to prepare graduates for meaningful, professional careers in diverse settings within three dynamic areas of focus: Education, Leadership, and Health.  With programs that range from undergraduate through doctoral study, the College of Education is committed to excellence in teaching, professional service, engaged partnerships, and applied research. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>College of Education Vision </P>

<P>The College of Education at the University of West Georgia will be recognized for Leading a New World of Learning, with relevant and innovative programs that change lives and contribute to the betterment of society. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Physical Education Requirement </P>

<P>The College of Education requires three hours of physical education. The student must satisfy this requirement by taking the 2-hour Health and Wellness course (PWLA 1600) and one 1-hour activity course. </P>

<P>A range of activity courses is offered each semester emphasizing lifetime activities, fitness-based activities, individual pursuits, and team sports. All activity courses encourage wellness and mental and physical health across the lifespan. </P>

<P>Military veterans with two or more years of active duty will not have to take the activity course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Certification </P>

<P>The Georgia Professional Standards Commission awards professional educator certificates in Georgia. The University of West Georgia has been approved to offer undergraduate programs designed to qualify students for the level four induction certificate in the following teaching fields: </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>1.  Early Childhood Education (Grades P-5) </P>

<P>2.  Early Childhood/Special Education - General Curriculum (Grades P-5) </P>

<P>3.  Secondary Education (Grades 6-12), with these majors: </P>

<P>Biology </P>

<P>Chemistry </P>

<P>Earth Science </P>

<P>English </P>

<P>History </P>

<P>Mathematics </P>

<P>Physics </P>

<P>4. All level Fields (Grades P-12) </P>

<P>Art Education </P>

<P>French </P>

<P>Health and Physical Education </P>

<P>Music Education </P>

<P>Spanish </P>

<P>Special Education - Adapted Curriculum </P>

<P>Special Education - General Curriculum </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>The teacher education programs in Elementary, Elementary/Special Education, Physical Education, and Special Education lead to a Bachelor of Science in Education degree with certification. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The program for certification on the P-12 level in selected fields is organized on an interdepartmental basis. The student completes the requirements for a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and a Bachelor of Music, as planned by the student's departmental advisor, while the professional education requirements are taken under the direction of the College of Education. Completion of one of the approved programs by the College of Education qualifies the graduate for an induction level four certificate in Georgia. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Georgia House Bill 671 requires that after July 1, 1976, any person certified as a teacher should have completed satisfactorily requirements in the identification and education of children who have special needs. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Note: The educational requirements of all programs are designed to enable one to meet present certification assessment(s) required by the Georgia Professional Standards Commission; however, the Georgia Professional Standards Commission may change required certification assessment(s) prior to the completion of the course of study. While reasonable efforts will be made to enable one to satisfy additional requirements, no assurances can be made that the University will be able to offer these additional courses or, if taken, that such courses will entitle one to take and pass the certification assessment(s). Prior to receipt of induction certification, the appropriate certification assessment(s) required by the Georgia Professional Standards Commission must be completed and passed. The candidate has the responsibility to register for the appropriate certification assessments. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>All post-baccalaureate students seeking initial certification must be admitted to teacher education and have an approved program of study planned prior to the end of the first semester of enrollment. All students must complete the program of study at West Georgia. In all cases, the appropriate certification assessment(s) will be required. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>State authorization to provide a program related to the preparation of teachers or other P-12 school / system personnel does not indicate eligibility for an Alabama certificate. Applicants for an Alabama certificate based on reciprocity must meet Alabama's test requirements and submit a valid, renewable professional educator certificate/license issued by another state at the degree level, grade level, and in the teaching field or area of instructional support for which an Alabama certificate is sought and for which Alabama issues a certificate. Applicants for Alabama certification in an area of administration must also document at least three years of full-time employment as an administrator in a P-12 school system(s). www.alsde.edu </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Liability Insurance </P>

<P>All teacher education candidates must provide their own liability insurance. Candidates, not the University of West Georgia, are responsible for acts committed while participating in professional field experiences. Keep in mind that financial penalties can be extreme, particularly when public school students are injured as a result of the candidates' negligent acts or omissions. Terms of the liability insurance policy can be obtained from the Office of Field Experiences. Coverage may be obtained through Student Professional Association of Georgia Educators (SPAGE) and/or Georgia Association of Educators (GAE).

<P>Special Education, B.S.Ed. </P>

<P>The B.S.Ed. with a major in Special Education program prepares candidates to teach students with disabilities who attend preschool through high school programs, as well as preschoolers receiving special education services.  The program allows teacher candidates to choose between two concentrations.  One concentration leads to certification in special education - adapted curriculum while the other leads to certification in special education - general curriculum.   Graduates sometimes choose other jobs in related social service areas or pursue teacher certification in additional areas of specialty at the graduate/post-baccalaureate level. The learning outcomes for the students who receive the Bachelor of Science in Special Education are taken from the Special Education Initial Content Standards and the Initial Knowledge and Skills Sets of the Council for Exceptional Children. </P>

<P>Lok C. Lew Yan Voon, Dean </P>

<P>http://www.westga.edu/cosm </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The College of Science and Mathematics is charged with the responsibility of providing instruction to students majoring in traditional sciences and mathematics disciplines, as well as providing the general education component of all the non-science and mathematics programs. It does so with the realization that in order to prepare students to face the ever-changing, complex society in which we live, it is necessary to do more than teach them a number of facts and train them in a variety of skills. This is done by offering a challenging curriculum that exposes students to innovative teaching and hands-on experiences. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The College of Science and Mathematics offers degrees in all traditional areas of science and mathematics, including biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, and physics. Sequences of quality academic courses are provided to prepare students for graduate studies in the discipline and the school of their choice, as well as for a variety of scientific careers, including elementary and secondary school teaching. In addition, it is believed that an educated person in modern society requires a basic understanding of science and mathematics as well as computational skills. Courses designed to accommodate this need are incorporated in all major programs and are available to students desiring a liberal experience in the sciences. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Graduation Requirement for Discipline-Specific Writing </P>

<P>All students majoring in disciplines in the College of Science and Mathematics must satisfy the requirements for Discipline Specific Writing (DSW) in order to graduate. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>DSW Requirements </P>

<P>ENGL 1101 and ENGL 1102 (or the equivalent of) are prerequisite to all &quot;W&quot; (writing-intensive) courses. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> W-courses will require a minimum of 4000 words of original, formal, graded writing, including one major assignment entailing instructor feedback and revision. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Students must take at least two 3000/4000-level W-courses (courses approved as writing-intensive courses and marked in the course bulletin with a W) for a total of at least 6 hours. Both courses must satisfy requirements or electives in the student's major, and at least one must be specific to the major. Departments may also elect to designate specific courses in allied disciplines that would fulfill the DSW requirement for the major. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> DSW requirements vary from department to department: students should consult the catalog and department DSW website for requirements specific to their major. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Certificate Option </P>

<P>A DSW certificate option is available for students who wish to gain additional experience in writing as well as to demonstrate a commitment to developing exemplary communication skills. A student may elect to double the basic DSW requirements, passing 12 hours of writing-intensive courses. These additional courses need not be in the student's major, unless the department specifies otherwise. Students who elect this option and earn a grade of C or above in each of their writing-intensive classes will receive: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> a Discipline-Specific Writing certificate, and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> transcript notation of this accomplishment. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Physical Education Requirement </P>

<P>The college of Science and Mathematics does not have any physical education requirements. Physical Education classes will not count as electives. Note, however, that if a student changes from the College of Science and Mathematics to the College of Education, the student must satisfy that college's physical education requirement. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Professional Practice Program </P>

<P>The Department of Career Services assists students in combining classroom study and field experience related to students' majors and/or career goals. Cooperative Education and Internship opportunities are available to students within the College of Science and Mathematics.

<P>Regents Engineering Pathways (REPP) program (formerly RETP) </P>

<P>The Regents' Engineering Pathways (REPP) program was originally established in 1986 Regents Engineering Transfer Program (RETP) to expand the availability of engineering education opportunities for Georgians for a select number of USG institutions. As of September 1, 2016, this program will be known as The Regents' Engineering Pathways (REPP) program and will be open to all USG institutions. In its current structure, students complete two or more years of engineering pathway courses at the University of West Georgia before transferring to Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Southern University, Kennesaw State University, Mercer University or the University of Georgia to complete a B.S. degree in Engineering (REPP program Engineering Institutions).  </P>

<P>Admission to B.S. in Biology Program </P>

<P>To be admitted into the B.S. program in Biology, students must have completed at least 30 hours with a cumulative GPA (including all transfer credit) of 2.5 or better. The criteria for declaring a major in the B.S. in Biology Program are as follows: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> The standard for declaring a major in Biology shall be the cumulative GPA as calculated by UWG from all academic courses on a student's transcript at the end of the most recent semester in which 30 or more academic hours have been completed. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> A student with fewer than 30 academic hours can elect to declare a major in the B.S. in Biology program. This entitles the student to follow the Biology program of study under the supervision of a professional adviser of the Advising Center. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> A student who has completed a minimum of 30 academic hours with a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or greater can declare a major in Biology. This entitles the student to earn a B.S. in Biology degree under the supervision of a faculty adviser of Biology. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> A major in Biology who reaches 30 academic hours with a cumulative GPA less than 2.5 is advised to meet with an adviser in the Advising Center and submit an action plan that includes specific steps to improve GPA. A major in Biology will be deferred to the first semester in which the student's GPA reaches or exceeds the standard as described above. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> In transferring from another major, a student who has accumulated at least 30 academic hours with a cumulative GPA less than 2.5 is advised to meet with an adviser in the Advising Center and submit an action plan that includes specific steps to improve GPA. A major in Biology will be deferred to the first semester in which the student's GPA reaches or exceeds the standard as described above. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> In transferring from another institution, a Biology major who has accumulated at least 30 academic hours can declare a major in Biology at UWG. </LBody>
</LI>

<P> </P>

<P>The Department of Geosciences offers programs of study focusing on planet earth, our natural and built environments, and how societies interact with and alter the biophysical world. We are a welcoming, student-centered department with challenging programs of study that span a wide range of subject matter and techniques. Our programs emphasize hands-on learning and take students out of the classroom into the field whenever possible. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Geology is the study of the earth, including the origin and history of the planet and its life forms. On a practical level geologists explore for natural resources, help society understand and mitigate natural hazards and guide environmental stewardship. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Geography is the study of the interactions between people and places, local and global processes, and social and biophysical systems. It is an integrative discipline in which scholars endeavor to understand the role of humans in producing the social and biophysical worlds in which they live.  </P>

<P>Geographic knowledge can be applied to explain cultural and political conflicts, environmental policies and practices, human landscapes, and economic well-being. Modern geographical analysis typically involves cartographic and geospatial techniques (GIS) and both qualitative and quantitative methods. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A range of degree plans are offered in the Department of Geosciences. The B.S. Degree in Geology is designed for students planning professional careers as geologists either with or without a graduate degree. The B.S. Degree in Earth Science prepares and certifies students for teaching careers. Four degree options are available under the B.S. Degree in Geography: Human Geography emphasizes on urban, political, economic, cultural, and social processes; Physical Geography concentrates on biological and geomorphological systems and atmospheric (weather and climate) processes; Environmental Sustainability focuses on the interactions between society and natural systems; and GIS concerns geospatial technologies and spatial analysis. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Geoscience graduates are well-prepared for immediate employment in the private sector; for employment in government service at the local, state or federal level; for teaching careers; or for continued study in graduate school. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Mission Statement </P>

<P>The educational mission of the Global Studies program is to promote an understanding of global awareness. The focus is to enable students to examine and explain global issues in an analytical </P>

<P>framework which emphasizes the role of individuals in local communities and their relationship to the global society. Students will develop an understanding of and appreciation for their roles and responsibilities as citizens of the global community. The program offers one degree, a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). This degree is appropriate for students who wish to join the global marketplace with careers in government, political organizations, journalism, private businesses, advocacy groups or non-governmental organizations. Likewise, it is appropriate for students planning on attending graduate or law school. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>The Department of Mathematics offers two degree programs in mathematics: the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Bachelor of Science degree program has four plans, each designed for specific career goals:  </P>

<P>Plan A, the Traditional Track; Plan B, the Applied Mathematics Track; Plan C, the Statistics/Actuarial Track; and Plan D, the UTEACH Secondary Education Track. The student's advisor will help the student choose the best track, based on the student's interests. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan A, a traditional mathematics option, offers students a broad background in mathematics and is principally designed to prepare students for graduate study in pure or applied mathematics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan B is designed to offer students a solid background in applied mathematics, prepare them for employment in government agencies such as communications, national security, and computer-related fields or industry such as engineering or computational types of work. It also prepares students for further study in mathematics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan C, an option in applied statistics/ actuarial science, is designed to offer students a solid theoretical and applied background in statistics, preparing them for employment in a wide variety of interesting careers. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan D, an option in secondary education, is designed for students seeking mathematics teacher certification at the secondary level. Students who complete this option will qualify for certification in secondary education in mathematics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Bachelor of Arts degree program is designed for students seeking employment in government or business or those desiring further study in mathematics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>The physics program offers seven plans leading to the B. S. degree in physics. These plans are Plan A, the general physics major; Plan B, the dual degree (physics and engineering); Plan C, the physics major with a business concentration; Plan D, the physics education major; and Plans E, F, and G, the various physics emphases. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan A is designed for students who desire to pursue graduate study in physics or career options for which physics is an excellent gateway. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan B, please see the Regents' Engineering Pathway (REP) website at:   http://www.usg.edu/assets/academic_partnerships_accreditation/committee_docs/documents/REP_Pathways_Web_Page.pdf . </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan C is designed so that students earn credit towards the master's in business administration. In this plan, students obtain a B.S. in physics with a business concentration in four years. Students who are interested in entering the technological business world are thus enabled to complete their M.B.A. in the fifth year at West Georgia. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Plan D is a B.S. in physics education. As mandated by the Board of Regents, students interested in teaching at the secondary level must have a major in the area of their teaching interest. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Finally, Plans E, F, and G are similar to Plan A but are specialized depending on the courses students choose in the major area. These three emphases are computational physics (plan E), electro-optics (plan F), and solid state physics (plan G). These plans are designed to make it easier for students to seek employment in specific industry positions. The physics faculty, as a whole, advise students in each of these areas. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>PHYS 1111 and PHYS 2211 are beginning courses. After receiving credit for PHYS 2211, a student may not receive credit for PHYS 1111. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Learning Outcomes </P>

<P>Serving Humanity, Doing Public Good </P>

<P>The motto of the College of Social Sciences (COSS) encapsulates the shared focus of the academic programs and centers housed in the College. Service to humanity is the founding principle at the heart of our various disciplines and informs our approach to the place of COSS in the wider community. Doing the public good is the natural extension of our broad commitment to our shared communities. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>As academic disciplines, our departments explore key aspects of the human condition and broaden our understanding of life and how it is lived. This exploration is critical to the development of informed, engaged, and active members of our communities. The partnerships formed between COSS programs and centers and the broader communities help our students to see the impact they may have on the future of local, regional, state, national, and global communities. They also help our faculty and staff engage in the community to find avenues for mutually beneficial relationships.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The continued success of our efforts to serve humanity and do public good depends on our ability to effectively and sustainably maintain our programs and centers and their relationships both at the University of West Georgia and with our wider community of stakeholders. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Mission Statement </P>

<P>The general education mission of the Political Science Department is to help students develop an understanding of the basic values, institutions, political and legal processes and public policies of the American national and Georgia governments so that they can participate in government in a knowledgeable and intelligent fashion. The undergraduate program offers two academic degrees. The primary purpose of the B.A. program is to provide students with a general, liberal arts degree with a major in political science. Such a degree is appropriate for those students who want a broad liberal arts education, plan to attend graduate or law school, or wish to prepare for employment in government, political organizations, journalism or a private business with extensive public contracts. The primary purpose of the B.S. program is to give students an overview of the discipline and a more concentrated focus on a particular subfield of political science so that they are prepared for employment in the public sector or in &quot;not-for-profit&quot; organizations or for professional programs in graduate school or law school. Finally, the department provides service courses related to domestic and international politics for students enrolled in related programs at West Georgia. </P>

<P>Organizational Leadership, B.S. </P>

<P>The Bachelor of Science with a Major in Organizational Leadership (ORGL) degree prepares students to focus on the theories, practices, issues, and specific ramifications of leading an organization. The multidisciplinary curriculum provides an understanding of management, administration, human resources, ethics, and technology related to today's complex organizations in the public, private or non-profit sectors. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Organization Leadership degree has options that allow adults to earn college credit through Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) for college-level knowledge gained from relevant work experiences, professional training, military service and professional certificate programs. These experiences may be documented through transcripts from the American Council on Education (ACE), the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), departmental challenge exams, or academic credit earned through the successful evaluation of a portfolio that contains sufficient information and documentation to affirm college-level learnings. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The online Organizational Leadership program is ideal for traditional students who wish to take advantage of online course delivery, as well as for working professionals, military members, transfer students and others seeking flexible routes to degree completion. The program is delivered fully online through eMajor. eMajor is a University System of Georgia collaborative program that has delivered flexible, online degree programs through multiple USG institutions since 2012. The purpose of eMajor is to provide quality, innovative, high-demand programs through traditional institutions. Developed and maintained by committed faculty and dedicated instructional design professionals, each course is consistent in quality, design, and accessibility standards and taught by University System of Georgia faculty. A cornerstone of eMajor is the inclusion of prior learning assessments in several programs, shortening time to degree. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>eMajor is a USG collaborative program which offers fully online, high-demand career degrees through traditional universities. Courses offered through eMajor are taken within the Georgia Online Virtual Instruction Enterprise Wide (GoVIEW) learning management system. The eMajor collaborative program operates by the USG collaborative calendar, which may differ slightly from institutional calendars. Additionally, eMajor courses are offered in various formats, which include 8-week condensed sessions. For the Organizational Leadership (ORGL) major offered through UWG, all courses will be offered solely in 8-week sessions, which allows students to progress swiftly through courses as needed. All eMajor courses are taught by highly qualified USG instructors. </P>

<P>Certificate </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Data Analytics Certificate (DAC) </P>

<P>Rationale </P>

<P>The Undergraduate Data Analytics Certificate (DAC) is a collaborative, cross-disciplinary program.  The certificate is designed for students who aspire to work in academic, governmental, non-profit, and commercial sectors as data scientists. The demand for data scientists has grown significantly as both private and public organizations generate and collect increasingly larger amounts of data; but the need to collect, analyze, and interpret such data requires a broad set of analytical skills. Through the Data Analytics Certificate, students will receive training in data management, quantitative analysis, and visualization techniques that will allow them to properly collect, contextualize, and communicate findings based on quantitative data. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The certificate requires 12 credit hours (4 courses). No more than three courses per discipline will count toward the certificate. Course substitutions or exceptions can be made with the approval of the certificate faculty adviser within each respective college. </P>

<P>Courses in the program will usually be offered as part of existing majors. Also, departments may occasionally offer the courses online (fully or hybrid), and in the summer (but not in the Maymester). The Data Analytics will be an embedded certificate. </P>

<P> Learning Outcomes </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. Demonstrate proficiency in data collection, management, analysis, and visualization. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>2. Demonstrate proficiency in quantitative analysis techniques for effective data-driven decision-making. </LBody>
</LI>

<LBody>3. Demonstrate proficiency in various data management and analysis software programs such as: R, SAS, SPSS, and STATA. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Eligibility </P>

<P>Applicants to the Data Analytics Certificate must meet the requirements for their major. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. Students may pursue this certificate in conjunction with their major program. </LBody>

<P>Preparation for Law School </P>

<P>Law Schools do not require a specific undergraduate curriculum, and students can be admitted to law school after majoring in any subject.  Students, however, should take courses that emphasize reading, writing, and critical thinking.  Two departments offer programs to that end, and there are also other courses which students should consider taking. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>In the Political Science Department, there are three courses offered every year that are specifically structured to prepare students for law school: Judicial Process (POLS 3301), Constitutional Law I (POLS 4301), and Constitutional Law II (POLS 4302).  These courses are suggested for students in any major, and they also comprise the courses necessary for completing the &quot;Law Concentration&quot; for those earning a B.A. or B.S. in Political Science.  They are taught by Thomas Hunter, who is recognized by the Law School Admissions Council as the &quot;Pre-Law Advisor&quot; for the University of West Georgia.  He also serves as the Faculty Advisor to the Political Science Pre-Law Society. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>The Philosophy Program offers a Law and Justice Track, which follows the basic requirements for a B.A. degree in Philosophy with some modifications.  Program requirements include the following courses: Critical Thinking (PHIL 2020), Modern Philosophy (PHIL 3110), Philosophy of Law (PHIL 4110), Political Philosophy (PHIL 4115), and Professional Ethics (PHIL 4120).  The advisor for this program is Walter Riker.  The Philosophy Program also offers Symbolic Logic (PHIL 4160), which is strongly encouraged for those taking the LSAT. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>Besides those courses listed above, other courses that discuss the legal system, or involve skills needed for law school, include: Legal and Ethical Environment of Business (BUSA 2106), Business Law (MGNMGNT 3602), International Business Law (MGNT 3625), Employment Law (MGNT 4640), Principles of Accounting I (ACCT 2101), Principles of Macroeconomics (ECON 2105), Creative Writing (ENGL 3200), and Advanced Composition: Creative Nonfiction (ENGL 3400). </P>

<P>Sociology is the scientific study of society and human behavior. Through the use of both research and theories, sociologists develop understandings of complex forms of human behavior. Students in the BS degree program in Sociology learn about the very fabric of social relations through courses in inequality, aging, gender, deviance, globalization, social psychology, race and ethnicity, the environment, the media and more. The Sociology program seeks to provide students with mastery of basic academic subject matter along with the learning skills necessary for enrichment and continued success in academic and workplace environments. Upon graduation students are prepared for advanced graduate and professional school education and for entrance into the job market in business, government, non-profit organizations, and social services work. Internships are available to provide onsite, practical experience. Students are encouraged to pursue independent research, collaborate with professors on their research, and present their work during UWG's Social Science Research Day and at annual conferences, such as the Georgia Sociological Association and the Southeastern Undergraduate Sociology Symposium. The Sociological Collective provides students with fun and support, career information, opportunities for community service, speakers, and other activities. Students who qualify are also invited to join the national sociology honor society, Alpha Kappa Delta. The B.S. Degree in Sociology is available in both face-to-face and online. </P>

<P>The B.A. degree in International Economic Affairs is a multidisciplinary undergraduate degree. The International Economic Affairs program offers a broad liberal arts education with careful attention to international economics, foreign language skills, geography, cultural anthropology, history, political science, and sociology. The major serves its graduates by providing them with both the skills necessary to secure employment upon graduation and the broad conceptual and analytical abilities that will give them the flexibility needed for personal and professional growth. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The B.A. degree in International Economic Affairs serves students who want a background in international affairs and international economics. The program is designed to stand alone as a major and also serve as a second major for students earning a B.A. in other areas, such as foreign languages. Graduates from all three Economics majors (B.B.A., B.S., and B.A.) find jobs in management training programs, banking, real estate, stock brokerage, and journalism to name a few. Majoring in Economics is also excellent preparation for graduate study in business, law, or the social sciences. </P>

<P>Admission to the BSN Program is a separate and independent process that occurs after admission to the University of West Georgia. It is competitive and spaces are limited. Students who wish to pursue a degree in nursing should consult with a nursing advisor. Because of the limited number of spaces available in the BSN program and the academic demands of the program, applications of all students who meet the minimum admission requirements will be evaluated by the BSN Admissions Committee, and the most qualified students will be selected. This evaluation and selection process includes current students, transfer students, and students seeking readmission. </P>

<P>Pre-licensure BSN Track </P>

<P>In addition to the admission requirements for the University of West Georgia, students applying for admission to the Pre-licensure BSN Program must have a program grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale.

Students who receive any two of the following: &quot;W&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;WF&quot;, or &quot;U&quot; in any two nursing courses may not continue in the program. Students who fail a course in the first semester of the program must compete and reapply for readmission with the next applicant pool. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>POLS 4519 - Genocide </P>

<P>(3 /0/ 3) Prerequisite: POLS 1101 The commission of genocidal acts represents the height of human inhumanity to human. Human history is filled with cases of groups-the state, elites, dominant ethnic groups, among others-committing genocidal crimes against other groups-marginalized racial, ethnic, religious and other groups-based on the perennial &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; serving as the motor force. Although, the international community has committed itself to the prevention of genocide as reflected in the famous expression &quot;Never again!,&quot; the rhetoric commitment has not been matched by consistent action. Accordingly, there have been cases of the commission of genocidal crimes as a recurring phenomenon-from the Holocaust to Sudan's Darfur region. Against this background, this course will seek to explore the various issues that underlie genocide, such as the explanations for the commission of genocidal acts, the typology of genocide, context, international norms, the efforts to prevent and punish genocidal crimes, and various case studies. The course begins with the issues, and this is then followed by the case studies. The rationale is to link the issues to the cases. </P>
