<P>While maintaining its reputation for delivering a high quality undergraduate education, McKendree has expanded its academic course offerings to include graduate </P>
</Sect>

<P>degree programs in business administration, criminal justice, education, nursing, and professional counseling. In 2013, McKendree became a member of the NCAA Division II, a move that has provided exciting opportunities for student-athletes to compete at a high level. </P>

<P>An enhanced academic reputation for the university has accompanied its growth. The university has become more selective, attracting more academically talented students, and the student body is more diverse. </P>

<P>McKendree offers a wide variety of co curricular opportunities, including music, band, athletic teams, debate teams, honor societies, student research opportunities and academic programs that have resulted in a robust university environment. The Russel E. and Fern M. Hettenhausen Center for the Arts, known as the “Hett, is home to the music and theatre programs. It offers the campus community a state of-the-art facility in which to enjoy a wide variety of performances and special events. Within the last 10 years, McKendree has opened “1828, a café to serve commuter students, evening students, and the campus community. Most recently, two new residence halls were constructed to better serve a growing residential student population. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Along with the many advances at the institution, one thing remains constant: McKendree University continues to provide a nurturing environment, offering students opportunities and challenges that lead to unmatched personal and professional growth. </H4>

McKendree University 2014/2015 Undergraduate Catalog 6 The Tradition Established in 1828 by pioneer Methodists, McKendree is the oldest university in Illinois, and the oldest in the nation with continuous ties to the United Methodist Church. First called Lebanon Seminary, the school opened in two rented sheds for 72 students. In 1830, Bishop William McKendree, the first American-born bishop of the Methodist Church, permitted the Board of Trustees to change the institution s name to McKendree College. Later Bishop McKendree deeded 480 acres of rich land in Shiloh Valley, Illinois, to help support the College. Reverend Peter Akers, in 1833, was the first president of the newly named college. He was three times president of McKendree College and received its first degree, an honorary Doctorate of Divinity. In 1835, the College received one of the first charters granted to independent church colleges by the Illinois legislature. The institution still operates under the provisions of a second, more liberal charter obtained in 1839. </Figure>

<P>If students are completing their high school education under the aegis of a </P>

<P>diploma-granting organization, they will need to submit evidence of the coursework </P>

<P>completed and performance evaluation. For those not completing their diploma </P>

<P>with an organization, we require a detailed portfolio of the work you have completed to assess your level of preparation for college-level work at McKendree. This </P>

<P>portfolio should include descriptions of books and other curricular material used </P>

<P>and mastered in preparation for college-level courses, transcripts from community </P>

<P>colleges or other courses, scores from advanced Placement tests, recommendations </P>

<P>from qualified tutors or teachers, examples of independent research, or evidence of completed units in science, English or other academic subjects. We also strongly encourage home-schooled students to provide a sample of their writing. </P>

<P>All McKendree applicants must submit either an ACT or SAT score with their application. These tests are administered independently of school systems and are open to anyone. </P>

<P>Letters of recommendation are particularly important for applicants. Recommenders should be qualified to evaluate you not only as a student but also as an individual and member of the community. </P>

No student with an unpaid account will be permitted to enroll until the account is paid in full or satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Business Office. </P>

<P>Payment may be made by personal check, debit card, American Express, MasterCard, Discover, or Visa. Grants and scholarship awards may also be applied toward payment of financial obligations. Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Federal Direct Parent (PLUS) Loans, or Perkins Loans may </P>

<P>be applied, provided the student has submitted the completed loan application before registration. Students expecting Veterans administration (Va) benefits or </P>

Admission </Figure>

<P>For students who register for less than a full semester or for a single one-month session, the same minimum registration payment and requirements as set forth above will apply. In this case, however, payment of the balance is due at the beginning of the session for which the student has registered. </P>

<P>If payment is not made by the last day of registration, the university will charge interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month from that day, and reserves the right to bar the student from classes, residence halls, the dining hall, and examinations until such payment is made. Furthermore, the university reserves the right to withhold grades or transcripts if the account is not paid in full by the end of the session for which the student has registered. The university will not allow students to participate in the graduation ceremony or have their degree posted or verified in any way until their account is paid in full. Students with delinquent accounts are responsible to reimburse the university for all interest charges, late payment fees, collection fees and court costs resulting from any delinquency. </P>

<P>The Offices of Administration and Finance and Financial Aid will work with students in the event of problems associated with payment of financial obligations. Students anticipating a payment problem should make an appointment with the Business Office to ensure that the requirements of the payment policy are met. </P>

<P>McKendree University reserves the right to change tuition, fees, and room and board charges at any time. </P>

<P>stipulate, but are not limited to, maintaining acceptable grades, completing a sufficient </P>

<P>number of credit hours per semester, and completing the first bachelor’s degree within a reasonable time frame. A student who does not meet these standards is not eligible to receive federally and/or state funded financial aid including institutional aid.

<H4>Withdrawals and Refunds </H4>

<P>No student who is suspended or dismissed from the university by university authorities shall be entitled to any refund of tuition, room rent or board. Any student who desires a change in course or withdrawal from one or more classes must sign and date a Change of Course form and have the form signed by the student’s Faculty </P>

<P>advisor, the office of Financial aid and the office of administration and Finance. this </P>

<P>form must then be returned to and be validated by the Office of Academic Records. In the case of complete withdrawal from the university, the student must fill out a withdrawal form and must have this form approved by the Provost, the student’s Faculty Advisor, the Office of Student Affairs, the Library, the Office of Financial Aid, </P>

<P>the office of administration and Finance, and the office of academic records. the </P>

<P>date on which such written approval is received by the Office of Academic Records determines the amount of refund. Failure by the student to obtain written approval makes the student ineligible for any refund. </P>

<P>Withdrawing from one or more classes should be carefully considered in terms of graduation requirements as well as financial aid. Financial aid programs have varying rules, and students need to consult the Office of Financial Aid before adding or dropping courses once a term has begun, particularly courses offered in a one-month, six-week, or eight-week format. It is recommended that a student seek counsel from an academic advisor and the office of Financial aid before changing courses or withdrawing from one or more courses. </P>

<P>a. Cheating involves many forms of misrepresentation such as sharing exam answers, copying another student’s answers, presenting another’s work as one’s own, changing work which has been graded when the work is going to be reevaluated, having a stand-in take an exam, and using unauthorized </P>

<P>examination aids. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Sabotage involves the destruction or deliberate inhibition of another student’s academic work or the destruction of materials relied upon by other students such as library materials, computer software and hardware, and computer files. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Duplicate submission means the submission of the same work in two different courses. This is not permitted except when permission has been given by the </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>instructors in the courses involved. </P>

<P>d. Plagiarism consists of presenting the words or ideas of another without proper acknowledgement. This applies to direct quotations, paraphrases, or summarized </P>

<P>ideas. </P>

<P>The Violation and Initial Report </P>

<P>When a faculty member suspects or learns of an alleged instance of academic dishonesty on the part of a student, the faculty member will contact the student. </P>

<P>When the faculty member confirms an incident of dishonesty, the faculty member may take any of the following steps: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Allow the student to resubmit the assignment or re-take the exam, test, or quiz for full credit; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Reduce the grade earned by the student for the specific assignment, exam, test, or quiz by whatever factor the faculty member deems appropriate; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Fail the student on the particular assignment, exam, test, or quiz; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Reduce the grade earned by the student for the course; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>e. </Lbl>

<LBody>Fail the student for the course; </LBody>

<Figure>

<P>In all confirmed cases, the faculty member must submit an Incident/Referral </P>

<P>reporting Form via Webadvisor. </P>

<P>Evidence </P>

<P>Within two weeks of receipt of the reporting form, and on the basis of the evidence presented, the Associate Dean for Curriculum will determine the appropriate procedure for the disposition of the case and take one of the following actions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Dismiss the case if there is insufficient evidence. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Send a disciplinary warning letter to the student if evidence of dishonesty is uncovered and it is a first offense. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>c. Convene a hearing of the Academic Integrity Committee if it is a second or </P>

<P>subsequent offense. </P>

<P>The Academic Integrity Committee Hearing </P>

<P>The student is contacted in writing by the Associate Dean for Curriculum. </P>

<P>This notice will include the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Specification of charges. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Hearing date, time, and location. </LBody>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Invitation to submit a response to the charges in writing or to attend the hearing in person (or remotely via phone or computer). If attending the hearing in person, the student must also submit the names of persons, if any, who will attend the hearing with him or her. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The hearing should be presented in a forum where both parties have a fair opportunity to present whatever they contend is important. Every effort should </P>

<P>be made to avoid an adversarial confrontation. the institution is the complaining </P>

<P>party, not an individual professor, staff member, or student. These individuals may participate as witnesses, but they should not be cast in the role of prosecutor. Formal hearing procedures are designed to protect the student’s rights. </P>

<P>The following rules should be observed: </P>

<P>a. the institution should present its case. It has the burden of demonstrating that a rule or rules have been violated. the standard of proof should be clear and </P>

<P>convincing evidence. The other extremes – proof beyond a reasonable doubt or proof by a mere preponderance of evidence – should be avoided. One is not possible, and the other may not be fair. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>The accused student has a right to hear all the evidence and testimony considered by the Academic Integrity Committee. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>The accused student has a right to present evidence and testimony or to remain silent, with no inference of guilt being drawn from the silence. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>the student has a right to assistance in the preparation and presentation of </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>evidence and witnesses. </P>

<P>e. If a member of the Academic Integrity Committee is involved in the incident, he/ </P>

<P>she must recuse him/herself from the hearing process. </P>

<P>f. The Associate Dean for Curriculum will not attend the hearing or cast a vote </P>

<P>about actions to be taken. </P>

<P>Counsel </P>

<P>The accused is entitled to have the assistance of counsel, who may act as an advisor, during the hearing process, but the student must represent him/herself. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Counsel is limited to a single individual. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Counsel may be any member of the McKendree University community or a legal representative. If the student invites a legal representative, the university’s legal representative also will attend the hearing. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Records </P>

<P>A record of the hearing must be maintained. Such a record becomes extremely important in the event of an appeal. The physical evidence should be received by the Academic Integrity Committee and kept with copies of all documents related to the hearing. The simplest way to preserve the testimony is with a tape recorder. </P>

<P>the tape and evidence can then be passed along during the appeal process and is </P>

<P>available for use before the appellate body. </P>

<P>Possible Sanctions Following an Academic Integrity Committee Hearing </P>

<P>The Academic Integrity Committee may elect to impose any of the following sanctions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>A disciplinary warning letter from the Associate Dean for Curriculum. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Administrative removal from the class with an automatic “F” grade for the class. </LBody>

<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Academic probation for one full academic semester following the adjudication of the student as academically dishonest. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Suspension from the university for at least one full academic semester following the adjudication of the student as academically dishonest. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>e. </Lbl>

<LBody>Expulsion from the university. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>In the event that a student does not respond to the charges nor attend the hearing in person or remotely, any of these actions can be taken without the student present. </P>

<P>The Provost’s Office will notify the student in writing about actions taken by the Academic Integrity Committee. </P>

<P>Appeals </P>

<P>The Provost will consider appeals of sanctions imposed by the Academic Integrity Committee. The student must file an appeal in the Provost’s Office within one week after the student has received formal notification of actions taken and must indicate which of the following are grounds for the appeal. </P>

<P>a. Questions of Fact: An appellant may appeal on questions of fact by introducing new evidence which would significantly affect the outcome of the case. Evidence which was known to the appellant at the time of the original hearing, but was withheld, shall not constitute a question of fact, nor is it to be considered on </P>

<P>appeal. </P>

<P>b. Questions of Procedure: Appeals will be considered on the basis of question </P>

<P>of procedure. the appellant must demonstrate that procedural guidelines </P>

<P>established in this Academic Honesty Policy were breached, and that these errors affected the outcome of the case. </P>

<ImageData src=""/>
Academic Policies </Figure>

<P>c. Severity of Sanction: Appeals based on the severity of the sanction shall be considered only when the penalty imposed exceeds the recommended range </P>

<P>of sanctions for the specific violation as described in this document. the accused </P>

<P>can request leniency in cases where it is clearly demonstrable that the imposition of a sanction is inconsistent with previous judicial practice, even though it may be within the range of acceptable action. Mere dissatisfaction with the sanction </P>

<P>is not grounds for appeal. </P>

<P>After the student has filed an appropriate request for an appeal, the Provost may take any of the following actions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Deny the appeal, </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Change a finding of guilt to a finding of innocence, </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Modify the penalty, </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Order a new hearing to be held wherein new evidence, testimony, etc. not </LBody>
</LI>

<H4>Advising </H4>

<P>McKendree places the relationship between advisors and students at the heart of the university experience, and students seek the guidance of their advisors frequently as they plan course and career choices. However, the ultimate responsibility for proper completion of all academic requirements rests with the student, not the advisor. </P>

<P>Each student is assigned a faculty or staff advisor to provide guidance in developing a course plan that meets curriculum requirements and nurtures the student’s own interests and goals. </P>

<P>For first-year students, this advisor may or may not be from the field of a student’s declared interest; but as a major focus develops, students are assigned a new advisor from among faculty members in the appropriate division or school. </P>

<P>Students may also choose a particular faculty member from their division or school. A change of advisors is accomplished by completing the appropriate eform on the Office of Academic Records web page. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Attendance </H4>

<P>Each instructor has the responsibility of making clear to the students in writing what the attendance policy will be in each course. </P>

<P>Student Absences for Official University Functions </P>

<P>Students shall be excused without penalty from class to participate in official university sanctioned student activities, including intercollegiate athletic competitions, debate meets, band and choir performances, university field trips, and other events approved by the Provost. Students are not to be excused from class to </P>

<P>attend practices or conditioning sessions. </P>

<P>Faculty or staff in charge of such activities shall file with the Provost’s Office at least one week in advance, if possible, a list of students and dates they request the students to be excused from class. the Provost shall ensure that notification about approved student activities is communicated to the faculty in a timely manner. In addition, students must give satisfactory notice to their instructors prior to scheduled absences. </P>

<P>Students are responsible for all content and assignments missed while absent from class to attend university sanctioned student activities. Any deviation from this policy must be approved by the Provost. </P>

<P>VA Policy on Class Attendance </P>

<P>According to the “Veterans Education and Employment Assistance Act of 1976,” veterans who are absent from a class for an excessive amount of time must be reported for non-attendance to the Veterans Administration. The veteran’s last date of attendance is determined by the instructor’s roll book. </P>

<H4>Challenges to Academic Decisions </H4>

<P>Students who think that their work has been improperly evaluated or who think that they have been unfairly treated in any academic decision may use the following grievance procedures: </P>

<P>1. A student must first contact and hold a personal conference with the appropriate faculty member, administrator, or decision-making unit involved no later than twenty-one (21) calendar days after the first class day of the next semester (at the off-campus centers, ten (10) days after grades are received) to see if the </P>

<P>problem(s) can be resolved. </P>

<P>2. If the problem cannot be resolved through action 1, and if the student wishes to proceed further, he or she must submit a written explanation of the problem to the chair of the appropriate division or school, who will attempt to assist the student and the faculty member, administrator, or decision-making unit in bringing the problem to a satisfactory conclusion. If the chair of the division or </P>

<P>school is being named in the petition, the student shall proceed to step 3 of the </P>

<P>process. This step shall be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days following </P>

<P>the completion of step. </P>

<P>3. If the problem cannot be resolved through action 2, and if the student wishes to proceed further, he or she must submit a written petition to the Provost, who will attempt to assist the student, the faculty member, administrator, or decision-</P>

<P>making unit, and the chair of the division or school in bringing the problem to a </P>

<P>satisfactory conclusion. This step shall be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days following completion of step 1 and/or step 2 as appropriate. </P>

<P>4. If the problem cannot be resolved through action 3, and if the student wishes to proceed further, he or she must submit a written petition to the Undergraduate </P>

<P>Council through its chairperson, the associate dean for Curriculum. the student submitting the petition has a right to appear before the Committee, as does the </P>

<P>faculty member, administrator, or decision-making unit. The Undergraduate Council will designate the time and place for the meeting. The student has the </P>

<P>right of counsel at the hearing, including legal counsel, to act as an advisor, but the </P>

<P>student must represent himself/herself. (An education major appealing a matter pertaining to the teacher education program may, however, be represented by </P>

<P>legal counsel speaking on behalf of the student.) this step shall be completed </P>

<P>within thirty (30) calendar days following the completion of step 3. Records of these proceedings will be recorded as provided by the provisions stipulated in the McKendree University Student Handbook, section 2.00 Records. </P>

<P>A simple majority vote of the Undergraduate Council will constitute a decision. The voting will be by secret ballot. The Associate Dean for Curriculum, who serves </P>

<P>as Chairperson of the Undergraduate Council, chair of the division or school, and </P>

<P>any member of the Undergraduate Council who is named in the petition, shall not be entitled to vote on the matter. Parties involved in the dispute may not be in attendance whenever the Undergraduate Council discusses and votes on the complaint. Within five (5) calendar days of the meeting, the parties involved in the dispute shall receive written notification of the decision of the Undergraduate </P>

<P>Council. </P>

<P>Within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date that the parties involved are informed of the committee’s decision, either party may appeal the committee’s decision to the President of the university. The President has the authority to rule in favor of the appealing party or accept the committee’s decision. However, if the President decides to rule in favor of the appealing party, the President shall schedule a meeting with the Undergraduate Council to discuss the rationale for the ruling. The appealing party may be present at this meeting. This meeting shall take place before official notification of the President’s decision is provided in writing to the parties involved. Within fourteen (14) calendar days the President shall provide the parties involved with official notification of the decision. </P>

<P>Every effort shall be made to expedite and complete this process according to the time frames established by this policy. In all cases, students must await written response from the respective action step before proceeding to the next step. </P>

<H4>Credit for Prior Learning </H4>

<P>Credit is awarded for prior learning when such learning can be directly equated to specific subject areas that are regularly offered as part of the McKendree degree programs. The assessment processes described below are intended for use when </P>

<P>students claim prior college-level learning that cannot be credited through the </P>

<P>normal transfer process because it was not acquired in a college or university setting. These assessment processes, however, are not intended as a “credit for life experience” policy. McKendree does not award credit for life experience. Credit is given only for demonstrated, college-level learning in areas the faculty has judged </P>

<P>appropriate as elements of a McKendree education. </P>

<P>For most examinations, the faculty has approved the awarding of credit toward major and general education requirements, as well as elective credit. </P>

<P>Credit for approved training programs </P>

<P>Learning gained through military training and experience may be credited when the training experience for which the student seeks credit has been evaluated by the American Council on Education and listed in the Council’s Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experience in the Armed Services. Similarly, learning gained through training and experience in civilian work is creditable if it is listed by the Council’s </P>

<P>Program on non-Collegiate Sponsored Instruction (PonSI). McKendree also grants up to 32 hours of credit for successful completion of the Certified Professional </P>

<P>Secretary examination, provided that credit awarded for this certification is not duplicated by other academic credit the student may receive for study at McKendree or elsewhere. </P>

<P>Family Educational Rights and Privacy McKendree University Notification of Rights under FERPA  for Postsecondary Institutions </P>

<P>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights are: </P>

<P>1. The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the university receives a request for access. </P>

<P>Students should submit to the registrar, dean, or chair of the academic division </P>

<P>or school [or appropriate official] written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. </P>

<P>If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. </P>

<P>2. The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the university to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. </P>

<P>They should write the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or </P>

<P>misleading. </P>

<P>If the university decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the university will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. </P>

<P>3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. </P>

<P>– As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education’s FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records – including Social Security Number, grades, or other private information – may be accessed without the student’s consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller general, the U.S. </P>

<P>Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (“Federal and State Authorities”) may allow access to student records and PII without the student’s consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is “principally engaged in the provision of education,” such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to student education records and PII without the student’s consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such </P>

<P>research. Federal and State authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and </P>

<P>data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive PII, but </P>

<P>the authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, </P>

<P>in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without consent PII from a student’s education records, and they may track participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about students that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems. </P>

<P>4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA. </P>

<H4>Foreign Language Requirements </H4>

<P>Students pursuing a major that requires a foreign language must complete a minimum of two semesters of a single foreign language or equivalent. Transcripts from an institution of higher learning can be used to fulfill this requirement. Tests can also be used for that purpose and must follow McKendree’s Testing Policy. Please see the McKendree website for acceptable scores on appropriate examinations </P>

<P>(CleP, PeP, nln, aPt, IB, and danteS). If a student has earned credit for completing </P>

<P>an AP, CLEP, or DANTES exam, the student must request an official transcript be sent </P>

<P>to the McKendree office of academic records for evaluation purposes. Credit for </P>

<P>exams that appear on a high school or another institution’s transcript will not be accepted. Before taking a CLEP or DANTES exam, students currently enrolled at </P>

<P>McKendree must complete an application for transfer Credit form available via the </P>

<P>Office of Academic Records webpage. Note that students may still be required to take a placement test at McKendree if they need additional credits in their foreign </P>

<P>language. </P>

<P>If a student wishes to use course-work completed before enrollment at McKendree University in order to meet part of the foreign language requirement, the requirement may be completed by taking any needed additional hours in a different foreign language if the courses taken previously are in a language not offered at McKendree. The total semester hours (or the equivalent as stated above) of the requirement would in such a case remain the same, but the stipulation that the work be in a single foreign language would be waived for such a student. </P>

<P>College-level foreign language study showing a grade of C or better being </P>

<H4>Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) </H4>

<P>McKendree University is a participant in the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide agreement that allows transfer of the completed general education curriculum between participating institutions. Completion of the general education curriculum at any participating college or university in Illinois assures transferring students that general education requirements for an associate or bachelor’s degree have been satisfied. This agreement is in effect for students entering an associate or </P>

<P>baccalaureate degree-granting institution as a first-time student in summer 1998 and thereafter. </P>

<P>Students should be aware that individual colleges have specific courses within general classifications needed for satisfying requirements for graduation. In keeping with the McKendree University mission and its status as a liberal arts college, these requirements are the following: Literature (3 hours), Computer Literacy (3 hours), Philosophy or Religion (3 hours), Cross Cultural Studies (3 hours), and History (3 hours). Students must also take two writing intensive (W) courses. </P>

<P>Additionally, while McKendree will accept grades of D in transfer provided the student has completed the IAI core, certain majors require a grade of C or better. Courses that may fulfill a general education requirement under the IAI agreement will not satisfy the major requirement if a grade of D is earned and the student is pursuing those majors. </P>

<P>McKendree University strongly recommends that students use its general education curriculum as a guide when selecting courses in social science and fine arts. (See the general education curriculum requirements in this catalog.) Students seeking licensure in education should see state requirements listed under Education in this catalog. </P>

<H4>Transfer of Credit </H4>

<P>The general criteria by which McKendree University evaluates transfer courses presented for degree credit at McKendree are: (1) the educational quality of the sending institution and of the courses themselves; (2) the comparability of the credit and of the courses themselves to be transferred to McKendree; and (3) the appropriateness and applicability of the courses and credits in relation to programs offered at McKendree University. </P>

<P>In general, McKendree University accepts transfer courses from regionally </P>

<P>accredited institutions provided that these courses are intended to meet degree </P>

<P>requirements at the sending institution. In cases where the quality, comparability, or applicability of a course is in question, before rendering a decision on granting transfer credit, the University reserves the right to request additional information (see next paragraph). In cases where a student presents transfer work from institutions lacking regional accreditation the University requires the student to present convincing documentation about the quality, comparability, and applicability of the course(s) in question (see next paragraph). </P>

<P>The “additional information”or “convincing documentation”requested or required may include such items as a course syllabus, credentials of the faculty member, and/or a portfolio of work completed for the course. In evaluating the quality and comparability of a course applicable to a McKendree degree, factors such as the following will be considered: comparability of expected student outcomes for the course, evidence of comparable rigor, and the nature of the course experiences (e.g., reading, writing, and research requirements, laboratories, hands-on work, physical education activities). </P>

<P>All transfer credits must meet the following criteria: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>The student must have earned a grade equivalent to C or better (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) in every course requested for transfer. Courses taken pass/fail are not accepted in transfer. McKendree University does not give credit for life experience. </LBody>

<P>General education and other professional education requirements must also be met for licensure. Art class descriptions are listed above under the art major. All studio courses may be repeated for additional credit. </P>

<P>For a list of professional education program requirements,  see the secondary education section under “School of Education.” </P>

<P>Biochemistry (BCH) </P>

<P>Biochemistry is the study of life processes at the molecular level through structural </P>

<P>and functional relationships. Biochemical research provides insights into the deeper </P>

<P>understanding of living systems at the most fundamental level, and allows our culture to manipulate this knowledge towards the betterment of humanity. A strong background in biochemistry is of utmost importance to those students who go on to the medical and other health related fields. The biochemistry minor aims to prepare these students for their future careers through a well-balanced curriculum of interdisciplinary courses. </P>

<P>Students majoring in biology or chemistry may elect to have a minor in biochemistry by completing the following courses in addition to their major/degree/ track requirements. </P>

<P>Biology majors seeking a BS degree, general track, must complete CHE 205, CHE 206, BCH 303, BCH 310, and CHE 300 beyond their biology major requirements. Biology majors seeking a BS degree, pre-professional track, should complete CHE 205, CHE 206, CHE 300, BCH 310 beyond their biology major requirements. Biology majors seeking a BA degree must complete CHE 205, CHE 206, BCH 303, BCH 310, and CHE 300 in addition to their biology major requirements. If two minors (chemistry and biochemistry) are declared, the same course cannot be counted to satisfy the requirement for both minors. Chemistry majors must complete BIO 110, BCH 303, BCH 310, and BCH 313L beyond their chemistry major requirements. The same requirement regarding minimum cumulative grade point average apply to the major apply to the minor. </P>

<P>Creative Writing (ENG) </P>

<P>The creative writing minor benefits students who wish to develop their own voices of writers of poetry and/or fiction. Students pursuing a creative writing minor will undertake intensive study of the forms and techniques of writing genres, emerging as writers of poetry or fiction that shows increasing originality, interest, technique, and confidence. Through their coursework, students will gain greater understanding of the literary history and practices of poetry and fiction, while also learning to develop their own distinct writer’s voice by producing a body of work of their own. </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>
Courses of Study </Figure>

<P>Students enrolled in the creative writing minor will take courses that introduce them to the aesthetic standards by which poetry and fiction are read, written, and evaluated. Coursework in the minor includes study of the work of major writers of poetry and fiction; classes focusing on discussion, development, and improvement of student-written work; and classes that develop understanding of the forms and history of language, the writer’s medium. Students pursuing a creative writing minor must complete a senior thesis containing a substantial, polished sample of their own poetry or fiction. Students must earn a minimum cumulative G.P.A. of 2.25 in courses applied to the minor. </P>

<P>The creative writing minor promotes individual creativity while building strengths in writing, critical thinking, editing and revising, and sensitivity to language. While particularly beneficial to those who wish to pursue graduate study and careers as writers of poetry or fiction, the Creative writing minor is invaluable for students interested in pursuing careers in a variety of fields. Many employers value creative thinkers highly, and creative writing students find work in such fields areas as the fine arts, teaching, publishing, communications, and law. </P>

<P>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS: n Capstone: Seminar in English (ENG 490) n Foreign Language: Two semesters of college-level foreign language. </P>

<P>Mission: The mission of the English program is to offer a wide range of courses in literature and writing to prepare students for graduate study and careers in teaching </P>

<P>and other professions. </P>

<P>Description of Major: In an increasingly information-based economy, McKendree University’s English faculty teach students, both through its general education requirements and its English major, to read closely, think critically, and write well. As students pursue an English major, they develop a better understanding of the </P>

<P>cultural, historical, ethical, aesthetic, and linguistic dimensions that shape all of </P>

<P>us. Students refine their analytical and research skills as they learn to write with clarity, coherence, creativity, and precision. As the English major progresses from introductory surveys to its capstone course, students complete increasingly more challenging assignments and perform more in-depth analysis of literary texts and </P>

<P>genres. through class discussions, lectures, events and student groups such as Sigma tau </P>

<P>Delta and the Literary Interest Society, the English department faculty and students </P>

<P>strive to create and nourish a rich intellectual environment. In addition, publications such as the McKendree Review and Montage offer venues for students to publish their work. </P>

<P>To major in English a student must complete at least 24 credit hours of English courses at McKendree. At least 21 hours of the English major (literature and writing </P>

<P>track) must be taken from courses numbered 300 or above. </P>

<P>In addition to the courses required for the English/secondary education track, it is also recommended that students in secondary education take one or more journalism courses. In addition, it is recommended that secondary education English majors with an interest in teaching drama and theatre take Dramatic Literature and/ or any theatre (THE) course as electives as well as participate in the university’s theatre productions. General education and professional education requirements must also be met for licensure. These are listed in the section titled “Initial Secondary License” in the courses of study section of this catalog under Education. </P>
<Figure>

Courses of Study </Figure>

<P>Students who are considering graduate school in English should make an effort to take as many of the following courses as possible: ENG 303, ENG 304, ENG 311, ENG 317, ENG 318, and ENG 319. These courses should enhance students’ performance </P>

<P>on the english graduate record examination. Students should check the general education portion of the catalog to determine </P>

<P>which English courses will satisfy the general education literature requirement and the general education cross cultural requirement. </P>

<P>Division of Social Sciences </P>

<P>The ethnic studies minor complements McKendree’s more traditional liberal arts majors as well as its professional courses of study. This minor benefits students in professional programs seeking knowledge to enhance a selected career path just as much as students in traditional liberal arts contemplating graduate study in their fields. Students from all majors would thrive with an ethnic studies minor. Individuals who complete this program will gain comparative insight into how scholars from different disciplines-including history, religion, sociology, literature, writing, communication, and psychology-pose and answer questions about race and ethnicity. </P>

<P>Students who minor in ethnic studies will enroll in a variety of courses designed to help them understand the construction and functioning of ethnicity both in the United States and in a global context. By the end of their studies, students should be able to (a) analyze diverse ethnic communities in a sympathetic and even-handed manner; (b) explain how racial/ethnic heritage can influence the way people understand and relate to the world around them; (c) discuss the effects of racial or ethnic prejudice in American society, including their own lives; (d) function more effectively as citizens in our increasingly pluralistic society; and (e) relate more empathetically to people from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds. </P>

<P>To minor in ethnic studies: </P>

<P>Division of Social Sciences </P>

<P>The gender studies minor complements McKendree’s more traditional liberal arts majors as well as its professional courses of study. This minor benefits students in professional programs seeking knowledge to enhance a selected career path just as much as students in traditional liberal arts contemplating graduate study in their fields. Students from all majors would thrive with a gender studies minor. Individuals who complete this program will gain comparative insight into how scholars from different disciplines – including history, sociology, literature, writing, communication, and psychology – pose and answer questions about gender. </P>
<Figure>

<P>Students who minor in gender studies will enroll in a variety of courses designed to help them understand the multiple experiences and viewpoints of women and men in contemporary society and in history, the gendered constructions of power in America and in the world, the representations of gender in literature, and the psychology and sociology of gender. As a result of this focused study, students should be able to (a) describe the varied and complex relations among social ideology, social structures/hierarchies, gender roles, and sexuality in various cultures; </P>

<P>(b) identify the presence and effects of gender discrimination in the United States and other societies; (c) analyze cultural artifacts and texts using the interdisciplinary methods of gender criticism; (d) summarize the basic elements of a feminist critique of Western society, including its political implications; (e) evaluate various theories about the inherent similarities and differences among and between women and men; (f) recover the long-neglected history and viewpoints of women in various cultures around the world; and (g) relate more effectively to individuals of the other </P>

<P>Description of Major: The study of history is a solid preparation for life in an increasingly unpredictable modern world. Its study sharpens abilities to analyze and evaluate information critically, to interpret relationships, to translate ideas into different forms, to apply concepts to varying situations, to synthesize new </P>

<P>concepts from given information, and to evaluate alternate courses of action or </P>

<P>interpretations of historical data. A history major will develop strong writing and research capabilities, culminating in a major original research paper based on primary source materials. </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>Degree Preparation: History has proven to be an outstanding preparation for successful careers in law, teaching, business, writing, and other fields. Social science secondary education students who are interested in procuring a history concentration may pursue a Bachelor of Science in history education. This degree, while not as comprehensive as the traditional history major, will nevertheless enable the holder to compete for teaching positions within the state of Illinois, seek a variety of business and non-profit professional careers in which the traditional liberal arts are valued, and pursue graduate studies in history. </P>

<P>Description of Minor: The journalism minor provides students with the classroom and real-world experience to work as professional journalists. Despite radical transformations, writing and researching skills remain the two most important skills required to create excellent journalism and therefore why they lie at the heart of the minor. By selecting appropriate electives, students can create a deeper focus on particular skill and study areas. The minor’s core courses develop strong reporting and editing skills, as well as a solid understanding of media ethics and the legal issues that arise when covering the news. All journalism minors also receive training in media design. The required internship ensures that students practice journalism skills in a professional context. Involvement with the student newspaper, online radio outlet, university communications operations, and other on-campus media opportunities significantly broaden classroom-based learning. </P>

<P>While obtaining admission into law school is very competitive, McKendree University </P>

<P>has an excellent reputation preparing students for taking the lSat and for gaining </P>

<P>admission to prominent law schools. </P>

<P>No single major is required to gain admission into law school. However, law schools look for specific courses in political science, philosophy, sociology, and history on transcripts. Law schools also look for applicants with quantitative courses such as economics, business, mathematics, logic, and finance. Law schools expect excellent writing and research skills. </P>

<P>Law schools require applicants to complete a standardized test, the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). Logic and other courses that emphasize critical thinking will help performance on the lSat. </P>

<P>The Legal Studies minor complements many majors. This minor benefits students </P>

<P>in their future careers, graduate school aspirations, and personal development. </P>

<P>Students who minor in Legal Studies will enroll in a variety of courses designed to help them understand multiple perspectives and to give them courses that will help prepare them for law school or professions related to the law. </P>

<P>To minor in Legal Studies: </P>

<P>1. Complete 22 credit hours. Students must also earn a minimum cumulative gPa of </P>

<P>Mission: The mission of the McKendree University music faculty is to provide students with the skills to appreciate, to evaluate and to perform music from different eras of history and different cultures. Students will be expected to analyze music theoretically and to understand its historical significance. Students will then apply these skills in critiquing and evaluating their own and/or other artists’performances. The acquisition of these skills will enable students to be lifelong participants in </P>

<P>artistic, cultural and intellectual life. </P>

<P>Student Learning Outcomes </P>

<P>Students will: </P>

<P>•  Identify and analyze the elements of music: melody, rhythm, harmony, texture, </P>

<P>form and timbre/medium. </P>

<P>•  Recognize specific characteristics of music from different cultures and different </P>

<P>historical eras. </P>

<P>•  Perform collegiate repertoire with an understanding of instrument specific </P>

<P>performance practices. </P>

<P>•  Critique and evaluate performances of musical works. </P>

<P>Degree Preparation: the degree prepares students to enter graduate school in </P>

<P>performance, music history, music theory or music therapy. Music majors also may </P>

<P>choose to audition for positions in orchestras or bands, or open a private studio. </P>

<P>Philosophy (PHI) </P>

<P>n Major: 36 credit hours n Minor: 15 credit hours n Major/minor GPA required for graduation: 2.25 n All courses for the major/minor must be completed with a grade of a C-  </P>

<P>or better. </P>

<P>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS: n Complete two semesters of a single foreign language or equivalent n Capstone: Students complete a capstone experience, which includes an </P>

<P>independent Study focusing on the profession of philosophy in addition to </P>

<P>capstone activities such as leading discussions in 300-level courses. </P>

<P>Description of Major: Studying philosophy helps students confront in a methodical and constructive way fundamental questions and problems, both theoretical and practical, about themselves, their culture, and the natural world. Philosophy addresses the “big questions,”including: What is the meaning of life? What duties do we have to others? What makes a society or law just? Is faith compatible with reason? What is the relation of mind to brain? As the oldest and most basic of the liberal arts disciplines, philosophy provides a foundation for addressing such questions, but also </P>

<P>cultivates skills in reasoning and argumentation that are critical to graduate studies, </P>

<P>law school, employment, and, indeed, to being an informed and engaged citizen. </P>

<P>Majoring in philosophy allows students to develop familiarity with a basic intellectual vocabulary through which discussion of central questions has occurred, as well as an ability to recognize relationships between past philosophies and basic presuppositions of Western culture today. Philosophy also seeks to develop students’ ability to recognize philosophical issues and to assess critically the response of various thinkers to those issues, while developing empathic skills in entering the “mind set” of given thinkers. Majors will emerge with the tools for diagnosing their own intellectual presuppositions and those of their culture, thus moving them to develop and express their own careful thinking about central philosophical questions. </P>

<P>Student Learning Outcomes </P>

<P>Students will: </P>

<P>•  Develop the interpretive, critical, and argumentative skills necessary for academic </P>

<P>excellence, career success, and civil engagement. </P>

<P>•  Know the major figures, issues, and debates in the history of Western philosophy, </P>

<P>both ancient and modern. </P>

<P>•  Explain, analyze, and evaluate the ethical and social issues that inform our personal </P>

<P>and social lives. </P>

<P>•  Create a perspective from which students can synthesize all their studies and develop a sense of how philosophy bears on other disciplines. </P>

<P>Degree Preparation: The study of philosophy develops skills essential to success in future education and employment, including: critical thinking, evaluation and construction of sophisticated arguments, consideration of many different perspectives on a single subject, clear written communication on complex topics, and the ability to synthesize and organize complex information. Students majoring in philosophy often enter the fields of law, medicine, journalism, or business, in addition to pursuing graduate studies in philosophy itself. A major or minor in philosophy, in tandem with a major in a narrower professional field or other academic discipline, will serve the student well as career advancement comes to require flexibility of mind, and insight into the essentials of a situation, as well as analytical skills. </P>

<P>It is suggested that the student consider a major or minor in a second field. The following courses, many of which also fulfill core curriculum requirements, are suggested but not required for the major in philosophy: ART 210 and/or 211; ECO 211 and/or 212; HIS 161, 162; PSI 202; PSY 153; REL 320; SOC 149, 150, 407; SPC 210. </P>

<P>Within the Division of Science and Mathematics, we seek to provide a broad-based education that prepares graduates to be scientifically and mathematically literate, socially responsible, and professionally successful. </P>

<P>Within the program in physics, we have established the following goals for our graduates: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•  </Lbl>

<LBody>Content: Graduates should have a broad-based understanding of core physical science concepts as well as an understanding of concepts and techniques specific to their specialization. </LBody>
</LI>

</LI>
</L>

<P>their area of specialization. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•  </Lbl>

<LBody>Communication: Graduates should be able to access existing physical science knowledge and effectively communicate their own work to a broader community. </LBody>

<LI>
<Lbl>•  </Lbl>

<LBody>Professional Awareness: graduates should develop personal and professional goals, the tools to achieve these goals, and an understanding of professional responsibilities. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The foundations of physics can be traced back to the ancient Greeks (600–200 BC), who sought order within the physical events that were understood as either chaotic or mystical. The idea of atoms as the fundamental particles of matter had a major influence over much of the scientific investigation that occurred over the course of the next few millennia. </P>

<P>The laws of physics apply from the subatomic through the cosmic levels, an idea whose development can be traced through the history of the science. The contributions of Democritus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Planck, Curie, Hubble, Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Feynman, Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley provide insights to pivotal moments in our field. The physics of today is based upon the achievements of the past. Students should appreciate the significance of these accomplishments and teachers should foster this appreciation. </P>

<P>The Engineering Physics minor was designed to prepare students for study </P>

<P>in mechanical, civil, or electrical engineering. the curriculum develops a strong </P>

<P>foundation of mathematical analysis, scientific inquiry, and engineering design, to pose questions, seek answers, and develop solutions to complex problems. </P>

<P>To obtain a minor in engineering physics,  the student must complete the following courses. </P>

<P>Sport Psychology </P>

<P>Division of Social Sciences </P>

<P>Applied sport psychology is the study of the psychological and mental factors that influence and are influenced by participation and performance in sport, exercise, and physical activity. Applied sport psychology professionals are interested in how participation in sport, exercise, and physical activity may enhance personal development and well-being throughout the life span (information from the Association for Applied Sport Psychology website – AASP). </P>

<P>Although there are many specific concepts within applied sport psychology (e.g., stress management, teamwork, goal setting, concentration, relaxation, imagery), the general goal is to teach athletes the mental skills necessary to perform consistently in training and competition and to help them realize their potential as people and athletes. Sport psychology draws upon the following areas of research: health psychology, performance enhancement and intervention, and social psychology. </P>

<P>Sport psychology is a growing field as a number of elite, amateur, and professional athletes are currently working with applied sport psychology professionals. Coaches also seek sport psychology professionals to work with their teams. </P>

<P>The sport psychology minor would be beneficial to students interested in occupations such as exercise specialists, athletic trainers, youth sport directors, or coaching. Moreover, students interested in pursuing graduate study in psychology, education, physical education, or occupational therapy could benefit from this minor. </P>

<P>The sport psychology minor emphasizes current theoretical and applied research in the fast growing field of sport psychology. The courses are a combination of primarily psychology and physical education courses. Please note that some of the courses have prerequisites. For a course to be accepted toward a sport psychology minor, a grade of C- or better is required. </P>

<P>To minor in Sport Psychology: </P>

<P>1. Students must complete 20 credit hours and earn a minimum cumulative gPa of </P>

<P>2.25 in courses applied to the minor. </P>

<P>Requirements for Professional Educator Licensure </P>

<P>teacher education candidates completing an approved Illinois teacher education program qualify for a professional educator license by passing the Test of Academic Proficiency or achieving the minimum acceptable score on the ACT/SAT, passing the appropriate test(s) of subject matter knowledge, and the edTPA (EDU 499). each license shall be endorsed according to the approved program completed, the coursework presented, and/or the applicable examination(s) passed. A remediation plan will be individually developed for any candidate who has not passed one or more of the required tests. This plan will be developed by the candidate and advisor and may include, as examples, additional courses, tutoring, referral to the writing center, etc. Candidates who do not pass the tests are also advised to seek assistance through the McKendree Student Success and advising Center for the area(s) of the test with low scores. </P>

<P>Because McKendree University must meet the requirements issued by the Illinois State Board of Education and the Illinois State Preparation and Licensure Board, their requirements take precedence over the catalog of record for individuals seeking teacher licensure recommendation. A candidate must have earned a grade of “C” or better in all course work applied toward licenses/ endorsements. </P>

<P>All candidates for licensure are required to successfully pass state-mandated </P>

<P>examinations in basic skills, a content area, and the edtPa (edU 499) before licensure </P>

Instruction is conducted within the framework of an organized cadet corps with a progression of experiences designed to develop each student’s leadership potential. The first two years of the leadership laboratory include a study of Air Force customs and courtesies, drill and ceremonies, studying the environment of an Air Force officer; and learning about areas of opportunity available to commissioned officers. The last two years of the leadership laboratory involve planning and controlling of military activities of the cadet corps. LLAB is held at SLU on Wednesdays from 3:30-5:30 p.m. and is mandatory for all cadets in the AFROTC program. </P>

<P>Field training </P>

<P>Cadets in the program participate in two-four weeks of field training. Field training is offered during the summer months at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, usually between a student’s sophomore and junior years. Major areas of study include: Air Force Orientation, leadership evaluation, aircrew/aircraft orientation, survival training, base functions and physical training. No direct academic credit is awarded for Field </P>

<P>training. </P>

<P>note these courses are not offered at the McKendree campus, but at other sites. All MSC courses include a leadership laboratory once per week. </P>

<P>Army ROTC may be completed in several different ways as outlined below. </P>

<P>1. Four-year Option. Military Science is traditionally offered as a four-year option. It is best to start as a first year student, but special arrangements can be made for those who start as sophomores. The first two years of Military Science are voluntary without service obligation and are designed to give students a perspective on their leadership ability and what the Army can offer them. Students who decide to continue in ROTC and pursue a commission sign an agreement with the Department of the Army to accept a commission upon completion of the last two years of Military Science. In return, the Army agrees to provide a subsistence allowance (up to $3000) and to provide all necessary uniforms and Military </P>

<P>Science books. </P>

<P>2. Two-year Option. The two-year option is designed to provide greater flexibility in meeting the needs of students desiring commissions in the United States Army. McKendree students who do not participate in the four-year option or community college transfer students are eligible for enrollment. Basic prerequisites for the two-year option are as follows: </P>

<P>a. Students must be in good academic standing (minimum 2.0 gPa) and pass an </P>

<P>Army medical examination. </P>

<P>b. Students must have two academic years of study remaining (undergraduate or </P>

<P>graduate). </P>

<P>Undergraduate students must have junior status. </P>

<P>Students attend a six-week summer camp to obtain the knowledge acquired by students in the four-year option. Attendance at the basic camp DOES NOT obligate students in any way and is only intended to provide experience with Army life and its opportunities. Students earn up to 10 credit hours and are paid approximately $750 for attendance at basic camp. </P>

<P>Simultaneous membership </P>

<P>Students who qualify for simultaneous membership (members of the Army Reserve or National Guard) can complete the military science program in two years and earn more than $6,500 at the same time. Upon graduation, a student may request to stay in the reserve or select active duty. </P>

<P>career paths. </P>

<P>The exploratory studies program is designed to provide students who are undecided about a specific major a structured curricular plan that will enable them to take required general education courses and explore various career interests. exploratory studies is a program, not a major; thus, students may not graduate with an Exploratory Studies major. At some point, students must select a baccalaureate major leading to a degree. The Office of Career Services will work closely with students enrolled in the exploratory studies program to help them learn about various resources, including online career assessments and career counseling. </P>

<P>In addition to taking general education classes, students enrolled in the exploratory studies program will take one or more of the following courses: </P>
