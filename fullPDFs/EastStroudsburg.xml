<H3>History of the University </H3>

<P>East Stroudsburg University, a comprehensive university in northeastern Pennsylvania offering 57 undergraduate and 21 graduate degree programs, is one of the 14 institutions in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. </P>

<P>It opened its doors on September 4, 1893, as East Stroudsburg Normal School. A faculty of 15 greeted a group of 320 students who entered two-year programs in elementary and science education. </P>

<P>Although the Normal School was originally privately owned, ownership was transferred to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1920, and the name was changed to East Stroudsburg State Normal School. </P>

<P>In 1927, the right to confer the degrees of Bachelor of Science in education and Bachelor of Science in health education was granted, and the school became the State Teachers College at East Stroudsburg. </P>

<P>In 1960, the name was changed to East Stroudsburg State College, reflecting the addition of liberal arts and science curricula. </P>

<P>In November 1982, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education was authorized by Act 188 of 1982, and the college officially became East Stroudsburg University on July 1, 1983. </P>

<H3>History of Graduate Studies </H3>

<P>East Stroudsburg University inaugurated Graduate Studies in 1962 with three Master of Education (M.Ed.) programs: Biological Sciences, General Science, and Health and Physical Education. In 1969, the first Master of Arts (M.A.) programs, in History and Political Science, were approved. </P>

<P>Over the years, graduate programs in a variety of fields, including a Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) have been approved and offered. In 2001, ESU entered into a memorandum of understanding with Indiana University of Pennsylvania to offer the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Administration and Leadership Studies on campus. In 2004, three new Master of Science (M.S.) programs were added: Exercise Science, Management and Leadership, and Sport Management. Also in 2004, the M.S., Cardiac Rehabilitation was revised to the M.S., Clinical Exercise Physiology. In 2007, our first distance education graduate program, M.S., Athletic Training, was approved. In July 2009, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education approved a new M.S., Information Security, also to be offered online. Most recently, the university was approved to offer an M.A. in Professional and New Media Writing and a new Organizational Behavior concentration within the M.S. in Management and Leadership program.  In 2016, the university was approved to offer its first doctoral degree, an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership and Administration. </P>

<P>In its first graduating class of 1964, the university awarded 10 graduate degrees. Today, the university offers over 30 degree and certification programs. </P>

<H3>Guidelines for Determining Resident Status for Students </H3>

<P>(Title 22 Pennsylvania Code, Section 153.1) </P>

<P>A student is classified as a Pennsylvania resident for tuition purposes if the student has a Pennsylvania domicile. A domicile is the place where one intends to and does, in fact, permanently reside. Because this decision is subjective, documentary evidence must be submitted to the Student Enrollment Center for consideration. </P>

<P>Students who believe that they are qualified for in-state residency and those who would like to be made aware of the necessary factors to make such a transition should contact that office. Each case will be decided on the basis of all facts submitted with qualitative rather than quantitative emphasis in support of the intention of the student to reside indefinitely in Pennsylvania. </P>

<P>If the student is not satisfied with the decision made by the Student Enrollment Center in response to the challenge, the student may make a written appeal to the Office of the Chancellor, State System of Higher Education, Dixon University Center, 2986 North Second Street, Harrisburg, PA 17110. The decision on the challenge shall be final. </P>

<H3>Tuition Payment Plan </H3>

<P>ESU offers several installment plan options for you to break up your balance into smaller payments each month.  These plans offers a flexible method for paying educational expenses from current income through regularly scheduled payments. Please contact the Bursar's Office at billing@esu.edu for more information. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Student Loans </H3>

<P>The Student Enrollment Center, located in Zimbar-Liljenstein Hall, welcomes the opportunity to provide information and to assist students. The Financial Aid Office is located within this center. </P>

<P>Please call 570-422-2800 or 1-800-378-6732 to schedule an appointment. </P>

<P>Prospective graduate students should contact the Office of Financial Aid to discuss regulations and processes required in order to determine eligibility for loans and university student employment programs. </P>

<P>The Office of Financial Aid administers the federal educational loan programs available to graduate students. Applicants must complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students are encouraged to submit the FAFSA online at fafsa.ed.gov. Recipients must be enrolled in at least six credits of graduate-level class work and must maintain satisfactory academic progress (i.e. 3.0 Grade Point Average, 67% Pass Rate, Acceptable Completion Timeframe). </P>

<P>Graduate students enrolled in graduate-level course work, may borrow up to a maximum of $20,500 per year in an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan. Graduate students enrolled in undergraduate-level course work should contact the Student Enrollment Center to determine eligibility. Total borrowing amounts for the loan term, however, cannot exceed the cost of education less other financial assistance. </P>

<P>After your completed application is received and processed, information from the FAFSA will be electronically transmitted to ESU. The Financial Aid Office will determine your financial aid eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, your financial aid awards will appear on your online portal. If a Direct Loan has been offered, you will need to take action in order for a loan to be originated. Online you may accept the full amount, partial amount or choose to decline the loan. If you are a first-time borrower, you will be required to complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) and entrance counseling. These can be completed online at studentloans.gov. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Teacher Certification Students </H4>

<P>Students enrolled in a post-baccalaureate teacher certification program are eligible for Federal Direct Loans at the undergraduate level. </P>

<P>Students simultaneously enrolled in a master’s degree program and teacher certification should check with the Office of Student Financial Aid in the Student Enrollment Center regarding their eligibility for student loans. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Verification Requirements </H4>

<P>Verification is the process of comparing the data provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) with other requested documentation such as a tax transcript. Much of the selection process is random. However, some students are selected because the information on the FAFSA is inconsistent. </P>

<P>If a FAFSA is selected for verification the student will be sent instructions to begin the process, which can be completed online. If you have any questions or concerns about the verification process you can contact the Office of Student Financial Aid. </P>

<P>Once the verification process is complete the student's financial aid can be processed. Failure to complete the verification process may result in the cancellation of all federal financial aid, and will result in an outstanding balance on the student's account. Verification may also result in a revision to any aid awarded prior to the completion of the verification process. </P>

<H4>Payment of Financial Aid </H4>

<P>Financial aid awards are credited directly to the student’s university account each semester. Refunds from financial aid will not become available until the student’s university account is satisfied. Students should plan to arrive on campus with enough personal money to purchase books and pay any off-campus housing expenses. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy </H4>

<P>A student must maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) to continue to receive federal Title IV financial aid. Federal financial aid includes Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Direct Loans, and Graduate PLUS loans.  </P>

<P>Federal standards of SAP include maintaining a 3.0 Grade Point Average, completing 67% of all courses enrolled, and a maximum time frame measurement to ensure the graduate program is completed in a timely manner. If one of the measures is not being met, the student is not meeting the standards and will no longer be eligible for federal financial aid. All periods of enrollment are included whether or not the student received federal financial aid during that time. </P>

<P>SAP is measured at the end of each academic year, specifically the end of the Spring semester. Winter enrollment will be counted in your spring calculations. The option to submit a Financial Aid SAP Appeal is offered to students who experienced unforeseen and extenuating circumstances of which prevented them from being academically successful. This appeal submission requires documentation to support reason for appeal and must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid by the required deadline. </P>

<H4>Graduate Students </H4>

<P>A student must meet all of the following requirements in order to be making satisfactory academic progress for Title IV aid. </P>

<P>Qualitative Standard (GPA): </P>

<LBody>In addition to cumulative GPA requirements, graduate students in selected programs will not meet SAP requirements if they do not meet specific departmental standards related to “C” grades earned and/or clinical performance. At the end of each payment period (as identified above) the office of Graduate and Extended Studies will notify the Office of Student Financial Aid of any student in this circumstance. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Quantitative (Pace) Standard: </P>

<L>
<LI>

<LBody>Graduate students must complete a minimum percentage of attempted credits, Pass Rate. Students must maintain a minimum completion rate of 66.67%. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Pass Rate is calculated by dividing the cumulative credit hours earned by the cumulative credit hours attempted.  </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Maximum Time Frame: </P>

<P>• Graduate students must complete degree requirements without exceeding 150% of the credit hours required. For example, a student enrolled in a 30 credit hour program will no longer be able to use federal financial aid once he/she has attempted 45 credit hours. Retaking coursework or coursework not required for program completion will affect the total number of attempted credit hours.   </P>

<P>Program Completion: </P>

<P>Once the student completes all the academic requirements for his/her program, the student is considered to have completed the degree program and is no longer eligible for further federal aid for that program. </P>

<P>Students who fail to meet the GPA and Pass Rate standard at the end of the academic year will lose federal aid eligibility unless they successfully appeal and are placed on financial aid probation, with an academic plan. </P>

<P>Financial Aid Appeal Process/ Financial Aid Probation: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>If, at the end of the academic year, a student is not meeting SAP requirements, the student may submit an appeal based on extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances are personal illness or injury, a death of a close relative, or other special circumstances. The appeal must outline the reasons that satisfactory academic progress was not met, what has changed that will allow the minimum standards to be met at the next evaluation and how the student plans to improve their academic progress (i.e. academic plan). The reasons for being academically unsuccessful must be supported with documentation. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>If the appeal is approved by the financial aid office, the student will be placed on academic probation, with an academic plan, and will be eligible for federal financial aid during a financial aid probationary period. The student’s progress will be monitored to determine the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan. If the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan, the student will be eligible to receive federal aid as </LBody>

<P>• If the appeal is denied, the student will not be eligible for federal financial aid until he/she is meeting satisfactory academic progress standards (i.e. GPA, Pass Rate, Max Hours). </P>

<P>Students will be notified, in writing, by the East Stroudsburg University Office of Student Financial Aid if they have been approved for federal financial aid due to a successful SAP Appeal submission. </P>

<P>Academic Forgiveness</P>

<P>Graduate students do not qualify for Academic Forgiveness at this time. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Simultaneous Enrollment in Undergraduate and Graduate Classes </H4>

<P>ESU and the federal government use different rules and regulations to classify students as undergraduate or graduate. </P>

<P>If a graduate student enrolled in a graduate degree program takes six credit hours of undergraduate course work and only three credit hours of graduate course work, the student is considered an undergraduate student and is only eligible for the maximum amount of federal aid for undergraduate students. </P>

<P>There is a significant difference in the amount of federal loan aid available to an undergraduate student and a graduate student. Students who are classified as graduate students in fall and undergraduate students in spring may find that they are only eligible for a small fraction of the federal loan that they would be eligible for in spring if they were classified as graduate students. </P>

<H4>Grading System and Quality Points </H4>

<P>In addition to meeting course and credit requirements for graduation, students must maintain a specified academic level throughout a given curriculum as measured by quality points. The minimum number of quality points required for graduation is twice the number of credits attempted. Work completed at other colleges and accepted as transfer credit is not considered in computing the grade point average.  </P>

<LBody>Grade symbols are translated into quality points per credit as listed above. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>The university recognizes that a good grade in a 3-semester-hour course requires more work than in a 2-semester-hour course. Owing to this, the university follows a system which recognizes both the quality and quantity of a student's work.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Under this system, the number of quality points for each letter grade (e.g. four points for an “A”) is multiplied by the number of credits for the course. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>For example, an “A” in a three-semester-hour course earns a total of 12 quality points. To find out a student's quality point average, divide the total number of quality points by the total number of credits scheduled. This average considers both the quality and quantity of work. </LBody>

<H4>Incomplete Grades </H4>

<P>The maximum time for completing course requirements to remove incomplete grades is one year from the end of the session in which the “I” grade was assigned. After that time, the “I” grade will automatically be converted by the registrar to an “E,” “F,” or “U” based on the grade mode for the course. The student can then only earn credits for the course by registering for it again in another term. </P>

<P>If a student applies for graduation in a session before the one-year period has expired, the course requirements must be completed by the end of that session, or the I grade will be converted by the registrar to an “E,” “F,” or “U.” </P>

<P>A faculty member who chooses to deviate from this policy will require the student to sign a contract specifying conditions necessary for course completion, which may include a time period for completion of less than one year or other conditions. </P>

<H4>Office of Accessible Services Individualized for Students (OASIS) </H4>

<P>East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania believes that an individual’s access to opportunities for achievement and personal fulfillment must be determined solely on the basis of the person’s ability and interest. </P>

<P>OASIS at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania provides accommodations and services to students with documented disabilities (i.e., specific learning disabilities, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder, chronic illnesses, mobility impairments, deaf/hard of hearing, blind/low vision, psychiatric disabilities, traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities not specified) that result in substantial limitation of a major life activity. The faculty members in OASIS provide basic services and facilities accommodations for eligible students with disabilities who self-identify with a disability, provide appropriate supporting documentation and request services. </P>

<P>Students who request accommodations are responsible for initiating the process with OASIS and for requesting academic or environmental accommodations. OASIS asks that individuals requesting services (accommodations and/or access) complete the self-disclosure and request for services form, including a description of the student’s disability, the disability’s likely impact on your educational experiences and the successful use of accommodations in the past. These forms are available online at the Office of Accessible Services Individualized for Students (OASIS). </P>

<P>Academic accommodations allow equal access to academic programs and include classroom and assessment accommodations, and are based on the evaluation process, a student’s course of study and current functional limitations. The evaluation process includes a review of the self-disclosure and request form, supporting documentation, an interview with the student, and the assessment of the student’s program of study during the first semester the student requests services. In order to fully evaluate requests for accommodations or adjustments, East Stroudsburg University requests supporting documentation, which can be valuable in the deliberative process of providing accommodations and/or access to the educational environment. Supporting documentation can include medical records, psycho-educational testing, school records that specify the impact the disability has on physical, perceptual, cognitive, and behavioral activities, and/or past records of accommodations and services. </P>

<P>Intake interviews usually occur during the first semester the individual with a disability requests services and attends classes. During this interview, accommodations and assistive technology needs are determined. The Office of Disabilities Services also provides an Assistive Technologist, who is available to instruct students in various assistive technologies to help students with their academic studies. After the interview meeting with the faculty member in the Office of Disability Services, the student is given a letter of accommodation listing the academic accommodations and/or assistive technology the student is entitled to use for each class. The student is responsible to provide a copy of this letter of accommodation to the professor of each class at the beginning of the semester. Some frequently used academic accommodations and assistive technology devices include, but are not limited to: </P>

<P>Clinical Education Plan </P>

<P>The Graduate PPP places equal emphasis on both the coursework and clinical fieldwork aspects of students’ education. The clinical fieldwork is a critical EDUCATIONAL requirement of the ATEP. Clinical fieldwork is where students learn to apply and refine the knowledge and skills they learn in their coursework. More importantly, clinical fieldwork is where they integrate all phases of Athletic training knowledge, skills, abilities and values to become competent practitioners. It is where students make the transition to clinical practice, develop a practice style and ultimately embrace the culture of the profession. </P>

<P>Clinical education will follow a logical progression that allows for increasing amounts of clinically supervised responsibility leading to autonomous practice upon graduation. The clinical education plan outlines the sequence of formal instruction and will provide students with authentic, real-time opportunities to practice and integrate athletic training (AT) knowledge, skills, and clinical abilities, including decision-making and professional behaviors required of the profession in order to develop proficiency as an Athletic Trainer. </P>

<P>Clinical education will allow the athletic training student (ATS) the opportunities to practice with different patient populations, health care providers, and in various health care settings relative to the ESU-Graduate Professional Practical Program (PPP) mission statement. Students enrolled in this program will be directly supervised by a clinical preceptor who will assist the student in their efforts to integrate theory into practice.  </P>

<P>Athletic Training Professional Organization </P>

<P>The National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) is the professional membership association for certified athletic trainers. Founded in 1950, the NATA has grown to more than 30,000 members worldwide today. </P>

<P>The Eastern Athletic Trainers' Association (EATA) formed in January 1949 when a few athletic trainers in the northeast decided to gather and share information. Today, the EATA encompasses all members of the National Athletic Trainers' Association who reside in either District I or District II. The Pennsylvania Athletic Trainers' Society (PATS) is a progressive organization of health care professionals who work under the direction of a licensed physician. </P>

<P>Certified athletic trainers working in the Commonwealth protect and enhance the health and welfare of our clients through prevention, recognition, management, and rehabilitation of injuries. </P>
