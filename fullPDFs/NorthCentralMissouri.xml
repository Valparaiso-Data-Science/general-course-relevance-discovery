<H2>NCMC History </H2>

<P>North Central Missouri College is located in a community that has long valued the benefits of higher education. College opportunities have been a tradition in Grundy County for more than 130 years. </P>

<P>Grand River College, organized in 1850, was the first school west of the Mississippi to open its doors to women. The second institution, Trenton College, opened in 1867 followed by Avalon College, which came to Trenton in 1890. Ruskin College, organized by Walter Vrooman (from England), became the center of a socialistic educational experiment. These early institutions are now defunct. </P>

<P>North Central Missouri College, formerly Trenton Junior College, was founded in 1925 and is the second oldest publicly supported community college in Missouri. In the beginning, it was located on the top floor of Trenton High School in a building located on East Ninth Street in Trenton. The College shared facilities, administration and staff with the high school until the facility became overcrowded. In 1967, the College moved to its present location in the former Central School Building on Main Street. In 2007, land was officially given to the College to establish a second campus with an emphasis in Agriculture and Natural Resources. </P>

<P>Trenton Junior College officially became an independent entity by action of the voters at a municipal election in April 1986; in July 1988, the College’s name was changed to North Central Missouri College. </P>

Anyone--parents, grandparents, relatives, employers or friends--can open a MO$T account for a beneficiary with as little as $25 (or $15 through payroll deduction). MO$T provides an added incentive by allowing up to $8,000 in total contributions to be deducted annually from an individual’s Missouri adjusted gross income for state tax purposes. All earnings on the contributions are exempt from state taxes if used to pay the beneficiary’s qualified postsecondary education expenses, and federal taxes on the earnings are deferred until the money is withdrawn. </P>

<P>The MO$T Program is managed by TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing, Inc., a nationally recognized financial services firm, under the direction of the MO$T Program Board and the Office of the State Treasurer. Additional information about the MO$T Program can be obtained by calling (888) 414-MOST or by visiting the program’s website at

<Sect>
<H3>Course Load </H3>

<P>Each course offered for college credit is assigned a specific credit hour value. The normal load for a full-time student is 15 to 18 credit hours in a regular semester. </P>

<P>Enrollment in a minimum of 6 credit hours per semester is considered half-time, 9 credit hours is three-quarter time, and 12 credit hours is full-time. Enrollment in more than 18 credit hours per semester is considered an overload and should be carefully considered with other obligations. A general recommendation for success is that students spend two hours studying outside of class for every one hour spent in the classroom. </P>

<P>International students must maintain enrollment in a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester. Any decrease, through drops or withdrawals, must be approved by the Primary Designated SEVIS Officer,

<H3>Class Attendance </H3>

<P>Each instructor may set his or her own standards relative to attendance as it pertains to the grade received. Students are encouraged to attend all class sessions of the courses in which they are enrolled and respond to all online class assignments. Absences reduce the value of the learning experience and also reduce the probability of passing the course successfully. </P>

<P>Students who stop attending, with unexcused absences, will be reported to the Financial Aid Office. Federal financial aid awards may be adversely affected by non-attendance. </P>

<P>Federal government regulations require that international students attend a minimum percentage of class sessions for all enrolled classes. VISA status may be negatively affected by failure to attend. </P>

<P>Students attending college-sponsored events are excused from class and should not be counted absent. In this case, it is the student’s responsibility to inform their instructor as to when they will miss class in advance of the event (1 week in advance, whenever possible). If an assignment is due, the student must submit the work prior to the absence. If there is a quiz or test on the day of the absence, the student must make arrangements with the instructor to complete the work before the absence or at a time designated by the instructor. </P>

<H3>Grade Point Average </H3>

<P>Grade point average (GPA) is the standard term used to describe a student’s overall academic level. Only letter grades of A, B, C, D, and F factor into the grade point average noted on the NCMC transcript. However, P and X grades are factored into the GPA used for financial aid eligibility. To compute the GPA, use the following formula and grade quality points: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0. </P>

<P>the total number of GPA credits. Transferred credit is not used to calculate the NCMC grade point average. Athletic eligibility is calculated using NJCAA guidelines and with an assigned grade point value of 2.00 for any grade of “P”. Graduation requirements for the Associate in Arts in Teaching Degree include a minimum GPA calculated on all college credit, regardless of originating institution. </P>

<P>Grades are available approximately one week after the end of the academic term. Students may access grades through the myCOMPASS portal, accessible from the NCMC website. Academic transcripts will not be released for students with outstanding financial obligations to the College. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Auditing a Class </H3>

<P>A class auditor is a student registered for a course for informational instruction only, not to earn credit. An audit must be declared in the Registrar’s Office by the student prior to the end of the Add/Drop period for the semester. Tuition and fees for audited classes are the same as for those taken for credit. A grade of “AU” -Audit will be placed on the student’s transcript. Financial aid is not available for audited classes. Auditing students are expected to attend the class, but are not required to take examinations or do assignments required of regularly enrolled students. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Incomplete Grades </H3>

<P>Under extreme circumstances, a student may apply for an incomplete grade prior to the final week of a term. An incomplete grade may be given, at the discretion of the instructor, when accident, illness, death in the immediate family, or other documented circumstances beyond the student’s control prevent the student from completing some course requirements. An incomplete grade should only be considered when 80% of the course requirements have been satisfied with a grade of“C” and attendance has been maintained. Course work must be completed within eight weeks of the first day of the term immediately following the term in which the incomplete was received; otherwise, the grade will be recorded as “F”. No extension of time beyond the allotted 8 weeks will be permitted. The application for </P>

<P>an incomplete grade is available in the Registrar’s </P>

<P>Office. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Pass/Fail Grading </H3>

<P>Developmental and some college skill classes at North Central Missouri College are graded with “P”-Pass or “X”-Fail grades. Credits earned in courses that are stipulated in the catalog as being graded on a Pass/Fail basis will not be used in computing a student’s grade point average, with the exception of athletic eligibility and satisfactory academic progress for financial aid. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Repeated Courses </H3>

<P>Students may receive credit value for a repeated course only once, unless the published course description notes otherwise. Repetition of coursework may have a negative impact on financial aid eligibility. </P>

<P> Courses used to meet requirements for a previously conferred degree or certificate may not be repeated. </P>

<P> Grades for transferred-in credit do not override grades earned from NCMC. </P>

<P> Students may repeat a course in which a grade of“C” or lower was earned, provided they have not completed a higher level course with a grade of “A” or “B” that required the first </P>

<P>course as a pre-requisite. </P>

<P> Recorded grades will not be removed from the student transcript, but only the last grade earned will be used when computing the cumulative grade point average. </P>

<P> Coursework in the PN and PN to ADN </P>

<P>programs may be repeated, regardless of the </P>

<P>first grade earned, when the last enrollment </P>

<P>in the course was at least five years prior to </P>

<P>the repeat term, and the student has not </P>

<P>used the credit to meet requirements for a </P>

<P>previously conferred degree or certificate. </P>

<P>Courses with recorded grades of “A” or “B” may be repeated, for informational purposes only, by declaring an audit at the time of enrollment. In the case of an audit, the student does not receive credit or a grade for the course. The first grade earned in the class remains in the grade point calculation. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Grade Disputes and Appeal Process Grade Disputes During a Semester </H3>

<P>Faculty members and students should communicate regularly and openly about all grading issues. A student who is dissatisfied with an instructor’s grading decision during a semester should discuss the issue with the instructor and attempt to resolve the matter informally as soon as possible. A student who believes that a grading issue has not been satisfactorily resolved should speak with the Dean or Program Director about the matter. The Dean or Director will work with both the student and the instructor to address the issue. </P>

<P>Students may not file a formal course grade appeal during the semester. Grading issues that remain unresolved during the semester may become the basis for a formal course grade appeal once the semester has ended and a final course grade has been assigned. The formal process may be used only for grading issues that impact the final course grade. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Disputes Regarding Final Course Grades </H3>

<P>A student who is dissatisfied with a grading decision must attempt to resolve the matter by contacting the instructor immediately. If the instructor is unavailable, the student may wish to contact the Dean or Program Director within ten business days of receiving the final grade to facilitate communication between the student and the instructor and to help resolve the dispute. </P>

<H3>Grade Appeals </H3>

<P>Students wanting to appeal a grade must contact their instructor within ten (10) business days after the end of the semester for which the grade was given using their pirate email account. </P>

<P>The deadline for the final ruling of the grade appeal cannot exceed the term following the completion of the course for which the grade is being considered. A student who is dissatisfied with an instructor’s final course grade decision should adhere to the following steps: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Discuss the concern or issue with the instructor. THIS IS ALWAYS THE FIRST STEP to the appeals process. If resolution is not achieved after meeting with the instructor, move to step #2. </LBody>

<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>File a formal grade appeal by emailing the reason for the appeal using the student pirate account to the Dean or Program within ten (10) business days of meeting with faculty member. Receipt of the formal grade appeal form and supporting documentation will result in initiation of an investigative process by the appropriate Dean or Director. The appropriate Dean/Director will respond, in writing, to the student within ten (10) business days of receipt of the appeal circumstances. If resolution is not achieved through the Dean/Director, move to step #3. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>A formal appeal may be made in writing by the student to the Vice President of Academic Affairs within ten (10) business days of receiving the Dean’s decision. Upon receipt of the formal appeal, the Vice President will initiate an investigative process which will result in a written response to the student within ten (10) business days of receipt of the formal appeal. If resolution is not achieved, move to step #4. </LBody>
</LI>

<Sect>
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>If not satisfied with the Vice President’s decision, the student may request through their pirate email, within ten (10) business days of the Vice President’s decision, to move to the next step. At this time a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will be formed to review the appeal. The request to appeal to the panel will be handled by the Vice President. The panel review will be scheduled as soon as possible with a decision being rendered and communicated in writing to the student within ten (10) working days of the panel review. If resolution is not achieved, move to step #5 </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Either party involved in the grade appeal process has a right to appeal to the President of the College within ten (10) business days of receiving the panel’s decision. The President will review the appeals and conduct whatever investigation he/she deems appropriate. The President determines the final outcome of the appeals and will communicate such in writing to the student, faculty, Vice President of Academic Affairs and the appropriate Dean/Director. In all cases, the decision of the President is final. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Administrative Final Course Grade Appeal Procedure </P>

<P>A. Informal Resolution Upon receipt of a Student Final Course Grade Appeal Form, the Dean or Director will contact both the student and the instructor involved to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If the instructor is no longer with the college, the Dean/Director shall appoint another </P>

<P>instructor to represent faculty interests in the appeal. The faculty member representing the absent </P>

<P>instructor shall act as a good faith representative of the faculty whose goal is to resolve the grading dispute fairly. The instructor may agree to resolve the dispute informally if he or she believes it is appropriate. For example, if the dispute involves a computational or clerical error and the instructor representing the absent faculty member agrees with the student, he or she may simply sign the Change of Grade Form to change the grade rather than begin the process of a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel to resolve the issue. </P>

<P>B. Dean’sResponse If the dispute is not resolved informally within ten (10) business days from the student-instructor meeting, the student will communicate, in writing, to the appropriate </P>

<P>Dean/Director the desire to continue the appeal process. The Dean/Director will make the instructor aware of the appeal and ask the instructor involved to prepare a written response to the appeal. The instructor’s response should include the following: </P>

<P> A copy of the course syllabus. </P>

<P> A copy of any relevant graded assignments that had not been returned to the student. </P>

<P> A written statement responding to the issues raised by the student. </P>

<P> Any other documents the instructor believes are relevant to the resolution of the course grade appeal. </P>

<P> The Dean/Director should continue to pursue an informal resolution to the dispute if he or she believes that a resolution is possible. The Dean/Director may share the instructor’s response with the student in hopes of finding common ground between the two. The Dean/Director may wish to give the student the opportunity to address issues raised in the instructor’s response that the student has not previously addressed. </P>

<P> The Dean/Director may meet with the student and instructor individually and offer a decision, in writing, within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request to continue the appeal process. If the student is not satisfied with the Dean/Director’s decision, he/she may request in writing, to the appropriate Dean, within ten (10) business days of the Dean’s decision that the appeal be forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. </P>

<P>C. Vice President of Academic Affairs The Vice President of Academic Affairs will review the documentation from the student, faculty, and Dean/Director. The Vice President may meet with the student, faculty member, Dean/Director to review the appeal and circumstances. The Vice President of Academic Affairs will offer a decision within ten (10) business days of receipt of the appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the Vice President’s decision he/she may request, in writing, within ten business days of receipt of the Vice President’s decision, request the </P>

<P>appeal be forwarded to a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>D. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel The Vice President of Academic Affairs shall appoint a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel to consider the appeal. The Panel shall consist of a minimum of three members: a division chair, at least one full-time faculty member (the student may choose the full-time faculty member), and the Vice President of Academic Affairs and/or the Dean. The instructor involved in the grade dispute is not eligible to serve on the Panel. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel is responsible </P>

<P>for ensuring that the grade appeal process is completed before the end of the subsequent semester. The Vice President of Academic Affairs is responsible for ensuring that the instructor and the student have at least ten </P>

<P>(10) business days advance notice of the time and location for appearing before the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel if they requested an appearance. </P>

<P>The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel is responsible for determining the facts in the dispute and making a judgment on the merits of the course grade appeal. The Panel shall review the materials submitted both by the student and the instructor. The Panel may request any other information it deems necessary, including additional instructor records and input from third parties. </P>

<P>Both the student and the instructor have the right to request the opportunity to appear in person before the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel if they so choose. If both parties appear before the Panel, they should be heard separately. If neither party requests to appear in person, the Panel should complete its review based on the written materials supplied by the parties and whatever other information the Panel may request. The Panel’s deliberations, including hearing testimony from the parties involved and third parties, shall take place in private. </P>

<P>The student has the burden of proof. The student must present clear evidence that a final grade was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error. </P>

<P>Once the members of the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel have determined that they have sufficient information to make a decision, they will vote either to grant or reject the grade appeal. A simple majority is sufficient to decide the issue. If the Panel grants the appeal, the panel will determine the appropriate course grade for the student. A member of the Panel shall prepare a written report stating the Panel’s decision and the justification for that decision. Copies of the report must be conveyed to the student, the instructor, and the Vice President of Academic Affairs. If the Panel determines that the student’s grade shall be changed, the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will prepare a Change of Grade Form and submit it to the Vice President of Academic Affairs with the Panel report attached. The stated reason for the change of grade will be “the recommendation of a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel.” The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will sign the form instead of the course instructor. </P>

<P>Sometimes a course grade appeal raises issues that go beyond the resolution of grading issues. These issues could include questions about compliance with ADA guidelines, concerns about an instructor following NCMC policies, or questions of a student’s academic integrity. At the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel’s discretion, they may prepare a supplementary report addressing those issues and present it to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. </P>

<P>E. Appealing the Panel’s Decision Either party involved in the grade appeal process has a right to appeal to the President of the college within ten (10) business days of receiving the panel’s decision. The President will review the appeal and conduct whatever investigation he or she deems appropriate. </P>

<H3>Academic Forgiveness </H3>

<P>Occasionally, due to overwhelming or unavoidable circumstances, a student earns grades that are not representative of his or her abilities. The Academic Forgiveness Policy is an appeals procedure that allows a student, who has returned to North Central Missouri College after a minimum five-year absence, to request removal of grades for one semester from the cumulative grade point average shown on their official academic record. </P>

<P> Forgiveness may be requested one time, for one semester only. </P>

<P> Forgiveness will not be considered for students with outstanding financial obligations to the college. </P>

<P> Forgiveness applies to all classes in the semester chosen, regardless of grades. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P> Forgiveness may not be requested for any semester including courses used to complete an awarded degree or certificate. </P>

<P> Student must have been absent from the institution for a minimum of five years since the semester to be forgiven. </P>

<P> Forgiveness will not be granted until at least 12 credit hours, with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00, have been earned upon re-enrollment at NCMC. </P>

<P> Grades in forgiven courses are removed from the cumulative GPA at NCMC, but courses and grades remain on the student transcript with a special forgiveness designation </P>

<P> All grades, whether forgiven at NCMC or not, may apply when transferring to another institution. Policies at the receiving institution apply. </P>

<P> Academic forgiveness does not automatically satisfy academic progress standards for financial aid purposes. </P>

<H3>General Transfer Policy </H3>

<P>NCMC considers the “transferability” between colleges and universities as a matter of considerable importance and practice. NCMC also believes the relationship between and among academic disciplines and between levels of coursework must be clear. NCMC strives to assist students in making progress toward their educational objectives without unnecessary disruption or duplication of coursework. </P>

<P>An articulation agreement is a formal arrangement for transfer of a defined set of academic credits between an academic program at NCMC and a program at another college or university. Transfer guidelines facilitate cooperation between colleges and universities for the purpose of accommodating the needs and interests of students who earn credit at one institution and choose to transfer to another. Successful transfer minimizes loss of time and duplication for students and optimizes the use of institutional resources. NCMC transfer policies recognize that each college and university has a separate and distinct mission and that each has the responsibility to establish and maintain academic quality within that mission. Underlying the policy is an attitude of mutual respect and cooperation among the institutions and recognition that the primary objective of articulation agreements is to benefit students. </P>

<P>North Central Missouri College maintains a list of established articulation agreements with other institutions for the transfer of the Associate in Arts, Associate in Arts in Teaching, and Associate in Applied Science degrees, available on the NCMC website. </P>

<H3>Transferring Credit to NCMC </H3>

<P>The Missouri Higher Education Core Transfer Curriculum is a recommended lower-division core curriculum of forty-two semester credit hours intended to facilitate student transfer among </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Missouri’s public institutions of higher education. All </P>

<P>public colleges and universities have adopted the Core Transfer Curriculum, which is commonly known as CORE 42. </P>

<P>CORE 42 is comprised of dozens of courses distributed across five knowledge areas. These courses are designated with a Missouri Transfer (MOTR) course number and icon, which guarantees the one-to-one transfer of these courses among all Missouri public institutions of higher education. </P>

<P>NCMC accepts credit earned from institutions accredited by agencies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. All courses designated as MOTR courses by sending institutions will be accepted in transfer. Courses outside the designated Missouri Transfer Core Curriculum will be accepted in transfer when the courses are: </P>

<P> Lower division, credit-bearing courses equal in </P>

<P>content to current NCMC coursework.  Lower division, credit-bearing courses with a grade </P>

<P>of “D” or higher. Coursework from institutions on a quarter hour system will be converted to semester hours using a two-thirds conversion factor for transfer to NCMC. </P>

<P>Transferred-in credit is not used to calculate a student’s grade point average for academic standing at NCMC. All grades, including any received from other higher education institutions, will be considered for athletic eligibility and used to calculate the cumulative grade point average required for graduates in the Associate in Arts in Teaching program. Transfer course equivalencies for many institutions can be found on the 
<Link>Course Equivalency </Link>
page of the NCMC website, under Degrees &amp; Academics/Academic Records/Transfer Coursework. </P>

<H4>Transfer Limitations </H4>

<P>There are some courses that are not accepted in transfer to NCMC. These include: </P>

<P> Career &amp; Technical Education (CTE) courses not </P>

<P>equivalent to content and/or level of NCMC </P>

<P>courses. </P>

<P> Courses with upper-division level course numbers </P>

<H4>Foreign College and University Credit </H4>

<P>North Central Missouri College staff does not evaluate foreign transcripts. Students seeking credit must have their foreign transcripts evaluated by a foreign transcript evaluation service, nationally accredited in the United States, and submit an official copy of the results to the NCMC Registrar’s Office. Credit may be granted for foreign coursework based on the results of such evaluations if substantially similar to courses offered by NCMC. The same requirements and limitations apply to foreign credit as those applicable to credit earned at U.S. colleges and universities. </P>

<H3>Credit for Prior Learning (CPL) </H3>

<P>North Central Missouri College believes that learning is a lifelong process and recognizes knowledge is acquired in many different ways. In addition to the traditional classroom setting, mastery of college-level knowledge and skills may occur as a result of nontraditional learning experiences such as employment, military training and experience, non-collegiate training programs, advanced high school courses, and self-development. NCMC awards credit for measurable college-level learning which includes knowledge, skills and competencies that students have obtained as a result of their prior learning experiences. College credit may be granted on a caseby-case basis for prior learning that can be documented and is equal to learning outcomes of NCMC regular credit course offerings. Application for credit for prior learning (CPL) must be approved prior to course enrollment, regardless of method or type of prior learning. All mandatory institutional requirements for certificates and degree programs must be met and individuals are only eligible for prior learning credit once officially accepted as an NCMC student. Missouri state law limits the number of credits that can be awarded for prior learning to a total of 30 credit hours. A maximum of 50% of courses required in a certificate or degree program will be awarded for prior learning, institutional or national examinations, and articulated credit. Please note that there may be financial aid implications as it relates to credit for prior learning. Please visit with the Financial Aid Office for further details. Credit granted through one of the CPL options may be used to fulfill NCMC program requirements, however transferability to other institutions is at the discretion of the receiving institution. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>

<H3>Graduation Requirements </H3>

<P>Graduation requirements for each degree and certificate program are outlined in the Programs of Study section of this catalog.

Continuous enrollment for this purpose is defined as the successful completion of at least three credit hours in at least two of the three terms per academic year in the program of study. </P>

<P>Students who do not maintain continuous enrollment in the program of study will lose the right to use the original catalog requirements and must use the catalog in force at the time of re-enrollment, program change, or application for degree completion. Candidates for graduation also have the option of selecting the current catalog (in force at the time an application for graduation is submitted) in order to fulfill program requirements. </P>

<P>Programs may occasionally be made inactive or eliminated at NCMC. Students enrolled in a program at the time it is made inactive may complete degree requirements and graduate in the program as long as the following criteria are met: </P>

<P> Continuous enrollment is maintained in a program of study </P>

<P> A minimum of 25% of the total credit hours </P>

<P>required for the program have been earned </P>

<P>when the program is inactivated </P>

<P> Career and technical coursework can be </P>

<P>made available by arrangement </P>

<P> All degree requirements are met within six </P>

<P>semesters of program elimination Graduation requirements can be met through a combination of NCMC courses, transfer credit and credit obtained through nontraditional means, however a minimum of 25% of the credit hours required in the certificate or degree must be earned through traditional means at North Central Missouri College. A maximum of 50% of the required credit hours may be earned through non-traditional means (refer to Credit for Prior Learning section). Students who are planning to transfer credit back to NCMC to complete degree requirements should complete the Application of Transfer Credit for Degree Completion form, available in the Registrar’s Office, on the myCOMPASS portal, and on the college website, during the last semester at NCMC. The transfer of credit must occur within one year from students’ last enrollment at NCMC. All other graduation requirements must be met. </P>

<P>All degrees and certificates require a minimum cumulative grade point average. Some programs of study have additional graduation requirements. </P>

<H3>Residence Life </H3>

<P>Living on campus opens up a new world of opportunities for fun, personal growth and leadership development. NCMC offers on-campus living facilities for both men (Ellsworth Hall) and women (Selby Hall). A full-service meal plan is part of the housing agreement. </P>

<P>Students’ rooms feature bunk beds, wardrobe, sink, mirror, dresser and desk. High speed wireless Internet access and expanded basic cable are provided in each room. NCMC’s residence halls include handicapped accessible rooms, 24-hour computer labs, a common area land line for local/calling card calls and 9-1-1 calls, a laundry area, TV in the lobby, mailboxes, vending machines and easy access to parking. </P>

<P>There are many advantages for students living on-campus, including access and academic success! Research shows that students who live on-campus are more likely to achieve a higher grade point average and complete their degree program than those students who live off campus. Dozens of clubs and organizations are available for leadership and fun, plus exciting campus activities and intercollegiate sports are close at hand. </P>

<P>NCMC’s housing facilities are supervised by the Director of Residence Life, Residence Hall Coordinators and Resident Assistants (RAs). RAs are students who live in the residence halls and assist with community building and management of the halls. For more information on RA positions, contact the Director of Residence Life. </P>

<P>Research has shown that maturation compatibility is a significant factor in the normal operation of campus housing and can complement the academic experience when there is not a significant age range. In addition, oversight, policies, and activities are planned to meet the general needs of the traditional college-age student. As a result, applicants beyond the range of 17-23 are encouraged to carefully consider “fit” before living in on-campus housing. </P>

<P>Housing is assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, and early confirmation of arrangements is encouraged. A housing application form accompanied by the required deposit should be submitted to the Office of Residence Life. </P>

<P>Students under the age of 18 must meet with the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs prior to placement in college housing. Parent(s) or legal guardian must be in attendance unless the student is an emancipated minor. </P>

<P>Students living on-campus are required to abide by college rules and the Student Code of Conduct. See the Residence Life Contract Terms and Conditions for additional guidelines. Visit the NCMC

<P>No student shall be in an intoxicated condition, which may be evidenced by disorderly, obscene or indecent conduct or appearance, while on campus or at a college-approved event off campus. No student shall furnish or cause to be furnished any alcoholic beverage to any person under the legal drinking age. Missouri under-age drinking laws and federal and state drug laws regarding the possession, use and sale of illegal drugs will be enforced through judicial referrals and/or reporting incidents to the Trenton Police Department. NCMC will impose sanctions, consistent with local, State, and Federal law, for violations of NCMC alcohol and drug policies and the Student Code of Conduct. Sanctions may include a verbal warning, written warning, loss of privileges, probation, suspension, expulsion from the halls and/or campus, or imposition of a lesser sanction. Sanctions may also include classes, community service, referrals for appropriate counseling and/or referral to local law enforcement for prosecution. If a student is convicted of violating criminal laws regarding alcohol or drugs, they may be subject to civil action. Legal sanctions may include classes, community service, fines, prison terms, loss of driving privileges, and mandated rehabilitation programs. </P>

<P>Employees </P>

<P>The unlawful possession, purchase, manufacture, use, sale or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by employees on college property or at any of its activities is prohibited.

<P>If an employee is convicted of violating criminal laws concerning alcohol or drugs, in addition to civil action, the employee may be subject to termination. Legal sanctions may include classes, community service, fines, prison terms, loss of driving privileges, and mandated rehabilitation programs. Failure to disclose previous convictions on a job application is grounds for termination. </P>

It encourages students to acquire and use the intellectual tools, knowledge and creative capabilities necessary to study the world as it is, as it has been understood and as it might be imagined. It also furnishes students with skills which enable them to deepen that understanding and to communicate it to others. Through general education, North Central Missouri College equips students for success in their specialized areas of study and for fulfilled lives as educated persons, as active citizens and as effective contributors to their own prosperity and to the general welfare of society. </P>

<P>As knowledge of the world is structured, so must general education be constructed to introduce students to the traditional disciplines of the arts and sciences. As that knowledge is ever changing, so must general education alert students to connections between the traditional disciplines and to the potential for interaction among all branches of knowing, ordering, and imagining the real world. As the real world is diverse, so must general education inform students that the world is understood in different ways and provide them with the means to come to terms, intelligently and humanely, with the diversity. As the diversities of knowing and understanding must be made open and accessible, so students must acquire appropriate investigative, interpretative, and communicative competencies. </P>

<H3>General Education Policy </H3>
</Sect>

<P>In order to facilitate the transfer of students among institutions of higher education in the state, the Missouri Department of Higher Education has supported the development of a statewide general education policy that is intended to ensure the portability of general education credit among Missouri’s colleges and universities. State-level curricular goals and institutional-level student competencies for general education fall into two categories: academic skills and knowledge. </P>

<Sect>
<P>1. Skills Areas </P>

<P>A. Communicating </P>
</Sect>

<P>To develop students’ effective use of the English language and quantitative and other symbolic systems essential to their success in school and in the world. Students should be able to read and listen critically and to write and speak with thoughtfulness, clarity, </P>

<Sect>
<P>coherence, and persuasiveness. </P>

<P>B. Higher-Order Thinking </P>
</Sect>

<P>To develop students’ ability to distinguish among opinions, facts, and inferences; to identify underlying or implicit assumptions; to make informed judgments; and to solve problems by applying evaluative standards. </P>

<P>C. Managing Information To develop students’ abilities to locate, organize, store, retrieve, evaluate, synthesize, and annotate </P>

<P>information from print, electronic, and other sources in preparation for solving problems and making informed decisions. </P>

<Sect>
<P>D. Valuing </P>
</Sect>

<P>To develop students’ abilities to understand the moral and ethical values of a diverse society and to understand that many courses of action are guided by value judgments about the way things ought to be. </P>

<P>Students should be able to make informed decisions through identifying personal values and the values of others and through understanding how such values develop. They should be able to analyze the ethical implications of choices made on the basis of these values. </P>

<Sect>
<P>2. Knowledge Areas </P>
</Sect>

<P>A. Social and Behavioral Sciences To develop students’ understanding of themselves and the world around them through study of content and the processes used by historians and social and behavioral scientists to discover, describe, explain, and predict human behavior and social systems. Students must understand the diversities and complexities of the cultural </P>

<P>and social world, past and present, and come to an informed sense of self and others. (Students must fulfill the state statute requirements for the United States and Missouri constitutions.) </P>

<P>B. Humanities and Fine Arts To develop students’ understanding of the ways in which humans have addressed their condition through imaginative work in the humanities and fine arts; to deepen their understanding of how that imaginative </P>

<P>process is informed and limited by social, cultural, linguistic, and historical circumstances; and to appreciate the world of the creative imagination as a form of knowledge. </P>

<P>C. Mathematics To develop students’ understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts and their applications. Students </P>

<P>should develop a level of quantitative literacy that would enable them to make decisions and solve problems which could serve as a basis for continued learning. </P>

<P>D. Life and Physical Sciences To develop students’ understanding of the principles and laboratory procedures of life and physical sciences and to cultivate their abilities to apply the empirical methods of scientific inquiry. Students should understand </P>

<P>how scientific discovery changes theoretical views of the world, informs our imaginations, and shapes human history. Students should also understand that science is shaped by historical and social contexts. </P>
