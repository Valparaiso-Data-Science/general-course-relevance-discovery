<New_Style_Sheet>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE </New_Style_Sheet>

<P>Southwestern Assemblies of God University is a Bible-based institution for theological and professional studies. It is rooted in the great commission of Jesus to “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation”’ and to “make disciples of all nations . . . teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” (Mark 16:15a; Matthew 28:19, 20), which is the primary emphasis of SAGU’s parent body, the General Council of the Assemblies of God.</P>

<P>Southwestern Assemblies of God University exists to equip students spiritually, academically, professionally, and cross-culturally for their God-given careers and callings.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>STATEMENT OF FAITH</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>SAGU embraces and supports the doctrinal teaching of the General Council of the Assemblies of God as set forth in Article V, Statement of Fundamental Truths of its Constitution. The following statements summarize these doctrines.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>We Believe</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>....the Bible is the inspired and only infallible and authoritative written Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16).</P>

<P>....there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19).</P>

<P>....in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, in His personal future return to this earth in power and glory to rule a thousand years (John 1:1).</P>

<P>....in the blessed hope — the rapture of the Church at Christ’s coming (Titus 2:13).</P>

<P>....the only means of being cleansed from sin is through repentance and faith in the precious blood of Christ (John 14:6).</P>

<P>....regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for personal salvation (Titus 3:5).</P>

<P>....in water baptism by immersion (Matthew 28:19).</P>

<P>....the redemptive work of Christ on the cross provides healing of the human body in answer to believing prayer (I Peter 2:24).</P>

<P>....the baptism in the Holy Spirit, according to Acts 2:4, is given to believers who ask for it.</P>

<P>....in the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a holy life (Galatians 5:16-25).</P>

<P>....in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost, the one to everlasting life and the other to everlasting damnation (Revelation 20:11-15).</P>

<P/>

<New_Style_Sheet>STATEMENT OF CORE VALUES</New_Style_Sheet>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Bible-based Education</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>God is the ultimate source of all knowledge and truth and has revealed Himself in Scripture; therefore, SAGU is committed to the authority of the Bible and the integration of biblical values in all academic disciplines.  The pursuit of truth and its application in every area of life comes through understanding the Word of God and knowing Christ.  The University intends that students will deepen their understanding of Scripture and develop well-founded theological convictions for a life of Christian service through a carefully selected core of Bible and theology curriculum.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Academic Excellence</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU is a university devoted, under God, to the pursuit of truth through the use of the mind.  Students, therefore, are encouraged to bring their minds in submission to Christ and fulfill their responsibilities as stewards, and work for the integration of thinking and learning in the framework of a Christian worldview.  Students are encouraged to develop their minds and intellects in the pursuit of knowing Christ and His creation, and seeking God’s direction as they choose a vocation or career path.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Spiritual Formation</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU is committed to fostering spiritual formation among students that produces life-long spiritual growth and character development.  Students are encouraged to develop their understanding of biblical faith, increase their desire to know and serve God, and develop personal integrity and character by applying biblical values to their lives.  Chapel and local church participation is emphasized because worship is an important element in the University’s strategy for spiritual formation.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Missions-mindedness</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU is founded on the belief that every believer has a personal responsibility for the Great Commission.  SAGU intends that students will embrace missions-mindedness as evidenced by life-long personal involvement in world evangelism, a life of intercessory prayer for the lost, personal witness, contributing resources to world evangelism, and a willingness to go into full-time missionary work (if called by God) or, at a minimum, participate in a short-term mission trip.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Pentecostal Distinction</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU is committed to an environment that encourages students to experience Spirit baptism according to Pentecostal theology to obtain additional power for witness, personal edification through speaking in tongues in private prayer, and additional enablement through spiritual gifts, while continually pursuing spiritual formation and a Spirit-formed character.  The University also encourages the operation of the gifts of the Spirit in worship services according to the scriptural directive.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Servant Leadership and Ministry</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU’s mission is founded on the belief that God intends every believer be actively involved in ministry that reflects service and servanthood.  Fulfilling the mission of the church requires all believers, no matter their chosen career and calling, to work in team-like fashion using their unique gifts and talents in churches and ministries around the world as pastors, board members, elders, deacons, and heads of creative ministries in the pattern of the servant ministry of Jesus Christ.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Community and Personal Wellness</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU is committed to the understanding that discipleship occurs in community and in relationship; therefore, students are encouraged to develop the social and relational skills needed to contribute to an affirming, loving, and giving community of believers.  Additionally students are encouraged toward emotional and physical health for the purpose of enabling long, faithful service unto God.  Eating properly, sleeping adequately, exercising regularly, and sufficient rest properly honors God through the body.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>UNIVERSITY STANDARDS </New_Style_Sheet>

<P>SAGU embraces standards of conduct that are the same as those generally accepted by the Assemblies of God in America. These are characterized by clean behavior and conversation, modest apparel, high moral standards, commitment to excellence in educational and professional development, and deep consecration and devotion in spiritual life.</P>

<P>High Christian standards relate to all facets of university life. Though they are reflected in the spiritual development of the student, they do not end there. Christian citizenship is a biblical obligation. Christian ethics extend into the intellectual development of an individual, and Christian morality regulates social relationships. Accordingly, the Christian will assume responsibilities in the educational community with cheerfulness and friendliness. Relationships at SAGU must reflect moral purity and distaste for promiscuity. High standards are imposed in the area of physical development. This results in habits and diets that contribute to good health and physical well-being.</P>

<P>The same Christian standards apply to faculty, staff, and students. General student conduct standards are explained in the Student Handbook. The Student Conduct Committee embraces the responsibility of maintaining the high Christian standards of the student community. The committee may require a student who does not embrace the aims and ideals of the University to withdraw if the general welfare of the University demands it.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>HISTORY </New_Style_Sheet>

<P>Three Bible schools were brought together to form Southwestern Bible Institute. The first, known as Southwestern Bible School, was established at Enid, Oklahoma, in 1927 under the leadership of the Reverend P. C. Nelson. The second, Shield of Faith Bible School, was founded in Amarillo, Texas, in 1931 under the direction of the Reverend Guy Shields. It included not only a Bible school, but also a grade school and high school. The third, which was operated as Southern Bible Institute in connection with the Richey Evangelistic Temple, began at Goose Creek, Texas, in 1931. It was started by the Reverend J. T. Little in Trinity Tabernacle and later moved to Houston in 1933. </P>

<P/>

<P>The Bible school division of Shield of Faith was moved to Fort Worth in 1935. The high school division was transferred the following year. In 1940, a merger resulted in Southern Bible Institute moving to Fort Worth. The combined school, operating as South Central Bible Institute, came under the ownership and direction of the Texas District Council of the Assemblies of God. The school in Enid merged with South Central in 1941, at which time the name was changed to Southwestern Bible Institute. In 1943, the institute was moved to its present facilities in Waxahachie, Texas. During the 1944-45 term, a junior college curriculum was added to the school’s program. The Junior College Division soon accounted for about half of the enrollment in the college.</P>

<P>Southwestern Bible Institute became a regional school in 1954, owned and operated by seven districts of the Assemblies of God—Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Texas, Oklahoma, South Texas and West Texas. The Mississippi District was added to the region in 1979. </P>

<P>The owning Districts officially changed the name to Southwestern Assemblies of God College. In 1963, the upper two years of the college were renamed Southwestern College of the Bible. In 1968, the separation of the divisions of the college was made more complete, and the Junior College was designated Southwestern Junior College of the Assemblies of God and given regional accreditation at that time. In 1984, the School of Distance Education was established. In 1988, the Junior College and Bible College divisions were reunited as Southwestern Assemblies of God College and in 1989 regional accreditation was attained for the College. </P>

<P>During the 1990’s the school experienced an unprecedented rate of student growth. In December 1994, the Board of Regents unanimously approved the name change to Southwestern Assemblies of God University, and authorized the development of the Thomas F. Harrison Graduate School to provide master’s degree programs. </P>

<P>During the first fifteen years of the 21st century, SAGU’s rate of facility growth to service its student population took on amazing proportions. In 2004, the University restructured its academic organization to recognize two colleges under the University umbrella: the College of Bible and Church Ministries, and the College of Arts and Professions. In 2013 the University adjusted its college identities again, dividing into the College of Bible and Church Ministries, the College of Business and Education, and the College of Music and Communication Arts. In 2015, SAGU was approved by regional accreditation as a Level V institution authorized to offer doctoral programs.</P>

<Story>
<P>The faculty and staff of SAGU are committed to providing services to make the student’s university experience meaningful and enjoyable, while intentionally promoting an atmosphere conducive to student learning.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>SPIRITUAL LIFE</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>Activities are promoted which contribute to the spiritual development of students. Central to this program is the daily chapel period shared by the entire University community. Seasons of worship are accompanied by spiritual challenges extended to the students by the administration, faculty, visiting guest speakers, and fellow students. As God moves during these times, many students are filled with the Spirit and make deep personal commitments to God.</P>

<P>A World Ministries emphasis is planned each semester at which time Christian stewardship and consecration are stressed. Many SAGU students have dedicated themselves to ministerial service in these meetings.</P>

<P>Emphasis also is placed on personal devotions in connection with residence hall life. At regular intervals entire sections of the residence halls meet for group worship. Spiritual life on campus is encouraged through a variety of student organizations and ministry groups.</P>

All students are required to serve a minimum of one hour of practical ministry service per week. Christian service should characterize every student’s life.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>PERSONAL LIFE</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>SAGU maintains concern about the personal life of its students. All students (married or single, off campus or on campus) are expected to conduct themselves at all times in accordance with the teachings of the Word of God, the accepted standards of the Assemblies of God, and the standards of conduct held by SAGU. SAGU students must realize the importance of exemplifying Christian living both on campus and off campus. Since many come from various backgrounds, it is necessary that each student becomes acquainted with SAGU’s standard of conduct and dress. The University states its intention of making biblical principles its primary basis for conduct as referred to in the Assemblies of God Bylaws, Article IX, Section 6, as follows:</P>

<P>In view of the alarming erosion of national moral standards, we reaffirm our intention of holding up biblical standards against all forms of worldliness. We urge all believers to “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world . . . For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world (I John 2:15,16).”</P>

<P>In its teaching regarding worldliness, the Scripture warns against participation in activity which defiles the body or corrupts the mind and spirit; the inordinate love of, or preoccupation with, pleasures, positions, or possessions, which lead to their misuse; manifestation of extreme behavior, unbecoming speech, or inappropriate appearance; any fascination or association which lessens one’s affection for spiritual things (Luke 21:34, 35; Romans 8:5-8; 12:1-2; II Corinthians 6:14-18; Ephesians 5:11; I Timothy 2:8-10; 4:12; James 4:4; I John 2:15-17, and Titus 2:12).</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>STUDENT LIFE</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>Attendance at SAGU is designed to be a life enriching experience. By living, worshiping, working, and interacting with other Christian young people, one is stimulated by the influence of examples to include Christ in every facet of daily living. A full schedule of activities is planned to emphasize the importance of Christian values.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Social Life</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Social life plays an important part in the development of Christian character and poise. The University seeks to provide a well-balanced program of social events for the student body. Opportunities for social experiences are planned by the Student Congress, Residential Life, and other campus organizations.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Student Conduct Committee</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>The Student Conduct Committee has the responsibility of maintaining the high Christian standards of the University. The committee seeks to identify models of excellence in Christian behavior and service on campus. It functions to remedy difficult problems but may also require a student who does not embrace the aims and ideals of the University to withdraw if general welfare demands it.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>GENERAL SERVICES AND POLICIES</New_Style_Sheet>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Orientation</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU is dedicated to helping men and women adjust to life as university students. The orientation program actually begins before students arrive on campus with a series of communications which answer important questions and provide helpful information about SAGU.</P>

<P>Days are designated at the opening of each Fall and Spring term for orientation, testing, and counseling. All new students participate in these activities. Freshmen students are required to enroll in the college life orientation course (GES 1122 Strategies for Student Success). Topics covered in the course serve to better acquaint students with the distinctive programs of SAGU and enable them to realize the most from a university education.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>STUDENT COMPLAINTS</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>The University regards general complaints with appropriate attention. The student body is regularly polled with respect to academics and student life.

Student Congress executive officers regularly share student concerns with the Vice President for Student Development. Students are welcomed to visit with the Vice President for Student Development to make personal concerns known. Formal written complaints may be filed with the Vice President for Student Development.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Initiating and Processing a Complaint</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Any student that wishes to log a complaint must first discuss it with the Dean of Students with the objective of resolving the matter informally. Should this informal discussion fail to satisfy the student, then a formal written complaint must be filed with the Vice President for Student Development. No complaint will be received in which the complainant refuses to commit to written record. All persons against whom a complaint has been filed will be notified of the allegations. A complaint may be withdrawn at any step without prejudice and cannot be reopened.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Procedure</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Step 1: The complainant shall file a formal written complaint with the Vice President for Student Development, using the Student Complaint Form that can be acquired from the Student Development office, or on the SAGU website (www.sagu.edu/complaintform).

<P>Step 2: Upon the evaluation by the Vice President for Student Development, an investigation will be conducted. The investigation may include interviews of all parties involved in the complaint and the gathering of all available evidence. In the event that the matter involves academics, the complaint will be turned over to the Vice President for Academics for investigation.</P>

<P>Step 3: Once the matter has been investigated, the Vice President for Student Development will inform the complainant of the resolution. If the student is not satisfied with the resolution, the complaint shall be transmitted to the President. Whomever the President designates shall meet with the parties of interest. A response to the complaint shall be indicated in writing with a copy furnished to the complainant and the accused. This response will be considered as final.</P>

<P/>

<New_Style_Sheet>FINANCIAL AID POLICIES</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>The following policies and funds are specific to the undergraduate student. Please see the Graduate Academic Catalog for policies and funds related to the Graduate Student.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Application Dates</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Applications for financial assistance are available after January 1 of each year for the following academic year (August-May). The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can be submitted online at www.fafsa.gov and should be completed by March 1. Priority is given to students whose FAFSA’s are submitted by March 1 and whose files are accurate and complete by April 15. To have funds ready at registration, the following deadlines are suggested: Apply by May 1 and have a complete and accurate file by July 1. Students planning to attend summer school need a FAFSA filed for the academic year preceding the summer session. Students are required to apply for institutional aid prior to the end of late registration each semester. After the end of late registration, students cannot be awarded any additional institutional financial aid even if otherwise eligible.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Financial Aid Eligibility</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>The financial aid lock in date is the last day a student can receive a 100% refund. This date will determine Pell Grant and Stafford Loan eligibility. Classes added after this day will not be eligible for additional federal or state aid. Federal Pell Grants will prorate by the number of credit hours registered in on this day. Students receiving Pell funds are required to attend at least one class period in each course to become eligible for funding. Stafford Student Loan eligibility requires a student to be locked into no less than six (6) credit hours. In order to qualify for state financial aid, students must lock into the required number of hours for each program. Please see the Financial Aid Office for these program requirements.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Return of Title IV Federal Funds </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Introduction</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>The law specifies how SAGU must determine the amount of Title IV program assistance that you earn if you withdraw from school. The Title IV programs offered at SAGU that are covered by this law are: Federal Pell Grants, Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), and Federal Perkins Loans.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Though your aid is posted to your account at the start of each semester, you earn the funds as you complete the semester. If you withdraw during the semester, the amount of Title IV program assistance that you have earned up to that point is determined by a specific formula. If you received (or SAGU or your parent received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount that you earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds. If you received more assistance than you earned, the excess funds must be returned by SAGU and/or you.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>A return of Title IV (R2T4) funds calculation is performed when a student who is awarded federal funds withdraws from a semester of study. The Financial Aid Office uses software provided by the U.S. Department of Education to complete this calculation. The student’s account statement and financial aid record is used in conjunction with this software.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Estimate of Aid Earned or Aid That May Need to be Returned</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>The amount of assistance that you have earned is determined on a pro rata basis. For example, if you completed 30% of the semester, you earn 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive. Once you have completed more than 60% of the semester, you earn all the assistance that you were scheduled to receive for that semester. This means that if a student receiving federal Title IV aid withdraws after completing 60% of the semester, no Title IV funds will be returned. The student is considered to have earned 100% of the Title IV aid for the semester.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Here’s an example of how you can estimate the percentage of Title IV aid that you have earned in a semester (enrollment period).</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3/>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>				= % of Title IV Earned By Student</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3/>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>You can also compute a rough estimate of the amount that you may be required to repay prior to withdrawing by using the U.S. Department of Education’s Treatment of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws form.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Unofficial Withdrawals and Earning All Non-Passing Grades</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>If you fail to earn a passing grade in at least one of your courses (i.e. all F’s, NC’s, all I’s or a combination of non-passing grades) during a semester, you are considered to have, for purposes of federal Title IV funds, unofficially withdrawn from the University. As a result, a federal withdrawal calculation must be performed to determine the amount of Title IV funds that you must repay. The only exception is when SAGU can document (within 30 days of the end of the semester) that you should not have been considered unofficially withdrawn. For example, that you were academically engaged after the 60% point of the semester or that you did not meet the requirements for administrative withdrawal in an online course.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Once semester grades post, and if you fail to earn a passing grade in at least one of your courses, SAGU will perform the federal withdrawal (Return of Title IV) calculation.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Post-Withdrawal Disbursement</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>If you did not receive all of the funds that you earned, you may be due a post-withdrawal disbursement. If your post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan funds, SAGU must get your permission before we can disburse them. We will contact you via LionMail (SAGU email) to offer you a post-withdrawal loan disbursement. Therefore, it is important that you continue to check your LionMail even after withdrawing from a semester. You may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds so that you don’t incur additional debt. SAGU may automatically use all or a portion of our post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition, fees, and room and board charges (as contracted with the school). SAGU needs your permission to use the post-withdrawal grant disbursement for all other school charges, and this permission is received each semester by each student when you approve your bill and agree to the terms and conditions of registration in your mySAGU student portal.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>There are some Title IV funds that you may have been scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to you once you withdraw because of other eligibility requirements. For example, a student that was awarded federal loans but has not accepted the loans in the mySAGU student portal or completed the required MPN or loan entrance counseling cannot receive a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Returning Title IV Funds</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>If you receive (or SAGU or your parent receives on your behalf) excess Title IV program funds that must be returned, SAGU must return a portion of the excess equal to the lesser of:</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>	1.  Your institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of your funds, or</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>	2.  The entire amount of excess funds.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>SAGU must return this amount even if we didn’t keep this amount of your Title IV program funds. If SAGU is not required to return all of the excess funds, you must return the remaining amount.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Any loan funds that you must return, you (or your parent for a Direct PLUS Loan) repay in accordance with the terms of the promissory note. That is, you make scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Overpayments</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Any amount of unearned grant funds that you must return is called an overpayment. The maximum amount of a grant overpayment that you must repay is half of the grant funds you received or were scheduled to receive. You do not have to repay a grant overpayment if the original amount of the overpayment is $50 or less. You must make arrangements with SAGU or the Department of Education to return any unearned grant funds.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Non-Attendance</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>If you are a Pell Grant, Iraq-Afghanistan Service Grant (IASG) or TEACH Grant recipient, federal regulations require you to have begun attending the courses for which you are enrolled and receiving these grants. If on the final roll sheet distributed to instructors to confirm attendance your instructor indicates that you are not attending a course, you are assumed not to have begun attendance for that course. Your grant will then be adjusted or cancelled based on the courses you have actually begun attending.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>If you fail to begin attendance in all of the courses for which you are registered, you will have failed to establish eligibility for financial aid. In this situation, you will be required to repay all of the financial aid that you have received.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Last Date of Attendance Determination for Programs That Take Attendance</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>For programs that take attendance (undergraduate on campus courses), the Financial Aid Office uses the student’s last date of attendance in calculating whether or not Title IV funds have to be returned to Federal Student Aid. These attendance records are received through Blackboard or instructor records. Additionally, other academic records in Blackboard may be used to help determine the last date of attendance, such as when a student submitted an assignment or completed an assessment in Blackboard.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Last Date of Attendance Determination for Programs That Do Not Take Attendance</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>For programs that do not take attendance (distance education and graduate on campus courses), the Financial Aid Office uses the withdrawal date in calculating whether or not Title IV funds have to be returned to Federal Student Aid. When a student in a program that does not take attendance is administratively withdrawn or when a student unofficially withdraws, the Financial Aid Office will use the midpoint of the semester in calculating whether or not funds have to be returned to Federal Student Aid, unless SAGU can show documentation of the student’s last academically related activity.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Federal vs. Institutional Refund Policy</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>The requirements for federal Title IV program funds when you withdraw are separate from any refund policy that SAGU has regarding institutional grants and scholarships or other non-federal financial aid. Therefore, federal funds may not cover all unpaid institutional charges due to a student’s withdrawal, and you may still owe funds to SAGU to cover any unpaid institutional charges. SAGU may also charge you for any Title IV program funds that we were required to return. When you approved your bill for the semester, you were emailed a copy of SAGU’s return policy to your LionMail account. If you do not have access to this or are not familiar with SAGU’s refund policy, you should contact the Student Billing Office at StudentBilling@sagu.edu or (972)825-4645 to ask for a copy.</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>When considering withdrawing from the University, students are encouraged to contact the Financial Aid Office first to see how the withdrawal could affect their aid. The Financial Aid Office will assist the </New_Style_Sheet_3>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Satisfactory Academic Progress  Policy (SAP) - Undergraduate </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Southwestern Assemblies of God University is required by law to formulate standards to gauge the progress of students receiving financial assistance through federal, state or institutional aid programs by applying both qualitative and quantitative measurements to academic work [34 CFR 668.16(3)]. These measurements shall be used to determine a student’s eligibility for all federal Title IV aid and for other need-based financial assistance, unless the terms of a particular grant or funding source states otherwise.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Time Frame Used in Measuring Progress</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>All SAP measurements are calculated annually at the end of the spring semester for all programs. Financial Aid Suspension will go into effect at the start of the following fall semester.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Qualitative Progress Measurement: Minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>A cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 2.0 or higher must be attained by the end of the student’s first spring semester. Students that transfer credits from other institutions will also have this GPA calculated in the CGPA. This average must be maintained at the end of each subsequent spring semester for a student to continue to receive financial aid. Students who do not meet this minimum CGPA requirement will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. According to SAGU academic grading policy, only the latest grade for a repeated course is calculated into the CGPA. More detailed information on how the CGPA is calculated can be found under the Academic Policies in the catalog.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Quantitative Progress Measurement No. 1: Number of Credit Hours Required to Complete</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>When students enroll for classes and receive financial aid to pay for them, students are expected to complete those classes. If students do not complete at least 70 percent of the credit hours that are attempted during the year, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. Only passing grades count as successful completions. Incomplete or other grades that do not result in earned credits will not count as completions.</P>

<P>Quantitative Progress Measurement No. 2: Maximum Time to Complete a Degree</P>

<P>Students must select a program/degree of study before they can receive financial aid. When students receive financial aid to help pay a program/degree of study, they are expected to complete that program without taking a lot of time.</P>

<P>A student’s progress may be evaluated for only one program at a time. Each financial aid applicant must select a primary program/degree of study prior to receiving financial aid payments. A student who is concurrently completing more than one program or major may request additional time to complete the program. A request for additional time must be submitted in writing to the Financial Aid Office.</P>

<P>To make sure that students complete their program in a reasonable amount of time, a limit set by law has been placed on the number of hours that students can attempt in order to complete the program/degree. That limit is 150 percent of the minimum number of hours required to complete the program/degree. (For example, if you are in a program/degree that takes 66 hours to complete, you must finish your program within 99 attempted hours. If you are in a program/degree that takes 120 hours to complete, you must finish your program within 180 attempted hours.)</P>

<P>Once students reach the 150 percent limit, they will no longer be able to receive additional financial aid payments. There are many variables that go into calculating that limit, including, but not limited to:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>All attempted credit hours are counted regardless of whether or not financial aid was received to pay for them.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Any transfer hours that are accepted from other colleges toward completion of the program are counted. If you are a transfer student, you must submit transcripts from all previous colleges.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>If a course is repeated, all attempts are counted.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4.	</Lbl>

<LBody>If a student withdraws from a course, it is still counted as an attempt.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Note:  If a student cannot complete the program within the 150 percent limit, they will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension when that determination is calculated. Students have the ability to submit an appeal for this determination.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Financial Aid Suspension </New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>If a student fails to meet any one of the SAP measurements described above, they will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. While on suspension, students will not be eligible to receive any financial aid. Students will be notified of this via their campus email address.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Reinstatement Procedures</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>To regain financial aid eligibility, a student must pay the expenses related to at least half-time enrollment (6 or more hours in a semester) during the period of suspension and satisfy all SAP requirements. After meeting all SAP requirements, the student must request reinstatement of eligibility in writing to the Financial Aid Office.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Appeal Process</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>Students placed on Financial Aid Suspension may petition the Financial Aid Department to consider mitigating (special)  circumstances that resulted in inability to meet the SAP requirements. The appeal must be typed and must include the Suspension Appeal Form, an explanation with supporting documentation (i.e., medical statements, divorce documents, letters of unemployment, etc.) of the reason(s) the minimum academic standards required by SAP policy were not achieved. Additionally, each appeal must be submitted with a letter of endorsement from an SAGU faculty/staff member. The appeal narrative and documentation should also demonstrate that the adverse circumstances have been resolved.</P>

<P>All appeals will be reviewed within 7 business days of the Financial Aid Office’s receipt of a complete appeal (appeal form, student’s appeal letter, endorser letter and supporting documentation). Notification of the review will be sent via SAGU email.</P>

<P>For appeals that have been approved, students will be placed on Financial Aid Probation for one academic year, beginning with the next fall semester. SAP will be calculated again at the end of the spring semester; if the cumulative standard is met, students will be placed back in good standing. Students that meet SAP for the academic year, yet are not meeting the cumulative requirement, will remain on Financial Aid Probation until the requirement is met.</P>

<P>For students that have been denied, there is another level of appeal. The student must request, in writing, a review by the Financial Aid Committee. Appeals that have been approved at this level will be required to see an academic counselor in order to tailor the class schedule for student success.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Developmental Course Work</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>Students may take up to 30 hours of developmental course work and receive financial aid to pay for those costs. These hours do not count toward the 150 percent limit to complete the student’s degree, but the student will be measured against Quantitative Measurement No. 1 described above. Once the student has attempted 30 developmental hours, he/she will only be paid for attempts of credit hours toward their program. The student cannot receive financial aid to pay for extra developmental hours.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Summer Enrollment and the SAP</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>When calculating the SAP status, summer attempted hours will be counted toward the 150 percent maximum, and summer grade points earned will be calculated as part of the cumulative grade point average. The rule pertaining to completion of a minimum number of attempted credit hours will not be calculated for summer enrollment.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Financial Aid Will Not Pay For:</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>n Any credit hours in excess of the 150 percent maximum program limit (see discussion of Quantitative Measurement No. 2 above)</P>

<P>n Courses taken by audit</P>

<P>n Credit hours earned by placement tests</P>

<P>n Courses registered for after the official certification date of the semester (last day to receive 100% refund)</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>TRANSFER POLICIES</New_Style_Sheet>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Transfer of Credits from Accredited Colleges or Universities </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Credit for courses that have been earned at other regionally accredited colleges or universities with a grade of “C-” or above and meet the requirements of the student’s chosen degree may be transferred into undergraduate studies at SAGU. Courses completed with a grade of “D+” or below will not be accepted in transfer.  Southwestern only transfers credit to meet course requirements for graduation. With the exception of transient courses, grades received at other institutions are not entered on Southwestern transcripts and do not count toward the student’s GPA. Transient courses - courses taken by continuing SAGU students - will still have grades recorded on the SAGU transcript. </P>

<P>Students must request official transcripts from their previous institutions be sent to the Admissions Office in order to transfer credit. Official transcripts must come directly from the sending institution. The University determines acceptable transfer credit from other institutions based on evaluation of course content as described in the catalogs of those institutions and in consultation with appropriate academic units at SAGU as necessary for clarification. Transfer credit may only be received for course work completed at regionally accredited institutions, or institutions which satisfy SAGU’s Unaccredited College Policy. A lower-level course that is transferred for an upper-level course does not count towards the upper-level hour requirement.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>New/Returning Transfer Student </New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>For policies concerning transfer credit for new and returning students, please refer to section entitled Admission as a Transfer Student.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Current Student </New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>Continuing students - students currently enrolled - planning on transferring in courses from other colleges should check with the Registrar’s Office before taking any course work. Students who are within the last 30 hours of their degree can only transfer six (6) additional hours. Continuing SAGU students who take courses as transient students at other institutions may transfer their grades back to SAGU.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Transfer of Credits from an Unaccredited College</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>In order to have courses from an unaccredited college evaluated, the student must complete the following steps:</P>

<L>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Vocational/Technical Credit</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>General Guidelines for Acceptance of Vocational Type Credit</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>SAGU will accept a limited amount of vocational/technical credit towards the completion of a degree. Courses that are terminal in nature and focus on a single trade or craft (cosmetology, massage therapy, automotive, etc.) are not eligible for transfer.  Also, SAGU will only transfer credit from institutions for which transfer is a stated option and are accredited by a CHEA-recognized accrediting agency.  SAGU does not accept vocational credits that are awarded through Continuing Education Units (CEUs).  </P>

<P>Courses eligible for transfer should meet the following requirements: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Courses are transcripted as college credit and are not terminal in nature. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Transferring institution is accredited by a CHEA-recognized accrediting agency. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Courses cover a range of intellectual and professional skills rather than narrowly focusing on a repetitive single skill set or craft.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<New_Style_Sheet_3/>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Acceptance of Credit for Courses In Which SAGU Does Not Offer Programs</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>SAGU will accept up to 12 elective hours of vocational, technical, or applied sciences credit towards degrees in which SAGU does not have a specified emphasis in the coursework being transferred.  Credit will be evaluated for quality, content, and learning outcomes. The general guidelines for acceptance of vocation credit as stated above apply. Courses eligible for transfer should employ a theoretical framework and higher-order thinking skills for the vocation in which they are being trained.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Acceptance of Credit for Courses In Which SAGU Offers A Program</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>For technical coursework in which SAGU does have an area of emphasis (Criminal Justice), transfer credit will be assessed on a course-by-course basis for applicability.   All credit must still meet the general guidelines for acceptance as stated above.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Correspondence Work</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU will accept up to twelve hours of correspondence work from a regionally accredited university toward a degree.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>DEVELOPMENTAL STUDIES COURSES POLICIES </New_Style_Sheet>

<P>Developmental studies courses, as listed below, are integral to the success of those students entering the University with academic challenges. Placement of students into such courses is dependent upon entrance examination scores and any applicable transfer credits. Enrollment in a developmental course incurs the same charges and is valid for the same financial aid as non-developmental courses. Successful completion of a developmental course does not apply toward a student’s degree completion.</P>

<P>Achievement in Mind (AIM) I (GES 0011) and II (GES 0021): Placement in these courses is determined at the time of initial enrollment, based upon composite ACT scores. </P>

<P>Crossroads (GES 0031): Required for all students with the academic status of Academic probation.</P>

<P>English Development: Upon initial enrollment, students with an ACT English or Reading score below 18 or the equivalent SAT Critical Reading score or below are required to enroll in ENG 0113, Integrated Reading and Writing, their first semester. Students who demonstrate mastery of learning outcomes, including a final essay, will be eligible to enroll in ENG 1113, Composition and Rhetoric I. Students may repeat this course for credit until they have met course objectives. Students with scores of 18-19 (or the SAT equivalent) will enroll in ENG 0111, Composition Lab, concurrently with ENG 1113, Composition and Rhetoric I.</P>

<P>Math Development:  Upon initial enrollment, students with an ACT Math score of 20 or below or an SAT Math score equivalent are required to enroll in MTH 0043 Developmental Math Sequence in their first semester and master a designated number of modules, determined by the level of mastery indicated on the placement exam, in order to earn credit.  Students may repeat this course until they have mastered all of the modules determined by their initial placement results and required for their degree plan’s General Education Math course.</P>

<P>Transfer of Credits From or To Other Colleges or Universities</P>

<P>In addition to other transfer policies, students may not receive credit toward graduation requirements for courses that SAGU deems “developmental” or “remedial.” If credit is received for these hours at another university, SAGU may use these credits as a placement device into subsequent courses.</P>

<P>SAGU does not authorized the transfer of the following courses to any college or university for standard graduation credit. Use of these courses as a placement tool is purely via institutional prerogative. These courses may be considered “developmental” or “remedial.” Each of these courses will receive a grade of Credit/No Credit (CR/NC).</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>ACADEMIC POLICIES</New_Style_Sheet>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Required Student Participation in University Surveys</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU engages in an ongoing program of assessment to determine the effectiveness of its education programs and services and to make informed strategic planning decisions. This process, under the direction of the Dean for Institutional Effectiveness, involves the participation of students in nationally standardized assessment instruments as well as tests and surveys developed within the University. The type and frequency of assessment instruments will vary according to the needs of the University. SAGU expects each student to participate in the following events as directed by the University:</P>

<P>Graduating Student Survey </P>

<P>Administered during the last semester of all graduating students</P>

<P>Assessment of General Education Progress </P>

<P>Administered to all Juniors</P>

<P>Student Satisfaction Inventory</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Academic Records</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Student records are housed in the Registrar’s Office. Grade reports are available online after the conclusion of each semester. Transcripts may be requested in writing for a fee. Transcripts will be released only when students are clear of all financial obligations to the University and are current on all student loans. If a student wishes to petition a grade it must be done in writing to the Registrar’s office.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Classification of Students</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Classification of students is determined at the beginning of each semester. Classification will be determined as follows:</P>

<P>Freshman: 	0 - 29 hours</P>

<P>Sophomore: 	30 - 59 hours</P>

<P>Senior:	90 or more hours</P>

<P>Full-time Student: 	A student who is carrying at least 12 semester hours</P>

<P>Part-time Student:	A student who is carrying less than 12 semester hours</P>

<P>Special Student:	A student who is not pursuing a degree</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Grading </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Grade point averages are computed using only the following grades and grade points for each semester hour attempted.</P>

<P/>

<P>	A	93-100	4.0</P>

<P>	A-	90-92	3.7</P>

<P>	B+	87-89	3.3</P>

<P> 	B	83-86	3.0</P>

<P>	B-	80-82	2.7					C+	77-79	2.3</P>

<P>	WF	Withdrawn Failing</P>

<P>	WC	Withdrawn Credit/NC</P>

<P>	WM	Withdrawn-Military Deployment</P>

<P/>

<P>The following grades are given to specific courses: CR, PR, NC, P, NP. These grades do not affect grade point averages but do count toward academic degree requirements and academic progress.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Course Grade Amendment Procedure</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Grades fall within the purview of the faculty who bear responsibility for assigning them. Any student requesting a review of a course grade must initiate the discussion with the faculty member who assigned the grade.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>The Unit of Credit or Semester Hour</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>The unit for calculating credit is the semester hour. Each course (except developmental, physical education, music performance, and laboratory courses) gives as many semester hours credit as the number of hours spent in class per week. It is expected that two hours preparation will be made for each hour spent in class.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Student Load</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Students enrolled in fewer than 12 semester credit hours are classified as part-time. Students enrolled in 12 or more semester credit hours are classified as full-time students. Students desiring to take more than 20 semester credit hours must secure special permission from the Assistant Dean for Student Records.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Seminars</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU offers a variety of CR/NC seminars usually for the purpose of exposing students to talented field expertise. Students are allowed to take as many as they wish; however, only three seminars graded “CR” may be counted toward meeting graduation requirements.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Majors and Specializations</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Major refers to the student’s general field of study and consists of a minimum of 9 hours for an Associate’s degree and a minimum of 30 hours for a Bachelor’s degree. Specialization refers to a related specific sub-field of study within the major and consists of a minimum of 9 hours for an Associate’s degree and a minimum of 18 hours for a Bachelor’s degree. All full-time students are to include at least one course from the General Biblical Studies component of General Education Studies per semester of enrollment until their requirement is satisfied. Part-time students are to include at least one course from the General Biblical Studies component per 15 semester credit hours of enrollment at SAGU.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Secondary Majors/Specializations - General Requirements</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>All degree-seeking students must declare a primary major/specialization. The primary major/specialization will serve as the principal basis for advising and course selection. Students may not use courses in the primary major as substitutions for courses in a secondary major (or vice-versa) unless it is for elective type courses. Programs where the major studies or specialization studies areas are left open for elective-based credit do not qualify for secondary majors/specializations.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Bachelor’s Degrees</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>Students wishing to declare a second major may do so by completing a minimum of thirty (30) hours unique to the second major in the major studies area. Students may request a second specialization by completing a minimum of fifteen (15) hours unique to another specialization in the specialization area. Students may not declare a secondary major or specialization where the respective number of unique hours is less than the minimum stipulated above. Students must complete all unique degree requirements for both programs.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Associate Degrees</New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>Students may complete a second associates major by completing all hours unique to the second major. Additionally, there must be at least nine (9) hours difference between the primary and secondary major.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Minor</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>A minor consists of 15-18 semester hours of coursework in a single subject (as outlined by academic departments) outside the student’s major field. At least 6 of those hours must be at the junior/senior level. General education courses in the minor subject may count toward the total required hours for the minor. The purpose of the minor is to give the student an additional, though lesser, area of concentration and expertise beyond the major field. Students pursuing elective-based degrees or degrees with 30 or more hours in elective credit may declare one minor from the list of available minors in their catalog year.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Special Opportunity</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU offers a core-curriculum of Bible/theology/ministry courses that can qualify students from any degree program to pursue ministerial credentials with the Assemblies of God. This 24 credit core consists of curriculum approved by the General Council of the Assemblies of God and SAGU owner districts for the purpose of ministerial credentials. At any point, a student who has completed all 24 credits may engage the credential process: Bible Study,  The Church in Mission, Foundations of Church Ministries, Authentic Christianity, New Testament Literature, Old Testament Literature, Introduction to Theology and Apologetics, and Pentecostal Doctrine and History. Please refer to section entitled “Ministerial Credentials for All SAGU Students.”</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Audit Courses</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Course audit is an option for students who want to gain more knowledge on a subject, but do not need the course for their degree. Audits are only intended to give students a theoretical basis in a subject area and not intended for mastery of a subject. Therefore, students auditing a course only receive a grade of AU and are not required to complete the assignments or participate in class discussions.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Course audits are not available via online. Additionally, students may not audit courses that are skilled-based such as applied music courses, physical education courses, lab courses, internship/practicums, or computer skills courses.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Students who wish to audit a course must request to do so through the Registrar’s Office during late registration. Audits are subject to seat availability. Further policies and procedures are available in the Registrar’s Office. There is a fee associated with auditing a course which is due in full at the time of registration.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Incomplete Work</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>The grade of “I” (incomplete) is an exceptional grade given only to students who have satisfactorily completed 50% of the course assignments/requirements, but who, for reasons beyond their control, have been unable to complete all course requirements. The granting of an “I” occurs only when mutually agreed upon by student and instructor. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Procedures
a)	The student must apply to the instructor for an “I” by a specified date on the academic
	calendar.
b)	The student is responsible for obtaining the remaining requirements of the course from
	the instructor.
c)	If the work is completed within sixty (60) days from the last day of the semester, or
	within a shorter time frame specified by the professor, the “I” will be changed to the
	earned grade. No academic work may be submitted after the conclusion of the sixty 		(60) day period.
d)	If the instructor does not submit a change of grade, the “I” will become the terminal
	grade.
e)	The grade of “I” will appear on the permanent record of the student but will not be
	used in the determination of the cumulative grade point average. It does, however,
	count in the determination of satisfactory academic progress.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Honors</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>After each semester, the Registrar publishes a President’s List of all students who have been enrolled for at least 12 semester hours earning a 4.00 semester grade point average, and a Dean’s List of students making a 3.50-3.99 semester grade point average. All work must have been completed on time. A student earning grades of “I”, “WF”, “WP”, “NC”, “WC”, “PR”, or “NP” do not qualify. Developmental courses, transfer courses, and credit by exam do not count toward the 12 semester hour requirement. However, college-level SAGU courses with CR grades (practicums, student teaching, seminars, etc.) may count towards the 12 hour minimum provided the student took other courses which resulted in an eligible semester GPA.</P>

<P>Honors are noted at commencement to graduating bachelors students with high cumulative grade point averages for all their college work.</P>

<P>	3.50 - 3.74  	Cum Laude</P>

<P>	3.75 - 3.89  	Magna Cum Laude</P>

<P>	3.90 - 4.00	Summa Cum Laude</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Examinations </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Instructors give regular examinations during class hours within the semester. To make up an announced test, approval must first be secured from the instructor.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Final examinations occur at the end of each semester. All students must take these examinations. Graduating seniors with a grade of B or higher within a course may be exempted from the last examination of the course if the professor designates it as a final exam. However, a graduating senior with a grade of B or higher within a course, at the professor’s prerogative, may or may not be exempted from a unit exam given during the final examination week. Early final examinations will not be permitted except for extraordinary emergencies.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Late final examinations may be administered by the Testing Center up to 60 days after the end of the semester only.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Distance Education Examinations</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>The student should ensure that the examination method is understood prior to taking the test. The DE program has various online testing procedures, and methods may vary even within the same course. It is recommended that the course syllabus be reviewed carefully and questions be directed to the instructor prior to taking online exams.</P>

<P>Whatever the testing method may be, all students must realize that exams must reflect the independent work and expertise of the student being tested. Questions concerning the content or grading of an exam should be directed to the course instructor and not posted on any electronic discussion area. </P>

<P>Online course exams are administered in Blackboard. To access the exam, the student should log in to the Blackboard course and follow the specific instructions as listed in the course syllabus.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Academic Integrity</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Studies at SAGU are as inherently spiritual as they are intellectual. Students are admitted with the expectation of a commitment to honesty and stewardship. The true worship of God requires the worship of the whole being (“you shall love the Lord your God with all your...mind” Matthew 22:37). Students are expected to be honest in fulfilling all academic requirements and assignments. This pertains to examinations, themes, book critiques, reading reports, etc. </P>

<P>Therefore, any form of cheating or academic dishonesty is unfit to basic Christian discipleship and cannot be tolerated. Anyone cheating on a test or assignment may receive an “F” for the assignment or for the course and potentially face disciplinary action by the school. Course notes and other resources may not be brought into the testing room. Testing requires academic honesty and a student’s honor is at stake if the testing situation is compromised in any fashion by having persons present or materials or technologies in use which impact the results of the test. Plagiarism, the use of another’s uncited material as one’s own, is impermissible. Reproducing material from other students by photocopy, computer media transfer, or by rewrite is cheating. This also specifically applies to the use of other people’s essays, research papers, sermons and ceremonies from books, tapes, magazines, etc. without proper attribution. It further applies to downloading material from websites which are designed to aid in cheating on essays, term papers and dissertations.</P>

<P>A student will not be allowed to withdraw from a course if he/she is under investigation for academic dishonesty. In the event that the student is determined guilty of academic dishonesty, then the student will not be allowed to withdraw from the course and will receive the grade determined by the faculty member. Refer to Standard of Conduct in the Student Handbook.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Academic Status</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Academic status is determined by a student’s cumulative grade point average (CGPA) calculated on the basis of all academic work attempted. For continued enrollment in good academic standing, students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Students who do not achieve this minimum requirement may incur one of the following academic statuses.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Academic Alert </New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>A freshman or sophomore is considered on academic alert when their semester grade point average (SGPA) falls between a 2.0 and 2.25. Academic alert is not reflected on students’ permanent records; however, it does serve as a caution to students who are in danger of falling below minimum academic requirements.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Academic Probation </New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>A student is placed on academic probation at the end of any fall, spring or summer enrollment period in which the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) drops below a 2.0. A student on academic probation must abide by the following guidelines: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students will not be permitted to enroll in more than 14 hours. These hours include GES 0031.  (SAGU is not obligated to accept credits taken concurrently at other institutions during a student’s probationary semester.)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students will be required to enroll in and complete a one (1) hour, Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) course (GES 0031) through the SAGU Learning Center. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students will be required to comply with a probation contract which provides a plan for continued academic improvement.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<New_Style_Sheet_3>Academic Suspension and Continued Academic Probation </New_Style_Sheet_3>

<P>A student who, during a probationary semester, either fails to raise their CGPA to the minimum 2.0 standard, fails to meet the terms of their probation contract, or has been on academic 
probation for 50% of their academic career will be placed on Academic Suspension at the end of that semester.</P>

<P>Students receiving their first academic suspension may appeal in writing to the Dean of Academic Services for re-admission on a Continued Academic Probation status. If the appeal is granted, the student will be required to follow the same guidelines listed under Academic Probation.  Please note: Continued Academic Probation is considered a suspension status for purposes of tracking academic progress. </P>

<P>Students who make sufficient academic progress during their Continued Academic Probation semester, but whose CGPA remains below the 2.0 standard will be placed on Academic Probation the following semester until their CGPA is above a 2.0. </P>

<P>One and Three Year Suspensions</P>

<P>Students who fail to make sufficient academic progress during a Continued Academic Probation semester or face their second academic suspension at the conclusion of a semester will serve the second suspension as a one year suspension. One year suspensions preclude students from enrolling at SAGU during fall, spring, and summer semesters.</P>

<P>A student academically suspended a third time will not be allowed to re-enroll for three years (fall, spring, and summer).</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>SAGU Learning Centers</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>The Southwestern Learning Centers, located in Davis Hall, exists primarily for the purpose of instructional assistance. It has been established by the University in harmony with its commitment to academic excellence. The Learning Centers is open to all students to facilitate their learning experiences. The Associate Director of the Learning Centers and Academic Accommodations assists students needing academic accommodations because of a documented physical or mental disability. Students needing such assistance must make application with the Learning Centers’ Associate Director of Academic Accommodations once they are enrolled (phone - 972/825-4841; email - AcademicAccommodations@sagu.edu). Based on the disability, the Learning Centers’ Associate Director of Academic Accommodations will select academic accommodations for the faculty and students’ use to maximize the learning experiences for students.</P>

<P>Notice of Nondiscriminatory Policy Related to Students With Disabilities:</P>

<P>Southwestern Assemblies of God University is dedicated to providing students with disabilities access to the programs, services, and activities of the University as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, and by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</P>

<P>The Associate Director of the Learning Centers and Academic Accommodations located in the Learning Centers housed in the Davis building, collaborates with SAGU students, staff, and faculty to provide equal access to educational programs and safeguards against discrimination for qualified students with disabilities.</P>

<P>The following policy defines voluntary and mandatory participants, and specifies some related procedures for the Learning Centers.</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>The following students will be required to attend the Learning Centers. (Any student who is required to use Learning Centers services yet does not comply with Learning Centers policy will be reported to the Dean of Academic Services.):
a)	New students with a composite ACT score of 18 and below or a combined SAT score 
	equivalent and below must enroll in a one (1) hour, Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) class 		through the Learning Centers each of the first two semesters.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students with verifiable learning challenges may apply to voluntarily participate in Learning Centers programs.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Academic Advising/Counseling</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>“Schedulers” work to help students with their degree planning activities. Students should freely consult with the schedulers who are helping in the design of their academic program. New students are connected with faculty members who serve to mentor, assist and coach. Faculty members are available to work with the students on the issues of life, academics, career and spirituality. Before changing a major or prior to adding or dropping a course, students should seek out meaningful counsel provided by the University. Students are also able to review their degree plans on line and to pre-register for course work in this fashion. Questions about academic interests should be brought to the attention of faculty members (“mac’s”) or to faculty members who are department leaders or program coordinators. Faculty post hours of availability for student appointments.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Course Repetition</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Any course taken in residence at SAGU or at any accredited or approved institution may be repeated in residence at SAGU in order to improve the student’s grade for that course. The student must apply to the Registrar’s Office to retake the course. Only the final grade and grade points are counted in the student’s grade point average. However, the original grade remains part of the permanent record. A course taken at SAGU must be repeated at SAGU.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Class Attendance Policy</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Unlike some forms of learning, a residential program of education is designed as an in-class learning experience. In this instructional setting, the ability to pass examinations and complete outside projects is only a partial measure of the knowledge, skills, understanding, and appreciation a student may or may not have. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for each student to establish and maintain regular and punctual class attendance. Students may leave class early only by special permission of their instructor. Those scheduled for chapel ministry generally need no more than 5 minutes for preparation.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>This policy is designed to assist students in the following ways: 1) to provide the necessary support for new students and at-risk students, 2) to provide a process of developing personal responsibility as students mature through their programs, 3) to provide latitude for students who represent SAGU on University sponsored activities under the direct guidance of designated sponsors.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Attendance is taken during every class meeting and begins on the first day each class begins for the semester (even if a student registers late for the class). SAGU’s attendance policy takes into account the possibility that students may need to be absent from class on occasion due to serious illness or unavoidable circumstances. Absences which exceed the allowable number of times a class meets, regardless of the nature or reason for the absences, will result in the student being automatically administratively dropped from the course, receiving a grade of “WP, WF, or WC” depending on the type of the class and what grade the student earned. (The student will be assessed the established course withdrawal fee.)</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>*Excuses will be approved via Academic Services by the Assistant Dean for Student Success.</P>

<P>If a class meets twice a week, when a student is late twice it qualifies as an absence. If a class meets three times a week, then three tardies constitute an absence. Students missing fifteen minutes of a class will be counted absent.</P>

<P>A student who is absent from a class is responsible to make the appropriate advanced arrangements with the faculty member for possible make-up work. The faculty member will have the prerogative to determine if a student may make up any examinations or outside assignments due to a student’s absence, along with the time frame in which the work must be completed. Students may receive reduced or no credit for work missed in class due to absence, however, no point reduction will be imposed upon a student’s final grade for absenteeism.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Online Course Attendance Policy (Course Enrollment Verification)</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Because SAGU faces a lawful responsibility and a financial aid liability with regard to student progress in courses following online registration, the following policy concerning online course enrollment verification is in effect:  Each student shall complete a Course Enrollment Verification (CEV) through Blackboard by the date designated in the academic calendar or communicated to the student during the online registration process. (The School of Distance Education or the Registrar’s Office may be contacted for more information or the official due date.) Students who fail to complete this requirement will be denied access to their course(s) in which the CEV is incomplete. Access will again be granted only after the student completes the CEV requirement through consultation with the School of Distance Education. Should the CEV remain incomplete by the 8th week of the semester (6th week for summer) the School of Distance Education will initiated an automatic administrative withdrawal for the course.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Tardy Policy</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Students missing fifteen minutes of a class will be counted as absent for that session. Every three tardies acquired in classes that meet three times a week and every two tardies acquired in classes that meet twice a week will be considered as an absence. The student is responsible, at the end of class, to identify his/her tardiness to the professor.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Course Withdrawal (Drop)</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>A student will be allowed to withdraw from a course (except in the case of alleged academic dishonesty) only within the first two-thirds of the semester (i.e., tenth week of the fall and spring semesters). A grade of “W” will be recorded on the student’s transcript for the class dropped. Consult the academic calendar for the last day to withdraw from classes.</P>

<P>Students failing to follow the correct procedure or meet the deadline in withdrawing from a class will receive a grade as determined by the instructor. Students desiring to withdraw from a course must file a change of schedule in the Registrar’s Office. This change must be approved by the faculty advisor and instructor. A fee is charged; consult the current Schedule of Fees.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Automatic Administrative Withdrawal (Distance Education)</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Because SAGU faces a lawful responsibility and a financial aid liability with regard to “unofficial withdrawals,” the following policy concerning automatic administrative withdrawal is in effect: Each student in an online course must complete two progress reports – designated “Progress Report #1” and “Progress Report #2” - during the semester of study. Both reports will be submitted through Blackboard by the date designated in the academic calendar. Progress Report #1 will be due from the student during the 4th week of the semester (3rd week for summer), and Progress Report #2 will be due during the 8th week of the semester (6th week for summer).</P>

<P>If no progress report has been received by the 4th week (3rd week for summer), the instructor will report to the School of Distance Education. If no progress report has been received by the 8th week (6th week for summer), the instructor will report to the School of Distance Education and the Registrar for the purpose of automatic administrative withdrawal from the course. In the event of administrative withdrawal from an undergraduate course, a grade of Withdrawn Passing (WP) or Withdrawn Failing (WF) will be assigned and a fee will be assessed. In the event of administrative withdrawal from a graduate course, a grade of Withdrawn (W) will be assigned and a fee will be assessed.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>School Withdrawal</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Students needing to withdraw from school must file an official withdrawal notice in the Registrar’s Office before the last day of classes. Students failing to follow the proper procedure in withdrawing are not eligible for any refund and will receive grades in all courses as determined by the instructors. Transcripts cannot be released until proper clearance is arranged.</P>

<P>Academic Forgiveness</P>

<P>A student who returns to SAGU after an extended absence and who demonstrates ability to do well academically, as described below, may use Academic Forgiveness to remove the effect of earlier unsatisfactory grades.</P>

<P>	1.	To be eligible, a student must:</P>

<P>		a.  Matriculate to SAGU after an absence of at least 7 consecutive years;</P>

<P>		b.  Have attempted at least 12 letter-graded hours since readmission;</P>

<P>		c.  Have earned at least a 2.00 GPA in all courses attempted since readmission;</P>

<P>		d.  Submit application for Academic Forgiveness, along with a $250 non-refundable application fee, to the Registrar’s Office during the student’s first semester of being readmitted before the last day of late registration;</P>

<P>	2.  After the student applies for Academic Forgiveness and after eligibility is verified, the following adjustments will be made to the student’s academic record:</P>

<P>		a.  GPA calculation will start fresh as of the new matriculation date;</P>

<P>		b.  Previous coursework will be graded on a credit (CR) or no-credit (NC) basis;</P>

<P>		c.  Courses with a letter grade of “C-” or higher will receive a credit (CR) grade;</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>SCHOOL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>SAGU’s School of Distance Education (SDE) program is designed to extend the resources of the University outside of its walls. Located throughout the world are a number of adults who desire to continue their education without relocating to a university campus. SAGU has developed a program where one may obtain an accredited education without relocating family or career. Through the School of Distance Education, a traditional Bible-based educational experience may be obtained through a quality academic format.</P>

<P>The School of Distance Education offers most University academic programs leading toward the Master of Arts, Master of Divinity, Master of Science, Master of Education, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Associate of Arts degrees.  Contact the School of Distance Education for a current list of program offerings.</P>

<P>Each degree program is uniquely designed for the adult student to earn a degree without moving to the campus. There is also an opportunity to earn up to 45 credits toward a baccalaureate degree (not available for students pursuing an A.A. degree, Education Majors, graduate or doctoral students) from experiential learning. This may be limited by a student’s previous college work or amount of experience. Up to 96 hours of transfer credit can be accepted (limit of 31 hours of non-traditional credit).</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Who fits this Program?</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Each semester, students from around the world who are at least 22 years of age enroll for course work in the School of Distance Education. Because of the flexibility of the program, a diverse group of students utilize the services of the School of Distance Education. Among those who benefit from this program are:</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>A Different Way to Learn — How It Works </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Students have the opportunity to complete online academic advising and counseling with an academic advisor each semester regarding their degree progress.  During the semester, students work under the professors’ auspices via online interaction, the use of the toll-free number and email. Students have access to all college services, including the Library, Career Services, and Counseling. Student pictures appear in the Yearbook. Students also receive an ID card upon enrollment, which is useful for admittance to libraries around the country.</P>

<P>Many adults want some interaction time with other students and their professors, and yet not be required to move to a university campus. SAGU has joined the best of two worlds. Each new student begins the program with the Strategies for Student Success course (GES 1122). With the combination of an online orientation during the first semester, online interaction, and private study, individuals are able to obtain a quality degree which provides flexibility to “wrap around” personal schedules and commitments.</P>

<P>Ongoing Enrollment: Each subsequent semester, students complete course selection and registration online. Following registration, students are given access to the online courses for which they have registered. Students should purchase textbooks and study materials online from the University Bookstore as soon as possible after course schedules are approved. Students may contact the University Library to access other online resources and even check out books. Once the semester commences students will complete all assignments and/or exams under the supervision of their professors.</P>

<P>Work From Home: Each course syllabus is structured to provide step-by-step assistance through course assignments.  Online courses contain important content. Exams are taken online. Many assignments and projects are designed to take advantage of one’s particular work situation, thus increasing the quality of a person’s learning experiences. All assignments are graded promptly by the professors, and the students are notified of the results. The professor is as close as a computer, telephone, or email message.</P>

<P>Any time students have questions regarding course material, professors may be contacted by email or by telephone. All professors are fully recognized and academically qualified members of SAGU’s faculty. In addition, all academic programs and all courses taught through Distance Education employ the same learning outcomes as their on-campus counterparts. This insures that the skills and knowledge expected of Distance Education students are equivalent to those expected of fellow on-campus students.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Courses</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Each semester a course schedule is published identifying the particular courses being offered the next semester. These schedules are uploaded to the Student Portal for review and selection.</P>

<P>Although a full-time load is considered 12 hours each semester, many students have found it advantageous to adjust their hours depending upon their projected personal schedule for that semester.</P>

<P>Time management and load determination are important issues discussed during the Strategies for Student Success course.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Enrollment Procedure</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>All adult students (22 years and older) admitted into SAGU are eligible to apply for enrollment in the SDE program. All required steps for enrollment can be completed online. Please refer to the section entitled “Admissions” for complete details.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Strategies for Student Success Course</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Upon admittance into the SDE program, the student is ready to enroll in Strategies for Student Success (GES 1122). Students must successfully complete the two hour for credit course GES 1122 to be eligible to continue in the Distance Education program. Students who convert from the on-campus program and have already taken the on campus version of Strategies for Student Success are required to re-take the course in its Distance Education version. The purposes of this course are:</P>

<P>1.  To design a personal study program which equips the student with proper time management skills</P>

<P>2.  To introduce the University services to which all students have access</P>

<P>3.  To explain how to do a career analysis for the purpose of obtaining University credit for experience</P>

<P>4.  To provide information on how to obtain University credit by testing</P>

<P>5.  To give an opportunity to select the second semester’s course work and meet with an academic advisor.</P>

<P>6.  To answer all questions</P>

<P>7.  To discuss current issues in adult education.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Student Life</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU is a denominationally sponsored university.  All students, whether on-campus or in distance education, are expected to embrace standards of conduct that are represented by a deep consecration and devotion to Christ, clean conduct and conversation, modest apparel in dress and high biblical standards of moral conduct.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Credit for Experiential Learning</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>(This does not apply to Education majors, graduate and doctoral students, or students pursuing an AA degree.)</P>

<P>Students that have been out of high school at least five years can apply for credit on the basis of experiential learning and receive up to a maximum of 45 credit hours toward their degree requirements. Non-traditional credit includes credit for Advanced Placement scores, ACT scores, CLEP scores, up to 12 hours of correspondence and Experiential Learning Credit. Generally, credit is given for Experiential Learning in specific course areas such as Biblical Preaching, Church Ministries, Counseling, Music, Criminal Justice, Business, etc. Students must apply these credits toward the requirements of their particular degree plan. These credits do not count toward residency requirements. However, students seeking experiential learning credit will register for the course APS 3313 Portfolio Development, which counts as residency credit. This course must be taken during the first semester of enrollment.</P>

<P>Students receive an Experiential Learning Credit Manual when they enroll in the course APS 3313 Portfolio Development. The Manual describes the level of experiential learning and competency that is required in each course area. </P>

<P/>

<P>At the close of the semester, students present their portfolios for evaluation to the Portfolio Assessment Committee.  This committee is comprised of SAGU faculty members representing the various disciplines at the University. After the committee evaluates the student’s portfolio, the student is required to meet with the committee in person or via phone conference.  The committee will approve or deny credit for the portfolio. This committee will also determine the number of hours awarded as credit. </P>

<P>National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (NC-SARA)</P>

<P>SAGU is an institutional participant in the SARA initiative which is a voluntary, regional approach to state oversight of distance education. As a participating institution students living in other states are able to enjoy expanding access to educational offerings at SAGU and the University is committed to continually enhance the overall quality of our distance education program.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>INTRODUCTION</New_Style_Sheet>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>From Dr. Paul Brooks, Vice President for Academics: </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>SAGU manages its undergraduate academic program out of three colleges which are served by qualified faculty who have academic training and life experience appropriate to their disciplines.</P>

<P>Underlying our majors is a curriculum of GENERAL EDUCATION.</P>

<P>SAGU provides degree programs, which lead to competency in various academic disciplines.  At the same time, students enjoy a substantial course of studies in general education curriculum. This core curriculum promotes the growth of knowledge and character as presented through a variety of broad-based and yet foundational disciplines.</P>

<P>These fundamental curricula include studies in Communication Arts, Psychology, Humanities, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Physical Education, and Biblical Studies.  The specifics of these required studies are presented within each of the degree programs.  At SAGU, all students in baccalaureate and associates programs have significant study requirements in Bible, theology and ministry. For those interested, this achievement can directly prepare them to apply for ministerial credentials with the Assemblies of God. The General Education curriculum assists students in the achievement of their academic, career, and spiritual goals by improving their skills in reading comprehension, oral and written communication, research and analytical thinking, as well as science and math.</P>

<P>The General Education curriculum develops seven competencies that highlight proficient communication, critical thinking, and application in life. SAGU evaluates student achievement of the competencies through course-integrated assessments, which allows the institution to gauge students’ achievements in accordance with the mission of the University. </P>

<P>Competency 1: Students will write effectively.</P>

<P>Competency 2: Students will communicate ideas effectively through oral presentation.</P>

<P>Competency 3: Students will evaluate, synthesize and employ needed information for research and problem-solving.</P>

<P>Competency 4: Students will critique worldviews and issues, past and present, represented in literature and the sciences.</P>

<P>Competency 5: Students will articulate foundational knowledge of Scripture and of Christian theology.</P>

<P>Competency 6: Students will demonstrate knowledge of the principles of human interpersonal relationships and behavior.</P>

<P>Competency 7: Students will formulate a Christ-centered response to social issues and problems.</P>

<P/>

<P>The College of Bible and Church Ministries exists to promote a comprehensive program of training for life and ministry, offering a variety of programs leading toward Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Associate of Arts, and Associate of Science degrees. Their companies of academically qualified instructors are rich with experience, providing mature perspective to all who study at SAGU.</P>

<P>The College believes in the generation that God is raising up to follow His will into fruitful servant leadership. Christ is still building His Church (Matthew 16.18). Thus SAGU is poised to contribute to the process of equipping strong, wise, and able men and women of God, who will walk with integrity of heart, produce an abundance of fruit that remains, and bear witness to the glorious gospel of Christ.</P>

<P>In the pursuit of its mission, the College emphasizes a sweeping program of hermeneutics (the science of Scripture interpretation), knowing that the entrance of God’s Word gives light, and that only by the Word of the Lord are lives rescued, rebuilt and released into productive service. Students matriculating through these programs come out as unashamed workmen “handling accurately the Word of truth” (2 Timothy 2.15).</P>

<P>As you review the programs offered, it should become clear that no matter what practical ministry is engaged, whether pastoral, youth, children, music, counseling or otherwise, fidelity to the eternal Word lies at the core of its design. It is my high confidence that when you complete your academic journey, you will possess the tools you need to serve the calling of God upon your life in an exceptional way.</P>

<P>The College of Business and Education and the College of Music and Communication Arts both exist to promote a comprehensive program of training for life and ministry, offering a variety of programs leading toward the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Associate of Arts, and Associate of Science degrees. SAGU holds that all men and women are called to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Peter 4.10; Romans 12.1-8). Some stand in the pulpit; many more stand in the marketplace. Whether educators, musicians, or entrepreneurs, God has a plan to use each one for His glory. The Colleges are here to foster that faith in all their students by way of carefully designed Bible-based curriculum in addition to the regular attendance of chapel. Every student who leaves this University has a lot to offer to the ministries of the local church and the mission of the gospel in this world.</P>

<P>Some rightly ask, “Why go to a Bible university to study business, literature, education, or history? Wouldn’t it be better stewardship to get the most affordable education at a local college?” The answer, though simple, is profound. It is not good stewardship to sacrifice the future and God’s truth to the classrooms of the intelligent who are divorced from the knowledge of God and His purposes. This conviction contributes to the unique role of SAGU in the world of higher education. The education delivered at SAGU is on a university level, and recognized by its peers as a quality program. Yet more than that, every day at SAGU the power of a biblical world-view saturates the courses, whether in history, literature, business ethics, music, or teacher education. All students are challenged to excellence in their discipline of study, and in their devotion to Christ and His Kingdom.</P>

<P>SAGU instructors are fully qualified in their respective disciplines. They also know the Lord, and many instructors hold ministerial credentials. SAGU instructors are active in local church ministries, and some go beyond that regularly, while others participate in periodic mission trips. These hearts are deep wells of love for the students who come through their courses. It’s no wonder that many students follow their examples and build a career as a platform to serve the ministry God has given them.  </P>

<P>I invite you to take a few moments to read the following introductions from our Deans.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet>COLLEGE DEANS</New_Style_Sheet>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>From the Dean of the College of
Bible and Church Ministries</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>As the Apostle Paul wrote, what a great joy it is to be called according to God’s purpose, to spend our days engaged in those things that matter for eternity! Every semester, we see the clear evidence that God is continually inviting more of us to His kingdom work,  ordinary people that God has called, gifted and empowered. You may be one of them! You have experienced God’s grace, heard His voice, and felt His power. You’ve said “Yes” to the Lord but now you need help to prepare yourself to serve effectively.</P>

<P>The faculty of the College of Bible and Church Ministries exists to prepare church leaders who have keen minds, sharpened skills and passionate hearts! Whether our students respond to the exploding demand that exists for children’s pastors, the exciting opportunities in youth ministry, the challenging task of church planting or revitalization, the leading of the local church’s disciple-making ministries, its worship, mission efforts, or the critical task of pastoral ministry, we are determined that they will be prepared professionally and spiritually. The church and our world are desperate for skilled people with Christian values and convictions to serve in both the behavioral sciences and its various community services. We will help supply them.</P>

<P>The College of Bible and Church Ministries faculty has dedicated itself to the mission of preparing leaders who can mobilize the local church to represent Jesus Christ in our world in the power of the Holy Spirit. Ministry in and through the local church is our passion! We believe the local church exists to be the primary means by which God reveals Himself to this world. SAGU wants missionary passion to throb in the heart of every one of its graduates! We are convinced that divinely called, gifted, skilled and prepared leaders who serve in the power and passion of the Holy Spirit provide the key to impacting our world with the gospel.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>From the Dean of the College of Music and Communication Arts:</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>The College of Music and Communication Arts (CMCA) was established in 2013 to organize three academic disciplines that have synergistic qualities under one academic covering. Audio, video, and language are synergistic in construction and presentation, and are often dependent on each other for full creative and artistic expression. Accordingly, the College encompasses Music, Communication Arts and English academic programs, all three of which form natural complements in curriculum and in their use of the Hagee Communication Center.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>The Hagee Communication Center (HCC) serves as the home of the CMCA, housing state-of-the-art media technology and equipment, specially-designed rehearsal and performance facilities, and faculty offices for the three departments. The facilities are equipped with special places for performance, including a 600-seat performing arts auditorium for music performance, theatre and special events, with a 2,000 square foot stage and 50 foot fly-loft for theatrical rigging and special effects. Another performance venue is a black-box theater for one-act plays, spoken word, poetry reading and open-microphone events.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>For student musicians, the facility provides sound-isolation Wenger SoundLok® practice rooms equipped with VAE® digital acoustic manipulation, recording and playback technology, dedicated, acoustically-enhanced rehearsal halls for both instrumental and vocal programs, and piano and music theory labs (SAGU is an All-Steinway school).</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>For students in our digital media programs, the HCC provides labs with audio and video editing suites, a television broadcast studio, audio recording studios and film screening room, featuring SONY cameras, rigging and OLED® displays, Newtek Tri-caster™ video production technology, and audio mixing and recording components from Euphonix, Solid State Logic and Digico.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Beyond the extensive enablement that the HCC provides for our academic programs in the CMCA, the mission of the College essentially translates into two practical goals:</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>n	The raising up of graduates who can perform and publish a variety of music, literature and media in support of the mission of the local church and its pursuit of the Great Commission, and </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>n	The development of graduates - world changers - who can bring redemption to our world’s music- and media-rich culture, and turn its influence toward divine purposes.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Accordingly, the CMCA supports ministry callings for both vocational (full-time) and marketplace ministry.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>The B.A. to MOL track provides students an opportunity to fast track an outstanding undergraduate ministry preparation program into a master’s degree in Organizational Leadership. This program is for students who are academically strong and highly motivated. The B.A. to MOL track requires formal admittance to Harrison Graduate School. Students need a 2.75 minimum Grade Point Average to apply for admission to the Graduate School in this program and they must apply and gain admittance to the Graduate School by the end of their 3rd year. Students who successfully complete this track will graduate from SAGU with a bachelor’s degree in Church Leadership and a 36 credit hour Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership (MOL). This accelerated Master’s degree consists of 6 hours of graduate level “shared credit” and an additional 30 hours of graduate course work identified in the graduate catalog. All graduation requirements in the Graduate School must be met to receive the MOL. Please see the Harrison Graduate School catalog.  Students will need to achieve a 3.0 GPA on all graduate work to earn a graduate degree from SAGU.</P>

It requires formal admittance to Harrison Graduate School during the second semester of the student’s junior year. The student will be required to have a minimum cumulative Grade Point Average of 2.75 for acceptance. Once accepted, the student will be allowed to take one graduate course each of their last two semesters which will be transferrable to Harrison Graduate School or other graduate theological venues upon conferral of their bachelor’s degree.</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>Applied Music </New_Style_Sheet_2>

<P>Private instruction is offered each semester in the various phases of applied music. Each credit involves a 30-minute private lesson and a minimum of 5 hours practice each week. Music majors without basic skills may be required to take additional instruction beyond what is suggested in the degree plan to meet proficiency requirements.</P>

<P>Each student will register in his/her major primary applied field and will continue to register for lower-level study until proficiency is attained. Unsatisfactory performance on the proficiency examination for upper-level standing will necessitate continued lower-level study until the student passes the qualifying examination.</P>

<P>Upon the recommendation of the teacher, a student may take the examination for advanced standing earlier than the completion of the prerequisite number of semester hours. However, all students must complete the required total number of semester hours in music as specified on the degree plan. </P>

<P>Grades in applied music represent an estimate of the student’s progress. However, a level of proficiency must be met for admittance to upper-level study.</P>

<Normal>ENGLISH</Normal>

<P>The heart of this English department is the study of language used effectively to communicate. The study may be of technical writing, well-known literary works, or original student writing, any of which contain, at the core, transforming themes and ideas that reflect a writer’s worldview. </P>

<P>Goals of SAGU English B.A. common to other universities’  English programs:</P>

<P>	1. To ignite in students a love for literature, writing, and thoughtful expression</P>

<P>	2. To be a catalyst for students’ critical thinking about themes and worldviews embedded in 		    literary conversations from the past to the present that related to major life issues</P>

<P>	3. To empower students to develop their own voices as they sharpen their thinking and 		    writing skills to share in the ongoing literary conversations</P>

<P/>

<P>Distinctives of SAGU English B.A.</P>

<P>The SAGU English program provides a scriptural and spiritual dynamic by equipping its majors with the skills to critically and thoughtfully engage contemporary culture with a sound apologetic. Students are encouraged to allow the Holy Spirit to guide them in their works, in order to be salt and light in today’s society.</P>

<P>Also, the SAGU TESOL track gives the opportunity for our students to interact with people of other cultures through teaching conversational English and, thereby, to engage in ministry.</P>

<P/>

<P>Expected Outcomes for English Majors</P>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>A student with an Associate of Science degree in Health Science will be enabled to pursue a BSN program (as described below) or other health-related professions, and to be a missionary to new marketplaces needing health care related careers within the United States and abroad. This type of program provides a foundation for further studies and specialization in addition to opening entry level employment doors in health care or health records administration.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

<New_Style_Sheet_2>A pathway to a bachelor’s degree in Nursing is available to SAGU students who complete their Associates degree in Health Science. SAGU has an agreement with LeTourneau University (LETU) to provide special opportunities for students who meet LeTourneau admissions requirements. Those who enroll with this intent to transfer will enjoy a special relationship with the LeTourneau Nursing faculty from the first semester of study. Some LETU course work will be included in the Associate of Science in Health Science curriculum and students will be invited to participate in LETU nursing projects such as global service learning opportunities, campus lab events, and nursing organizations such as the Student Nurses Association and Nurses Christian Fellowship. More information on this process can be accessed via SAGU’s Admissions office or the Office of the Dean of the College of Business and Education.</New_Style_Sheet_2>

Graduates of the program will be qualified to work in entry level human service career fields related to one of the human service academic specializations.  This degree will additionally provide preparation for graduate study in the student’s chosen human services area.

This degree prepares graduates for marketplace vocational positions in various private and public human service agencies. This may include mental health facilities, social service organizations, nonprofit faith-based facilities, government agencies and private companies.

Music majors without basic skills may be required to take additional instruction beyond what is suggested in the degree plan to meet proficiency requirements.</P>

<P/>

<P>Each student will register in his/her major primary applied field and will continue to register for lower-level study until proficiency is attained. Unsatisfactory performance on the proficiency examination for upper-level standing will necessitate continued lower-level study until the student passes the qualifying examination. </P>

<New_Style_Sheet>SOCIAL WORK</New_Style_Sheet>

<P>The Social Work program prepares students academically, professionally and spiritually for quality educational and professional Christian service by providing knowledge and training in generalist social work and related disciplines. Students learn basic foundations, knowledge, research skills, policies, issues, practice methods, and social service delivery systems coupled with an understanding of a Christian perspective and ministry-related community outreach faith-based endeavors. This degree is part of the overall University academic program which is accredited by Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. Program accreditation is a separate commendation from an entity outside of SAGU’s regional accreditation. While SAGU pursues this additional acclaim, the degree now offered enables students to have a strong academic foundation for entry-level social work positions as well as admission to graduate social work professional programs. Available upon student request, the Department Chair can provide material identifying such entry level positions as well as graduate schools where SAGU students have been accepted into MSW programs. Students anticipating a professional career in social work should plan on pursuing a graduate degree in Social Work (MSW).  </P>
