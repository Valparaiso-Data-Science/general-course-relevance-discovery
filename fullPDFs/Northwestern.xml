<P>A private, nonprofit institution founded in 1851, Northwestern University is recognized nationally and internationally for the quality of its educational programs at all levels. Innovative teaching and pioneering research take place in a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary environment that combines the resources of a major research university with the level of individual attention of a small college. </P>

<P>Approximately 20,000 full- and part-time students are enrolled on Northwestern’s lakefront campuses in Evanston and Chicago and branch campus in Qatar. More than 8,300 undergraduates study at the University’s largest campus in Evanston. </P>

<P>The University’s 3,300 full-time faculty members range from Nobel Prize laureates to Tony Award winners. In their ranks are members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Council of Learned Societies, and numerous other honorary and professional societies. </P>

<H5>A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW </H5>

<P>A year after nine Chicagoans met to establish a university “of the highest order of excellence” to serve the people of America’s Northwest Territory, Northwestern University was officially incorporated in 1851. In 1853 the founders purchased a 379-acre tract of farmland along Lake Michigan 12 miles north of Chicago as a site for the new university. The town that grew up around Northwestern was named Evanston in honor of John Evans, one of the University founders. </P>

<P>Northwestern began classes in fall 1855 with two faculty members and 10 male students. In 1869 it enrolled its first female students, thereby becoming a pioneer in the higher education of women. By 1900 the University was composed of a liberal arts college and six professional schools, including the schools of law and medicine, with a total of 2,700 students. In the 20th century, schools were added in management, engineering, education, journalism, and continuing studies. With the establishment of the Graduate School in 1910, Northwestern adopted the German university model of providing graduate as well as undergraduate instruction and stressing research along with teaching. Recent years have seen a proliferation of academic programs and the opening of the Qatar campus. </P>

<P>Today, with the academic divisions listed on pages 7 to 9, Northwestern enjoys a position as one of the country’s leading private research universities. </P>

<H5>THE UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Academic Excellence </H5>

<P>Despite their relatively small numbers, Northwestern undergraduates enjoy a great range of educational choices, including more than 200 formal academic concentrations as well as opportunities to do research and special projects, study abroad, and pursue internships. Students frequently complete two majors or two degrees, and some construct and receive approval for their own programs of study. About three-fourths of Northwestern’s undergraduates engage in internships, practicums, paid cooperative education programs, applied research, study abroad, and other off-campus experiences, often for academic credit. All benefit from a level of faculty involvement unusual for undergraduates at major universities, with faculty teaching a large proportion of classes as well as inviting students to participate in research. </P>

<P>At the heart of a Northwestern education is the belief that a solid foundation in the liberal arts is essential, regardless of one’s future plans. Students in all six undergraduate schools may take courses in science, mathematics and technology, individual and social behavior, historical studies, the humanities, and fine and performing arts. Moreover, Northwestern’s emphasis on effective communication, regardless of field of study, fosters the ability to think analytically and write and speak clearly and persuasively. </P>

<P>Northwestern’s many interdisciplinary research centers have profound implications for undergraduate education. Their research often alters theory and practice within an academic discipline and leads to new curricula. More immediately, many research centers have special programs for undergraduates, who may apply for research grants to fund independent scholarly projects. In recent years many new research centers have been established, especially in science and technology. See research.northwestern.edu for a list of the University’s research centers. </P>

<P>The University • Student Demographics • Campuses and Schools </P>

<Sect>
<P>Other academic resources available to Northwestern students include the 10th-largest library collection among US private universities (www.library.northwestern.edu). Northwestern University Information Technology supports students’ academic needs with extensive online services, computer labs, and wired and wireless access from nearly anywhere on campus (it.northwestern.edu). </P>

<P>Underpinning the breadth of a Northwestern education is the quarter system, which gives students the opportunity to take more courses than under a traditional semester system. Most undergraduates attend for three quarters each year (fall, winter, and spring). They typically take 4 courses each quarter and 12 courses in an academic year. </P>

<H5>Outside the Classroom </H5>

<P>In its extracurricular offerings as well as in its academic programs, Northwestern encourages its students to develop holistically and to prepare for life in a diverse, interconnected, and rapidly changing world. </P>

<P>Supported by the Center for Student Involvement, the more than 500 extracurricular groups include organizations devoted to service on campus and in the community, cultural awareness and support, musical and theatrical performance, entertainment programming, political activism, career preparation, and countless mutual interests. The full list is available at northwestern.campuslabs.com/engage. </P>

<P>A charter member of and the only private university in the Big Ten conference, Northwestern sponsors 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men’s and 11 women’s), as well as intramural, club, informal, and instructional sport and fitness programs. Fitness centers provide state-of-the-art facilities for exercise and recreation. Northwestern students even have their own beach and the opportunity to take sailing lessons. </P>
</Sect>

<P>About 4,000 undergraduates live in University-owned on-campus student residences that range widely in size, age, character, and suite arrangements; another 800 live in fraternity or sorority houses, and the remainder live off campus. Services available to undergraduates include counseling and psychological services, healthcare, career advising, and assistance in identifying employment, internship, and external-funding opportunities. Specialized offices and resource centers serve students with disabilities, LGBTQA students, international students, members of various religious denominations, women, and African American, Asian/Asian American, and Hispanic/Latino students. For all programs offered by the Division of Student Affairs, see northwestern.edu/studentaffairs. </P>

<Sect>
<P>In addition to enjoying numerous opportunities on campus, students benefit from Northwestern’s location in the first suburb north of Chicago. Downtown Evanston offers restaurants, shops, and a multiplex movie theater, and the cultural, entertainment, and sporting events of America’s third-largest city are just a short train ride away. </P>

<H5>STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS </H5>

<P>Northwestern recruits students of demonstrated academic achievement from diverse social, ethnic, and economic backgrounds. More than 90 percent of applicants rank in the top 10 percent of their high school classes, and Northwestern’s National Merit Scholar enrollment rate has recently ranked among the nation’s highest. About one in ten applicants is accepted. </P>

<P>All 50 states and more than 70 countries are represented among the undergraduate student body. International students make up roughly 10 percent of the class of 2019. More than 43 percent of the first-year class come from underrepresented backgrounds. About 62 percent of students receive financial assistance. </P>

<P>Both the federal government and the National Collegiate Athletic Association use as a measurement for reporting purposes the graduation rates of entering classes over six continuous years. Such rates at Northwestern have remained above 90 percent since 1991–92. See www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records /enrollment_and_graduation_statistics.html. </P>

<P>Northwestern may award credit for distinguished performance on certain foreign national examinations, and the higher-level examinations of the International Baccalaureate. Students will receive credit only once for the same course of study even if mastery is demonstrated on multiple exams (e.g., mathematics AP and IB exams). Also, credit is awarded only for exams taken prior to matriculation at Northwestern. </P>

<P>Northwestern also may award credit for college courses taken by incoming first-year students before they enter the University. To qualify for such recognition, the courses must be similar to courses offered at Northwestern, must have been completed at a college or university whose accreditation is recognized by Northwestern, must not have been submitted in partial fulfillment of the normal secondary school graduation requirement, and must have been taken primarily by bona fide college students (i.e., high school graduates pursuing a college degree). </P>

<H5>Transfer Candidates </H5>

<P>Students may be considered for admission as transfers from another college or university provided they have completed one full year of university studies by the application deadline, are in good standing at their postsecondary institution, and have maintained at least a B average in rigorous academic courses. If students have been enrolled full-time at any institution except Northwestern, they cannot be considered for admission as first-year candidates and must meet the criteria to apply as transfer candidates. Undergraduate schools at Northwestern enroll transfer students in the fall quarter only. Transfer students must meet the relevant provisions of the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (see pages 17–18 for details). </P>

<P>Undergraduate Education • Financial Aid </P>
</Sect>

<P>nondegree-seeking students. Applicants must present official transcripts of previous study and show evidence of successful academic achievement. Persons who do not meet these requirements should not apply. </P>

<P>Enrollment as a special student does not constitute admission to any degree program at the University, and credits earned as a special student may not be counted toward a degree at Northwestern. (Exception: Special students who subsequently become eligible for admission into the School of Professional Studies may apply these credits toward a degree.) Special students are granted academic credit for coursework satisfactorily completed, and these credits may be transferred to another institution. </P>

<P>Special students are admitted with the understanding that they may register only after students working toward Northwestern degrees have registered. Some classes will be closed, and some schools or departments may not accept nondegree students. These restrictions do not apply to Summer Session. </P>

<P>Special students are not permitted to enroll in 399 or 499 Independent Study courses. </P>

<P>All tuition and fees for special students are charged at the undergraduate rate. Complete instructions and application forms may be obtained from the Office of Special Students, Northwestern University, 405 Church Street, Evanston, Illinois 60208.

<H5>FINANCIAL AID </H5>

<P>The University awards financial aid on the basis of need as determined by the financial circumstances of the family. Aid may consist of a scholarship, part-time employment, a loan, or a combination of these. The funds may come from state, federal, institutional, or private sources. Students are required to reapply for financial aid each year and maintain the requirements established by the Financial Aid Committee. The amount of aid may change based on the family’s financial circumstances. </P>

<P>For entering first-year students, financial aid is generally renewable for a maximum of 12 quarters of full-time enrollment or its equivalent. Students in the five-year dual degree programs are eligible to receive aid for a maximum of 15 quarters of full-time enrollment or its equivalent. Students must be enrolled in the dual degree program by the end of their sophomore year. A student who later decides to pursue only one degree reverts to a maximum eligibility of 12 quarters. </P>

<P>Transfer students are eligible for up to 9 quarters of institutional financial aid. Those needing additional quarters of aid are required to consult with an academic dean and to submit an appeal to the Financial Aid Committee. If a student has been enrolled and has not applied for or received financial aid, all quarters of enrollment to date count toward the maximum eligibility. </P>

<P>Students who are unable to complete their degree in the allotted quarters of assistance may petition the Financial Aid Committee for an additional quarter of eligibility. For information consult undergradaid.northwestern.edu /information-for/prospective-students.html. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Who Should Apply </H5>

<P>Any undergraduate students who believe they cannot afford the full cost of a Northwestern education may apply for financial aid. International students may apply for need-based financial aid, although financial need may factor into a final admission decision (whereas the review process is need-blind for US citizens and permanent residents). For more information see admissions .northwestern.edu/tuition-aid/international-student-aid. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Application Procedure </H5>

<P>Applicants request consideration for financial aid when submitting the Application for Admission. The Financial Aid Committee cannot make a decision until the University has admitted the applicant. Candidates should do the following: </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Registration Status and Financial Aid </H5>

<P>For financial aid purposes, full-time students are defined as those who are registered and billed for 3 to 5.5 units of credit in an academic quarter; those registered for 2 to </P>

<P>2.99 units are considered half-time; those registered for </P>

<Sect>
<P>Undergraduate Education • Financial Regulations </P>

<P>fewer than 2 units are less than half-time. (Note that students who register for more than 5.5 units may be subject to overload tuition charges, and some schools require these students to obtain the approval of the dean before registering.) All quarters of full-time registration are counted toward the maximum number of quarters of financial aid eligibility (12 quarters in most cases). Each quarter of half-time status counts as .5 quarter. Any quarter of less than half-time status is not counted toward the maximum eligibility. </P>

<P>Students with less than half-time status are not eligible for financial aid from Northwestern but may have limited eligibility for federal aid. Students awarded aid at full-time status who reduce to half-time or less than half-time status will have their aid adjusted accordingly. Students may not receive additional aid to pay any overload tuition charges they incur. </P>

<P>Students considering a change of registration status should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine how the change might affect their aid awards or quarters of eligibility. A detailed explanation of aid eligibility and adjustment policies is provided on the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid’s website, undergradaid .northwestern.edu. The Financial Aid Committee considers appeals for variances to these policies on a case-by-case basis. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>Satisfactory Academic Progress and Financial Aid </H5>

<P>Students are required to maintain satisfactory academic progress in order to stay eligible for federal student aid funds. For Northwestern students, SAP means the successful completion of at least 67 percent of the course units attempted in an academic year (e.g., a student who registers for a total of 12 quarter-courses a year must complete at least 8 to maintain SAP). Withdrawn, incomplete, and repeated courses are counted as attempted course units. </P>

<P>In addition, students must attain a GPA of 2.0 or better by the end of their second academic year and every year thereafter in order to meet SAP requirements. This GPA minimum may differ from a school’s academic requirements, which are outlined in its chapter in this catalog. </P>
</Sect>

<P>A student may not continue to receive federal aid beyond a maximum time frame, which is 150 percent of the degree program’s published length as measured in academic units. All transfer credits are counted toward the maximum time frame. The total number of units required for a bachelor’s degree is specified in each school’s chapter in this catalog; the website of the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid notes the maximum time frames calculated in terms of credits required for degree completion. </P>

<Sect>
<P>A student who fails to maintain SAP as described above will lose financial aid eligibility. He or she will receive notification from the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid and have the opportunity to appeal the cancellation and request a probationary period of aid. The appeal must be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid within two weeks of SAP failure notification. In some cases, an appeal will not be considered until the student has met with his or her academic adviser to determine an academic plan for completing the degree. </P>

<P>If awarded a probationary quarter of aid through the appeal process, the student must successfully complete 67 percent of the coursework attempted during the probationary quarter. Students who are required to submit an academic plan must meet its conditions in order to satisfy SAP requirements. SAP failure during the probationary quarter will result in the loss of further financial aid eligibility. </P>

<P>A student who is denied a probationary quarter or forgoes the appeal process may reestablish eligibility by successfully meeting SAP requirements without federal or institutional assistance. </P>

<P>Students returning to the University after academic dismissal must submit an SAP appeal before they will be considered for financial assistance. </P>

<P>When students have been in attendance at Northwestern for 12 quarters or the equivalent, they are not eligible for further institutional financial assistance even if they continue to maintain SAP. The only exceptions are students admitted to the liberal arts and music, communication and engineering, communication and music, education and music, engineering and music, or journalism and music five-year dual degree programs; these students are eligible for University funds for up to 15 quarters of enrollment. Students pursuing other dual degree opportunities are eligible for federal and state funding only. </P>

<P>The Financial Aid Committee may grant a continuation of aid when unusual circumstances exist and students demonstrate academic promise. More detailed information regarding satisfactory academic progress is available on the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid’s website. </P>

<H5>UNDERGRADUATE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT </H5>

<P>The Undergraduate Registration Requirement applies to undergraduate students seeking a bachelor’s degree and must be completed in addition to the degree requirements established by the various school faculties. Each school specifies a minimum number of units of credit needed for a bachelor’s degree (45 or more, depending on the degree). The URR specifies the number of quarters a student must be registered at Northwestern and how much credit must be earned at Northwestern. It is predicated on the principle that when a student receives a bachelor’s degree from Northwestern University, the majority of the student’s academic work is completed at the University. </P>

<P>For the purposes of the URR, the following definitions apply: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Being “registered at Northwestern” for a quarter means that during that quarter the student is registered for and completes Northwestern coursework worth at least 2 full units of credit under the supervision of Northwestern faculty members. Eligible coursework includes, for instance, the practicum in the School of Education and Social Policy and the Journalism Residency in the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. It does not include the Walter P. Murphy Cooperative Engineering Education Program or most study abroad credits (see exception below). </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>For counting number of quarters, a credit-bearing course is considered completed if a student receives any of the following grades: A, B, C (including pluses and minuses), D, F, P, N, X, Y, K, or W. Courses in which the student receives an NR are not included. The NR is an administrative notation rather than a grade. </LBody>
</LI>

<H5>Registration in the School of Professional Studies </H5>
</Sect>

<P>Northwestern University School of Professional Studies, with locations in Evanston, Chicago, and the Chicago Loop, offers courses designed primarily for working adults. Students enrolled in an undergraduate school at Northwestern may take SPS courses for credit only with the approval of their school’s dean or their faculty adviser. SPS students have priority, so enrollment of non-SPS undergraduate students in SPS courses is capped. Registrations are processed on the first day of the quarter, and priority is given to students who need a course to complete a major. </P>

<H5>Interschool Transfers </H5>

<P>Undergraduate students who wish to transfer from one school or college of the University to another must have an interschool transfer approved by the dean’s office of each school. A return to the original school must be approved in the same way. Approval of an interschool transfer is usually contingent on satisfactory performance in the original school. The policy concerning interschool transfer and application deadlines can be found at </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Cancellation of Registration </H5>

<P>Students who register for a quarter and later decide not to attend must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing before the first day of classes of the quarter to avoid being charged the applicable tuition and fees. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Withdrawal from the University </H5>

<P>Students who wish to withdraw from the University after registering for classes must file a withdrawal form (available at the Office of the Registrar) and have it approved by appropriate school and/or Student Affairs officials. If withdrawals are filed before the deadline to drop classes, that quarter’s registered courses will be removed from the transcript and a withdrawal notation added. After the drop deadline has passed, a withdrawal petition period begins during which students may request complete withdrawal from the term or from individual courses. Approved petitions will result in W grades. Withdrawals may no longer be requested after the final exam or the final assessment due date, or after 5 p.m. two Fridays before exams begin, whichever is sooner. Detailed procedures can be found at www.registrar.northwestern.edu. (See also Withdrawal from the University: Refunds under Financial Regulations.) </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Readmission to the University </H5>

<P>Undergraduate students who have not registered for one or more quarters of an academic year must file an application to reenter with their school dean’s office no later than six weeks before the first day of registration of the quarter in which they plan to return. </P>

<P>Application to reenter is not required if students have registered during the spring quarter and intend to return in the fall. </P>

<P>If a student interrupts a program of study for an extended period of time and if degree requirements are changed during this period, the new requirements normally must be met. Any modification of the requirements is made by the appropriate administrative officers of the school in which the student is registered. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Work at Other Institutions </H5>

<P>Students who wish to transfer credit for work taken elsewhere during an absence from Northwestern must obtain advance approval of their proposed course of study. A petition for credit for non-Northwestern courses may be filed at www.registrar.northwestern.edu/graduation/non_nu _transfer_credit.html. An official signed and sealed transcript documenting that work must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar in order for credit to be applied to the student’s record. </P>

<P>Students may not register concurrently at Northwestern and at another institution and receive transfer credit for work taken at the other institution unless permission is granted in advance by the office of the dean of their schools. This applies to traditional and online or blended-format courses. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Petition to Graduate </H5>

<P>Undergraduate students should submit a graduation petition one calendar year before they expect to graduate. Students in Weinberg College, the School of Communication, the School of Education and Social Policy, the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, and the Bienen School of Music submit petitions to the Office of the Registrar; McCormick School students submit petitions to their school’s academic services office. Failure to petition in a timely fashion may delay graduation or result in omission of the student’s name from the printed Commencement program. </P>

<H5>Grading Policies </H5>

<P>The following grading system is used in computing the grade point average: </P>

<P>Grade Grade Points </P>

<P>X Failed to earn credit: missed final examination 0 Y Failed to earn credit: work incomplete 0 </P>

<P>The following notations are ignored in computing the grade point average: P Pass with credit N No grade, no credit K In progress S Satisfactory: noncredit course U Unsatisfactory: noncredit course W Withdrawn by permission NR No grade reported by instructor </P>

<P>Class Rank </P>

<P>Northwestern University does not rank its students. </P>

<P>Pass/No Credit (P/N) </P>

<P>Many undergraduate courses are open to the P (pass) or N (no credit) option, which allows students to explore fields beyond their areas of specialization without concern about grade point average. Students may exercise the P/N option in classes designated with “Student Option” grading in CAESAR. For information about a particular school’s P/N policy, see that school’s chapter in this catalog. </P>

<P>Incomplete Coursework </P>

<P>At the end of a quarter a grade of X (missed final exam) or Y (work incomplete) will be given only if the instructor believes the student has a reasonable chance of passing the course by taking an examination or turning in the required work, or both. Some undergraduate schools prohibit the posting of X or Y grades without the approval of the dean’s office. Students should contact their school for its regulations concerning X and Y grades. </P>

<P>For credit to be awarded, the student must complete the course and the grade must be changed no later than the end of the following like term, or the incomplete will be changed to a final grade of F (failure). Students planning to graduate within that time frame must complete courses and receive grades before graduating. Incomplete grades remaining at the time of degree conferral will be changed to final grades of F (failure). No academic record changes, including grade changes, are allowed after a degree has A 4.0 </P>

<H5>Class Attendance and Absence </H5>

<P>Students are expected to attend all sessions of the courses for which they are registered. Excessive absence is cause for failure in the course. Some courses require attendance at the first class meeting; students may be dropped for nonattendance. Such courses are designated in CAESAR as “First Class Mandatory.” </P>

<H5>Grade Reports </H5>

<P>Quarterly grades are not mailed but are delivered online through CAESAR. Students may print a copy of their grades from CAESAR for verification purposes. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Northwestern University Transcripts </H5>

<P>Students who have satisfied all financial obligations to the University may request an official transcript of their academic record from the Office of the Registrar in person, by fax, or through CAESAR. Northwestern provides transcripts either on paper or in the form of a certified PDF that may be distributed securely. A fee is charged for all official transcripts (see Fees under Tuition and Fees). Current students may print unofficial copies for their personal use from CAESAR. </P>

<P>Except for internal educational uses or as otherwise required by law, Northwestern issues official transcripts only upon written authorization of the student concerned. Requests for transcripts initiated by persons or agencies other than the student or appropriate educational agencies will not be filled until written authorization has been secured from the student. When these requests can be anticipated, students can avoid delay by providing such authorization in advance. Because of the confidential nature of a student’s record, telephone or email requests for transcripts will not be accepted. </P>

<P>Former students may order an official transcript by following the instructions at www.registrar.northwestern .edu/academic_records/obtaining_a_transcript.html. The site provides full information on the University’s policies and procedures governing academic records. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Transcripts from Other Institutions </H5>

<P>Northwestern neither releases nor certifies copies of transcripts or other academic documents received from other schools or institutions. This includes test score reports and transcripts submitted to Northwestern for admission or evaluation of transfer or study abroad credits. Students who study abroad and subsequently need a transcript of their coursework must request it from the institutions they attended or through their study abroad programs. </P>

<H5>Access to Student Records </H5>

<P>Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, all students have certain rights with regard to their educational records. Northwestern’s student records policy is available at www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic _records/FERPA_policy.html. </P>

<P>Students’ rights under FERPA include </P>

<H5>The University’s Use of Email </H5>

<P>Email is the University’s mechanism for official communication with students, and Northwestern has the right to expect that students will read official email in a timely fashion. </P>

<P>All students are assigned a “u.northwestern.edu” address that is maintained in the University email directory. Northwestern provides a convenient mechanism for students who want to forward email from the University address to another email address of their choice, but students assume the risk of forwarding email. Failure to receive or read University communication that was sent to the “u.northwestern.edu” address does not absolve a student from knowing and complying with the content of the communication. </P>

<P>Faculty may use email for communicating with students registered in their classes so that all students will be able to comply with course requirements. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Academic Integrity </H5>

<P>Academic integrity at Northwestern is based on a respect for individual achievement that lies at the heart of academic culture. Every faculty member and student belongs to a community of scholars in which academic integrity is a fundamental commitment. </P>

<P>Students enrolled at Northwestern are expected to adhere to the University’s standards of academic integrity. Questions about the acceptability of specific behavior should be addressed to the appropriate faculty member or school dean. The following is a nonexhaustive list of types of behavior that violate the standards of academic integrity: </P>

<P>It is the responsibility of every member of the academic community to be familiar with the specific policies of his or her school. A student who violates these policies may be subject to sanctions, including but not limited to one or more of the following: a letter of warning; a defined period of probation with the attachment of conditions; a period of suspension with or without the attachment of conditions; course failure; notation on the official record; exclusion from the University, with notation on the transcript; or revocation of an awarded degree. A student may not change his or her registration in a course in which a violation of academic integrity has been alleged, regardless of whether the allegation has been referred to the designated school official. Nor may a student receive a University degree while a finding is pending or while a suspension has been imposed pursuant to a finding. Information on procedures that will be followed in cases of alleged violations of academic integrity may be obtained from the dean’s office of each school. This will include information regarding how decisions may be appealed to the appropriate University officials, up to and including the University provost.

<Sect>
<H5>Academic Probation </H5>

<P>Academic probation constitutes notice of unsatisfactory academic performance; it is a warning that minimum standards for graduation are not being met. Unless a student demonstrates significant scholastic improvement during the period of probation and thereby indicates ability to fulfill degree requirements within a reasonable period of time, the student may be dismissed from the University. </P>

<P>The following are ordinarily placed on academic probation: </P>

<L>

<Sect>
<H5>Removal from Academic Probation </H5>

<P>Students on academic probation are ordinarily removed from probation if the deficiencies that resulted in probation have been remedied during the next succeeding quarter in residence. Students are rarely removed from probation on the basis of a program consisting of less than 4 courses graded on a basis other than the pass/no credit option. </P>

<P>If students on probation who receive grades of X or Y are not dismissed, probation continues until they have completed all courses or until the end of the next quarter in residence, when the students’ records are again subject to scrutiny. </P>

<P>In no case are students removed from probation at the end of a quarter in which they have failed any course. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Academic Dismissal </H5>

<P>The following is a partial list of categories of students who may be dismissed for academic deficiencies (in every case the decision is determined in part by the student’s cumulative academic record): </P>

<H5>Graduation with School Honors </H5>

<P>Degrees with honors are determined by grades in all work at Northwestern University and are awarded to the top 25 percent of the students in each school who complete graduation requirements. Spring quarter graduates in the highest 5 percent of the school’s class are awarded degrees summa cum laude; those in the next 8 percent, magna cum laude; and those in the next 12 percent, cum laude. Graduation honors are not announced before June Commencement, and the GPA cutoffs for each level of honors based on the stated percentages are not made public. Students who complete degrees in the summer, fall, or winter quarter are awarded school honors based on the GPA cutoffs established by the prior spring quarter’s graduating class. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Graduation with Departmental Honors </H5>

<P>Departmental honors may be granted to graduating seniors who have done outstanding work in a department in connection with a research project or work of an integrative nature. Students are nominated for these honors by their departments. The faculty of the school concerned makes the final awards. See the school chapters of this catalog for more information on departmental honors. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Honorary Organizations and Prizes </H5>

<P>Students who qualify by reason of superior scholarship or other outstanding achievement are eligible for membership in certain honorary societies. Some of these recognize outstanding performance within one of the undergraduate schools, while others recognize distinction in a specific field of study, certain extracurricular options, or other endeavors. </P>

<P>In addition, several prizes established through gifts and endowments are awarded each year to undergraduate students. Some are all-University prizes, and others are available only to students in the school, department, or program that administers the awards.

<P>The Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME) provides an opportunity for highly talented high school seniors to be admitted to an undergraduate program and to the Feinberg School of Medicine and to complete their formal premedical and medical studies in seven or eight years. Each year a small number of students are admitted to the program and to Weinberg College, the School of Communication, or the McCormick School. For information on applying to HPME, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. For a description of the program, including requirements for students in the different undergraduate schools, see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. </P>

<P>Integrated Science Program </P>

<P>The Integrated Science Program (ISP) is a highly selective undergraduate program of integrated science studies within Weinberg College. The curriculum provides a thorough and rigorous background in the major scientific disciplines and mathematics and offers special research opportunities. ISP can lead to a bachelor’s degree in three years or, after a fourth year at Northwestern, to a double major or an advanced degree. For information on applying to ISP, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. For a description of the program, see page 112 in the Weinberg College chapter of this catalog and isp.northwestern.edu. </P>

<P>Accelerated Master’s Programs </P>

<P>Combined bachelor’s/master’s degree programs enable exceptional undergraduates in the McCormick School, the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, and Weinberg College to receive both degrees in less than the usual time.

<Sect>
<H5>Study Abroad </H5>

<P>northwestern.edu/studyabroad </P>

<P>Northwestern encourages qualified students to study abroad. With early planning, most students, regardless of school or major, should be able to study abroad during the academic year and still graduate within four years. Students may also study abroad during the summer on one of Northwestern’s summer programs or on an approved unaffiliated program. </P>

<P>The Study Abroad Office, the Office of International Program Development, and the Global Engagement Studies Institute provide information and advising to all students interested in study abroad. Students must submit a study abroad application, including signatures from school advisers and, in many cases, department advisers; approval is required before the study abroad experience. All students approved by Northwestern to study abroad remain registered at Northwestern while abroad. </P>

<P>Most Northwestern students studying abroad do so on one of more than 150 programs administered by or affiliated with the University. Students participating in University exchange programs and some programs administered by the University continue to pay Northwestern tuition. For all other programs, students pay the program fee plus a Northwestern administrative fee. Students participating in Northwestern-sponsored and affiliated programs may apply for financial aid, including Northwestern grant assistance, to help offset the cost of their programs. </P>

<P>Students who wish to participate in unaffiliated programs must petition for permission to apply. No financial aid is available from the University for students on unaffiliated programs, and Northwestern cannot process their outside aid. </P>

<P>Since study abroad often requires special language or other preparation, interested students should consult with study abroad advisers early in their Northwestern careers. Other resources include information sessions, an annual study abroad fair, and a resource library with detailed information on programs and study abroad policies. </P>

<H5>Support for Undergraduate Research Endeavors </H5>

<P>undergradresearch.northwestern.edu globalresearchopportunities.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Office of Undergraduate Research pursues three primary goals: administer its grant programs, which award more than $1,100,000 a year; coordinate University-wide efforts in undergraduate research and communicate these opportunities to students; and help students prepare for these experiences. The office aims to encourage as many students as possible to engage in research and creative projects. </P>

<P>The office’s flagship Undergraduate Research Grant program, funding research and creative work in any discipline, offers a $3,500 stipend for eight-week summer projects and up to $1,000 for research expenses during the academic year. To help students get started, the Undergraduate Research Assistant Program offers students funding to work as mentored research assistants on faculty projects. Other grants provide support for intensive language study during the summer or for conference travel. An annual $9,000 award—the Circumnavigators Travel-Study Grant, jointly funded by Northwestern University and the Circumnavigators Club Foundation—enables one undergraduate researcher to undertake around-the-world travel during the summer before senior year. </P>

<P>The office contributes to the Global and Research Opportunities website, allowing students easy, searchable access to opportunities within and beyond Northwestern. Because many students may be undertaking independent projects and applying for funds for the first time, the office offers one-on-one advising and regularly conducts information sessions and workshops, working with various partners on campus—from the schools, departments, labs, and other groups—to ensure that students receive guidance relevant to their research interests. Outstanding research projects are showcased each year at the annual Undergraduate Research and Arts Exposition, which features a Creative Arts Festival in addition to poster and panel presentations by undergraduate researchers. </P>

<P>Many schools and departments at Northwestern also provide funds to support undergraduate research. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Undergraduate Course Credits and Quarters </H5>

<P>Traditional undergraduate work in all the schools on the Evanston campus is on the quarter system. In a quarter-long course, students and faculty meet at least three hours per week, and students are awarded 1.0 unit of credit. Exceptions are courses that meet less than three hours per week, which carry less than 1.0 unit, and 15-week courses, which carry 1.5 units. </P>

<P>For purposes of transfer to other institutions or for certification stated in credit or semester hours, a quarter-long course bearing 1.0 unit of credit is generally the equivalent of 2²/3 (2.66) semester hours. In quarter hours, 1 quarter-long course is equal to 4 quarter hours of undergraduate credit. </P>

<H4 id="LinkTarget_735">Cross-School Options </H4>

<P>Northwestern values interdisciplinarity. Many Northwestern faculty are members of more than one department or program, and many of their academic endeavors cut across traditional fields of study. Similarly, many Northwestern students have interests that span traditional academic boundaries. </P>

<P>Each of Northwestern’s six undergraduate schools has its own unique curriculum, but many courses across the University are open to students from all six undergraduate schools. In addition, each school offers majors, minors, certificates, field studies, or other programs in which students from other schools may participate. Collaborative efforts involving more than one undergraduate school, an undergraduate school and a graduate program, or a University center or institute provide additional options for students. The University is committed to developing programs that build pedagogical and intellectual bridges between disciplines and across schools to create new interdisciplinary opportunities for undergraduates. </P>

<P>The Honors Program in Medical Education provides an opportunity for highly talented high school seniors to be admitted to an undergraduate program and to the Feinberg School of Medicine and to complete their formal premedical and medical studies in seven or eight years. Applicants should be able to qualify for advanced placement in chemistry and mathematics. Each year a small number of students are admitted to the program and to Weinberg College, the School of Communication, or the McCormick School. Only candidates applying directly from high school are considered. For information on applying, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. </P>

<P>The first three or four years of the program are spent in undergraduate study, during which students must complete coursework that meets HPME requirements—including chemistry, physics, and biological sciences courses and labs— as well as courses that meet their school’s HPME requirements. Special Undergraduate Registration Requirement provisions apply to HPME students; see page 17 in the Undergraduate Education chapter. To remain in the program, students must maintain designated grade point averages both in required science courses and overall. </P>

<P>In addition to the required science courses, HPME students enrolled in Weinberg College fulfill the college’s general education requirements by taking courses in four areas of inquiry: social and behavioral sciences, historical studies, ethics and values, and literature and fine arts. They complete at least one first-year seminar as well as other Weinberg College requirements. The third year is usually devoted to completing the requirements for a BA in Weinberg College by doing advanced coursework in the major and/or to studying abroad in a Northwestern-affiliated program. Students may also take an additional undergraduate year at Northwestern. </P>

<P>Students in the McCormick School spend three or four years pursuing an in-depth education in mathematics, the sciences, and engineering while taking core courses in biomedical engineering. To supplement their technical courses, students also take courses in the humanities and the social sciences. </P>

<P>Students in the School of Communication’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders supplement their HPME science requirements with courses in the social sciences, humanities, and the arts. At the same time, as majors in human communication sciences, they study the basic science principles underlying human communication and cognition, as well as hearing, speech, language, and learning disorders. Through exposure to both research and clinical activities, they consider the relationship between basic science and real-life health issues. </P>

<P>After the first three or four years, HPME students who meet the program requirements move to the Chicago campus as members of the first-year Feinberg School of Medicine class. After successfully completing their first year at the Feinberg School, Weinberg College students who have not received a BA degree qualify for a bachelor of science in medicine, and School of Communication students qualify for a bachelor of science in communication. McCormick School students either fully complete BS requirements in biomedical engineering during the undergraduate phase of their studies or qualify for the BS in biomedical engineering after successfully completing the second year at the Feinberg School. </P>

<H4 id="LinkTarget_736">Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences </H4>

<P>weinberg.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences—oldest of Northwestern’s 12 schools—has been the center of the University’s academic and intellectual life since the 1850s. Weinberg College offers a liberal arts education that combines broad exposure to the insights and methods of multiple academic disciplines with focused study in one or more areas. The 600-member college faculty is dedicated to superior teaching informed by advanced research. Nearly all members of the faculty, including the most senior, regularly teach undergraduates in a curriculum that includes more than 2,200 courses each year, as well as tutorials, supervised laboratory experiences, internships, and other individualized forms of instruction. The 4,200 undergraduates and 1,400 graduate students in arts and sciences enjoy a great deal of choice, with access to departments and programs offering 42 majors, 6 adjunct majors, and more than 50 minors. Among these are several majors and minors that are interdisciplinary within the College and a growing number that represent curricular collaboration across schools. </P>

<P>A liberal arts education in Weinberg College emphasizes the ability to reason clearly, to extract the essential significance of large bodies of information, to apply general principles in new contexts, to communicate effectively, and to be sensitive to human creativity and diversity. Required coursework provides an overview of the complexity of the world and different ways of apprehending and solving problems. Students examine how scholars from many backgrounds confront fundamental issues and how social conditions shape their inquiries. Proficiency in writing and competence in a foreign language build communication skills and expand the capability to study and understand another culture, while intensive coursework in a required major and optional minor develops an understanding of advanced concepts and lays the groundwork for original research. Many areas of the curriculum encourage interdisciplinary study that integrates the approaches of different fields and enhances the ability to address questions that cross traditional academic boundaries. A period of study abroad is encouraged in order to develop firsthand knowledge of other cultures and greater intellectual and personal independence. Students are also encouraged to undertake independent research projects that help them move beyond coursework and synthesize what they learn in their majors. </P>

<P>Weinberg College promotes participatory learning that begins in the first year of study in required first-year seminars and continues in laboratory experiences, internships, professional linkage and senior seminars, and other small-group or individualized instruction. Students can experience the excitement of discovery in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences not only through lectures by faculty working at the forefront of their fields but also through special projects developed under faculty guidance or by assisting faculty in their research. Northwestern’s strong undergraduate preprofessional schools and its graduate and professional schools offer liberal arts students enhanced opportunities to extend their interdisciplinary studies and to pursue applied work in several areas. In some cases this may lead to a minor, a concentration, or a certificate. (See Cross-School Options chapter.) The University’s outstanding libraries and its research centers further support and enrich the educational pursuits of liberal arts undergraduates. </P>

<H5>ACADEMIC POLICIES </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts </H5>

<P>Weinberg College offers courses of study in the arts and sciences leading to the degree of bachelor of arts. Students have extensive flexibility in structuring their academic programs within a framework of general education and major requirements specified in the following sections. Guidance in planning a coherent curriculum is available from several sources; see Academic Advising on page 41. </P>

<P>Students earning the bachelor of arts degree must complete 45 units of credit and fulfill the course and grade requirements described below. These include completing 2 first-year seminars, demonstrating proficiency in writing and in a foreign language, satisfying distribution requirements in six major areas of intellectual inquiry, and completing the requirements of a major in one of the departments or programs of Weinberg College. They must also complete a specified amount of their coursework within Weinberg College. </P>

<P>First-Year Seminar Requirement </P>

<P>First-year students must complete two seminars. Offered by nearly all departments and programs in Weinberg College, these are small, discussion-oriented courses designed to develop basic intellectual skills: how to read critically, think logically, and communicate effectively, typically through the investigation of a specific theme or issue. First-year seminars are limited to 15 or 16 students to </P>

<Sect>
<P>Arts and Sciences • Academic Policies </P>

<P>encourage discussion, and each seminar requires considerable expository writing—usually a minimum of 15–20 typed pages. These seminars ordinarily supplement rather than replace standard introductory courses and usually do not provide the preparation necessary for advanced work in a field. P/N registration is not allowed in first-year seminars. </P>

<P>Except for students in HPME, ISP, and MMSS, who may take their seminars in winter and spring, incoming first-year students are assigned to a fall seminar based on preferences they submit to the Weinberg Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising during the summer. The first-year seminar instructor also serves as the students’ academic adviser for that quarter. Also during the summer, first-year students are informed of the quarter in which they are to take their second seminar. First-year students also have the opportunity through the Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program to take small seminars linked to larger lecture courses focusing on a common broad theme. </P>

<P>Writing Proficiency Requirement </P>

<P>Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in writing. This may be achieved in a number of ways. First-year seminar instructors make the initial evaluation of writing in their courses. Students who do not write sufficiently well in their first-year seminars or in other courses may be asked to take ENGLISH 105 Expository Writing. Courses in expository writing and intermediate composition are available for all students who wish to increase their skill and confidence in writing. </P>

<P>Foreign Language Requirement </P>

<P>Before graduation students must demonstrate proficiency in a classical or modern foreign language equivalent to the work covered in a second-year college-level course. Language proficiency may be shown in any of these ways: </P>

All courses counted toward a major must be passed with grades of C– or higher. Grades of P (pass) are not acceptable in major and related courses. (See also Grade Requirements.) </P>
</Sect>

<P>Students may pursue two or more majors by completing each department’s major requirements. With limited exceptions, the same course may not be applied to the major requirements of two departments. However, a course used as a department or program course in one major may also fulfill a related course requirement for another major. </P>

<P>A student’s total number of majors plus minors may not typically exceed three. Exceptions require permission from the Weinberg College Advising Office and cannot be granted during the first year. </P>

<P>Transfer students normally must complete at least four 300-level courses at Northwestern in the major department or program. </P>

<P>A student may elect a major from among the following options: </P>

<LBody>Area or interdisciplinary major The college offers many interdisciplinary majors that apply the approaches of several departments to certain scientific, cultural, and political areas. Most are open to all students. American studies, integrated science, legal studies, and mathematical methods in the social sciences are limited-admission majors that require a special application, as does the English department’s creative writing major. African studies, geography, global health studies, international studies, mathematical methods in the social sciences, and science in human culture are available only as adjunct majors and must be completed with a second major that is not an adjunct major.

</L>

<P>Registration Requirements: Number of Courses and Quarters </P>

<P>All Weinberg College students, except those in the Integrated Science Program, the Honors Program in Medical Education, and the dual bachelor’s degree programs (BA/ BMus and BA/BS), must successfully complete coursework earning at least 45 units of credit in order to graduate. Students must be degree candidates in Weinberg College during the last three quarters before receiving the BA degree. They may take courses in any other Northwestern school, but a limited amount of such coursework may count toward the degree. For details see the section Taking Courses in Other Schools of the University. </P>

<P>In addition to and independent of the requirements set by Weinberg College, all students must satisfy the University’s Undergraduate Registration Requirement (see Undergraduate Education chapter of this catalog). This requirement addresses the number of quarters for which a student must be registered at Northwestern and the minimum number of units of credit that must be completed at the University. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Grade Requirements </H5>

<P>Students must achieve an overall grade point average of C (2.0) or higher in courses used to meet degree requirements. They must earn at least a C– in all major courses and all minor courses, including all related courses for a major. If a major or minor has prerequisites, students must earn at least a C– in these courses as well. To complete the foreign language proficiency requirement through Northwestern coursework, students must earn at least a C– in the third quarter of the second-year language sequence. </P>

<P>Full-time students in Weinberg College are permitted to enroll in a limited number of courses with the understanding that in place of a regular letter grade they will receive the notation P (pass) or N (no credit), neither of which counts in the grade point average. No more than 1 course a quarter and 6 courses in all may be taken under this P/N option. Courses used to satisfy first-year seminar, distribution, foreign language, major, or minor requirements may not be taken P/N. No more than one-fifth of the total courses taken at Northwestern and offered for graduation may have grades of P or D. </P>

<P>While some other undergraduate schools of the University offer a Target Grade–P/N registration option, such registration is not available for courses offered by Weinberg College. Special rules govern registrations by Weinberg College students in courses of the undergraduate schools where this plan is available as well as by non– Weinberg College students who transfer into the college. Questions concerning this policy should be addressed to the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Taking Courses in Other Schools of the University </H5>

<P>Weinberg students may take advantage of Northwestern’s other schools to take as many as 11 of their required 45 units; of those 11, up to 3 may be instruction in applied music. Students must obtain the advance approval of the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising to register for courses in the School of Professional Studies. Approved </P>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>Taking Courses at Other Institutions </H5>

<P>Students must secure prior approval from the Weinberg College Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising before taking courses at other US institutions that they will submit for Northwestern credit. University, college, and department and program rules govern how many courses taken at other institutions a student may count toward requirements, where they may be taken, in which areas of study they may be, and which requirements they may fulfill. Information about credit from other institutions is available from the Office of the Registrar. Courses taken at other institutions but not accepted for credit by Northwestern cannot count toward a Weinberg College degree. </P>

<P>Many Weinberg College students spend time studying abroad, most often for a summer or for part or all of junior year. The University’s Study Abroad Office is an essential source of information about programs around the world as well as about the rules and process for going abroad. Advisers in the Study Abroad Office, the college’s Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising, and the departments and programs can help students select programs that fit their academic needs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Awards and Honors </H5>

<P>Each year Weinberg College awards several prizes and honors to exceptional students. Recognition is given for outstanding writing in first-year seminars and outstanding academic achievement in certain areas of study. Each quarter the college’s Dean’s List honors students with sufficiently high grades. Each spring the Northwestern chapter of the liberal arts honorary society Phi Beta Kappa elects juniors and seniors to membership. Seniors whose grade point averages meet certain criteria graduate with college honors. In addition, many departments and programs recognize outstanding achievement by their students. This includes recommending students for graduation with department or program honors (see Honors in the Major below). </P>

<P>The college also awards funds to students working on research projects and creative activities; see Research Funding on page 41 for information. </P>

<H5>ACADEMIC OPTIONS </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Minors </H5>

<P>Students may choose from more than 50 minors offered at Northwestern; among these are Weinberg College minors, interschool minors, and minors offered by some of Northwestern’s other undergraduate schools (see Cross-School Options chapter). Minor requirements are listed under the appropriate headings in this catalog. </P>

<P>Completion of a minor is optional, not a degree requirement. A student’s total number of majors plus minors may not typically exceed three. Exceptions require permission from the Weinberg College Advising Office and cannot be granted during the first year. </P>

<P>Students may not count any course toward both a minor and a major unless the catalog description of the minor explicitly permits this or the course fulfills a related course requirement for the major. A course may not count toward more than one minor. All courses counted toward a minor, including prerequisites for the minor, must be completed with a grade of at least C–. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Independent Study and Undergraduate Seminars </H5>

<P>Registering for 399 Independent Study allows students to earn course credit by working on a research or creative project under the supervision of a faculty member. 399 is generally open to juniors and seniors, and department consent is required; in some cases sophomores may qualify. During the quarter before enrolling in 399, students must submit for departmental approval a detailed description of the work they will undertake and the basis for its evaluation. Upon completion of the course, they must submit an abstract of the completed work to the department, where the description and the abstract are filed. </P>

<P>By departmental invitation seniors may take 398 (a senior-year seminar) in one or more quarters, up to a maximum of 4 units. </P>

<P>Students may not register for more than 2 units of 399 in a quarter or take 399 to make up for credit they lack as a result of failure or uncompleted courses. No more than 9 units of 398 and 399 may be presented as credit for graduation. Certain independent study courses offered by some departments with course numbers different from 398 and 399 are also subject to these restrictions. </P>

<P>canned programs, and summaries of primary or second</P>

<P>ary sources are not by themselves bases for the award of </P>

<P>honors in the major. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Each major has an undergraduate honors committee responsible for administering its honors program and for preparing the final recommendations for honors submitted in May to the Weinberg College Committee on Undergraduate Academic Excellence. The faculty adviser proposes a student for honors and writes a letter describing and evaluating the student’s project. A faculty member typically unconnected with the project must submit another letter giving independent and substantive judgments. The departmental honors committee reviews nominations during spring quarter and takes a separate recorded vote on each candidate. Approved nominations are reviewed by the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Excellence, which makes the final decision. </P>

<P>Information on procedures for students pursuing separate honors in two departments or programs, or interdisciplinary honors spanning two majors, is available from the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising and at weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/honors -awards/departmental-honors.html. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Professional Linkage Seminars </H5>

<P>Undergraduates may take specially designed linkage seminars that approach social and work-related concerns through the eyes of an accomplished nonacademic professional with an affinity for the liberal arts and a gift for intellectual inquiry. These seminars link liberal education to professional issues, illustrating how theory and practice affect and enrich one another and thus focusing on the transition from the academic to the nonacademic world. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Preprofessional Study </H5>

<P>Weinberg College offers excellent preparation for subsequent training in professions such as law, medicine, and management. Each year many graduates pursue professional study in these areas. Other students enter the workforce directly. </P>

<P>All majors can furnish suitable preparation for professional schools, provided appropriate courses are taken. No major, however, is intended solely as preprofessional training. The college advisers in the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising help students design academic programs that combine the breadth of a liberal arts education with adequate preparation for further professional study. Northwestern Career Advancement is another resource; several career counselors specialize in helping Weinberg students identify career goals and paths toward achieving them. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Internships </H5>

<P>Many students seek to enrich their education with practical experiences gained off campus. Chicago Field Studies administers several programs that combine seminars taught on campus with internships typically at Chicago-area organizations. Other Weinberg College departments and programs also offer opportunities for off-campus work. These are described in their sections of this catalog. No more than 6 units of credit earned through internship-linked coursework may count toward a Weinberg degree. See the college website for a list of options counting toward this limit. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Study Abroad </H5>

<P>Weinberg College students are encouraged to study abroad. The philosophy of the college is that the best foreign study experience combines continued work in a student’s chosen course of study with significant opportunities for immersion in the culture of the host country. For example, a political science student might study the European Union in France. The college encourages participation in full-academic–year programs that include extensive study of languages and culture. The Office of the Provost offers grants for intensive summer foreign language study abroad. As early as the first year, interested students should discuss study abroad plans with their advisers and obtain information from the Study Abroad Office (northwestern.edu/studyabroad). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Cross-School Options </H5>

<P>Dual Bachelor’s Degree Programs (BA/BS and BA/BMus) </P>

<P>Two programs allow undergraduates to combine a bachelor’s degree in the liberal arts with a bachelor’s degree in another Northwestern undergraduate school. One results in a BA from Weinberg College and a BS from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the other results in a BA from Weinberg College and a BMus from the Bienen School of Music. Both options typically require five years of study. For more information see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. </P>

<P>Honors Program in Medical Education </P>

<P>The Honors Program in Medical Education is designed for unusually well-prepared high school students who seek a career in medicine or medical science. It provides a plan whereby students entering Northwestern are admitted simultaneously to Weinberg College, the McCormick School, or the School of Communication and to the Feinberg School of Medicine. HPME students then spend the first three or four years in undergraduate study and the last four years in the Feinberg School, potentially reducing the period of formal training by one year. For more information see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. </P>

<P>The approved BA/MA and BA/MS departmental programs in chemistry, comparative literary studies, economics, French, and linguistics share the goal of selecting and training exceptional students. Students are not self-selected but are recommended by the department to the Graduate School for admission. No particular grade point average in undergraduate courses, however high, automatically entitles a student to participate in an accelerated master’s program. Students are officially admitted only after their credentials have been thoroughly reviewed and approved by the senior associate dean of the Graduate School. </P>

<Sect>
<P>See the individual department sections of this catalog for more information on accelerated master’s programs. Further details and policies are available from advisers in the relevant departments and on the Graduate School’s website at tgs.northwestern.edu/academics /programs/dual-degrees/bachelors-masters.html. </P>

<P>Teaching Certification </P>
</Sect>

<P>Students enrolled in a number of departments of Weinberg College may simultaneously pursue secondary teaching certification through the School of Education and Social Policy. Students may earn science certification with a biology, chemistry, or physics designation; social science certification with an economics, history, political science, or sociology designation; or certification in English, French, German, Latin, mathematics, or Spanish. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Majors in the certification areas who wish to be considered for teaching certification must apply, be admitted to, and complete all requirements of the Secondary Teaching Program as described in the School of Education and Social Policy chapter of this catalog. Applications should be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs in the School of Education and Social Policy. </P>

<P>Other Cross-School Options </P>
</Sect>

<P>Weinberg College students participate in many academic opportunities outside of the college, sometimes taking individual courses of interest and sometimes completing a formal program of study. Many possibilities are included in the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. Certificates open to Weinberg undergraduates are offered through the School of Education and Social Policy, the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Kellogg School of Management, and the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. Minors in several of Northwestern’s undergraduate schools, as well as other options in music, are also open to Weinberg College students.

<H5>STUDENT RESOURCES </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Academic Advising </H5>

<P>Weinberg College provides an integrated academic advising structure centered in the college’s Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising, where faculty advisers are available throughout the year to assist students in all aspects of academic and career planning. Each first-year student is assigned an adviser who in nearly all cases is the student’s instructor in a fall-quarter first-year seminar. At the end of fall quarter each student is assigned a Weinberg College adviser, who will continue to be that student’s adviser through graduation. In addition, each Weinberg department and program has a corps of faculty advisers who counsel all undergraduates about course selections, majors and minors, and research and career opportunities. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Research Funding </H5>

<P>Weinberg College is committed to facilitating student research and to helping undergraduates immerse themselves in challenging, intense explorations through well-focused projects. The college, as well as some of its departments and programs, awards competitive grants to support research and creative projects of students working under faculty guidance. Academic–year awards cover some research expenses, and some summer awards also provide assistance with living expenses. Conference travel grants help fund travel to professional conferences to present research or creative work. </P>

<P>The University’s Undergraduate Research Grant Program is another source of research funding for qualified students. See page 25 for information. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Student Organizations </H5>

<P>Many departments and programs within the college sponsor student organizations. Some are honorary organizations, recognizing students who have achieved distinction within their fields of study. Others provide opportunities for students with common interests to come together for academic, social, career-focused, and service activities that complement classroom experiences. </P>

<P>The Weinberg College Student Advisory Board is the primary source of student advice to the dean and the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs. Members also serve on several college committees. The board includes representatives from every Weinberg College department and program offering a major or a minor. </P>

<H5>AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES </H5>

<P>afam.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The study of black lives, cultures, and experiences has a long and distinguished history in the United States and abroad. Interdisciplinary from its beginnings, the field has developed exciting insights and firm intellectual and empirical foundations to systematically study the social, political, cultural, and economic dimensions of race both domestically and internationally. With these strengths and traditions, the Department of African American Studies provides opportunities to explore the richness and diversity of black life in a meaningful and coherent way. </P>

<P>The department offers courses that focus on people of African descent in the United States and other regions of the Americas and the African diaspora—the communities created by the dispersion of peoples from the African continent. By comparing the black experience in various parts of the world, students learn to analyze identity, race, and racism as formations that change over time and space. This broad study of the black experience is one of the key features that distinguish the department from similar departments at other institutions. Major themes in the curriculum include the nature of colonization and its impact on the colonizer and the colonized; racism and its effects on society as well as on scholarship; the importance of oral language, history, and tradition in the black experience; the roots and development of black music, literature, and religious styles; analysis of key social, political, and economic institutions such as families, churches, and labor markets; and the traffic of people, ideas, and artifacts throughout the African diaspora. </P>

<P>African American studies provides excellent preparation for graduate work in the social sciences, the humanities, and the professions, as well as for jobs and careers in a variety of fields. Education, law, journalism, urban planning, healthcare delivery and administration, business, social work, and politics are only a few of the fields for which African American studies provides an excellent background. In addition, as scholars and political leaders pay increased attention to global economic, political, and social phenomena, African American studies touches on issues of far-reaching national and international significance. </P>

<H5>Honors in African American Studies </H5>

<P>Majors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors must notify the director of undergraduate studies during fall of senior year. To qualify for honors, a student must complete a substantial senior-year research project. With the director, the student selects a thesis adviser, who need not be a member of the department. Completion of the thesis ordinarily requires at least two quarters of research and writing. During one or both of those quarters students may register for 399, an independent study with the thesis adviser. This course counts as either 1 of the 6 required “elective courses” in the major or as the senior-course requirement. </P>

<P>Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information contact the director of undergraduate studies and see Honors in the Major on page 39. </P>

<H5>AFRICAN STUDIES </H5>

<P>africanstudies.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>More than six decades after the distinguished scholar Melville J. Herskovits organized the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the program remains a model of Africanist study and research. Through sponsorship of multidisciplinary courses with African content, language training, and promotion of Africa-based study, it supports and enlivens the undergraduate study of Africa while serving as the University’s “headquarters” for formal and informal interaction among interested students, faculty, and visitors. The program brings undergraduates studying Africa together with faculty and other experts in many areas of inquiry—across disciplinary boundaries and regional specializations—for lectures, seminars, workshops, conferences, and research programs. Northwestern’s Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies, an unparalleled resource for Africanist study, attracts students and scholars from all over the world. Over the years the program has remained in active contact with its counterparts in Africa and elsewhere, while expanding its role in the University and off-campus communities. </P>

<P>The program offers both an adjunct major and a minor. Although there is no formal language requirement for either, students are strongly encouraged to study a non-English language that is spoken in Africa or its diaspora, such as Swahili, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish. Competence in a foreign language can facilitate individual research projects, widen understanding of particular topics, and increase study abroad opportunities. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>Adjunct Major in African Studies </H5>

<P>The adjunct major is structured to serve two broad aims. </P>

<P>First, students are exposed to the geographical and disciplinary breadth of African studies. To that end, all students take 200-level core courses in African history, anthropology, literature, and/or politics, as well as 7 elective courses chosen from an array of disciplines, including African studies, African American studies, anthropology, history, political science, religious studies, and several language and literature departments. </P>

<P>Second, students engage in in-depth research or immersion practicums, the products of which they develop in a capstone senior research seminar. Practicums often involve a central research component, but other proposed practicums of acceptable quality, depth of immersion, etc., may be approved. Among the experiences that may satisfy this requirement with appropriate content are study abroad in Africa, research connected to the Program of African Studies, internships, and independent study and senior capstone projects. </P>

<H5>AMERICAN STUDIES </H5>

<P>amstp.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The American Studies Program is interdisciplinary, comparative, and internationally oriented. The competitive-admissions major examines the development and expressions of national culture alongside those of borderland and diasporic American cultures and amongst global cultures. It draws on a broad range of faculty from the humanities and social sciences so that students can examine components of US culture and the diverse experiences of Americans and others affected by Americans locally, nationally, and globally. Students are allowed a wide-ranging yet disciplined exploration that crosses the boundaries of traditional academic fields. All students write a thesis explicitly dealing with the United States in a comparative or global dimension. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Because this selective honors program has more applicants than available space, admission depends in part on academic distinction and on demonstrated interest in comparative American cultures. First- and second-year students apply for admission to the major early in spring quarter. </P>

<H5>ANTHROPOLOGY </H5>

<P>anthropology.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Anthropology is the study of humankind from a broadly comparative and historical perspective that aims to advance understanding of human biological and cultural diversity around the world and across time. In a changing world, anthropology provides for cross-cultural comparative analysis of diversities and inequalities. Understanding cultural, biological, and linguistic differences and similarities is central to almost any career, and students gain a critical understanding of ethical issues at play in a diverse, globalized world. </P>

<P>Anthropology draws on the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences to answer compelling questions about humankind, including how the species evolved, how biology, language, and culture became its defining characteristics, and how and why cultures change over time. </P>

<P>Anthropology’s breadth makes the major ideal for students seeking a strong liberal arts and sciences education. Students are prepared for careers not only in anthropology and archaeology but also in a range of fields including medicine, public health, law, journalism, marketing, international development, and business. </P>

<P>The department’s faculty bring together the four subfields of anthropology (archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology) to develop a holistic understanding of human diversity. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to participate in a variety of departmental field and laboratory research projects in archaeology, ethnography, and human biology that offer the opportunity to conduct original research, which can be an integral part of a senior thesis project. </P>

<P>Students complete a 13-course program (12 courses in anthropology and 1 in formal studies) for a major in anthropology. At the 200 level, courses provide background in the four major subfields of anthropology. At the 300 level, students expand both the breadth and depth of their studies, examining the philosophical and historical roots of the discipline. A research class (322, 361, 386, or 389) provides an opportunity to learn research skills and gain valuable analytical, critical thinking, and writing skills. Six additional 300-level courses include concentration courses from a subfield and from across the department. </P>

<H5>Minor in Anthropology </H5>

<P>The minor in anthropology provides students in other fields with a framework to pursue a particular focus within the discipline. Such a focus might be within a subfield of anthropology (e.g., biological anthropology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology), in area studies (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, the United States), or in a specific topic (e.g., ethnicity, gender, the origins of the state, urban studies). The minor combines 2 200-level courses and 4 300-level courses that constitute a coherent focus. </P>

<P>Students pursuing the minor should consult with the department’s undergraduate adviser to establish a program. </P>

<H5>ART HISTORY </H5>

<P>arthistory.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Art history studies the world’s arts and architecture from antiquity to the present. It analyzes visual objects from multiple perspectives, including their aesthetic and historical contexts, use of technology, relationship to science, ideological or social function, and visual and spatial characteristics. It studies individual artists or makers, cultural institutions, audiences, and intercultural exchanges. Because the field is inherently interdisciplinary, it often engages anthropology, philosophy, political science, history, literature, film, performance, theater, and theories of race, gender, class, and sexuality. </P>

<P>The study of art history provides knowledge of geographically and historically diverse artworks and related cultural practices. Departmental course offerings explore these works and practices with varying intensity and specialization. The major is an essential platform for those interested in the classic art history careers. (Curatorial work in museums normally requires at least a master’s degree, and college and university teaching and research require a PhD.) With its liberal arts emphasis on informed and critical reading, writing, speaking, and looking, and with its broad historical, cultural, geographic, and methodological range, the major also offers an excellent foundation for specialization in law, medicine, business, international relations, politics, education, and other areas. </P>

<P>All majors are required to confer with their adviser or the director of undergraduate studies at the start of the academic year and are encouraged to do so before each registration period. Those wishing to petition to graduate or to transfer credits must see the director of undergraduate studies. </P>

<H5>ART THEORY AND PRACTICE </H5>

<P>art.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>As its name suggests, the Department of Art Theory and Practice explores both the making of contemporary art and the ideas and theories that drive it. Faculty and students pursue the visual arts as a theoretical discipline that pushes the boundaries of aesthetic and cultural experience. The department offers a range of courses that apply traditional approaches, adopt newer media, or use alternative strategies. The study of art practice in traditional media, such as painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography, is the core of the undergraduate course structure, enabling students to develop a solid foundation in the field’s traditions and established forms. Studio art classes address both </P>

<P>Arts and Sciences • Asian American Studies  </P>

<P>technique and critical thinking about contemporary art; these are complemented by classes in contemporary art theory. Other courses expressly look forward, exposing students to experimental approaches and a foretaste of future developments in visual art making. This dynamic curriculum incorporates digital technology, video, and conceptual art practice, thus blending new trends with traditional practices. </P>

<H5>ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES </H5>

<P>asianamerican.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Asian American studies is a vital component of a liberal arts education that seeks to broaden awareness and appreciation of the world. Asian American studies deepens understanding of the multiracial history and character of the United States and also provides an opportunity to place the American experience within a larger global context. </P>

<P>Northwestern’s Asian American Studies Program aims to provide students with an understanding of Asian American experience as fundamental to the ongoing development of American society and linked to the experiences of other racial minorities in the United States and of Asian migrants across the world. The program thus encourages students to develop informed, far-reaching perspectives that facilitate responsible participation in a rapidly changing world. As an interdisciplinary program, Asian American studies develops traditional investigative, analytic, and critical skills while also promoting the intellectual and creative powers students need to meet the challenges of the 21st century. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Both the major and the minor in Asian American studies offer an opportunity to pursue a coherent study of Asian American communities and the experiences of Asian Americans in the United States. Students pursuing the major or minor engage in the interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and migration within the modern global historical development of nationalism, imperialism, and colonialism. </P>

<H5>ASIAN LANGUAGES AND CULTURES </H5>

<P>alc.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Department of Asian Languages and Cultures focuses on Asian humanities and languages past and present. Its Asian- and English-language courses provide students with opportunities to attain linguistic and transcultural competence in one or more of four language areas and to better appreciate Asia as a dynamic site of international cultural relations. </P>

<P>The department offers a major in Asian languages and cultures with five tracks (Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, Korean, and Asian humanities), as well as two minors. The minor in Asian languages focuses on the mastery of an Asian language, and the minor in Asian humanities includes interdisciplinary study of diverse Asian literatures and cultures. </P>

<P>When they graduate, majors and Asian languages minors will have proficiency in the four core skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing in an Asian language. They should be able to understand spoken language in conversations, public speeches, and media; to read literature, newspapers, and magazines; to speak and write in formal and informal language; and to engage with and discuss cultural values and assumptions. </P>

<P>In addition to these core skills, students will gain sophisticated understanding of a culture of Asia. Cultural literacy includes knowledge of classical and modern literary texts, films, and other media; ability to analyze and interpret texts orally and in writing; understanding and experience of cultural practices; and ability to conduct independent research in primary and secondary sources. </P>

<P>Study abroad is encouraged. Students should consult with their department adviser and the director of undergraduate studies before studying abroad to discuss how courses taken abroad might count. </P>

<H5>ASIAN STUDIES </H5>

<P>asian-studies.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Asian Studies Program offers individualized, interdisciplinary study of the languages, histories, societies, and cultures of the peoples of Asia, past and present. Through the study of a relevant language (Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, or Korean) and coursework in history, the humanities, and the social sciences, students gain a sophisticated critical understanding of a specific Asian region (East, South, or Southeast) or country. They also learn to examine the world and themselves through the lens of another language and culture. The program encourages in-depth study while also promoting more general inquiry into fundamental issues, such as cultural difference and its social and political implications and the significance of the transcultural and transnational flow of people and ideas. </P>

<P>Asian studies students hone their aptitude for analyzing problems, conducting research, and presenting ideas in writing and in speech and thus succeed in a wide range of careers, including law, medicine, business, media, government, education, and nonprofit work. Others go on to graduate study. Some graduates work primarily overseas. </P>

<P>The program offers a major and a minor. Study of a relevant language is required for the major and encouraged but not required for the minor. Approved courses are listed on the program website. Students should contact the program director for further information about requirements. </P>

<H5>BUSINESS INSTITUTIONS </H5>

<P>bip.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The minor in business institutions offered by the Harvey Kapnick Center for Business Institutions is designed to provide undergraduates with a rigorous introduction to business and management fundamentals. It allows students to prepare for employment in the business world by building on skills and knowledge they acquire through other Northwestern coursework. The program also connects students’ study of business and management fundamentals to broader areas of academic inquiry, both by linking the study of business management principles to the social sciences scholarship on which it is based, and by introducing social sciences and humanities scholarship on the cultural, political, philosophical, literary, and social aspects of business institutions. Thus, the program is not meant to serve as narrowly conceived preprofessional training; instead it offers a broad multidisciplinary perspective on a significant area of inquiry in 21st-century society. </P>

<P>Students without extensive quantitative training are particularly encouraged to apply. The program is designed so students can acquire the necessary quantitative background by completing four basic prerequisite courses in mathematics, statistics, and economics. </P>

<H5>CHEMISTRY </H5>

<P>chemistry.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Chemistry is the study of molecular structure, chemical reactions, and the molecular basis of solids, liquids, and gases. Training in chemistry blends descriptive, conceptual, and mathematical elements in both lectures and laboratory work. While developing chemical knowledge is essential, the progressive honing of analytical abilities and application of this knowledge to research are just as important. Courses are carefully designed to give a rigorous introduction to chemistry for both science and nonscience students. </P>

<P>The broad applicability of phenomena and rigorous methodology of chemistry provide a wide range of career options for majors. By offering a foundation in mathematics, physics, and related sciences; a core curriculum introducing the fundamental areas of organic, inorganic, physical, and analytical chemistry; concentrations in six different areas of chemistry; and opportunities to participate in research, the department meets the needs of students with diverse career objectives, including professional chemistry, graduate training, medicine, and teaching. Options are also provided for Northwestern’s engineering, biological sciences, and prehealth professional programs. </P>

<P>The chemistry faculty is actively engaged in a wide spectrum of original research in which undergraduates are </P>

<H5>General Chemistry,Advanced Placement, and Course Credit </H5>

<P>Entering students may receive advanced placement in chemistry by means of the College Board’s AP Chemistry examination or the department’s placement examination taken on entry to Northwestern. Depending on their scores, they will be advised to register in 110, 151, or 171 (with credit for 1X0 listed on their transcript); or 210 or 212 (with 1 credit for each 1X0, 1X1, and 1X2, and with </P>

<P>0.34 credit for each 11X and 12X on their transcript). Students may not start any general chemistry sequence with 131, 152, or 172 regardless of their AP credit. Questions should be directed to the director of undergraduate studies in chemistry. </P>

<P>Students may not retain both AP credit and credit for a course at a lower level than placed by the AP score. For example, students who receive 1 test credit listed as 1X0 may take 151 for credit, but they may not retain credit for both. Similar constraints apply to 1X1 and 171; 1X2 and 172; 11X and 181; and 12X and 182. Students may receive credit for only 1 of 131, 151, or 171; only 1 of 132, 152, or 172; only 1 of 141, 161, or 181; and only 1 of 142, 162, or 182. Students whose AP or chemistry placement exam scores place them into organic chemistry but who choose instead to begin with 171/181 must complete the entire general chemistry sequence before taking organic chemistry. Students who place into organic chemistry may not take 110 or 151/161. </P>

<P>The laboratory components of general and organic chemistry courses require separate registration and bear separate credit.When such a course is listed as a prerequisite for another course, the associated lab is also a prerequisite. </P>

<H5>CLASSICS </H5>

<P>classics.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Classics majors and minors study the language, literature, history, and culture of Greek and Roman antiquity. The department offers a wide range of topics and has strengths in Greek and Latin literature, mythology, Greek history, the ancient economy, and ancient philosophical writing. Students may also study the reception of classical antiquity in medieval through contemporary Western cultures by taking classical traditions courses offered by other departments. The wide range of choices includes philosophy, religion, political theory, art history, film studies, English, and comparative literature. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Classics majors may pursue a concentration in Latin, Greek, or both languages. For a classics minor, students may choose a concentration with readings in Latin or in Greek or a classical studies concentration with sources in English translation only. Additional information about classics programs and courses is available on the department website or in the department office. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Major in Classics </H5>

<P>The major in classics offers students three paths of study. Although no previous knowledge of Latin or Greek is required, all students are required to achieve competence in one of these ancient languages in order to work with primary sources in the original. Some may choose to complete advanced work in both languages. </P>

<P>With concentrations in Latin, Greek, or both languages, the major requirements allow some flexibility. Classics majors develop familiarity with the broad sweep of ancient history and literature and key analytical skills necessary to examine the record of Greek and Roman culture. They complete a demanding and distinctive course of study that stresses the development of important intellectual sensibilities—close reading, analytical clarity, thorough research, evaluation of evidence, logical analysis, effective writing, appreciation of nuance and subtleties, historical variability, and cultural differences. All majors complete a research project under the direction of a faculty member in a small 1-quarter seminar. Seniors pursuing honors will undertake an additional 2 quarters of research. </P>

<P>Each of the three tracks—Greek and Latin, Latin, or Greek—requires a minimum of 12 courses beyond the language prerequisites. </P>

<P>All majors are required to undertake a research project in connection with 395 Research Seminar. Topics vary from year to year. Instruction will be included in the use of traditional as well as digital research tools. Students may petition the director of undergraduate studies to substitute research conducted for a study abroad program. </P>

<H5>COGNITIVE SCIENCE </H5>

<P>cogsci.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Cognitive science is the scientific study of the mind with the goal of understanding the nature of thought. Students learn the ways in which converging sources of evidence may be integrated to discover the mechanisms underlying the complex adaptive properties of human cognition. The major in cognitive science gives a broad foundation in this interdisciplinary field, encompassing cognitive psychology, linguistics, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and related disciplines. Required introductory courses survey basic phenomena and approaches; basic methodology courses impart the methods of cognitive science; core courses provide foundations of disciplines within cognitive science; and elective courses allow students to pursue more advanced study in particular disciplines. A proseminar focuses on ongoing research in the field by Northwestern faculty. </P>

<H5>COMPARATIVE LITERARY STUDIES </H5>

<P>complit.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Comparative Literary Studies Program is an interdepartmental, interdisciplinary program for the study of literature across national and linguistic lines. Those who work in the field of comparative literature hold that language is not an indifferent medium of expression but an integral dimension of every expressive act. Drawing on faculty from the various literature departments as well as from disciplines such as art history, film studies, music, and philosophy, the CLS program examines literary texts within the context of diverse literary traditions and other cultural phenomena. CLS encourages students not only to read and interpret works of literature but also to reflect on the assumptions, methods, and goals that shape literary and other humanistic studies. </P>

<P>In contrast to studying one culture’s literature over a specific time period, CLS juxtaposes literatures of different cultures and epochs, studying the themes, conventions, and movements shared by distinct literary traditions as well as those features that distinguish them from each other. Building on Northwestern’s traditional strengths in European and North American literatures, CLS now also offers programs of study in the literatures of East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. By engaging in cross-disciplinary scholarship across languages and historical eras, students encounter the literary achievements of people with vastly different histories, frames of cultural reference, and poetic traditions. </P>

<P>Their course of study provides CLS students with a range of innovative theoretical approaches to literary texts, movements, and genres, along with a strong commitment to traditional literary interpretation, philological methods, and critical analysis. In considering texts ranging from the classics of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations to contemporary critical theory, students not only learn to understand specific literary works but also raise questions about their relations to other forms of discourse and about the nature of literature itself. To this end, the CLS program emphasizes the study of various types of specifically literary theory (such as structuralist, poststructuralist, psychoanalytic, sociopolitical, and new historical) and of the theoretical and methodological concerns of other disciplines (such as anthropology, history, philosophy, gender and sexuality studies, and sociology). </P>

<P>Finally, comparative literary studies considers literary texts in relation to other forms of creative production. The relationship of literature to other arts, such as music, the fine arts, and new media, is an important focus of interest in many courses, and students are encouraged to take classes in other disciplines. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Major in Comparative Literary Studies </H5>

<P>Students pursuing a program in comparative literature need to be acquainted with at least two literary traditions. They choose a first literature, normally that written in their native tongue, and a second literature written in another language. They take at least 2 courses in each, as well as at least 1 course in non-Western literature either in translation or in the original language. </P>

<P>Introductory CLS courses provide students with a range of theoretical approaches to literary texts in particular and the study of culture in general. Advanced CLS courses allow students to use their linguistic skills to further explore literary themes, movements, genres, and periods on a comparative basis. </P>

<P>By spring of junior year, majors in CLS choose a concentration with the director of undergraduate studies. Each concentration consists of 3 courses, of which 1 is a CLS “gateway” to the concentration. Examples of </P>

<H5>Minor in World Literature </H5>

<P>The minor in world literature, like the major in comparative literary studies, examines literature beyond the boundaries of one national or linguistic tradition. It is designed for students who either do not have the language skills necessary for the major or are particularly interested in non-Western literatures, which currently are taught at Northwestern primarily in translation. Unlike the major in comparative literary studies, the minor in world literature does not have a language requirement. Students are encouraged to read literary texts in the original language but can also take courses where literature is read in English translation. </P>

<P>The minor allows students to study literatures from different parts of the world as well as different periods. Students take courses from at least two different cultural traditions and are encouraged to examine the relations between them—particularly between traditions of Europe and North America and those of the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America. In so doing students discover how literary texts cross national boundaries and thus become part of “world literature.” This crossing often involves some kind of translation, so the minor, while allowing students to read literary texts in English translation, also makes translation one of its objects of investigation. </P>

<H5>CRITICAL THEORY </H5>

<P>criticaltheory.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Critical theory involves the attempt to better understand power and conflict and to achieve change in or distance from the unexamined beliefs, forces, conventions, ways of thought, institutions, and routines that determine much of human life. Students will develop their ability to question the world in which they live and to formulate theoretically nuanced responses to the problems that define our historical moment. </P>

<P>The minor is an interdisciplinary program of study enabling undergraduates to acquire understanding of critical theory’s many dimensions and fields of application. It fosters dialogue between students with shared interests in such areas as continental philosophy, comparative literature, media and communication, film studies, the social sciences, and political theory, among others. Through the undergraduate-initiated and organized Critical Theory Research Workshop, students pursuing the minor benefit from an active undergraduate research culture. The minor is associated with Northwestern’s Critical Theory Cluster, a research network of over 100 faculty and graduates responsible for a vibrant program of interdisciplinary events, workshops, visiting professors, and lectures. The minor is also associated with the undergraduate Paris Program in Critical Theory, Literature, and Media. </P>

<H5>ECONOMICS </H5>

<P>economics.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The program in economics enables students to understand the basic concepts, theories, and techniques of economics as they apply to economic problems and policies. These may focus on macroeconomics, applied microeconomics, quantitative economics, or economic history. Whatever courses students take, they will become familiar with the way economists think about problems and devise solutions to them. Although the program does not offer specialized professional training in economics, it provides excellent preparation for graduate work in economics, the study of law, and careers in business or government. Students should consult a department adviser about field courses that fit their needs. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Major in Economics </H5>

<P>The introductory courses 201 and 202 must be taken first and in that order. STAT 210 and MATH 220 should also be taken early in the program; the former is a prerequisite for 281 and the latter for 310-1. 281 and the intermediate theory courses should be completed before 300-level field courses are taken. Although only MATH 220 is required, majors are strongly urged to take MATH 224, 230, and </P>

<P>240. Majors considering graduate work in economics are strongly advised to take additional mathematics courses and perhaps a second major in mathematics. Students wishing to pursue in-depth study of econometrics may take 381-1,2 without taking 281 first. For students who complete 381-1, 281 will be waived. </P>

<H5>ENGLISH </H5>

<P>english.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Department of English values various kinds of critical inquiry and creativity. While some courses emphasize the formal qualities of literary works, others address such questions as what counts as “literary,” or how to characterize the relationships among literature, culture, and politics. Classes might discuss psychoanalysis, race and gender, or the history of the book. While courses have different approaches, methods, and emphases and the texts examined vary, all courses stress close reading and careful analysis of texts, whether written or visual. Reflecting both range and specificity, the curriculum enables students to pursue their areas of interest within a broader understanding of literary history and the range of literary study. In its creative writing courses the department offers training in verse, fiction, and creative nonfiction. Virtually all courses also include practice in writing clear, concise, and persuasive expository prose. </P>

<P>Rigorous training in thinking and writing is valuable for any career, including law, IT, communications, marketing, consulting, finance, and business as well as writing, publishing, and the teaching of English at all levels. Courses in English and American literature also help students to hone their skills as critical citizens of global communities. </P>

<P>The department takes pride in its diversity of perspectives. In addition to teaching classes in the department, English faculty contribute substantially to the course offerings in theater, drama, and comparative literature, as well as American, African American, Asian American, Latina and Latino, and gender and sexuality studies. Professors have taught courses in conjunction with the Newberry Library and other Chicago institutions. </P>

<H5>ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND CULTURE </H5>

<P>epc.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Environmental Policy and Culture Program offers students an interdisciplinary approach to environmental studies, focusing on the social sciences and humanities. Environmental issues and conflicts are among the most important concerns of the 21st century. The minor in environmental policy and culture provides opportunities to engage in scholarly inquiry about managing the natural environment. Courses address issues such as global climate change, efforts to maintain and restore biodiversity, and the reconciliation of development with environmental protection. Courses that fulfill the minor requirements include both those offered by EPC (identified as ENVR POL) and courses from different departments and programs. They fall into three categories: the humanities (largely courses in history, philosophy, and religion), policy (largely courses in the social sciences), and the natural sciences. Although all students who minor in environmental policy and culture take at least 1 relevant course in the natural sciences, the emphasis is on courses in the humanities and social sciences. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to participate in environmental research at Northwestern. They may take EPC research seminar 395 and/or pursue independent research projects in 399 under the supervision of faculty affiliated with the program. </P>

Proficiency in language and knowledge of culture are keys to careers in communication, media, business, the arts, and academia and are valuable components of any university education. </P>

<P>The department’s programs are varied. Language courses, from the elementary through the graduate levels, develop communication skills for functioning at ease with foreign texts or in a foreign environment. Courses in literature and culture not only broaden and deepen insights into the thought and writing of other societies but also train students to think independently, to organize and analyze materials thoughtfully, and to discuss ideas effectively. </P>

<P>The department offers a minor in French, a major in French studies, MA and PhD programs in French, and a minor and a major in Italian. These may be supplemented by study abroad, which allows students to increase their knowledge of a foreign language and society while continuing university work abroad in a variety of fields. It is not necessary to be a major to participate in these programs. </P>

<H5>Major in French </H5>

<P>The major in French provides rigorous interdisciplinary training in the French language and the literary, cultural, and intellectual traditions of France and the French-speaking world. </P>

<P>Extensive coursework at all levels of language study prepares students to engage critically with a rich array of texts, images, and ideas from francophone cultures. Ranging in scope from the medieval period to the present, course content extends across regions and incorporates many genres, media, and historical documents, placing them in their social and political contexts. Majors acquire the tools for literary and cultural analysis, learn about the distinctive contributions of French critical thought, and complete an independent research paper. Students are thus prepared to be linguistically adept, global citizens who are attuned to the complexities of language and culture. </P>

<H5>GENDER AND SEXUALITY STUDIES </H5>

<P>gendersexuality.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Gender and Sexuality Studies Program is a dynamic interdisciplinary program that draws on faculty and courses from more than 20 departments and several schools—including Weinberg College, the School of Communication, the Pritzker School of Law, the Feinberg School of Medicine, and the Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music. The program offers a major and a minor for Northwestern undergraduates, as well as a certificate for graduate students. It includes 11 core faculty members with joint appointments as well as affiliated faculty. Faculty teach courses and pursue research in the history and theory of gender, feminism, women’s studies, and sexuality studies, including gay, lesbian, and queer studies. </P>

<P>The many approaches, methods, and topics in gender and sexuality studies at Northwestern are united in focusing on gender, sex, and sexuality as key but often under-examined categories in history, scholarly study, and daily life. At the same time, they attend to questions of identity and sexual politics in ways that do not take for granted the particular sex/gender categories of the modern Western world. </P>

<P>A full range of courses is offered, from first-year seminars to graduate courses. They provide information and </P>

<P>The Department of History is a place where students can study any region of the world, during almost any historical era, from a wide variety of perspectives. The faculty includes nationally distinguished scholars in United States, European, Latin American, African, and Asian history. Faculty resources enable the department to offer major fields of study in the history of the Americas, English/European history, African/Middle Eastern history, Asian/Middle Eastern history, and global history. </P>

Few have specific prerequisites, although first-year students are generally advised to try 100- and 200-level courses before attempting 300-level courses. History majors have priority in registering for classes, but most students enrolled in history courses are majoring in other areas. The history faculty welcomes this diversity of students. </P>

<P>The humanities are a broad and interdisciplinary collection of fields that differ from the physical, biological, and certain of the social sciences by concentrating on the study of human thought and culture. The humanities include the study of literature, philosophy, history, art, and music, as well as film, dance, theater, and television. Certain scholars in sociology, psychology, anthropology, and political science also pursue humanities research. </P>

<H5>INTEGRATED SCIENCE </H5>

<P>isp.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Integrated Science Program is a highly selective curriculum of natural sciences and mathematics presented predominantly in small classes at an accelerated pace. Courses emphasize the common base and relationships between the traditional sciences, including the importance of mathematics and the development of first principles, leading to interdisciplinary topics at the forefront of science today. The goal is to provide students who are interested in careers in science and mathematics with a broad quantitative background that will give them superior preparation for further work in graduate or professional schools or permanent employment. The curriculum is composed of 25.7 units, up to 3 of which may be independent research, as well as a regular seminar series. Most students take advantage of the opportunity to pursue research in world-class laboratories at Northwestern and are able to publish peer-reviewed papers in professional journals. ISP may lead to a three-year bachelor of arts degree if, by the end of the third year, the student has completed 38.7 or more units and satisfied all other college requirements. </P>

<P>Students must be accepted to Northwestern to be eligible for admission to ISP, which requires a separate application to the program director. For more information on admission procedures, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. Also see the ISP website for the required AP and achievement tests. </P>

<P>The ISP curriculum consists of specially designed courses taught by faculty members of science and mathematics departments. Course descriptions are found in the appropriate departments in this catalog. Though listed in a three-year format, the program is often spread over four years, particularly if a student wishes to combine an ISP major with a second major in a traditional department, such as biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, environmental sciences, earth and planetary sciences, materials science, mathematics, physics, psychology, or in an engineering field. Specific second-major requirements for ISP students can be found on the program website and under individual departments in this catalog. </P>

<P>International studies is an undergraduate adjunct major, complementing and taken in conjunction with a disciplinary major. It is open to students in all schools. </P>

<P>The adjunct major provides students with an interdisciplinary understanding of the international system as it has developed and as it affects contemporary politics and society. Students are required to take a core set of courses in history, political science, sociopolitical development, and economics that are designed to introduce key elements and concepts related to the historical development of the </P>

They then choose thematic and regional areas of focus, taking courses from a variety of disciplines such as history, political science, economics, anthropology, literature, art, linguistics, global health, music, and religion. Students complete the major with either an integrating project seminar related to the thematic focus or an honors thesis that includes a 2-quarter honors seminar. </P>

<P>Each student majoring in international studies has a different combination of courses. Because international studies majors must show a minimum of 8 courses not double-counted in any other major(s), students should see an international studies adviser when designing their programs. </P>

<P>The Jewish Studies Program focuses not only on Judaism in its narrow sense as a religious phenomenon but also in its broader sense as a culture and civilization. A good case can be made that the roots of Western culture lie in two places: Athens and Jerusalem. The traditional education of the humanist scholar recognized this by requiring not only the mastery of Greek and Latin but also of Hebrew. Thus, the study of Judaism in this program considers the many and varied dimensions of the phenomenon of Jewish civilization. A typical program of study includes, in addition to the religious dimension, the historical, sociological, linguistic, philosophic, and artistic dimensions. The Jewish Studies Program offers a major and two minors: Jewish studies and Hebrew studies. </P>

<P>Latina and Latino studies focuses on the experiences of US Latinas and Latinos and encompasses a wide diversity of communities, cultures, and backgrounds as well as relationships to diasporic homelands. </P>

<P>Explicitly concerned with exposing inequality and injustice, the field examines the relationships among social structure, cultural production, and power.

Scholars use inter- and multidisciplinary approaches instead of more conventional paradigms. </P>

<H5>LEGAL STUDIES </H5>

<P>The Legal Studies program promotes the interdisciplinary study of law, legal institutions, and legal processes from social science and humanities perspectives. It is not a “prelaw” program; instead, it examines how legal institutions, actors, and processes fit within a broader social context. In this conception, the law is a social institution that warrants study in its own right and provides an excellent lens through which students may critically examine a variety of themes central to other disciplines (such as race </P>
</Sect>

<P>120 Arts and Sciences • Legal Studies </P>

<H5>LINGUISTICS </H5>

<P>linguistics.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Linguistics is the scientific study of language, its structure and function as a means of communication, its acquisition, and the mental and physiological processes involved in its use. Knowledge of the structure, origins, and functions of language can provide deep insight into human nature and behavior. The major in linguistics prepares students for professional studies in law, medicine, technology, education, and business, as well as for graduate work in linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines. </P>

<P>Three introductory courses examining the sound structure of human language, the structure of words and sentences, and the structure of linguistic meaning make up the core of the major and provide the foundation for more advanced work. More specialized courses in linguistics introduce students to the activities of working researchers in various subfields. </P>

<P>Linguistics majors are encouraged to participate in faculty research and to develop independent research. Students often enhance their linguistics major through interdisciplinary studies in cognitive science, communication sciences and disorders, psychology, philosophy, international studies, mathematics, or computer science. Students with a strong record in their major courses and an interest in pursuing linguistics at the graduate level are encouraged to enroll in 400-level courses. </P>

<H5>MATERIALS SCIENCE </H5>

<P>mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science </P>

<P>Materials science is the study of processing-structureproperty relationships in materials of importance to society, such as metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, biomaterials, nanomaterials, and their combinations (composites). Materials scientists pay special attention to “microstructure”—i.e., how materials are constructed on the microscopic, submicroscopic, and even the nanometer levels, and how this affects their properties. Given the wide range of uses for materials, their properties of interest are similarly broad, from mechanical (e.g., strength) to electrical (e.g., semiconduction) to biological (e.g., biocompatibility). </P>

<P>By offering the opportunity to study materials science within the context of the liberal arts and sciences, the Materials Science Program in Weinberg College is distinct from the program in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. The Weinberg program has strong connections with Weinberg’s physical and biological sciences departments in addition to its links with McCormick’s various engineering disciplines. </P>

<H5>MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES </H5>

<P>mmss.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>A central feature of modern social, behavioral, managerial, and policy sciences is the use of mathematics, statistics, and computers, both as languages and as methods of abstraction and analysis. Most undergraduate programs in the social sciences do not incorporate mathematical approaches in an organized and consistent manner, however. The Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences Program (MMSS) was created to give undergraduate students an opportunity to combine the study of social sciences with training in formal analytical methods. </P>

<P>MMSS students pursue a double course of study: a common mathematics/quantitative methods sequence and the social science major of their choice. (In some cases, students choose their joint major from outside the social sciences.) The program is for students with high mathematical aptitude and strong interest in social problems and issues, including policy and research implications. It provides excellent preparation for graduate study in social or managerial sciences as well as for careers requiring quantitative skills and a solid background in the social sciences. </P>

<P>In the first two years of the program, students enroll in a coordinated sequence of 12 1-quarter courses (2 courses a quarter) covering mathematical methods and their applications in the social sciences. These courses are open only to MMSS students and are taught at an appropriately advanced level. In senior year, all MMSS students participate in a senior seminar in which they write a thesis. There are no other required MMSS courses, but students must fulfill the requirements of their joint major. </P>

<P>Admission to the MMSS program is very selective and is limited to first-year students and to Northwestern sophomores with superior academic records and a demonstrated strong aptitude in mathematics. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Arts and Sciences • Mathematics  125 </P>
</Sect>

<P>A full-year course in calculus is a prerequisite for admission. High school students fulfilling this prerequisite are encouraged to enter the program as first-year students, applying to both Northwestern and the program. </P>

<Sect>
<P>To be considered for admission as sophomores, students lacking calculus should complete at least 2 quarters of calculus (MATH 220 and 224) in the first year of college. Those with sufficient background in calculus are advised to register for a 200-level calculus/linear algebra sequence such as MATH 230, 234, 240, 290-1,2,3, 291-1,2,3, or ES APPM 252-1,2 in the first year. Students with less mathematics preparation who are admitted to the program after the first year may be required to take all or part of the first-year MMSS math sequence. </P>

<P>Northwestern applicants interested in the program should see Special Admission Programs on page 11. Current students who wish to be considered for the program should complete an online application at mmss.northwestern.edu. </P>

<P>Mathematics, often celebrated as the “Queen of the Sciences,” has long been an indispensable tool in the physical sciences, engineering, and commerce. Today it is also used in sophisticated ways in the social sciences and humanities. Students majoring in mathematics have the opportunity to learn about its diverse applications, as well as to acquire an understanding of both the foundations and the frontiers of the discipline. </P>

<P>The department offers a major and a minor in mathematics. The mathematics major is flexible, accommodating students interested in the foundations of the modern mathematical sciences; those primarily interested in the application of mathematics to the biological, social, and behavioral sciences; and those interested in management or engineering. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Students with sufficiently strong preparation who are interested in a rigorous approach to the subject are encouraged to enter the Mathematical Experience for Northwestern Undergraduates Program (MENU). The department also encourages appropriately prepared students to enroll in its graduate courses. </P>

<P>A course in computer science is often a valuable adjunct to a mathematics major. Students interested in probability and statistics or in becoming actuaries should take 310-1,2,3 or 311-1,2,3 and 1 or more courses in statistics (e.g., STAT 320-2,3, 350, 351, 352, 355). They should try to include some courses from real analysis (320 or 321), computer science, and areas where probability and statistics are used. </P>

<P>Those interested in economics should take 320-1,2,3 or 321-1,2,3, and 310-1,2,3 or 311-1,2,3, as well as ECON 380-1,2 and/or 381-1,2. Double majors in mathematics and economics should consult the director of undergraduate studies in economics about possible adjustments to their economics requirements. </P>

<H5>MENU Program </H5>

<P>Mathematical Experience for Northwestern Undergraduates (MENU) is a flexible program of challenging courses designed to provide qualified undergraduates with a thorough foundation in mathematics suitable for advanced study in mathematics and its applications across a wide range of disciplines. </P>

<P>MENU offers students an opportunity to expand their mathematical knowledge while retaining flexibility about their majors. The program is especially suited for students considering a major in mathematics, the natural sciences, or economics, although MENU attracts participants with a variety of interests and majors. The program director is available to advise all MENU students regardless of major. </P>

<P>During the first year, MENU participants typically enroll in one of two yearlong sequences: 290-1,2,3 or 2911,2,3. Each provides a strong background in linear algebra and multivariable calculus. In contrast to standard mathematics courses, 290 and 291 develop linear algebra before multivariable calculus and use linear algebra as an important tool in the study of multivariable calculus. In particular, 291 emphasizes theory and proofs and is appropriate for students who are particularly skilled in and passionate about mathematics. Students may transfer between 290 and 291 with permission from the MENU director. </P>

<P>After the first year, MENU participants may choose among four upper-level MENU sequences: 311-1,2,3; 321-1,2,3; 331-1,2,3; or 360-1,2; or they may enroll in other advanced courses in the mathematics department. </P>

<P>Admission to MENU is by invitation. Students who earn an Advanced Placement score of at least 4 on the Calculus BC examination should automatically receive an invitation to participate. Others who satisfy any of the following criteria qualify for MENU (although they do not receive an automatic invitation) and may obtain permission to enroll from the director: </P>

<H5>Course Recommendations for Entering Students </H5>

<P>Students enrolled in the McCormick School, ISP, or MMSS should consult their programs to determine the appropriate beginning mathematics course. </P>

<P>Students who have not taken any calculus normally enroll in 220. Those concerned about their preparation for 220 should consult the director of calculus about the possibility of starting in 212. Students intending to major in a behavioral science other than economics and those from Medill may take 202 and 211 rather than 220/224/230, especially if they are concerned about their math skills. Those who wish only to fulfill the Area II distribution requirement and plan no further study of mathematics may also take 100, 104, or 110. </P>

<P>Students who have taken calculus in secondary school should determine their beginning math course as follows: </P>

With strengths in Anglo-American and continental philosophy, the department provides courses in all systematic areas of philosophy as well as a strong array of courses in ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. The research interests of members of the department show a similar breadth. This pluralism enables students to see philosophy’s application to all areas of life and to appreciate the diversity of approaches possible in philosophy. </P>

<H5>PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY </H5>

<P>physics.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Physics seeks answers to fundamental questions about the natural world. Physicists study nature at all distance scales, from extremely large (stellar systems, galaxies, and the observable universe) to infinitesimally small (atoms, nuclei, and fundamental particles), as well as everything in between (biological systems, natural and artificial materials). </P>

<P>Many students in physics pursue career paths involving the natural sciences and engineering, both in academia and industry, while others find that the quantitative thinking and problem solving skills that characterize physics and astronomy can be fruitfully applied to many nonscience areas. </P>

<P>Majors normally take PHYSICS 135-1,2,3/136-1,2,3 in the first year and PHYSICS 239 in the sophomore year. Majors also take a sequence of mathematics courses in their first and second years. The remaining requirements are a set of 300-level courses that depend on the chosen concentration, taken during sophomore, junior, and senior years. </P>

<P>While there is no formal major in astronomy, students may select the astronomy concentration within the physics major. </P>

<P>Students intending to study physics or astronomy in graduate school should choose the advanced physics or astronomy concentrations. They should also consider taking 2 or 3 units of PHYSICS 398 or 399 under the supervision of a faculty member, consisting of a research project in the student’s area of concentration and, if possible, introductory graduate courses. Students intending graduate study in a subject other than physics or not planning to go to graduate school may select the flexible concentration, which can be tailored to their interests. All declared and prospective majors should meet with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of sophomore year, if not earlier. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Major in Physics </H5>

<P>The physics major is designed to help students acquire a broad and varied background in physics and related fields; it provides an excellent intellectual foundation for many careers. The three basic steps toward completing the major are fulfilling prerequisites in introductory physics and calculus; taking a core sequence (common to all concentrations) of classical physics, modern physics, and mathematics; and completing a course concentration. </P>

<H5>POLITICAL SCIENCE </H5>

<P>polisci.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Political science is the study of politics and power from domestic, international, and comparative perspectives. It entails understanding political ideas, ideologies, institutions, public policies, and behavior, as well as groups, classes, government, diplomacy, law, strategy, and war. A background in political science is valuable for citizenship and political action, as well as for future careers in government, law, business, media, or public service. </P>

<P>Northwestern’s Department of Political Science offers classes in the four major subfields of the discipline— American politics, comparative politics, international politics, and political theory—but many courses cut across subfields. Political science faculty are closely associated with other departments in Weinberg College, Pritzker School of Law, and the Kellogg School of Management, as well as several interdisciplinary programs, including the Buffett Institute for Global Studies, the Institute for Policy Research, the Program of African Studies, the Gender and Sexuality Studies Program, the Chicago Field Studies Program, the Environmental Policy and Culture Program, and the Center for Civic Engagement. </P>

<P>The major in political science provides an opportunity for students to learn about politics in a variety of realms and settings. Students generally begin the major with 200-level courses, which provide a general introduction to subfields of political science as well as background for 300-level courses. Majors should choose 200-level courses from at least two subfields: American politics, comparative politics, international politics, and political theory. </P>

<P>While some students choose courses from within one or two subfields, most take a wide variety across different areas. Concentrations are not required; however, majors may consult with department advisers to design programs of study. Students might design concentrations around, for instance, themes such as race, ethnicity, and politics; global transformation; representation and law; social and economic inequalities; terrorism and national security; and citizenship studies. </P>

<P>Students planning to major in political science are advised to complete the 200-level gateway courses and at least 1 300-level course in political science by the end of sophomore year. Majors should complete their methodology requirement by the end of junior year and before taking the 395 research seminar. Students should plan to take 395 in junior year or early in senior year. Those who plan to pursue honors must take 395 in junior year. </P>

<H5>Minor in Political Science </H5>

<P>The minor in political science offers students the opportunity to acquire a foundation in the discipline as well as significant exposure to advanced courses. </P>

<P>Students may want to choose courses that complement and deepen their major area of study. For example, an economics major may want to focus on political economy courses. A history major might study contemporary politics in an area on which he or she is focusing. A philosophy major may study political theory. Alternatively, students can choose to broaden their knowledge of political science in areas unrelated to their majors. Students should consult with a member of the departmental undergraduate advising team to develop an individual program of study. </P>

<H5>PSYCHOLOGY </H5>

<P>psychology.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The study of psychology includes a wide range of topics in the natural and social sciences. It provides students an opportunity to increase their understanding of themselves and other people as developing individuals, biological organisms, and participants in society. Because of the strong research orientation of the department, it also provides an understanding of how research is done and an opportunity to participate directly in research. </P>
</Sect>

<P>A major in psychology may lead in various directions after graduation. Graduate study may prepare a student for a career as an academic, clinical, industrial, or other kind of psychologist. With course offerings spanning the areas of cognitive science, psychobiology, psychopathology, health psychology, and social psychology, psychology is also a useful major for students planning careers in education, medicine, law, or management. It provides knowledge about human behavior and about research methods and data analysis that is valuable in business, the helping professions, and other occupations. </P>

<P>At the graduate level, the department recognizes several specialties with programs leading to the PhD. Though opportunities for study and research are available to undergraduates in all of these areas, there is only one undergraduate psychology major. Its requirements are designed to give every student a mastery of the basic methods and a balanced exposure to different aspects of psychology. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Beyond that, students are encouraged to follow their interests in regular courses and in independent study. Extensive laboratory facilities and research experiences are available. </P>

<H5>RELIGIOUS STUDIES </H5>

<P>religion.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Department of Religious Studies offers undergraduates from across Northwestern the opportunity to study religions as historical and cultural phenomena. This includes the scholarly exploration of religious traditions, histories, cultures, beliefs, practices, sacred texts, sacred stories, and material productions from around the world in their institutional as well as noninstitutional (“on the ground”) forms. The department’s approach is fundamentally multidisciplinary, drawing from a variety of fields and critical perspectives: anthropology, history, philosophy, ethics, sociology, and literary and cultural studies, among others. </P>

<P>The wide variety of undergraduate courses range from large introductory classes to advanced seminars, and there are also independent studies and a senior thesis program for qualified students. The courses cover aspects of Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, African American and Native American religions, new religious movements, and religion and culture in America. </P>

<P>The department offers a major and minor in religious studies and a minor in Catholic studies. </P>

<P>In consultation with a department adviser, students majoring in religious studies select one of four concentrations: </P>

<H5>SCIENCE IN HUMAN CULTURE </H5>

<P>shc.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Science in Human Culture Program prepares students to confront the global impact of science, medicine, and technology on society—and on their own lives. The adjunct major and the minor welcome humanities, social science, and science majors, including premedical students, wishing to surmount modern science’s compartmentalization of knowledge. Courses bridge the sciences and the humanities and seek to foster critical thinking about the limits, authority, and impact of science, a mode of understanding and intervening that is often said to be the defining feature of modern culture. </P>

<P>The Department of Sociology offers preparation for careers in a wide range of fields requiring strong research and analytical skills and knowledge of social institutions and diverse cultures. It provides an excellent background for careers in business, advertising, nonprofits, the arts, public administration, law, medicine and health, journalism and communications, and planning, among others. The department also emphasizes the sociological perspective as a fundamental part of a liberal education and a complex understanding of the world. </P>

<P>The department is particularly strong in the areas of organizations and economic sociology; the sociology of law, health, science, and education; urban studies; international, comparative and historical sociology; the sociology of art and culture; and criminology. It offers a wide variety of approaches to social inequality and its origins and consequences, including class, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. </P>

<P>Statistics is the scientific discipline that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of numerical data. Statistical methods are widely used in observational studies and for the design and analysis of experiments, sample surveys, and censuses. Such analysis involves both description of the properties of groups of observations and problems of drawing inferences from such data. Applications to the biological, social, and physical sciences are widespread, and statistical analyses are increasingly required in actuarial work, accounting, finance, engineering, medicine, and law. </P>

<H5>WRITING PROGRAM </H5>

<P>writingprogram.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The Bobbie and Stanton Cook Family Writing Program is an independent Weinberg College unit that seeks to help all Northwestern undergraduates learn to write clearly and persuasively. A core faculty of experienced writing instructors teach the program’s main sequence of introductory, intermediate, and advanced expository writing courses. These are listed as ENGLISH 105, 105-6, 106, 205, and </P>

<P>305. Writing courses are limited to 15 students, allowing instructors to comment extensively on students’ writing and to meet regularly with students in individual conferences. Courses at every level emphasize revision, with the goal of strengthening each student’s ability to think clearly, analyze carefully, argue convincingly, and communicate effectively. </P>

<P>The Cook Family Writing Program also operates the Writing Place, a center that provides free composition tutoring and consulting for all Northwestern students. The Writing Place, located in University Library, is open most mornings, afternoons, and evenings during the academic year. Students may make appointments, use the schedule of drop-in hours, or interact with Writing Place tutors through the campus computer network. </P>

<P>In addition, the program helps to oversee writing requirements—and thus provides writing advising—for undergraduates in Weinberg College, the McCormick School, and the Bienen School. Members of the program faculty teach specialized courses and workshops, as needed. The program has collaborated extensively with other University programs and departments, developing new ways to integrate writing instruction with instruction in other disciplines. For example, faculty from the program and the McCormick School team-teach Design Thinking and Communication (a combination of ENGLISH 106 and DESIGN 106) for first-year engineering students. In this, as in all its courses and special offerings, the program concentrates on helping students develop skill, confidence, and insight as writers. </P>

<H4 id="LinkTarget_737">School of Communication </H4>

<P>www.communication.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Communication is at the root of nearly everything we do, and mastering the art of communication can open doors in a wide range of careers, from law and medicine to acting, directing, writing, and producing. </P>

<P>The School of Communication’s mission is based on a philosophy of performance. We seek to improve the practice of communication, whether on the stage or screen, at the podium, in the clinic, or in everyday life. </P>

<P>The school is committed to building the basic and applied sciences of communication; developing theoretical and critical perspectives on communicative performances; creating new technologies for communication and new modes of artistic expression; and helping students to be more effective in their work, at home, and in civic life by applying principles of communication. Undergraduates work in partnerships with world-class faculty to create new understandings and develop new approaches to human communication. The curriculum provides students with a solid liberal-arts education that broadens and enriches their studies of human expression and interaction. </P>

<P>Founded by Robert Cumnock in 1878, the School of Communication is now the third largest of Northwestern’s six undergraduate divisions. It annually enrolls approximately 1,200 undergraduate majors and 400 graduate students. </P>

<P>Originally, the curriculum and its related activities were concerned with public speaking and interpretative reading as performing arts. As the field grew, the school added instruction in theatre, speech pathology, audiology, radio, television, film, and other specialties in oral communication. Throughout its history the school has often been a pioneer in new fields of study, including film and audiology. </P>

<P>Today the five departments of instruction represent the diverse spectrum of study in the field of communication: communication sciences and disorders; communication studies; performance studies; radio/television/film; and theatre (including dance). All departments offer graduate courses. The School of Communication sponsors dance, debate, media arts, and theatre arts divisions of Northwestern’s National High School Institute. </P>

<P>This wide range of educational activities takes place in buildings across the Evanston campus. The fifth floor of the Ryan Center for the Musical Arts houses the school’s administrative offices and two departmental offices. The Frances Searle Building houses administrative offices, two departmental offices, and laboratory and research spaces. Other facilities include the school’s original building, Annie May Swift Hall; two former residences on Chicago Avenue; the Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts; and John J. Louis Hall, a state-of-the-art studio production facility. </P>

<P>In 2008 Northwestern opened a branch campus in Qatar, where programs in communication and journalism are offered. (See Campuses and Schools in The University chapter of this catalog.) </P>

<Sect>
<H5>ACADEMIC POLICIES </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science in Communication and the Degree of Bachelor of Arts in Communication </H5>

<P>The School of Communication grants the degree of bachelor of science in communication upon (1) the satisfactory completion of 42 course units; (2) the fulfillment of the distribution requirement of the student’s major department; and (3) the completion of an approved program of study in communication and related fields suited to the student’s special interests and needs. If students interrupt the program of study for an extended period of time and degree requirements are changed during this period, they are normally held to the new requirements. </P>

<P>In addition to, and independent of, the requirements set by the School of Communication, students must satisfy the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (see page 17). </P>

<P>The Departments of Communication Studies, Performance Studies, Radio/Television/Film, and Theatre (including dance) offer the bachelor of arts in communication. The requirements for this degree are identical to the requirements for the bachelor of science in communication with the addition of a foreign language requirement. (Regardless of whether the BA or BS is sought, the required programs of study for majors in the Departments of Communication Studies and Radio/Television/Film include specific foreign language requirements; for details, see the major requirements for each of those programs.) To earn the bachelor of arts in communication, students—in addition to completing the degree requirements for the bachelor of sci-ence—must demonstrate two-year proficiency in a classical or modern foreign language. Proficiency is defined as competence in the work covered through the final quarter of a college-level second-year language course sequence (or equivalent as determined by each foreign language department). Students who enroll for course credit to satisfy the proficiency requirement must earn a grade no lower than C– in the final course of the second-year course sequence. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Communication • Academic Options 171 </P>

<P>This proficiency is established in precisely the same manner as in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; see page 37 in the Weinberg College chapter of this catalog. </P>

<P>General Requirements </P>

<P>Of the 42 units of credit required for all major programs in the School of Communication, 35 must be completed with grades of A, B, or C (grades of C– do not satisfy this requirement). A minimum of 18 units of credit must be taken outside the major department (see distribution requirements below). All distribution courses and all courses applied to a major or a minor must be completed with a grade of C– or higher. Courses offered by the major department may not be taken for a P grade regardless of how they are applied to degree requirements. D and P grades may apply only to the elective requirement. </P>

<P>A transfer student will be required to complete at least 11 units of credit in the School of Communication at Northwestern. A communication placement interview is required at the time of first registration for all transfer students. </P>

<H5>COMMUNICATION SCIENCES AND DISORDERS </H5>

<P>communication.northwestern.edu/departments/csd </P>

<P>The Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders offers a major in human communication sciences, providing undergraduate students with a foundation for the study of disorders of hearing, speech, language, and learning. The department’s classroom, clinical, and research facilities are located in the Frances Searle Building on the Evanston campus. The undergraduate program emphasizes the basic science principles underlying all human communication and cognition and introduces students to clinical issues and research findings that pertain to disorders of communication and learning. The major in human communication sciences is particularly appealing to students who plan to attend graduate or professional school in fields such as medicine, audiology, speech and language pathology, learning disabilities, dentistry, and biomedical engineering. Students who do not pursue medical, clinically based, or research graduate degrees may enter careers in health-related private industry or the public sector. </P>

<P>Undergraduate majors in human communication sciences have the option of pursuing a general course of study, typical for most premed students, or of choosing among three areas of concentration: audiology and hearing sciences, learning disabilities, and speech and language pathology. </P>

<P>Audiology and hearing sciences encompasses the study of hearing, hearing disorders, and the treatment of hearing disorders. Emphasis is on basic communication science, including study of the anatomical, physiological, and physical bases of hearing. Undergraduate courses present information on normal communication processes and provide an introduction to audiologic assessment and hearing loss management. </P>

<P>Learning disabilities is concerned with learning processes and their dysfunctions, including disorders of perception, memory, language, and conceptualization. Such disorders lead to problems in the acquisition and use of oral language, reading, writing, and math skills that require specialized remediation. Undergraduate coursework stresses theoretical, scientific, clinical, and educational issues as a foundation for advanced training. </P>

<P>Speech and language pathology introduces students to the psychological, linguistic, neurological, acoustic, anatomical, and physiological bases of normal speech and language behavior. As their knowledge of normal speech, language, learning, and hearing processes increases, students are introduced to the communicative disorders that result from the disruption of these processes. Advanced undergraduate courses are concerned with the nature, recognition, and management of common communicative disorders and present issues related to administration and public policy. </P>

<H5>PERFORMANCE STUDIES </H5>

<P>communication.northwestern.edu/departments /performancestudies </P>

<P>The Department of Performance Studies integrates artistic and analytical approaches to a wide range of performance texts, events, and processes. The courses explore an interdisciplinary range of literary, cultural, and personal texts in performance. The department has particular strengths in the study of literature through solo performance; the ensemble adaptation and staging of poetic, narrative, and nonfictional texts; intercultural performance; performance art; cultural studies and the ethnography of performance; and performance theory and criticism. Internships and field study for performance studies majors extend and deepen their classroom work with experiential learning. Extracurricular work provides students with a variety of opportunities to perform, adapt, and direct, enabling their creative work to reach an audience outside the classroom. </P>

<P>Performance studies majors have been successful in many professions that require intelligence and imagination as well as critical and creative skills. In addition to pursuing careers in professional theatre and arts development, many graduates teach literature, theatre, humanities, and performance studies. Majors have found performance studies an excellent preparation for law school and complementary to their interests in creative writing, communication, new media, anthropology, dance, literature, or social work. Performance studies can be thought of as a major that bridges artistic expression and conceptual analysis, theory and practice. Performance, in its manifold forms, is the subject and the method of study. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Honors in Performance Studies </H5>

<P>Performance studies majors may apply in their junior year to participate in the departmental honors program. The program is intended to provide highly qualified students with an opportunity to complete a substantial research investigation; to introduce students to graduate-level, faculty-mentored research; and to provide formal honorary recognition to students who have excelled in coursework and in independent research. More information is available from the department office. </P>

<H5>THEATRE </H5>

<P>communication.northwestern.edu/departments /theatre </P>

<P>Of all the performing arts, none draws on the rich variety of human experience more fully than theatre. Theatre communicates the drama of life—whether the past, present, or future, and whether real or imagined—with immediacy, excitement, and eloquence. The student of theatre, therefore, must be a student of human society and must understand how social forces impinge on human behavior. To paraphrase Boswell, students of the theatre take as their subject the entire system of human life. </P>
</Sect>

<P>For this reason students who major in theatre at Northwestern combine a liberal arts education with intensive training in the theories and arts of the theatre. At the heart of the theatre program lies the idea that the best theatre artist is the one who combines a broad knowledge of the literature and theory of the field with highly developed skills in its practice. </P>

<P>Students spend approximately one-third of their program studying in the Department of Theatre, including courses in history, literature, and criticism; acting, voice, and movement; directing; devising theatre; stage production; design; playwriting; dramaturgy; creative drama and theatre for young audiences; and dance. Students develop the ability to approach problems and issues from a variety of perspectives while developing skills in research and writing, laboratory work, group discussion, oral presentation, performance, and production. Another third of the program comprises distribution requirements outside the department, and a final third is devoted to elective courses selected from a wide spectrum of University offerings. </P>

<P>A major in dance is also available within the Department of Theatre (see page 193). </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Honors in Theatre </H5>

<P>The honors program provides theatre majors who have demonstrated records of academic achievement with the opportunity to explore a sustained project in their senior year. It exposes majors to the rigors of research and creative work comparable with graduate-level programs in theatre studies and offers preparation for future graduate-level study. Projects may be proposed in any area of the theatre department’s pursuits (design, directing, choreography, performance, history, criticism, or playwriting), provided that supervisory personnel are available and willing to participate, and provided that appropriate facilities are available. </P>

<P>Eligibility for the honors program will be determined by the faculty. Contact the theatre department for more information. </P>

<P>sesp.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>The mission of the School of Education and Social Policy is to understand and improve learning communities, defined as groups of people working together in structured social and/or technical environments that influence human development. Learning communities include not only schools and classrooms but also workplaces, families, neighborhoods, and other societal arrangements where learning takes place. Through broad-based interdisciplinary research, teaching, and outreach activities, SESP’s faculty strive to better understand how social, psychological, and economic factors shape human development and learning and how innovations in pedagogy, technology, and social policies can benefit lives. They learn to understand human development and improve learning in its various social contexts by applying the social and behavioral sciences. </P>

<P>The school provides undergraduates with an interdisciplinary curriculum, practical experiences, and research activities that are closely linked to its faculty and graduate programs. Five concentrations lead to the degree of bachelor of science in education and social policy. The intellectual core of the human development and psychological services and social policy concentrations comes from SESP’s human development and social policy graduate program. The intellectual core of the learning and organizational change, learning sciences, and secondary teaching concentrations is grounded in the school’s learning sciences graduate program. </P>

<P>The five concentrations offer preparation for a number of career options. Students are encouraged to design their concentrations with career objectives or graduate and professional school admission policies in mind. They enroll with a wide variety of academic and career goals. Some intend to go immediately to graduate and professional schools, while others plan to enter a profession upon graduation. </P>

<P>Students in Northwestern’s other schools may choose to complete the requirements of SESP’s secondary teaching concentration in order to qualify for teacher certification. </P>

<H5>Common Coursework </H5>
</Sect>

<P>Distribution and core requirements are the same for all students in SESP’s four nonsecondary teaching concentrations. Students also complete an off-campus practicum (SESP 382, 386, 387, or 388, as appropriate; or 384 or 389) that entails engagement in professional activities and projects in such areas as program development and management, learning design, therapeutic rehabilitation, or policy research and evaluation. It is taken during junior year (or during the summer before or after junior year) in the Chicago area or, during Summer Session only, in Washington, DC, or San Francisco. Concurrent with the practicum, students meet weekly for the practicum analysis seminar, which is taught by a faculty member and culminates in a final research paper. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Up to 3 units of a research apprenticeship (390) or independent study (399) may be counted toward the concentration requirements. Credit for a student-organized seminar (298) may be used only as elective credit. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to develop a course plan within their concentration that reflects their individual interests and career goals. Working with their advisers, students may develop an interdisciplinary specialization comprising 5 or more courses from across the University; course selection is subject to approval by petition.

<H6>Teacher Preparation Program </H6>

<P>Students who wish to be licensed as teachers must apply to the SESP Teacher Preparation Program. This program is approved by the Illinois State Teacher Certification Board. Completion of the courses alone does not result in licensure, nor is licensure required for completion of the SESP degree. </P>

<Sect>
<H6>Application and Admission </H6>

<P>Students apply to the Teacher Preparation Program when enrolled in TEACH ED 304 Schooling in Communities or by the fall of the junior year. To be admitted, they must have received a passing score on the Illinois Certification Testing System (ICTS) Test of Academic Proficiency and have a minimum overall GPA of 2.5 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in teaching subject–area courses. SESP students must be eligible for entrance to the program no later than the end of fall quarter of the junior year. Weinberg College students may start the program later than the fall of the junior year but then may finish later than June of the senior year. Students are required to attend meetings about the process. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Clinical Experience </H6>

<P>Students in the Teacher Preparation Program complete three clinical experiences: a 30-hour nonschool experience (as part of TEACH ED 304); a 100-hour school practicum (typically during fall of the senior year); and student teaching (typically during winter of the senior year). </P>

<P>To be eligible for the 100-hour practicum, students must have met the GPA requirements for and been admitted to the Teacher Preparation Program and be on track to have completed a minimum of 9 courses in the teaching subject area by the end of the term in order to be placed. Those meeting these requirements will be placed with a department or teacher mentor at a local school. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to begin the practicum at the start of the school year at the assigned site. This is typically one to three weeks prior to the start of Northwestern’s fall quarter. Clinical experiences gained at the site are central to the discussion of methods and theories in the practicum seminar (TEACH ED 378 or 379) and methodology courses (TEACH ED 355–359). </P>

<P>To be eligible for student teaching, students must have successfully completed the applicable TEACH ED 355– 359 course(s) as well as TEACH ED 378 or 379, earned a passing score on the applicable ICTS Content-Area Test, fulfilled minimum GPA requirements for student teaching, and completed 9 teaching subject–area courses. Most school districts also require a criminal background check. </P>

<P>Student teaching involves full-time placement in a local school for the entire quarter; no other courses are taken concurrently. Teacher candidates attend an evening seminar (TEACH ED 388 or 389). The internship and seminar together earn 4 units. Teacher candidates are evaluated by their school mentor, a Northwestern supervisor, and the seminar instructor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Other Licensure Requirements </H6>

<P>In addition to successful completion of student teaching, all teacher candidates must successfully complete the state-mandated performance assessment, edTPA. </P>

<P>Foreign language teacher candidates other than those in Latin are required to complete the Oral Proficiency Interview of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages with a rating of upper-intermediatehigh or better. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Recommendation for Licensure </H6>

<P>Students are recommended for licensure when they successfully complete degree requirements and all courses </P>

<Sect>
<P>Education and Social Policy • Secondary Teaching  207 </P>

<P>in the Teacher Preparation Program, earn a rating of recommendation for licensure for student teaching, pass all outside tests as noted above, and successfully complete the edTPA tasks. </P>

<P>Although legal requirements for licensure vary from state to state, the SESP Teacher Preparation Program is flexible enough to permit students who plan carefully to complete provisional requirements for most states. As it is easier to obtain a teaching license in another state through reciprocity than through independent certification, all students who complete the program are encouraged to apply for an Illinois license before leaving the state. </P>

<P>Students should apply for the license immediately upon graduation. Teacher Preparation Program graduates who are recommended but do not apply for certification upon graduation may not be eligible for certification at a later date due to changes in state requirements. </P>

<P>The Illinois School Code has provided that school districts may not knowingly employ individuals who have been convicted of certain offenses (principally those related to sex or drugs). All Illinois school districts require applicants to submit to a criminal background check. </P>

<P>Major Program (16 units) </P>

<P>Each degree program in the McCormick School finds its depth in the major program’s 16 units. Each major curriculum provides considerable elective opportunity for individualization, but coherence in the selection of elective courses is still necessary. In accredited programs, guidance is essential to ensure that certain criteria are met. A plan of study listing intended selections must be submitted for approval to the Office of Undergraduate Engineering by the end of the eighth quarter of study (winter quarter of junior year). </P>

<P>Most curricula offer suggested areas of specialization or options in using electives. Course plans are available in the department or program offices or the Office of Undergraduate Engineering. Alternately, self-designed plans worked out in consultation with a faculty adviser may be submitted. </P>

<P>Students must meet both the school’s and the major program’s curricular requirements; the latter are listed in the major curricula sections in this chapter. Some curricula contain specializations or options to guide elective course choices. </P>

<P>Taking courses regarded as duplicates will increase the number of requirements needed to earn a McCormick degree. (Contact the Office of Undergraduate Engineering or see the McCormick website for a list.) </P>

<H5>Cooperative Engineering Education Program </H5>

<P>The Walter P. Murphy Cooperative Engineering Education Program alternates periods of paid industrial experience with academic studies for full-time students in all departments of engineering and applied science. During 18 months of industrial employment, students apply theory while gaining practical experience and develop an understanding of the responsibilities of their future professional careers. </P>

<P>First-year students are invited to participate in workshops to prepare for the co-op program. Sophomores in good academic standing begin applying for co-op positions as early as the fall quarter. The co-op coordinator makes every effort to secure interviews for the students so that cooperative work assignments are related to their professional objectives. </P>

<P>Generally, the first work experience for sophomore co-op students occurs the summer before their junior year. Co-op experience for juniors, transfer students, and others may begin as late as the spring of junior year. If necessary, special schedules may be arranged with the help of the academic advisers to enable students to meet individual academic requirements as well as co-op requirements. </P>

<P>Students register for their work quarters, thus remaining enrolled at Northwestern. While no academic credit is given for co-op, special BS/MS programs may use co-op experience as the basis for undergraduate projects and master’s theses. </P>

<P>Although emphasis is on the experience gained from cooperative work rather than on the income, students in the co-op program can cover a portion of their educational expenses with their earnings. </P>

<P>The following table shows the college-industry schedule for the five years of undergraduate education: </P>

<P>Employers of co-op students include government and service institutions as well as industry. Co-op coordinators visit participating employers periodically to discuss students’ abilities, attitudes, and progress on the job. At the end of each work period, employers are asked to evaluate student performance and progress. </P>

<P>No tuition or fees are charged during co-op periods. Students who complete the co-op plan receive rebates of tuition increases their final academic quarters and continue to pay the same tuition level as others in their entering class. </P>
</Sect>

<P>212 Engineering and Applied Science • Academic Options </P>

<P>In addition to the academic degree, students who successfully complete the schedule of school and work— meeting standards set by the program and the co-op employer—receive recognition as co-op students upon graduation from McCormick. </P>

<P>In some states, co-op experience may be credited for up to one year of the usual four years of engineering experience required for the Professional Engineer’s License. </P>

<P>Permanent employment is not an obligation for either employers or co-op students, but most students receive impressive permanent job offers as a result of the co-op experience. Others are admitted to prestigious graduate and professional schools. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Integrated Engineering Studies Program </H5>

<P>The Integrated Engineering Studies Program provides an alternative for students whose particular interests and goals cannot be satisfied by a regular program in engineering or applied science. To be eligible, students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or above. They may apply as early as the end of their first year but no later than 3½ quarters before completing the degree. Applicants must prepare a compelling argument for qualifying for this customized degree program. Examples of these ad hoc degrees from recent years include public health, engineering physics, biomedical engineering and molecular biology, analytics, and mechanical design. Additional details are available on the McCormick School web pages. Students who complete this program are awarded a bachelor of science in integrated engineering studies, and their transcripts specify the themes of their courses of study. </P>

<H5>BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING </H5>

<P>mccormick.northwestern.edu/biomedical </P>

<P>Biomedical engineers solve problems in the life sciences and clinical medicine by applying engineering and mathematical techniques. This approach has been fruitful where a descriptive approach is no longer adequate for studying complex systems involved in the body’s transport, regulation, and information processing. Equally important has been the development of devices used inside or outside the body to replace or supplement physiological functions and to enhance the quality of diagnosis and care. </P>

<P>The interplay among the physical sciences, engineering, biology, and the medical sciences takes many forms. The traditional study of complex systems—whether for power transmission, communications, or the operation and control of industrial processes—provided engineers with a number of concepts and techniques that proved valuable in analysis and design. These principles expressed in mathematical form are applicable to a wide range of phenomena, including those in biological processes. Information theory, statistics, and computer technology have opened new areas for exploration of sensory and central nervous activity as well as patient handling and diagnosis. Theories for feedback controls, transport processes, materials science, and mechanics have provided new insight into homeostatic physiological processes. Analysis of heat transfer, fluid flow, and chemical-process control in living organisms requires competence in both engineering and the life sciences. Current studies further understanding of many physiological processes, which in turn leads to improvements in clinical practice, diagnosis, and patient care. </P>

<P>Northwestern was among the first schools to recognize the value of a biomedical engineering background. Today the Department of Biomedical Engineering offers one of the largest and broadest programs in the country at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Most students interested in the field follow its program, but other engineering departments also offer biomedical options. </P>

<P>The biomedical engineering program provides biomedical training that is quantitative, emphasizes problem solving, and treats phenomena from the molecular to the systems levels. The curriculum prepares students for careers in dentistry, medicine, or research or with healthcare corporations. Required courses in mathematics, engineering, and science establish a strong foundation </P>

<P>on which the student builds a self-selected area of specialization. </P>

<P>A minimum of 18 course units in engineering design and engineering science, as well as substantial training in design, are required for a biomedical engineering degree. </P>

<P>Those seeking admission to dental or medical school should be familiar with the entrance requirements of schools to which they intend to apply. Many professional schools require courses in physics, organic, and/or physical chemistry and laboratory biology, in addition to courses required by the biomedical engineering program. These requirements may be satisfied by judicious use of electives. </P>

<H5>CHEMICAL ENGINEERING </H5>

<P>mccormick.northwestern.edu/chemical-biological </P>

<P>Chemical engineering is concerned primarily with the principles and processes involved in the conversion of raw materials into products vital to modern civilization. The products of the chemical and process industries range from antibiotics to zirconium, from petroleum to pharmaceuticals, from agricultural chemicals to plastics and synthetic rubber. The rapid introduction of new products gives chemical engineering its characteristic concern with the management and development of innovation. Chemical engineers have always played a pivotal role in the field of energy and more recently have become key players in sustainability and biotechnology. </P>

<P>While clearly rooted in chemistry, chemical engineering is a distinct discipline that makes significant contributions to society. Concerns about efficient utilization of raw materials, cost-effective and safe processing strategies, and environmental impact have shaped the evolution of the field. Chemical engineers are uniquely skilled in understanding molecular transformations; working over a wide range of scales, from molecular to global; analyzing quantitatively; and viewing, synthesizing, and analyzing large, complex systems. </P>

<P>Preparation for careers in the field requires a comprehension of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering principles. The chemical engineering curriculum provides broad fundamental training and prepares graduates for the chemical and process industries or for advanced study. The program aims at developing graduates who can plan, design, and operate new processes, who can contribute to the development of new chemical products, and who have potential for managerial responsibility in highly technical industrial enterprises. </P>

<H5>CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING </H5>

<P>mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental </P>

<P>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers two degree programs for undergraduate students, one in civil engineering and another in environmental engineering, as well as a minor in environmental engineering and an architectural engineering and design certificate. </P>

<P>Civil and environmental engineers play central roles in defining sustainable development approaches to the interactions of humans with earth systems. The curricula of these programs place strong emphasis on design, communication, teamwork, and the development of a systems perspective on the complex problems of today and tomorrow. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Civil Engineering </H5>

<P>Civil engineering provides solutions to pressing societal challenges for both the natural and built environments. Civil engineers design, construct, and manage visible structures, such as airports, skyscrapers, and bridges, as well as infrastructure systems. They provide safe drinking water, sustainable energy, and efficient mobility; sequester and treat waste; transform wastelands; and protect against natural disasters. </P>

<P>Civil engineers combine engineering knowledge with initiative and creativity to satisfy each project’s unique characteristics and objectives, protect society and natural resources, and meet budget constraints. They make use of biotechnology that supports environmental restoration; materials science that develops new building materials; preconstruction computer and analytical models that predict the response of infrastructure systems to stress; and advanced sensors and communication devices that monitor performance of bridges, tunnels, and buildings in real time, over long distances, and under extreme conditions. They also employ the social, economic, political, and managerial sciences and collaborate with other experts and the public. </P>

<P>Bridging science and society, civil engineering plays a leading role in supporting economic growth through planning, designing, building, and ensuring a sustainable infrastructure system. The profession recognizes the reality of limited natural resources; the desire for such sustainable practices as life-cycle analysis and sustainable design techniques; and the need for social equity in resource consumption. </P>

<P>Northwestern’s civil engineering curriculum has been designed to satisfy diverse interests and professional goals. Students customize study plans and have extensive options for social, economic, and managerial science courses outside the McCormick School. </P>

<P>While civil engineering graduates typically work in consulting firms, construction companies, governmental public works and transportation departments, and concrete and steel product industries, some work in the aerospace industry, on Wall Street, or in politics and policy development. A majority of Northwestern graduates receive advanced degrees and may work in other technical fields or medicine, law, research and development, or education. </P>

<P>Areas of Specialization </P>

<P>Since civil engineering students have a wide range of career options, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering prescribes only a minimum of required courses and subjects, allowing students to select the remainder freely or from specified broad categories. To make judicious choices that fit their needs, students are encouraged to discuss with faculty any proposed program that meets a well-defined goal. Examples of courses selected in the areas of specialization most often pursued are available on the department website. </P>

<P>Is the water safe to drink? Is the air dangerous to breathe? Should we eat the fish we catch and the crops we grow? Do our living and work spaces pose threats to our health? Environmental engineers are the technical professionals who address the potentially harmful interrelationships between human civilization and the environment. They identify and measure physical, chemical, and biological problems in the environment and apply scientific and technological knowledge to eliminate or reduce them. Systems designed and operated by environmental engineers shield the environment from the harmful effects of human activity, protect people from adverse environmental events such as floods and disease, and maintain and improve environmental quality. As their role has expanded, environmental engineers are being called on to address challenges associated with alternative energy, sustainability, climate change, ecological restoration, and public health. </P>

<P>Northwestern’s interdisciplinary four-year curriculum provides students with opportunities to supplement a sound foundation in environmental engineering principles with the knowledge of social sciences, humanities, and public policy that is desirable in the profession. </P>

<P>Students may pursue an optional concentration using technical electives and other courses from one or more of the following areas: management science, healthcare and humanitarian logistics, entrepreneurship, mathematical sciences/graduate preparation, statistics and data analysis, and production and logistics. </P>

<P>Many industrial engineering graduates eventually assume management positions. In preparation for such careers, students take full advantage of the additional academic, business, and leadership programs available at Northwestern: a major or minor in economics, the business enterprise certificate for engineers, the Undergraduate Leadership Program, the Business Institutions Program, study abroad, and the co-op program. The two-quarter senior design project allows students to integrate all of these experiences. </P>

<H5>MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING </H5>

<P>mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science </P>

<P>The discipline of materials science and engineering has expanded rapidly in response to growing demand for materials that make improved use of existing resources or are needed for new technologies. The program at Northwestern is broad based, offering educational and research opportunities in polymer science, ceramics, metallurgy, surface science, biomaterials, nanomaterials, and electronic materials. Engineers, scientists, and technologists who work on these different materials all basically apply the same scientific principles governing the interrelation of processing, structure, properties, and material performance. A key theme of the Northwestern program is the integration of these principles in the systematic design of new materials. </P>

<P>The department offers an undergraduate program leading to the BS degree and participates in the co-op and BS/MS programs. The curriculum centers on basic engineering and materials coursework but also provides the flexibility to focus on different areas of concentration as described below. The student’s educational experience is broadened by courses in the humanities, arts, sciences, and other areas of engineering. The undergraduate program culminates in the senior project, in which the student carries out a research/development project with a faculty member and his or her research group. </P>
</Sect>

<P>242 Engineering and Applied Science • Materials Science and Engineering </P>

<P>Students who complete the BS program will be well prepared for professional work or graduate study in the application, production, processing, or research and development of materials. Graduates find opportunities in many areas, since materials expertise is important in various engineering fields as well as in medicine, physics, and chemistry. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Areas of Concentration </H5>

<P>The undergraduate program at Northwestern offers a close relationship between students and faculty. Every effort is made to tailor specific programs to needs and interests. Several broad areas of concentration are described below. Students are encouraged to create other areas that fit particular interests. </P>

<P>Biomaterials </P>

<P>The growth of biotechnology has stimulated interest in the interface of the life sciences and materials science. The field of biomaterials spans three broad areas: biomedical implant materials to replace natural structures; biomimetic materials applying biological concepts to the design of new engineering materials; and application of materials science principles to the understanding of structure and function in biological systems. </P>

<P>Design and Manufacturing </P>

<P>This concentration is especially appropriate for those planning a career in industry, where engineers typically work in teams on projects requiring experience with design and manufacturing. It builds on the design content in the materials science curriculum and provides additional interdisciplinary design experience. The concentration also develops industrially relevant strengths in the areas of materials selection, computational tools, materials processing, and failure analysis. </P>

<P>Electronic Materials </P>

<P>As microelectronics enters the era of ultralarge-scale integration, materials scientists face new challenges in developing materials and processes for integrated circuits with components of nanometer dimensions. New scientific principles, materials fabrication techniques, and improved instrumentation will be needed to exploit electronic-level structure/property relations in devices and their components. New electronic materials must be developed to meet requirements in a growing range of application areas, such as spintronics, optical computing, and fuel cells. </P>

<P>Energy Materials </P>

<P>Materials play a key role in a variety of energy-related areas, including the search for new and efficient energy sources as well as energy storage and efficient energy utilization. Specific topics covered in this specialization include fuel cell materials, hydrogen generation and storage, solar energy conversion, lithium-ion battery materials, and lightweight energy-efficient structural materials. </P>

<P>Metals and Ceramics </P>

<P>The ability to design increasingly higher-strength alloys allows for lighter structures, and higher-temperature materials provide energy efficiency. Heat-treatable and toughened ceramics exploit advanced knowledge of solid-state phase transformations and reactions. Exciting developments are taking place in high-performance composite combinations of these and other materials for structural and electronic applications. </P>

<P>Nanomaterials </P>

<P>The area of nanomaterials, focusing on materials with sizes in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers, is an increasingly important research topic as nanotechnology industries develop. Examples of nanomaterials include ultrahigh-strength materials with nanometer-range structural features and structures designed and self-assembled atom by atom or molecule by molecule. Machines smaller than the tip of a pin can be built using either semiconductor materials processing or biologically inspired processing technology. This specialization is designed to give students the knowledge needed to work at the nanoscale, including design and synthesis, characterization, and theory/ modeling/simulation of nanomaterials. </P>

<P>Polymeric Materials </P>

<P>Synthetic polymers offer the engineering community an ever-expanding array of materials having properties tailored by chemical and physical processing. New developments are opening up applications for polymers as high-strength, low-weight materials; optoelectronic components; and key materials in other revolutionary areas. The basic understanding of engineering properties in terms of multilevel microstructure is essential for the full utilization of polymers. </P>

<P>Surface Science </P>

<P>A solid communicates with the outside world through its surface. Wear, corrosion, and passivation are well-known surface processes. Chemical, electronic, and mechanical properties of materials depend on composition at surfaces and grain boundaries (internal surfaces), surface treatments, and the environment. The surface scientist must be able to not only determine the properties of surfaces and interfaces but also to control them. </P>

<P>Sustainable Materials </P>

<P>Many technologies that the materials, manufacturing, energy, and water sectors currently rely on to provide benefits to humanity are not designed to last indefinitely. Redirection toward a more sustainable path is key. This concentration focuses on sustainability as it applies to </P>

<P>Engineering and Applied Science • Materials Science and Engineering 243 </P>

<Sect>
<P>materials and the manufacturing processes that convert them into a multitude of usable products. Students gain knowledge that bridges the domains of systems design and sustainable materials development and engineering. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>Laboratories and Facilities </H5>

<P>Materials science and engineering demands sophisticated experimental techniques for the preparation and characterization of advanced materials. The undergraduate program makes heavy use of state-of-the-art laboratory facilities in core courses, technical electives, and senior projects. </P>

<P>Materials preparation and processing equipment is available for all classes of materials, including an advanced crystal growth facility in a clean-room environment for preparing single crystals of metals, oxides, alkali halides, and semiconductors. Investigation of complex microstructures employs a wide array of microscopy, diffraction, and microanalysis techniques. A unique combination of instruments (cold field–emission transmission electron microscope, atom-probe field-ion microscopes, scanning tunneling microscopes) provides atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis. These are complemented by an extensive surface analytical laboratory. Characterization of material properties employs an advanced mechanical testing facility featuring static and dynamic loading under controlled temperature and environment. Specialized facilities measure electrical, spectroscopic, magnetic, and photonic properties. Computer laboratories and a design studio address thermodynamic modeling and simulation of microstructural evolution, with application in materials design. </P>

<H5>MECHANICAL ENGINEERING </H5>

<P>mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical </P>

<P>The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a broad range of programs leading to the bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. </P>

<P>Mechanical engineering has always meant engines and machinery, but the character of modern engines and machinery has changed enormously because of the ever-increasing demands of performance, compactness, reliability, and productivity. The early devices were built by ingenious mechanics who possessed the know-how to reduce ideas to practice. In an increasingly competitive world, traditional know-how and creative ability are as necessary as ever but no longer sufficient. It is also necessary to know why things occur and thus be able to guide the earliest stages of planning. With finite resources and increasing awareness of the environment, mechanical engineers must cope with the undesirable effects of pollution as well as the traditional concerns of efficiency and safety. The tools they need must be more sophisticated. </P>

<P>Mechanical engineering plays a dominant role in a wide spectrum of industries, among them transportation (automotive, rail, air, and marine), heavy machinery (machines producing other machines), the power industry, the environmental industry (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning), robotics, light precision-machine enterprises (optical, prosthetic devices, mechanical instruments, and the like), and numerous commercial-product industries. </P>

<P>Preparation for a career in mechanical engineering requires a basic understanding of the mathematical, physical, and engineering principles essential to planning, designing, and manufacturing new equipment. The curriculum provides a broad fundamental preparation for direct entry into industry as well as for further professional study. The first part of the curriculum is devoted to mathematics, </P>
</Sect>

<P>246 Engineering and Applied Science • Mechanical Engineering </P>

<P>physics, and chemistry. With this background, fundamental mechanical engineering subjects, such as dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and thermodynamics, are studied, followed by specialized subjects, such as manufacturing, heat transfer, and automatic control. During the final two years design courses, laboratory courses, and project courses allow students to acquire a taste for the complex task of designing, analyzing, and building a piece of “hardware.” In particular, students become aware of the relationships among conceptual design, subsequent analysis (mathematical modeling), manufacturing, systematic experimentation, and final testing. Supporting courses in allied fields of science and engineering broaden technical proficiency, while the elective courses in social sciences, fine arts, history, and philosophy enlarge the background in the problems of humanity. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Elective Concentrations </H5>

<P>The program in mechanical engineering is designed to appeal to students with a wide variety of interests and professional goals. By choosing the 4 required elective courses wisely, students can develop a highly personalized curriculum. Some areas of concentration are computer-aided design and manufacturing, fluid mechanics, robotics, systems and control, and tribology. In addition, there are seven concentrations: biomedical engineering, design, energy, intelligent mechanical systems, manufacturing, nanotechnology/MEMS, and solid mechanics. </P>

<P>The biomedical engineering concentration is open to students interested in the biological and medical applications of mechanical engineering procedures. Students in this concentration can also satisfy the entrance requirements of medical schools. </P>

<P>The design concentration focuses on product design with related conceptual and manufacturing processes. </P>

<P>The energy concentration emphasizes the mechanical aspects of energy conversion and management. </P>

<P>The intelligent mechanical systems concentration focuses on the design of devices featuring mechanical hardware interfaces with electronic hardware and software. </P>

<P>The manufacturing concentration is directed toward planning and selecting manufacturing methods, design for manufacture, computer-aided flexible automation and robotics, and increased efficiency and productivity of current and emerging manufacturing technologies. </P>

<P>The nanotechnology/microelectromechanical systems concentration focuses on engineering at nanometer- and micrometer-length scales, including properties of materials and design and fabrication of devices. </P>

<P>The solid mechanics concentration focuses on the study of stress and strain in solid bodies, along with the application of computational methods for stress analysis. </P>

<P>medill.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>Medill’s undergraduate program leads the way in preparing students to navigate and help shape a media landscape of unprecedented change. </P>

<P>A Medill education emphasizes the development of skills not only in writing, reporting, editing, production, and critical thinking but also in using multimedia tools to create compelling, high-impact journalism. </P>

<P>The bachelor of science in journalism (BSJ) degree program develops well-rounded students who are broadly educated in the liberal arts and sciences, knowledgeable about diverse cultures and social inequalities in the United States and abroad, and ready for careers in both traditional and nontraditional media and communications. </P>

<P>Medill also offers an Integrated Marketing Communications Certificate Program focusing on effective IMC strategies for an increasingly digital media environment. Students learn how to conduct research and analyze data on consumer behavior, media usage, and marketing communications effectiveness. They learn about message creation and delivery through a wide variety of media channels. (See page 256 for more information on the IMC certificate.) </P>

<P>Real-world training and immersion experiences reflect Medill’s philosophy. A sophomore-year course sends students into deep subject-specific reporting and writing with an emphasis on fieldwork. They discover issues important to particular audiences and sharpen reporting and writing skills as they produce relevant, engaging multimedia stories. </P>

<P>Through the Medill on the Hill program, students may spend a quarter in Washington, DC, reporting and writing about politics and Capitol Hill. The San Francisco Bay Area Immersion program, offered in partnership with the McCormick School’s Segal Design Institute, offers Medill students the opportunity to study at the intersection of design and media innovation. </P>

<P>During their junior or senior year, students get real-world experience and networking opportunities within a media company or marketing firm through Journalism Residency. They work alongside professional mentors in one of more than 100 newspapers, magazines, broadcast stations, documentary houses, and public relations and marketing firms across the United States and selected locations abroad, including South Africa, Latin America, and the Persian Gulf. </P>

<P>In 2008 Northwestern opened a campus in Qatar offering programs in journalism and communication. Evanston-based journalism students are eligible to spend a term at Northwestern University in Qatar and other universities in the Qatar Foundation’s Education City in Doha. (For more on Northwestern University in Qatar, see page 9.) </P>

<P>Medill students routinely win national awards and go on to become leaders and innovators in journalism, media, and integrated marketing communications. </P>

<H4 id="LinkTarget_741">Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music </H4>

<P>music.northwestern.edu </P>

<P>One of the oldest degree-granting music institutions in the United States, Northwestern University’s Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music combines a nationally ranked music program of conservatory-level intensity with the academic rigor and scholarly resources found only at a world-class private research university. The Bienen School of Music is a professional school within the University. Entering first-year undergraduates show highest-level achievement in academics as well as music. The school believes that by carefully developing outstanding musicianship and keen intelligence, while nurturing a curiosity about the world, we can best encourage the emergence of each student’s unique creative voice. </P>

<P>All students at the Bienen School of Music are expected to grow as artists and as people. They are encouraged to explore in depth other areas of interest, drawing on the vast resources of Northwestern’s other schools, and to develop the critical thinking and communication skills necessary for a successful career in music. </P>

<P>Key to all degree programs is intensive one-on-one training with a celebrated faculty that includes members of the Chicago Symphony and Lyric Opera of Chicago Orchestras, internationally acclaimed soloists, sought-after conductors, and distinguished scholars and clinicians. Students work in small classes with these dedicated teachers and artists in a curriculum that comprises music history and theory, aural and piano skills, instrumental and voice lessons, and electives. Special programs include a five-year dual-degree curriculum—enabling students to earn a degree in music as well as one in communication, education and social policy, engineering, journalism, or arts and sciences—and the ad hoc (self-designed) degree, an option offered by no other major music school. Additionally, the world-class music making and other cultural resources of downtown Chicago provide exceptional opportunities for learning outside the classroom. </P>

<P>Performing and research opportunities abound at Northwestern. Students may participate in 16 ensembles and chamber groups and have access to more than 400 performances each year, including three critically acclaimed professional series as well as master classes by internationally renowned performers. In addition, the school sponsors the biennial Michael Ludwig Nemmers Prize in Music Composition and the Jean Gimbel Lane Prize in Piano Performance, which regularly bring world-renowned composers and pianists to campus. Northwestern’s Music Library is among the nation’s largest music research collections and is distinguished internationally for its particular commitment to 20th-century and contemporary music, represented especially in extensive holdings of printed music, manuscripts, and archives. </P>

<P>A Bienen School of Music education provides students with skills and values—superb musicianship, a mastery of communication, a sense of discipline, a commitment to excellence—that prepare them for success wherever their interests may lead. </P>

<P>The Bienen School of Music is a founding member of the National Association of Schools of Music, which fully accredits all its degree programs. </P>

<H5>ACADEMIC POLICIES </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Programs of Study </H5>

<P>The Bienen School of Music offers programs leading to the professional degrees of bachelor of music, master of music, and doctor of musical arts. The school also offers two nonprofessional degrees, the bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music. </P>

<P>The curriculum allows flexibility for students while providing an education that is basic for all musicians. Applicants in all areas who are accepted by the Bienen School enter directly into a program of specialization that begins in the first undergraduate year. The core studies, taken by all students, require the acquisition of minimum competencies and provide fundamental and essential experiences that complement the specialized studies in the declared major. Students are also required to complete studies in a number of allied subjects throughout the University. </P>

<P>Bachelor of Music </P>

<P>Courses of study leading to the bachelor of music degree include majors in piano, strings, voice, winds and percussion, jazz, music cognition, music composition, music education, musicology, and music theory. It is also possible to design an ad hoc major as a second major that cuts across specializations to meet a particular student’s needs and career ambitions. Ad hoc majors are designed in consultation with faculty and Chicago-area professionals with expertise in the particular area of interest; specializations have included areas such as arts administration, music criticism, music theater production, and popular musicology. For degree requirements for the bachelor of music, see below. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Music • Academic Policies 259 </P>

<P>Liberal Arts Degrees in Music </P>

<P>The bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music are nonperformance degrees that offer a broad liberal arts education with a major in music. The requirements of the BAMus are essentially identical to those for the BA in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; the requirements for the BSMus are the same as those for the BAMus except that the BSMus has no language requirement. Within these degrees’ focus on music, there are a wide range of possibilities for study, from cultural musicology to cognitive studies of music and from music composition to advanced theory; the options also include an ad hoc specialization designed to meet a particular student’s needs and career ambitions. These degrees are an excellent stepping-stone to further education in music or to any career for which a knowledge of music brings depth and enrichment. The curricula offer considerable latitude in designing a sequence of courses to suit the student’s interests and goals. A key feature for the student is the planning and execution of a senior project. For specific degree requirements, see next column. </P>

<P>Dual Bachelor’s Degree Programs </P>

<P>The Bienen School of Music offers dual bachelor’s degree programs with the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences (music and liberal arts), the School of Communication (music and communication), the School of Education and Social Policy (music and education and social policy), the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science (music and engineering), and the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications (music and journalism).

</LI>
</L>

<P>Overlay Requirement in Business or Finance </P>

<P>All Bienen School undergraduates are required to complete a 1-credit “overlay” requirement in business or finance. The requirement is so termed because it does not add to the existing number of courses required for undergraduate degrees; depending on which course is chosen, the course counts toward the student’s general education or free electives requirement. See the Office of Student Affairs for a list of recommended courses. </P>

<P>Other Requirements </P>

<P>Music majors must earn a grade of C or above in all courses required in the major, including all core requirements and all specialization courses, in order to count those courses toward graduation requirements. A grade of D or above (including P grades for four-year students) may be used to fulfill distribution requirements and electives. If a student receives a D in a major course, then takes that course a second time and receives a C grade or above, the initial D grade remains on the permanent record and cannot count toward elective requirements. The second (improved) grade does not replace the first, and the same course cannot be counted twice in the degree. A maximum of 6 1-credit courses in nonmusic subjects taken under </P>
</Sect>

<P>260 Music • Academic Options </P>

<P>the P/N grade option may be counted toward the degree. Music students may not take music courses under the P/N grade option, except for those courses graded solely with P/N grades. </P>

<P>If students interrupt their program of study for an extended period of time and degree requirements are changed during this period, they will normally be held to the new requirements. </P>

<P>Every candidate for a degree must file a graduation petition one year in advance of the date of graduation. </P>

<P>Students coming to Northwestern University for a second undergraduate degree must transfer at least 9 units of credit in music, audition for admission at the 300 level, complete the general education distribution requirement with transfer credit, and comply with the University’s Undergraduate Registration Requirement for transfer students. </P>

<P>In addition to and independent of the requirements set by the Bienen School of Music, all students must satisfy the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (see page 17 in the Undergraduate Education chapter of this catalog). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Applied Music Study </H5>

<P>The Bienen School of Music offers individual instruction for majors in piano, strings, voice, winds and percussion, jazz, and composition. Students should consult their program coordinators for the assignment of an instructor. Consent of the instructor, program coordinator, and department chair as well as concurrent registration in ensemble are required. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Attendance Policy </H5>

<P>Students are expected to attend all sessions of courses and ensembles for which they are registered. It is the responsibility of students enrolled in the Bienen School of Music to acquaint themselves and comply with the attendance policy of their departments, class instructors, and ensemble conductors. In addition, students who are absent from classes for three or more consecutive days because of illness are required to notify the Office of Student Affairs. </P>

<P>Outside professional opportunities may arise for music students. If such an opportunity directly interferes in any way with curricular responsibilities, students must first obtain permission from faculty of record for courses potentially affected, including classes, opera, and ensembles, along with the signature of the program coordinator and a signature from one of the cochairs of the Department of Music Performance. </P>

<P>Failure to comply with these regulations can be cause for failure in the courses or ensembles for which a student is registered during that quarter. </P>

<P>See the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. </P>

<H5>ACADEMIC OPTIONS </H5>

<Sect>
<H5>Double Major </H5>

<P>Students may earn a double major in four years by fulfilling the requirements of both majors. Typically, the double major within the Bienen School of Music combines a specialization in a performance area with one in an academic area, although double majors in two academic areas are also possible. A double major in two performance areas is generally not permitted. Four-year bachelor of music students may also complete a second major outside the music school but may earn only one bachelor’s degree. Bienen School of Music students who choose to leave the school for another school at Northwestern may still complete a music major as a second major, although in these cases no degree from the Bienen School will be awarded. </P>

<P>Candidates for the bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music may double major with any major offered in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences but may earn only one bachelor’s degree. Candidates for bachelor’s degrees in all Northwestern undergraduate schools other than the Bienen School may complete a second major from the Bienen School but must first successfully complete the application and audition process through the Bienen School’s admission office. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Minor Programs </H5>

<P>The Bienen School of Music offers minors in arts administration, commercial music, general music, music cognition, music composition, music criticism, music education, musicology, music technology, and music theory. Minor programs include a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 9 courses, of which a minimum of 5 courses are not double-counted toward the major. Students must receive a grade of C or above in all courses counted toward the minor; no P/N grades are allowed. Students who wish to complete a minor program should fill out a Minor Declaration Form, available in the Office of Student Affairs, and should fill out a minor petition form one year before graduation. Students may pursue more than one Bienen School of Music minor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Program Honors </H5>

<P>Each year faculty are invited to nominate graduating students for program honors. To be eligible for program honors, students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or above and be outstanding contributors to their respective programs. Additional criteria govern the selection of voice majors; see the coordinator of the voice and opera program for details. Faculty select only a small number of students in each program for program honors in a given year; for more information, contact the Office of Student Affairs in the Bienen School of Music. </P>

<P>Graduates with a major in music education meet all requirements for teacher certification in the state of Illinois as well as most other states. Students take the professional program required of all music students, a structured sequence of courses in general education, a basic set of courses in music education, and special courses in the chosen music education specialization. The combination results in a program that prepares professionals with a broad understanding of music and education as well as the skills to be effective music teachers. </P>

<P>Students in the undergraduate music education program must take all the core studies in music and all the professional studies in music education plus the general education courses required for teacher certification. They must also choose one of the three specialization tracks— instrumental, choral, or general—and take the required courses for that track. A combined track is also available for students interested in a hybrid version of the music education major; see the music education program coordinator for advising on this option. All music education majors are required to complete 100 hours of clinical observation. </P>
