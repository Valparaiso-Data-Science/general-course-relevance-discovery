<H1>THE UNIVERSITY</H1>

<Sect>
<H2> HISTORY AND FUNCTIONS </H2>

<Sect>
<P>East Central University was established by legislative act in 1909 as one of three regional state normal schools founded that year in the eastern half of Oklahoma, that part which had been Indian Territory before the founding of the State in 1907. Three similar institutions had been established earlier in Oklahoma Territory, which became the western half of the new state.  The six institutions for many years served virtually identical purposes in the state’s program of higher education. </P>

<P>The normal school program consisted of four years of preparatory, or high school, work and two years at the college level.  Graduates of the normal schools were awarded lifetime licenses for teaching in the public schools of the state.  In 1919 the six state normal schools were authorized to increase their college programs to four years of teacher education and to confer bachelors degrees.  At that time they were designated teachers’ colleges.  In 1939 they were authorized to expand their programs to include degree programs in Arts and Sciences as well as Education, and the designation was changed to Oklahoma state colleges. </P>

<P>In 1954 East Central University and the other Oklahoma state colleges were authorized to offer their ﬁrst graduate work in a ﬁ fth-year program for teachers leading to the Master of Teaching degree.  In 1969 the state colleges were authorized to change the name of this advanced degree from Master of Teaching to Master of Education.  Other masters degrees have since been added. </P>

<P>In 1974 the Oklahoma State Legislature ofﬁcially changed the name of East Central from East Central State College to East Central Oklahoma State University and in 1985 the ofﬁcial title became East Central University.  The academic schools of the University are the following:  the Harland C. Stonecipher School of Business; the College of Education and Psychology; the College of Health and Sciences;  the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences; and the School of Graduate Studies.  </P>

<P>As a unit in the state’s system of higher education receiving principal support from public taxation, East Central University has sought to serve the needs of the people of the state in a democratically responsive manner.  The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education have speciﬁed the following functions for the senior universities of the state. </P>

<P>The functions of the senior universities include:  (1) offering undergraduate study in several ﬁelds leading to the bachelors degree; (2) offering a limited number of programs leading to the ﬁ rst professional degree when appropriate to an institution’s strengths and the needs of the state; (3) offering graduate study at the masters level, primarily in teacher education and in selected ﬁelds related to Oklahoma’s human resource needs; (4) responsibility for extension and public service in the assigned geographic regions; (5) responsibility for institutional and applied research in those areas related closely to their program assignments; (6) responsibility for regional programs of economic development; (7) responsibility for offering associate degrees when not in close proximity to a community college; (8) responsibility for offering certiﬁcate programs as speciﬁcally authorized; (9) responsibility for offering programs of statewide impact; and (10) admitting students in the top one half of the class as deﬁned in State Regents Policy.  All of these functions except number seven have relevance for East Central University. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>VALUES </H5>

<P>Values are core beliefs or desires that guide or motivate attitudes and actions. They also deﬁne the things we value and prize the most and, therefore, provide the basis for ranking the things we want in a way that elevates some values over others. East Central University has established the following shared values that unite us as an organization and guide our actions and decisions: </P>

<P>1. Integrity </P>

<P>We respect and value people by treating others as we want to be treated. We are honest by representing ourselves and our intentions truthfully. </P>

<P>2. Commitment </P>

<P>We take responsibility by being at our personal best for East Central University.  We commit to excellence by being personally dedicated to the continuous improvement of East Central University. </P>

<P>3. Diversity </P>

<P>We recognize that a diverse faculty, staff, and student body enriches the quality of education and helps to prepare graduates to live and work in a culturally pluralistic, interdependent world. </P>

<P>4. Citizenship </P>

<P>We recognize that the worth of an organization is reﬂ ected in its impact on the community and how it conducts its business with others. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>TO THE PROSPECTIVE STUDENT </H2>

<Sect>
<P>East Central University is an accredited, tax-supported part of the Oklahoma System of Higher Education, directed by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.  East Central University students wishing to continue their education elsewhere in undergraduate, graduate, or professional schools readily transfer their academic credits from East Central University either within or outside of Oklahoma, and East Central University accepts academic credits transferred from accredited institutions. </P>

<P>The University grants bachelors degrees in many of the traditional academic disciplines.  East Central University’s graduate training culminates in the masters degree.  The University prepares students to follow many occupations and educates them in a broad background of general studies.

<P>Computer science courses (one or more units) that meet the State Regents’ guidelines for high school curricular requirements may satisfy the postsecondary systemwide computer proﬁciency graduation requirement (see the State Regents’ Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy). </P>

<P>In addition to the above requirements, the following subjects are recommended for college preparation: 2  additional units: Fine arts - music, art, drama, and speech 1  additional unit: Lab science (as described above) 1  additional unit: Mathematics (as described above) 4  Recommended Units. </P>

<P>While these curricular requirements will normally be met by students in grades 9 through 12, advanced students who complete these courses in earlier grades will not be required to take additional courses for purposes of admission. </P>

<P>The remaining units required by the State Board of Education for high school graduation may be selected from courses to meet students’ individual needs and interests. </P>

<P>Additionally, 70 O.S. § 11-103.6 outlines the curricular units or sets of competencies that are required to graduate from an Oklahoma public high school. By virtue of this statute, high school courses that satisfy college admission requirements, which are subject to State Regents’ approval, also satisfy speciﬁc college preparatory/work ready curricular high school graduation requirements. Therefore, if a high school or the </P>

<P>Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education wishes to determine if a course will satisfy a college admission curricular requirement, which ﬁts within one of the legislatively deﬁned college preparatory/work ready curricular subject areas, but is not explicitly detailed therein, it shall require State Regents’ approval. Additional information regarding the course review process may be found in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook. </P>

<LI>
<Lbl>1.  </Lbl>

<LBody>Baccalaureate Programs </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>Students must meet all basic academic skills curricular requirements (English, mathematics, and science) to be admitted to baccalaureate programs at research or regional institutions. Students with a deﬁciency in a non-basic academic skills course (excludes English, mathematics, and science) who present an ACT reading subject score at or above the speciﬁed level or who score at the designated level on any approved secondary institutional reading assessment instrument may be admitted as a regular admission student. These students will be required to complete an additional three-hour collegiate course in the relative subject area to make up the high school deﬁciency (see the State Regents’ High School Curricular Requirements policy). Other exceptions are noted in the special admission options outlined later in this policy. If an institution admits students with one or more curricular deﬁciencies to a baccalaureate program utilizing the alternative admission category, the institution must provide the means to satisfy those deﬁciencies (see the State Regents’ High School Curricular Requirements policy) and the student must successfully remediate basic academic skills course requirements within 24 college level hours attempted. Students continuously enrolled in courses designed to remove deﬁciencies bay be allowed to continue enrollment beyond the 24 hour limit. </LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>2.   </Lbl>

<LBody>Associate in Arts and Associate in Science Programs </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>Students lacking curricular requirements are admissible into AA or AS programs in the community colleges but must remediate curricular deﬁciencies in the basic academic skills at the earliest possible time but within the ﬁrst 24 college-level hours attempted. Students continuously enrolled in courses designed to remove deﬁciencies may be allowed to continue enrollment beyond the 24 hour limit. In addition, students must remove curricular deﬁciencies in a discipline area before taking collegiate level work in that discipline. </LI>
</L>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.    </Lbl>

<LBody>Associate in Applied Science Programs </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students entering AAS degree programs or other certiﬁ cate programs must remove high school curricular requirement deﬁciencies before taking courses in the same ﬁeld as part of an AAS degree or certiﬁcate program. Students admitted under this provision may not transfer into an AA, AS or baccalaureate program without ﬁrst removing the high school curricular deﬁ ciencies. </P>

<P>Students may remove curricular deﬁciencies as detailed in the State Regents’ High School Curricular Requirements policy. The institution’s president or the president’s designee may allow a deserving student who failed to remediate a basic academic skills deﬁciency in a single subject to continue to enroll in collegiate level courses in addition to remedial course work beyond the 24-hour limit providing the student has demonstrated success in collegiate courses to date. Such exceptions must be appropriately documented. </P>

<P>Students pursuing admission to AA, AS, AAS, or baccalaureate degree programs may not count remedial/ development courses toward satisfaction of degree program requirements. </P>

<P>C. Applied Courses </P>

<P>The use of applied courses to meet the high school curricular requirements is to be considered an alternative. College bound students are encouraged to take courses currently speciﬁ ed in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy. The State Regents are interested in experimenting with alternative delivery systems that might facilitate student interest and success. It must be noted that the State Regents request and expect high school transcripts to be valid and reﬂective of the actual courses taken by students; anything less threatens the integrity of the academic process. </P>

<P>One year of Principles of Technology may substitute for one of the currently required lab science courses providing that students taking the course also successfully complete a lab science course listed in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy. Additionally, the Principles of Technology course must be taught by a teacher certiﬁ ed or endorsed in physics who has completed the specialized training to instruct the course.</P>

<Sect>
<H5>  3.9.4  Admission of First-Time Freshmen: Performance  Requirements </H5>

<P>Students must meet the criteria for both the high school curricular requirements and the high school performance requirements as deﬁned in the following sections. Students meeting both the high school curricular and the high school performance requirements are eligible for admission. This section includes performance requirements for regular admission which includes three options for admission: standardized tests, high school GPA in all courses plus class rank, or high school GPA in theState Regents’ 15-units of required high school core courses. </P>

<P>The ACT score used for admission purposes is the composite score without the writing component. The SAT score used for admission purposes is the combined critical reading and math scores without the writing component. Students utilizing a test other than ACT will have their scores converted to ACT equivalents. The high school class rank is one more than the number of students in the high school graduating class who have a high school GPA greater than the student in question. </P>

<P>A GED recipient’s high school class must have graduated to be eligible for admission. The president or the president’s designee may allow exceptions on an individual student basis. Any exceptions, including subsequent student academic performance, will be reported to the State Regents upon request. The University of Oklahoma (OU) is authorized by the State Regents to also require a minimum average standard GED score for automatic admission. </P>

<P>The high school GPA used for admission purposes in option 2 is the unweighted average of all grades (“A” equating to 4.00 and “D” equating to 1.00) taken in the 9th through 12 grades. The GPA used for admission purposes in option 3 shall add a standard weighting (1.0) to The College Board’s Advanced Placement courses and the International Baccalaureate Organization’s higher-level courses (an “F” remains zero). </P>

<P>While the State Regents strongly support the initiation of honors courses, honors weighting will not be used in the calculation of either high school GPA because there is no equitable mechanism to include the honors premium. </P>

<P>The exact standardized test scores and high school GPA will vary over time, and may differ at each institution. The high school GPA will be deﬁned annually to correspond to the rank in class. The ACT score equivalent to these percentages will be determined based on the average of the preceding three years’ACT scores of graduating seniors if available. Oklahoma test data will be used. The concordance table used to set the equivalent SAT score is updated regularly. </P>

<P>First-time entering students must also meet entry-level assessment requirements before enrolling in college-level courses. See the State Regents’ Student Assessment and Remediation policy for more information. </P>

<H5>3.9.6  Special Admission </H5>

<P>Students admitted must meet curricular standards as deﬁ ned in section 3.9.4, and must meet the high school performance criteria as deﬁned in section 3.9.4.  The only exceptions are students admitted in the following special admission categories. </P>

<P>A.   Special Non-Degree Seeking Student </P>

<P>Students who wish to enroll in courses without intending to pursue a degree may be permitted to enroll in no more than nine credit hours without submitting academic credentials or meeting the academic curricular or performance requirements of the institution of desired entry. Retention standards will be enforced. Once a student has completed the designated number of hours, the student is required to meet the formal admission or transfer criteria for the institution of desired entry in order to enroll in additional course work. (This provision is not intended to be limited only to ﬁ rst-timeentering students.) </P>

<P>The president or the president’s designee may allow nondegree-seeking students to exceed this initial nine credit-hour limit on an individual student basis. Such exceptions may be made for non-degree-seeking students only who meet the retention standards and must be  appropriately documented and reported to the State Regents annually. </P>

<P>B.  Alternative Admission </P>

<P>Research and regional institutions may admit 8 percent of the number of previous year’s ﬁrst-time freshmen or 50 students (whichever is greater) without the students having met the State Regents’ high school curricular or performance admission requirements. Institutions admitting students through the alternative admission category must have formally established admission criteria on ﬁle at the State Regents’ ofﬁce. The criteria must be oriented to identifying those students who: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.</Lbl>

<LBody> have a reasonable chance for academic success; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.</Lbl>

<LBody> have unusual talent or ability in art, drama, music, sports, etc; or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.</Lbl>

<LBody> are educationally or economically disadvantaged and show promise of being able to succeed in a program or curriculum at the institution where they desire to enroll. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Institutions should use interviews as a part of the mechanism for admitting students in this program. Students wishing to enter under the alternative admission category should be given the opportunity to convince the institutions of their ability through this interview process. In addition, the institution must have implemented programs designed to assist ﬁrst-year students making the transition to college both academically and socially. </P>

<P>The objective of these procedures and programs is to increase the success rate of students as measured by the increase in the retention and graduation rates of all students and particularly minority students. </P>

<P>It is intended that the alternative admission opportunities be equitably utilized and proportionately represent different types of students of unusual talent or abilities who do not otherwise meet State Regents’ admission standards. Waivers shall not be awarded in signiﬁcant disproportion for scholarship athletes. It shall be used to promote the system goal of social justice. </P>

<P>C.  Adult Admission </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.</Lbl>

<LBody> Students who are 21 years of age or older or on active military duty may be admitted based on criteria established at the campus level and submitted to and approved by the State Regents. For students admitted under the adult admission category, the campus must consider the probability of the academic success of the student. Related to the curricular requirements, students admitted under the adult admission category must demonstrate proﬁ ciency to the satisfaction of the entering institution in the curricular area the student desires to pursue. Institutions will be required to submit an annual report of those students admitted in this category to the State Regents. </LBody>

<P>E.   Opportunity Admission Category </P>

<P>Students who have not graduated from high school whose composite standard score on the ACT without the writing component places them at the 99th percentile of all students using Oklahoma norms, or whose combined critical reading and mathematical score on the SAT without the writing component places them at the 99th percentile of all students using national norms may apply for full enrollment at a college or university of the State System. The college or university will determine admissibility based on test scores, evaluation of the student’s level of maturity and ability to function in the adult college environment, and whether the experience will be in the best interest of the student intellectually and socially. </P>

<P>F.  Correspondence Study Enrollment </P>

<P>Admission to the institution is not required for enrollment in correspondence work. However, academic credit for correspondence work will not be applicable toward a degree until such time as the student has been formally admitted to the institution and has secured the approval of the appropriate academic ofﬁcers for such credit. Students who desire to apply credit for correspondence courses must make the necessary arrangements with the school where credit is to be applied. Completed courses will appear on the student’s ofﬁcial transcript and be designated as correspondence study. </P>

<P>Refer to page 14 of ECU Catalog, Undergraduate Transfer and Articulation Policy (3.11.3). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.9.8   Retention Standards </H5>

<P>In keeping with this philosophy of maximizing student success, institutions are strongly urged to initiate or strengthen programs which will assure that students experiencing academic difﬁculties will be provided appropriate academic assistance. Such specially designed programs should include, but not be limited to, academic and career counseling, tutoring opportunities, study skills sessions, and diagnostic testing as appropriate. Students on academic notice or academic probation should be required as a condition for continued enrollment to participate in these special academic support services. These programs should be available to all students who feel participation will enhance their academic performance and success. </P>

<P>A. GPA Requirements </P>

<P>All students must maintain a 2.0 GPA for the duration of the college experience with the exception of freshmen on academic notice and academic probation. A student will be placed on academic probation if the following requirements are not met: </P>

<P>Credit Hours Attempted  GPA Requirement 0 through 30 semester credit hours  1.7 Greater than 30 semester credit hours                2.0 </P>

<P>Students with 30 or fewer credit hours, with a GPA of 1.7 to less than 2.0 will be placed on academic notice. All courses in which a student has a recorded grade will be counted in the calculation of the GPA for retention purposes excluding any courses repeated, reprieved or renewed as detailed in the State Regents’ Grading policy, developmental education, and physical education activity courses. </P>

<P>Any student not maintaining satisfactory progress toward the academic objective as indicated above will be placed on probation for one semester. At the end of that semester, the student must have a semester GPA of 2.0 in regularly-graded course work, not to include activity or performance courses, or meet the minimum GPA standard required above, in order to continue as a student. Students not meeting either of these criteria will be immediately suspended and may not be reinstated until one regular semester (fall or spring) has elapsed. </P>

<P>Students suspended in the spring semester may attend, at the discretion of the suspending institution, the summer session immediately following spring suspension. However, such students may enroll only in core academic courses which meet the general education requirements or degree requirements. The student’s transcript will note suspension at the end of the spring semester. For students who fail to achieve retention standards after the summer session, the phrase “suspension continued” should be entered on the transcript at the end of the summer session. Only students under ﬁ rst-time suspension status at the suspending institution are eligible. To continue in that fall semester, such students must achieve a 2.0 semester GPA or raise their GPA to the required level. </P>

<P>B.  Suspension of Seniors </P>

<P>An institution may allow a student with 90 or more hours in a speciﬁed degree program who has failed to meet the GPA of 2.0 or the semester GPA of 2.0 to enroll in up to 15 additional semester hours in a further attempt to achieve the GPA requirement. During this 15 hours of enrollment, the student must achieve a minimum 2.0 semester GPA during each enrollment or raise the GPA to 2.0 or above. This senior suspension exception can be exercised only once per student. </P>

<P>C.  Academic Suspension Appeals </P>

<P>Institutions have the discretion to establish an academic suspension appeals procedure. Such procedures should allow appropriate discretion in deserving cases. Academic suspension appeal procedures should require that the suspended student document any extraordinary personal circumstances that contributed to the academic deﬁ ciencies. Such events must be highly unusual such as the death of an immediate relative; a serious illness; severe ﬁ nancial distress; direct, signiﬁcant work conﬂicts; unexpected, substantial family obligations; or personal crisis. Such appeals decisions should be made only following the thoughtful deliberation of an appropriate committee which may include faculty, students, and administrators. Any institutional policies and procedures developed for the appeal of academic suspension decisions must be submitted to and approved by the State Regents. Annual reports detailing all decisions concerning appeals requests will be submitted to the State Regents. </P>

<P>D.  Readmission of Suspended Students </P>

<P>Students who are academically suspended by an institution will not be allowed to reenter the suspending institution for at least one regular semester (fall or spring) except as noted above. Institutions should develop policies and procedures to guide the readmission of suspended students. Such policies should include the provision that suspended students can be readmitted only one time. Such students are readmitted on probationary status and must maintain a 2.0 GPA average each semester attempted while on probation or raise their GPA to the designated level. Should a reinstated student be suspended a second time from the same institution, the student cannot return to the suspending school until such time as the student has demonstrated, by attending another institution, the ability to succeed academically by raising the GPA to the retention </P>

<P>standards. </P>

<P>E.  Reinstatement of Suspended Students at System Institutions </P>

<P>It is the intent of the State Regents that public higher education opportunities be provided for all citizens with the ability and desire to use these public services. As previously stated, students will not be permitted readmission to the suspending institution for a minimum of one regular semester (fall or spring). However, research indicates that many times students suspended from one institution may succeed in a new academic environment if given the opportunity. As such, institutions may develop a special admission procedure, subject to State Regents’ approval, for students who are suspended from other system institutions and who would otherwise qualify for admission to the reinstating institution. Such students would be admitted at the discretion of the receiving institution and such admission would be probationary. Institutions admitting such students should provide the appropriate academic services to facilitate their success. </P>

<H5>3.9.10   Non-Academic Criteria for Admission </H5>

<P>A. In addition to the academic criteria used by institutions in the State System as the basis for student admission, institutions shall consider the following non-academic criteria in deciding whether a ﬁrst-time applicant or a transfer student shall be granted admission: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.</Lbl>

<LBody> Whether an applicant has been expelled, suspended, denied admission or denied readmission by any other educational institution. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.</Lbl>

<LBody> Whether an applicant has been convicted of a felony or convicted of any lesser crime involving moral turpitude. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.</Lbl>

<LBody> Whether an applicant’s conduct has been such that if, at the time of the conduct in question, the applicant had been a student at the institution to which application is made, the course of conduct would have been grounds for expulsion, suspension, dismissal or denial of readmission. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>B. If the institution ﬁnds that an applicant has any of the above, then the institution shall deny admission to applicant if it decides that any of the events described indicates the applicant’s unﬁ tness, at the time of application, to be a student at the institution to which application is made. </P>

<P>If an applicant is denied admission on any of the foregoing grounds, there must be substantial evidence supporting the basis for denial.  In addition, the applicant must be afforded adequate procedural safeguards, including the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.</Lbl>

<LBody> Be advised of the ground of the denial. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.</Lbl>

<LBody> Be informed of the facts which form a basis of the  denial. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.</Lbl>

<LBody> Be afforded an opportunity to be heard. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Institutions should establish a hearing committee or some other appropriate mechanism to guarantee the proper administration of the procedural safeguards outlined above. </P>

<H5>3.11.4   Transfer of Course Work Within the State   System from Degree-granting Institutions </H5>

<P>The following guidelines for transfer of students among institutions have been adopted for the State System. </P>

<P>A. A student who has completed the prescribed lower-division requirements of a State System institution developed in accordance with the standards set forth in the State Regents’ Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy may transfer into a baccalaureate degree program at any senior institution of the State System and be assured of completing his or her program in sequential fashion. Senior institutions may, with the approval of the State Regents, require that transferring students complete additional general education work for the degree. However, such additional work shall be programmed as a part of the upper division requirements of the senior institution in order that any student shall be able to complete a baccalaureate program in a number of semester hours equal to the total speciﬁed for graduation published in the receiving institution’s ofﬁ cial catalog. </P>

<P>B.  It is understood, however, that it might be necessary for certain students to take additional courses in general education to meet minimum professional certiﬁ cation requirements as deﬁned by the state. It is also understood that the completion of these requirements does not preclude requirements of senior institutions of particular GPAs for admission to professional departments or ﬁ elds. </P>

<P>C.   It is further understood that it is the responsibility of the transferring institution to provide adequate counseling to enable  a student to complete during the freshman and sophomore years those lower-division courses which are published prerequisites to pursuit of junior level courses of his or her chosen major disciplinary ﬁ eld. </P>

<P>D. The baccalaureate degree in all Oklahoma senior-level institutions shall be awarded in recognition of lower-division (freshman and sophomore) combined with upper-division (junior and senior) work. If a student has completed an AA or AS degree, the lower-division general education requirement of the baccalaureate degree shall be the responsibility of the institution awarding the associate degree, providing the general education requirements speciﬁed herein are met. If, for any reason, a student has not completed an associate degree program prior to his or her transfer to another institution, the general education requirements shall become the responsibility of the receiving institutions. However, the receiving institution will recognize general education credit for all transfer courses in which a reasonable equivalency of discipline or course content exists with courses speciﬁ ed as part of general education at the receiving institution, provided that there is an appropriate correspondence between the associate degree and the baccalaureate degree being sought. </P>

<P>E.   If a student has completed general education courses at a baccalaureate degree-recommending institution within the State System, the receiving baccalaureate institution will recognize general education credit for all courses in which a reasonable equivalency or discipline or course content exists with courses speciﬁed as part of general education at the receiving institution, provided that there is an appropriate correspondence of disciplinary study. </P>

<P>F.  Lower-division programs in all state institutions enrolling freshmen and sophomores may offer introductory courses which permit the student to explore the principal professional specializations that can be pursued at the baccalaureate level. These introductory courses shall be adequate in content to be fully counted toward the baccalaureate degree for students continuing in such a professional ﬁeld of specialization. The determination of the major course requirements for a baccalaureate degree, including courses in the major taken in the lower division, shall be the responsibility of the institution awarding the degree. However, courses classiﬁed as upper- division courses generally taken by sophomores at senior institutions, even though taught at a community college as lower-division courses, should be transferable as satisfying that part of the student’s requirement in the content area. </P>

<P>G.   Courses offered at the freshman or sophomore (1000 or 2000) level at baccalaureate degree-recommending institutions may be offered at a community college provided that such courses are included in the community college’s approved instructional program. </P>

<P>H.   Other associate degrees and certiﬁcates may be awarded by institutions for programs which have requirements different from the aforementioned degrees, or a primary objective other than transfer. Acceptance of course credits for transfer from such degree or certiﬁcate programs will be evaluated by the receiving institution on the basis of applicability of the courses to the baccalaureate program in the major ﬁeld of the student. Each receiving institution is encouraged to develop admission policies that will consider all factors indicating the possibility of success of these students in its upper division. </P>

<P>I.   Each baccalaureate degree-recommending institution shall list and update the requirements for each program leading to the baccalaureate degree and shall publicize these requirements for use by all other institutions in the State System. Each baccalaureate degree-recommending institution shall include in its ofﬁcial publications (whether print or electronic) information stating all lower-division prerequisite requirements for each upper-division course. All requirements for admission to a university, college, or program should be set forth with precision and clarity. The degree requirements in effect at the time of the student’s initial full-time enrollment in any State System college or university shall govern lower-division prerequisites, provided that the student has had continuous enrollment in the State System as deﬁned in the ofﬁcial college or university publications. </P>

<P>J.   Institutions are encouraged to publish, distribute, and keep current transfer guides. The transfer guides should include institutional procedures for the evaluation of course equivalency and a description of the appeals process. A systemwide course transfer matrix is maintained online and updated annually by the State Regents. </P>

<P>K.   Credit for prior learning, once recorded at a State System institution, is transferable on the same basis as if the credit had been earned through regular study at the awarding institution. See the State Regents’ Credit for Prior Learning policy. </P>

<P>L.   State System institutions may determine course equivalencies through various methods, including articulation agreements, institutional evaluation of individual courses, as well as through the Course Equivalency Project. Courses listed under the same Common Course category on the Course Equivalency Project Matrix shall be accepted by all institutions listed in that category as equivalent for the academic year during which those institutions’ courses are listed. By participating in the same process as State System institutions, independent degree-granting institutions based in Oklahoma may list courses on the Course Equivalency Project Matrix. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>3.18.3   Principles </H5>

<P>As part of the admissions process, institutions are responsible for determining students’ in-state/out-of-state status consistent with this policy. Administrators interview students, review documentation and are in the best position to determine whether the student may be classiﬁed as in-state. Each institution must designate an appropriate administrative ofﬁcial (most often the Admissions Ofﬁcer) as responsible for administration of this policy. Clariﬁcation and additional information including documentation examples and frequently asked questions are in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook. </P>

<P>The burden of proof to establish in-state status shall be upon the student. Since residence or domicile is a matter of intent, each case will be judged on its own merit by the appropriate administrative ofﬁcial(s) consistent with this policy. Mere assertion by a student such as checking “In-State” on the application for admission is insufﬁ cient. The appropriate administrative ofﬁcial must review relevant documents, consider the policy principles and procedures, circumstances, and documentation to determine in-state status. While no set criteria, documentation, or set of circumstances can be used for this purpose, the principles outlined below guide the process. </P>

<P>A. Attendance at a postsecondary educational institution, albeit a continuous and long-term experience, does not establish in-state status. Therefore, a student neither gains nor loses instate status solely by such attendance. </P>

<P>B.   Students attending an Oklahoma college or university may perform many objective acts, some of which are required by law (i.e. payment of taxes), and all of which are customarily done by some out-of-state students who do not intend to remain in Oklahoma after graduation, but are situational and necessary and/or voluntary (i.e. registering to vote, obtaining a driver’s license). Such acts and/or declarations alone are insufﬁcient evidence of intent to remain in Oklahoma beyond the college experience. </P>

<P>C. An out-of-state student attending an Oklahoma college or university on more than a half-time basis is presumed to be in the state primarily for educational purposes. </P>

<P>D. An individual is not deemed to have acquired in-state status until he or she has been in the state for at least a year primarily as a permanent resident and not primarily as a student and has established domicile. Likewise, an individual classiﬁed as in-state shall not be reclassiﬁed as out-of-state until 12 months after leaving Oklahoma to live in another state. </P>

<P>E.   Unless residency has been established in another state, an individual who resided in Oklahoma at the time of graduation from an Oklahoma high school and has resided in the state with a parent or legal guardian for two years prior to graduation from high school will be eligible for in-state status and as allowed in 3.18.7 and 3.18.8. </P>

<P>F.  Each spouse in a family shall establish his or her own status on a separate basis. Exceptions include the following: when an out-of-state status individual marries a person with in-state status, the out-of-state individual may be considered in-state after documentation of the marriage and proof of domicile are satisﬁed without the 12 month domiciliary waiting period, and as provided in sections 3.18.7 or 3.18.8. </P>

<P>G.   Initial classiﬁcation as out-of-state shall not prejudice the right of a person to be reclassiﬁed thereafter for following semesters or terms of enrollment as in-state provided that he or she establish domicile as deﬁned in this policy. Institutions must establish procedures for students to appeal out-of-state status classiﬁ cation. </P>

<P>H.   Institutions may, but are not required, to waive out-of-state tuition (also known as Nonresident Tuition Waiver) in accordance with current State Regents’ Tuition and Fees policy 4.18.5.B that allows any institution in the State System to waive a portion of the out-of-state tuition which amount shall not exceed the difference between out-of-state tuition and the amount paid by in-state students. </P>

<P>I.     When a student transfers from one institution to another, the institution to which the student transfers is not bound by the in-state/out-of-state classiﬁcation previously determined and may request documentation to determine the student’s instate/out-of-state status. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.18.4 Dependent and Independent Persons </H5>

<P>A. The legal residence of a dependent person is the postsecondary student’s parents or the residence of the parent who has legal custody or the parent with whom the student habitually resides.  If the student is under the care of those other than the parents, the legal residence is that of the student’s legal guardian. </P>

<P>B. In-state/out-of-state classiﬁcations of postsecondary students with extenuating circumstances (e.g., divorced parents with joint custody when one parent or legal guardian lives outof-state and/or claimed as a dependent on a tax return, etc.) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Guidance for administrative ofﬁcers charged with classifying students will be provided in the procedures manual. </P>

<P>C. A dependent person may establish independent person status through circumstances including, marriage, formal court action, abandonment by parents, etc. To qualify, a dependent person must have completely separated from the parental or guardian domicile and prove that such separation is complete and permanent. Additionally, the individual must provide evidence that they are responsible for their housing and living expenses. Mere absence from the parental or guardian domicile is not proof of its complete abandonment. If an applicant can provide adequate and satisfactory evidence of independent status and domicile, they may be granted in-state status. </P>

<P>D. If an independent person can provide evidence of coming to Oklahoma to establish domicile, the applicant may be granted in-state status at the next enrollment occurring after expiration of 12 months following establishment of domicile in Oklahoma. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.18.5 Documented Foreign Nationals </H5>

<P>Documented foreign nationals may attend as postsecondary students if they have appropriate educational visas. These individuals are eligible for in-state classiﬁcation if they become lawful permanent residents, have resided in Oklahoma for at least 12 consecutive months, and meet domicile requirements as set forth in this policy. </P>

<P>Documented foreign nationals who are present in the U.S. with visas that allow full-time employment for extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, athletics, as an executive, manager, or specialist of a treaty nation company operating in the U.S. are eligible for out-of-state tuition waivers as long as they remain in full-time working status. Dependents of these documented foreign nationals who are lawfully present in Oklahoma based on the documented foreign national’s visa are also eligible for out-of-state tuition waivers. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.18.6 Undocumented Students </H5>

<P>Pursuant to Title 70, O.S., Section 3242 (2007) (also known as HB1804 of the First Regular Session of the 51st Legislature), an individual who cannot present to the institution valid documentation of United States nationality or an immigration status permitting study at a postsecondary institution but who: </P>

<P>A. Graduated from a public or private Oklahoma high school; </P>

<P>B. Resided in this state with a parent or legal guardian while attending classes at an Oklahoma public or private high school in this state for at least two (2) years prior to graduation; and </P>

<P>C. Satisﬁes admission standards for the institution. </P>

<P>Individuals who meet the above requirements are eligible for enrollment and/or out-of-state tuition waivers if that individual: </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>4. Any student who completes and provides the institution with a copy of a true and correct application or petition ﬁled with USCIS to legalize the student’s immigration status shall not be disqualiﬁed on the basis of the student’s immigration status from any scholarships or ﬁ nancial aid provided by this state as long as the student meets the following: </P>

<H4>STUDENT ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION POLICY (OSRHE Policy 3.20, 10/15) </H4>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>3.20.3   Principles </H5>

<P>A.  Improvement of Teaching and Learning </P>

<P>For the purpose of improving teaching and learning, each college and university shall assess students using criteria approved by the State Regents and including at least the following four categories: (1) entry level to determine academic preparation and course placement; (2) general education assessment; (3) academic program learning outcomes assessment; and (4) student engagement and satisfaction.  Assessment applies to all students including those admitted through adult admission (refer to Adult Admission in the Institutional Admission and Retention </P>

<P>policy).  Assessment will be consistent with the HLC Criteria for Accreditation and Core Components and consistent with </P>

<P>3.7 Academic Program Review.  </P>

<P>B. Accountability and Institutional Effectiveness </P>

<P>Assessment for accountability and institutional effectiveness should, whenever possible, be compared to external benchmarks. Data in each category of assessment will be reported to the State Regents annually and will include detailed information designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the assessments consistent with the mission and programs of the institution.  Reports may include the annual student assessment report and national assessment reports for comparing institutions and State Systems.  </P>

<P>As institutions develop criteria and select assessment measures that demonstrate institutional effectiveness, each assessment should be coordinated and complement the improvement of teaching and learning.  Institutions should evaluate the validity and reliability of the assessments.   </P>

<P>In recognition of varying institutional missions and student populations served, assessment for accountability and institutional effectiveness should include the institutional characteristics that produce the most meaningful comparisons and useful information for improvement. Assessment programs should also consider the needs of special populations in the  development of policies and procedures. </P>

<P>C.   Developmental Education </P>

<P>Certain disciplines, most notably English, mathematics, and science, build on requisite knowledge. College courses in such disciplines assume a student knowledge base gained in high school or other previous academic experiences. It is therefore imperative that students not enroll in college-level courses in the ﬁelds when lacking that knowledge.   </P>

<P>Students should not enroll in college-level courses, such as  history or other elective courses, without a necessary foundation in reading and writing.   </P>

<P>Students, who can demonstrate competency in an academic ﬁeld, even though they did not take the required course(s) in high school, will have the curricular deﬁciency waived. Such students will be allowed to enroll in the respective discipline’s college-level courses. </P>

<P>Within the State System, the community college tier is ofﬁcially designated as responsible for developmental education.  Although institutions in other tiers, with the exception of regional universities with assigned community college functions, do not have this developmental education responsibility, such institutions may also offer developmental education.  </P>

<P>Developmental education at all state system institutions shall be fully supported through student fees. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.20.4  Entry Level Assessment and Course Placement </H5>

<P>A.  High School Curricular Requirements </P>

<P>The State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy lists high school curricular requirements for admission to programs leading to associate in arts, associate in science, associate in applied science, and baccalaureate degrees.  The policy requires institutions admitting students with one or more curricular deﬁciencies to provide the means to satisfy those deﬁciencies and to remediate these deﬁ ciencies within the ﬁrst 24 college-level credit hours attempted.  </P>

<P>Students with curricular deﬁciencies in English, mathematics, reading, and science who fail to demonstrate adequate curricular competence through a minimum ACT subject score or institutional secondary assessment will be required to participate in developmental education designed to remedy the deﬁ ciency. </P>

<P>Students must achieve a competency equivalent to a “C” or better to remove the deﬁciency.   </P>

<P>Students with a curricular deﬁciency in history or citizenship skills, who present an ACT reading subject score at or above the speciﬁed level or who score at the designated level on any approved secondary institutional reading assessment instrument, may be admitted as regular admission students. These students will be required to complete an additional three-hour college-level history or citizenship skills course to make up the high school deﬁ ciency. </P>

<P>Students with an elective deﬁciency may also be admitted as regular admission students as speciﬁed in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy, but will be required to take an additional three-hour collegiate course in an elective subject area(s).  </P>

<P>These course placement requirements will be communicated regularly to high school students, parents, school teachers, counselors,and administrators for the purpose of informing them of the proﬁciency levels in the basic academic skills areas needed to be adequately prepared for college-level work. </P>

<P>B.  Basic Academic Skills Requirements </P>

<P>Student competency may be demonstrated and deﬁ ciencies removed in basic academic skills English, mathematics, reading and science—through the use of State System ACT scores in the four subject areas of science, English, and mathematics and reading, or high school assessments predictive of college course success. Institutions may, within their approved assessment plans, establish higher standards by requiring additional testing of those students meeting or exceeding the minimum ACT subject test score requirement. The system ACT subject scores are reviewed by the State Regents and communicated annually. Each institution will use measures for course placement as approved by the State Regents.   </P>

<P>Students scoring below the ACT subject score minimum level will be reviewed with additional information, as approved by the State Regents, to determine the level of readiness for college-level course work or successfully complete developmental education in the subject area. Students must begin remediation of basic academic skills deﬁ ciencies during the ﬁrst semester and continue until prepared for college-level course work in the respective subject area.  Institutions are responsible for directing students to complete developmental education within the ﬁrst year or 24 college-level credit hours.  The president or the president’s designee may allow exceptions on an individual basis for students with extenuating circumstances.  All exceptions will be reported to the State Regents.     </P>

<P>C.  Concurrently Enrolled High School Students </P>

<P>High school students wishing to enroll concurrently in college courses must meet the designated score in English, mathematics, and science or they will not be permitted enrollment in the corresponding college subject area. A student scoring below the established ACT score in reading will not be permitted enrollment in any collegiate course (outside the subjects of science, mathematics, and English). Concurrent enrollment students are not eligible for secondary institutional assessments and may not enroll in developmental education.  </P>

<P>D.  Adult Students </P>

<P>Institutions must assess adult students’ academic competence through the evaluation of basic academic skills or curricular requirements appropriate.  This must be done through participation in the ACT or the review of additional information.  If indicated by the course placement information, adult students must be remediated consistent with this policy.  Institutions are responsible for directing students to complete developmental education within the ﬁ rst year or 24 college-level credit hours. </P>

<P>E. Course Placement and Developmental Education Evaluation </P>

<P>Institutional entry level assessment programs should include anevaluation of past academic performance, educational goals, study skills, values, self-concept and motivation. Student assessment results will be utilized in the placement and advisement process. Tracking systems for evaluation of institutional assessment programs must be in place. The purpose is to validate that information from assessment and course completion is used to evaluate, innovate and strengthen programs in order to accelerate student achievement and development. The data collection activities must be clearly linked to instructional improvement efforts.  These data will be included in the annual assessment report. </P>

<P>F. Limits </P>

<P>The president or the president’s designee may allow a student who has been regularly enrolled to continue to enroll in college-level course work in addition to developmental coursework beyond the 24 college-level credit hour limit, provided the student has demonstrated success in the college-level coursework. Such exceptions must be appropriately documented and a report made available upon request. </P>

<H4>LOANS </H4>

<P>Several types of loans are available to help students pay for school.  Loans must be repaid with interest. Loans require entrance counseling prior to disbursement of funds and exit counseling prior to graduating, leaving school or dropping below half-time. Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments. The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester. Students must repay loans even if they do not complete their education, are not able to get a job after completing the program or are dissatisﬁed with the education for which they paid. The Health Care Act of 2010 (H. R. 4872) eliminated the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and requires schools to participate in the William D. Ford Direct Lending Program.  Since the federal government will be the only lender, new and former loan borrowers (prior to Summer, 2010)  will need to complete a Direct Loan Master Promissory Note and Direct Loan Entrance Counseling to continue receiving student loans.  Students may also want to consider loan consolidation to avoid multiple payments to more than one lender. Students should refer to the Direct Loan tab and the loan consolidation tab on the ﬁnancial aid webpage for more information. </P>

<H5>Lions-Alumni Student Loan Fund and Don Clawson Student Loan Fund </H5>

<P>This fund is designed to aid students with short-term, low-cost loans to meet emergency expenses.  The loan is to be repaid prior to preenrollment for the following semester. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program (subsidized and unsubsidized) </H5>

<P>The Stafford Loan is a low interest loan guaranteed and funded by the federal government.  The federal government pays the interest on the subsidized Stafford loan while the student is in school and during the grace period.  The student is responsible for the interest on the unsubsidized Stafford loan.  Repayment normally begins six months after graduating, leaving school or dropping below half-time.  The monthly repayment amount depends on the total amount borrowed, the length of the payment period and the repayment option chosen. </P>

<P>The amount of the loan is determined by the Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce, and depends on several variables such as expected family contribution as determined by the FAFSA, other types of ﬁnancial assistance which the student receives and grade level.  East Central University may not deliver the ﬁrst installment of Stafford Loan proceeds to a ﬁ rst-year undergraduate student who has not previously received a Stafford Loan until 30 days after the ﬁrst day of classes (the 31st day).  Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments.  The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester.  To qualify for a Stafford Loan, undergraduate students must be enrolled in at least 6 hours and graduate students must be enrolled in at least 4 hours. All summer loans are disbursed in two payments, one in June and the second in July. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Federal Direct PLUS Program </H5>

<P>This loan may be available to families of dependent students when other types of aid do not meet their needs.  It is a loan program similar to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program.  Repayment normally begins 60 days after the last loan disbursement for the loan period.  However, if a deferment applies, borrowers do not begin repaying any principal until the deferment ends.  The lender will run a credit check on all PLUS Loan borrowers.   The student must be enrolled in at least 6 hours for the parent to qualify for a PLUS loan. </P>

<H5>STUDENT EMPLOYMENT </H5>

<P>Many students are employed by area businesses.  Others work on campus either as regular student employees or as participants in the Federal Work Study program.  Student employment allows students to earn money to pay for educational costs while providing valuable job experience.  Money is earned hourly and paid monthly.  ECU offers a variety of community service employment opportunities funded through the federal work-study program.  The University assists students in securing this work.

<H4>VA BENEFITS </H4>

<P>The Department of Veterans Affairs administers a variety of educational beneﬁt programs. Many Veterans and active duty personnel can qualify for more than one education beneﬁts program. Go to the GI Bill website for more information. </P>

<P>Per Title 38 CFR 21.4253,21.4254, and 41.4263, VA law requires that every new student interested in utilizing VA Education beneﬁ ts provide all prior transfer courses, credits and previous experience for evaluation and review as appropriate to the enrolled course. This includes post-secondary and military transcripts. All transcripts must be provided before a student can be certiﬁed for VA beneﬁts. ECU will evaluate these records, and when possible, grant appropriate credit for the previous education and/or training, shorten the length of the training program, and notify the student regarding the amount of credit being granted for previous training. </P>

<P>Chapter 30 - Montgomery GI Bill (Active Duty): </P>

<P>The MGIB program provided up to 36 months of education beneﬁ ts. This beneﬁt may be used for degree and certiﬁ cate programs, ﬂ ight training, apprenticeship/on-the-job training and correspondence courses. Generally, beneﬁts are payable for 10 years following your release from active duty. </P>

<H4>DISBURSEMENT POLICIES </H4>

<P>Student aid eligibility is computed to the maximum amount possible in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines and the availability of funds.  In the event that this amount does not cover all costs, the student must pay the balance from some other source.  This aid may not be used for deposits, physical exams or any other fees that are due prior to enrollment.  East Central University has no obligation to make this aid available until the student is properly admitted and enrolled. </P>

<P>Awards for the fall and spring semesters are normally made at the same time.  One-half of the total aid for the school year will be made available in the fall semester and one-half in the spring.  Awards for summer school are made late in the spring semester.  A separate summer aid application is required.  The summer aid application may be obtained in the Financial Aid Ofﬁce when summer enrollment begins. </P>

<P>If the student has been awarded for the fall and spring and does not attend the fall semester, the award will be cancelled for both semesters unless the student speciﬁcally requests that aid for the spring be continued.  This will be done if funds are available on the date of request.  In addition, if the student drops below half-time, the second semester Stafford Loan must be cancelled and the student must reapply. </P>

<P>If the student withdraws during the fall term, the award will be cancelled for the spring term.  If the student wishes to return to school for the spring or summer term, the student should contact the Financial Aid Ofﬁce to have the application re-evaluated.  East Central University may not deliver the ﬁrst installment of Stafford Loan proceeds to a ﬁ rstyear undergraduate student who has not previously received a Stafford Loan until 30 days after the ﬁrst day of classes (the 31st day).  Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments.  The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester.  </P>

<P>All ﬁnancial aid funds are credited to the ECU Bursar account and refunds are disbursed through Higher One. Students are required to activate the ECU Tiger Card and may choose either an ACH transfer (direct deposit to a currently existing bank account) or open a Higher One account. Students need to carefully review their options before making a selection.  Although the ACH transfer may take slightly longer depending on the policies of their bank, certain transaction fees may apply to the Higher One account and $500 is the maximum cash withdrawal per day from any ATM. Students may contact the Controller or Bursar if they have questions pertaining to the ECU Tiger Card. </P>

<P>The initial disbursement each semester occurs approximately two weeks following the end of the 100% refund period (10 class days for fall and spring).  After the initial disbursement each semester, funds are disbursed twice a week as they are received.  First time loan recipients who are freshmen must wait until the 31st day of classes to receive their loan funds.  Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Oklahoma’s Promise, etc., are disbursed when received from their respective agencies. </P>

<H4>ORIENTATION </H4>

<Sect>
<P>Every student should have a current copy of each of the following University publications: the Catalog, the ECU Student Handbook and the Schedule.  The Student Handbook contains the East Central University Student Code of Conduct.  The Handbook is available online at www.ecok.edu/student-development/student-development-home/ ecu-student-handbook. Since the Catalog explains the operation of and gives the rules of the University, the student will refer to it often.  Usually a student follows the degree plan as stated in the catalog effective at East Central University at the beginning of his or her continuous enrollment.  A continuous enrollment shall mean assignment of an East Central University grade on the transcript of at least one semester hour, semester after semester—excluding summer—until graduation.  Additional rules to the above policies are: </P>

<Table>
<TR>
<TD>a. </TD>

<TD>If the student leaves East Central University and returns during a later term, continuous enrollment at any accredited institution will also be acceptable. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>b. </TD>

<TD>If general education requirements are completed under an East Central University Catalog at the time of the student’s enrollment, the new general education requirements need not be met. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>c. </TD>

<TD>If the student is in attendance at East Central University when changes are made in the requirements for three components, the general education program and/or the major and/or the minor program of studies, he or she may follow the requirements of either component in effect at his or her ﬁrst enrollment or he or she may choose to follow the requirements of any successive catalog provided that he or she is in continuous enrollment. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>d. </TD>

<TD>If a student is suspended by the University for academic reasons, he or she may return under the original catalog within </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD/>

<TD>a year. </TD>
</TR>
</Table>

<P>e. In cases not covered by the above rules, the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs, in consultation with the student, will determine which catalog will be in effect for that student’s graduation. </P>

<P>Any changes imposed by law or policies by governing regulatory boards or agencies become effective at the date speciﬁ ed regardless of continuous enrollment or provision stated above.  East Central University would in no case be obligated to offer courses only for a student to meet degree requirements under a previous catalog.  The Schedule, published each semester, gives vital information about the current term. </P>

<P>A student may become familiar with East Central University by reading this chapter and by referring to other parts of the Catalog, and to the Schedule.  Additional help in becoming familiar with the University is given at the Freshman Advisement and Enrollment to beginning freshmen (students with 6 or fewer attempted credit hours, excluding remedial [0-level courses] or pre-college work and excluding credit hours accumulated by concurrently enrolled high school students). This session occurs at times indicated in the Schedule.  All beginning freshmen will be required to successfully complete new student orientation immediately prior to their ﬁrst semester of enrollment and UNIV 1001 Freshman Seminar in their ﬁrst semester of enrollment.  </P>

<P>East Central University has four undergraduate schools and colleges and a School of Graduate Studies.  The undergraduate schools are as follows:  the Harland C. Stonecipher School of Business; the College of Education and Psychology; the College of Health and Sciences; and the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences.  The rules and procedures of the School of Graduate Studies are given in the section of the Catalog labeled the same.  The undergraduate schools and colleges are made up of departments (for example, the Art Department and the Biology Department), which offer courses in their own academic ﬁ elds. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>A course meets a speciﬁc number of clock hours each week throughout a semester (Fall or Spring semester) or summer session.  A regular semester meets for sixteen weeks.  A summer session meets for eight weeks.  Occasionally courses are offered as intersession or accelerated courses.  Dates and times of those courses which meet less than a full term are noted in the Schedule.  When a student makes a passing grade in a course, he or she earns the appropriate semester hour(s) of credit.  During a regular semester, a lecture course will meet 50 minutes per week for each hour of credit being granted.  Laboratory courses will meet a minimum of 120 minutes per week for each hour of credit.  Class periods during shorter terms and sessions will be adjusted proportionately. </P>

<P>As a student accumulates hours of credit, his or her classiﬁ cation changes.  A student is a freshman if he or she  has earned 0-29 semester hours, a sophomore if he or she has earned 30-59 hours, a junior if he or she has earned 60-89 semester hours, or a senior if he or she has earned 90 or more semester hours.  A student is a post-graduate student if he or she has earned a bachelors degree but has not earned graduate credit.  A graduate student is one who has earned at least a bachelors degree and who earns graduate credit. </P>

<P>Most semester hours earned will apply toward a bachelors degree.  Some semester hours apply toward general education requirements (courses required by the university prior to graduation which give a broad background in a variety of subject areas) while others are in the student’s major (a ﬁeld of intense specialization) or minor (a ﬁ eld of less intense specialization) areas.  Additional courses taken to complete degree requirements are called elective courses.  Some majors require minors and some do not.  Students should refer to major requirements for speciﬁc graduation requirements. </P>

<P>Lower-division courses are generally taken during a student’s freshman and sophomore years and are listed as 1000-2000 level.  Some freshmen may also be required to take pre-collegiate level (0-level) courses during their ﬁrst year of attendance.  Upper-division courses are generally taken during a student’s junior, senior, or postgraduate years and consist of 3000-4000 level courses.  During the freshman and sophomore years, the student usually takes general education courses and decides on a major and minor.  During the junior and senior years, the student usually takes a greater number of classes in the major and minor areas.  Graduate students will enroll in graduate courses numbered as 5000 level.  With the approval of the instructor, a senior having earned more than 99 semester hours credit may enroll in a 5000 level course.  These courses, if taken for graduate credit, may not apply on a bachelors degree.  Seniors, however, may not enroll in an individual study course on the graduate level.  5000 level courses must be taken for graduate credit if the student holds a bachelors degree. </P>

<P>A student plans his or her course load each semester with the help of an advisor.  An advisor is an instructor in the student’s major area who assists in planning the student’s schedule each semester.  Should a student be pursuing two majors, he or she should have an advisor in each area.  The student is responsible for keeping both advisors informed on degree plans from each major. </P>

<P> Each student is fully responsible for meeting the requirements of the university.  He or she must plan his or her own course load to suit his or her own program and goals.  The student should consult the assigned advisor at appropriate times for help with and approval of his or her plans.  To aid in the planning process, at the end of each semester the Records Ofﬁce makes available the grades and hours a student has earned.  When he or she becomes a junior, the Records Ofﬁ ce will prepare an ofﬁ cial degree requirement check sheet at the student’s request. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>COURSE IDENTIFICATION </H4>

<Sect>
<P>Department course offerings are listed in their respective school sections of the Catalog.  The courses offered in a particular semester or term are listed in the Schedule.  Many departments regularly post a list of courses to be taught within a few terms in the future. </P>

<P>A course preﬁx indicates the department offering the course.  The ﬁrst digit of a four-digit course number indicates the class level (0 is pre-collegiate; 1 is freshman; 2 is sophomore; 3 is junior; 4 is senior; 5 is graduate).  The last digit of a four-digit number indicates the credit.  ENG 2243, for example, is a sophomore course offered by the English Department for 3 hours of credit.  CJSOC 4313 is a senior course offered by both the Department of Criminal Justice and the Department of Sociology for 3 hours of credit. </P>

<P>The digits 499 (undergraduate) and 599 (graduate) at the beginning of a course number indicate a course of individual study (directed individual study on a special subject or problem). </P>

<P> A prerequisite course is one in which a student must earn credit before enrolling in another particular course.  A corequisite course is one in which a student must enroll concurrently while enrolled in another course.  The course description (a brief description following the number and title) indicates any prerequisite or corequisite for a course.  With the permission of the instructor, a prerequisite or corequisite may be waived. </P>

<H4>REGISTRATION, COURSE LOAD, AND OVERLOAD </H4>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>REGISTRATION </H5>

<P>Information concerning registration is published in the Schedule.  Although advisors assist students and grant enrollment clearance, each student is responsible for the correctness of his or her own course load and for seeing that it suits his or her own program.  Before registering, a student should be familiar with all degree requirements. </P>

<P>A student may register late but no later than the ﬁrst week of a semester, the ﬁrst week of a summer session, or the ﬁfth class day of a half-semester course.  Deadlines for registering in a class with an atypical schedule are determined proportional to those for a full term.  Registration policies for intersession courses are unique.  Speciﬁ c details may be found in the Schedule. </P>

<P>A student may not be registered at both East Central University and another institution at the same time without prior approval from each institution.  Overload regulations apply to students enrolling on more than one campus. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>COURSE LOAD AND OVERLOAD APPROVAL </H5>

<P>An undergraduate student should register each semester or term in a course load which meets his or her needs.  Minimum loads are required for veteran’s beneﬁts, student loans, sports eligibility, and so forth.  Although an undergraduate student is usually considered a full-time student if he or she takes a load of a minimum of 12 semester hours in a semester or 6 semester hours in a summer session, the normal load is 15 or 16 semester hours in a semester or 8 or 9 semester hours in a summer session.  This load, regularly taken, will enable a student to fulﬁll the graduation requirement of 124 semester hours in 8 semesters or the equivalent.  A student may register for as many as 20 semester hours in a semester or 10 semester hours in a summer session without special permission.  To register for an overload of as many as 24 hours in a semester or 15 in a summer, the student must have the approval of the Dean of his or her major.  Oklahoma Regents allow no more than 24 semester hours credit granted for a fall or spring semester, or 15 hours for a summer term without special approval from the university president or his or her designee.  It should be noted that status for Financial Aid may be different from status for enrollment.  </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>CHANGING A COURSE LOAD OR FORMALLY WITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY </H5>

<P>Changing a course load or withdrawing from the university results from the student’s formally processing the transaction.  See the ECU Schedule for speciﬁc procedures and deadlines.  </P>

<P>A student may add a full semester course to his or her course load within the ﬁrst week of classes in a semester, the ﬁrst week of classes in a summer session, the ﬁ rst ﬁve class days of a half-semester course, or the ﬁrst three days of a half summer session course.  Deadlines for adding a class with an atypical schedule are determined proportional to those for a full term. </P>

<P>A student who formally withdraws from a course through the twenty-eighth day (ﬁve weeks plus 3 days) of a summer session or the eleventh week of a semester receives the guaranteed grade of “W” for the course.  One who withdraws after the guaranteed “W” deadline through the seventh week of a summer session or the fourteenth week of a semester may receive “W” for the course if passing, “F” if failing.  The assignment of an “F” is optional to the instructor.  Time limits for withdrawing from a class meeting less than a full term are proportional to those for a full term. </P>

<P>An instructor may withdraw a student from a course he or she teaches if the student’s attendance or performance becomes unsatisfactory.  A student who stops attending one or all of his or her classes without formally withdrawing will receive an “F” in each unﬁnished course.  If a student’s attendance or performance becomes unsatisfactory, he or she may be required to withdraw from the University. </P>

A student is not eligible to receive advanced standing credit in any course unless he or she is eligible to enroll in the course at East Central University; no student may take the advanced standing examination in any course in which he or she already has credit.  No student will be permitted to repeat an advanced standing examination. </P>

<P>II. Compliance With Policy </P>

<P>This policy is in compliance with the Standards of Education relating to advanced standing credit established by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. </P>

<P>5. Taking an Educational Tour Course </P>

<P>On occasion, the University provides educational tours as special features of the academic program.  These tours, at times, are entirely within the continental United States, and, in some instances, they involve travel and study in foreign countries.  They are planned and conducted in a manner to make them soundly educational and wholesomely recreational.  Generally they are directed by instructional departments of the University, and they provide for earning credit appropriate to the time spent and the educational opportunities afforded. Costs to the students are kept at a minimum. </P>

<P>6. Taking a Course via Electronic Media </P>

<P>A student may earn credit for courses delivered electronically at East Central University or at one of the approved off-campus locations.  East Central University, having both receiving classrooms and transmitting studios, is a participating member of OneNet, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education statewide instructional and communications network.  This two way video and audio instructional method allows institutions to share the best available faculty and courses via Instructional Television. </P>

<P>A student may also earn credit for courses delivered in a web-based environment over the internet. </P>

<P>All Oklahoma State Regents’ and institutional policies, standards, and guidelines for on-campus instruction apply to electronic instruction with the exception of course meeting time as deﬁned in the State Regents’ Academic Calendar Policy. </P>

<P>7. Auditing a Course </P>

<P>An applicant must qualify for admission to enroll in an audited course.  A student earns no credit for auditing a course.  An audit student may attend class only as an observer; he or she may not take any examinations.  A student may audit a course if he or she does not plan to take it later for credit.  Changing class status either to or from audit status must be done prior to the last day to enroll in the course.  Fees for a class being audited are the same as if the class were being taken for credit. </P>

<P>8. Duplicating a Course </P>

<P>A student earns no credit for taking a course substantially equivalent to a course for which he or she has already received credit, regardless of whether he or she intended to duplicate work. </P>

<P>K. Advanced standing credit will not be considered as part of the regular study load for the semester or term in </P>

<P>9.  Taking Courses in Military Science  </P>

<P>A student may apply a maximum of 24 semester hours of military science courses toward a degree. </P>

<P>10.  Earning Credit for Military Service </P>

<P>Veterans or current service members may be granted credit for basic training, for formal service school courses, and for approved college-level examinations passed while in military service.  Generally, the credit is granted in accordance with the recommendations of the American Council on Education (ACE).  However, evaluation practices at East Central University supersede ACE recommendations. </P>

<P>11.  Earning Credit for Prior Learning </P>

<P>Students may earn credit for knowledge gained through prior learning experiences.  Credit is granted based on the evaluation of a portfolio prepared by the student.  Prior approval  for portfolio preparation must be obtained. </P>

<P>12.  Transferring Credit for the General Education         Requirement (Articulation Policy) </P>

<P>East Central University participates with certain other Oklahoma institutions in a reciprocal transfer agreement (the Regents’Articulation Policy).  By virtue of this agreement a student who has completed his or her general education requirement and received an Associate degree in Arts or Science at one of the participating Oklahoma two-year colleges may fulﬁll East Central University’s general education requirement by transferring his or her credit to East Central University.  Transferring credit for general education does not eliminate or otherwise affect any of the following East Central University requirements:  (1) prerequisites; (2) speciﬁc requirements in majors, minors or related work in these areas; (3) the requirements for teacher certiﬁcation.  Not included in this transfer arrangement are vocational and technical two-year college programs and other programs not primarily designated for students intending to transfer to bachelor’s degree programs. </P>

<P>13.  Transferring Credit from Accredited Institutions </P>

<P>A student may transfer from approved institutions up to 94 semester hours of approved credit toward a degree or a program.  No more than 64 hours of the transferred credit may be earned at two-year colleges.  No more than 32 hours of the transferred college credit may be earned at one-year colleges.  A student may transfer credit from a two-year college after he or she has earned 64 hours or from a one-year college after he or she has earned 32 hours only if the credit is in courses that are equivalent to lower-division courses at East Central University.  </P>

<P>14.  Transferring Credit from Unaccredited Institutions </P>

<P>After completing at least twelve hours at East Central University with a grade average of “C” or higher, a student may ask to have credits transferred from unaccredited institutions.  If his or her request is approved, he or she may transfer credit generally on the basis of credit acceptance policies described in “Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions,” a publication of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Ofﬁcers.  Credit is evaluated on a course-by-course basis and is usually granted only toward speciﬁ c requirements in the general education, major and/or minor areas. </P>

<P>15.  Oklahoma Statewide Transfer Matrix </P>

<P>Students transferring to East Central University may obtain information concerning course equivalencies of courses being transferred to ECU.  A course transfer matrix approved by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and a transfer matrix established speciﬁ cally for East Central University may be found by going to the website  www.ecok.edu then clicking on Admissions/Transfer Student, then ECU Transfer Matrix. </P>

<P>16.  Failing a Course </P>

<P>A student earns no credit for a course in which he or she makes “F” or “WF.”  See the State Regents’ Grading Policy regarding grade point average calculation. </P>

<P>17.  No Degree Credit (Not Applicable on Degree) </P>

<P>Because of high school or previous course work completed, a course may be recorded “not applicable on degree” credit.  Such courses will be counted as part of the course load in a term or semester, and in the cumulative and retention grade point averages.  The course will not be counted on degree requirements. </P>

<P>I An incomplete grade may be used at the instructor’s discretion to indicate that additional work is necessary to complete a course.  It is not a substitute for an “F”, and no student may be failing a course at the time an “I” grade is awarded.  To receive an “I” grade, the student should have satisfactorily completed a substantial portion of the required course work for the semester.  “I” grades must be changed by the instructor within one year from the end of the semester in which the “I” was assigned or they will remain as a permanent “I” and not contribute to the student’s GPA.  Prior to fall 1993, an “I” grade became an “F” if the work was not completed in the required time frame. </P>

<P>For students who are members of the active uniformed </P>

<P>military service, refer to Leave of Absence (3.12.3.B).  </P>

<P>AU Audit status is used for the student not interested in obtaining a course grade, but who is enrolled to get course content knowlegdge.  The allowable time to change an enrollment status from audit to credit will be established by each institution but may not exceed the institution’s add period and must be consistent with the State Regents’ add period, which is deﬁned as the ﬁrst two weeks of a regular semester/term and the ﬁrst week of a summer semester/ term.  Students who change their enrollment status from audit to credit must meet institutional admission/retention standards as set by the State Regents.  The allowable time to change an enrollment status from credit to audit will be established by each institution, but will not exceed the institution’s last date for withdrawal from classes.  An AU is GPA neutral. </P>

<P>W An automatic withdrawal grade of “W” is issued when a student initiates a withdrawal during the institution’s allowable withdrawal period.  An institution’s withdrawal period for an automatic “W” shall begin after the tenth day of classes in the regular session and the ﬁfth day of classes in the summer term and shall not exceed 12 weeks of a 16-week semester or, in general, not exceed three-fourths of the duration of any term.  (These are maximum limits.  The State Regents encourage institutions to establish shorter limits.)  For any drop or withdrawal accepted after this deadline, a “W” or “F” will be assigned depending upon the student’s standing in the class and the institution’s stated withdrawal policy.  If an “F” grade is assigned, it is calculated in the student’s GPA; the “W” grade is GPA neutral. </P>

<P>WF  Withdrawal Failing.  This grade may be given if a student is failing when he or she formally withdraws from a course within the prescribed time. (Discontinued beginning Fall 1993.) </P>

<P>AW Administrative Withdrawal may be assigned by the Ofﬁ ce of Academic Affairs or Student Affairs to indicate that a student has been “involuntarily” withdrawn from class(es) after the institution’s drop-and-add period for disciplinary or ﬁnancial reasons or inadequate attendance.  Such withdrawals must follow formal institutional procedures.  Administrative withdrawals are GPA neutral. </P>

<P>S-U/ </P>

<P>P-NP An institution may use the grades “S” or “U” and “P” or “NP” for speciﬁed courses or may allow students to elect an “S/U” or “P/NP” option under circumstances speciﬁ ed by the institution.  The “S” and “P” are grades neutral indicating minimum course requirements have been met and credit has been earned.  The “S” and “P” grades may also be used to indicate credit earned through advanced standing examinations.  The grades of “U” and “NP” indicate that a student did not meet minimum requirements in a course designated for “S/U” or “P/NP” grading.  While all four grades, “S, U, P, N/P” are GPA neutral, they are counted in the total number of attempted hours for retention and the total number of attempted and earned hours for graduation. </P>

<P>P-F An institution may use Pass-Fail as an option for students in speciﬁed courses.  The Pass grade indicates hours earned but does not contribute to the GPA.  The Fail grade is an “F” and is calculated into the GPA. </P>

<P>N An “N” grade may be used by an institution to indicate that the semester grade was not submitted by the instructor by the appropriate deadline.  The “N” grade must be replaced by the appropriate letter grade prior to the end of the subsequent semester.  The “N” grade is GPA neutral. </P>

<P>B.  Leave of Absence </P>

<P>Pursuant to Title 70, O.S., Section 3248, State System institutions shall grant a leave of absence, which shall not exceed a cumulative ﬁve (5) years, to a student who is a member of the active uniformed military services of the United States and called to active duty. The student shall be eligible to: </P>

<P>1. Withdraw from any or all courses for the period of active duty service without penalty to admission status or GPA and without loss of institutional ﬁnancial aid. (for refund of tuition and fees refer to Budget and Fiscal policy 4.18.4.I);  </P>

<P>or </P>

<P>2. Receive an “I” for any or all courses for the period of active duty status irrespective of the student’s grade at the time the “I” is awarded; provided, however, that the student has completed a minimum of ﬁfty percent (50%) of all coursework prior to being called to active duty and the student completes all courses upon return from active duty. The student’s admission status and GPA shall not be penalized and the student shall not experience loss of institutional ﬁ nancial aid. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.12.4   Grade Point Averages </H5>

<P>The GPA is used to determine a student’s eligibility to remain enrolled or graduate from an institution.  Activity courses and forgiven course work are not calculated in GPA.  This GPA may be used to determine ﬁnancial aid eligibility, admission to graduate or professional programs, or for graduation honors. </P>

<P>The cumulative GPA includes grades for all course work, including activity courses and forgiven course work.  The use of the cumulative GPA on transcript is optional, but it may be used to determine ﬁnancial aid eligibility, admission to graduate or professional programs, or for graduation honors. </P>

<P>Remedial/developmental courses, audited courses, and courses in which the grades of I, W, AW, S, U, P, NP, N and X are given are not calculated in the retention/graduation or cumulative GPAs.  Institutions may calculate and include on student transcripts additional GPAs such as semester, transfer, institutional, combined, etc. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.12.5 Remedial/Developmental Courses </H5>

<P>Remedial/developmental courses shall be coded as zero-level and collegiate-level credit may not be awarded for the completion of these courses.  Remedial/developmental courses may be graded “S-U” or “P-NP” or letter graded at the discretion of the institution.  Regardless of the grades awarded, remedial/developmental courses are not calculated in the retention/graduation or cumulative GPAs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>3.12.6 Academic Forgiveness Provisions </H5>

<P>Circumstances may justify a student being able to recover from academic problems in ways which do not forever jeopardize the students academic standing.  </P>

<P>Academic forgiveness may be warranted for currently enrolled undergraduate students in three speciﬁ c circumstances: </P>

<P>A.  For pedagogical reasons, a student will be allowed to repeat a course and count only the second grade earned in the calculation of the GPA under the prescribed circumstances listed below. </P>

<P>B. There may be extraordinary situations in which a student has done poorly in up to two semesters due to extenuating circumstances which, in the judgment of the appropriate institutional ofﬁcials, warrants excluding grades from those semesters in calculating the student’s GPA. </P>

<P>C. A student may be returning to college after an extended absence and/or under circumstances that warrant a fresh academic start. </P>

<P>Students may seek academic forgiveness utilizing the following institutional procedures.  A student may receive no more than one academic reprieve or renewal in the academic career, and only one option (reprieve or renewal) can be used.  The repeated courses provision may be utilized independent of reprieve or renewal within the limits prescribed below.  All institutions will conform to the repeated courses forgiveness provision.  Institutions may offer students academic reprieve or academic renewal as detailed below.  Institutions that grant academic reprieve and/or academic renewal must submit an annual report to the State Regents. </P>

<P>D.  Repeated Courses </P>

<P>All State System institutions are required to offer the repeated courses provision. </P>

<P>A student shall have the prerogative to repeat courses and have only the second grade earned, even if it is lower than the ﬁrst grade, count in the calculation of the GPA, up to a maximum of four courses but not to exceed 18 hours, in the courses in which the original grade earned was a “D” or “F.”  Both attempts shall be recorded on the transcript with the earned grade for each listed in the semester earned. The Explanation of Grades section of the transcript will note that only the second grade earned is used in the calculation of the GPA.  If a student repeats an individual course more than once, all grades earned, with the exception of the ﬁ rst, are used to calculate the GPA.  Students repeating courses above the ﬁrst four courses or 18 credit hours of “Ds” or “Fs” repeated may do so with the initial grades and repeat grades averaged. </P>

<P>E.  Academic Reprieve </P>

<P>Offering academic reprieve for students is optional for all State System institutions. </P>

<P>Academic reprieve is a provision allowing a student who has experienced extraordinary circumstances to disregard up to two semesters in the calculation of his or her GPA. </P>

<P>A student may request an academic reprieve from State System institutions with academic reprieve policies consistent with these guidelines: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.  </Lbl>

<LBody>At least three years must have elapsed between the period in which the grades being requested reprieved were earned and the reprieve request; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.</Lbl>

<LBody> Prior to requesting the academic reprieve, the student must have earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher with no grade lower than a “C” in all regularly graded course work (a minimum of 12 hours) excluding activity or performance courses; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>The request may be for one semester or term of enrollment or two consecutive semesters or terms of enrollments.  If the reprieve is awarded, all grades and hours are included during the semester(s) for which a reprieve has been requested.  If the student’s request is for two consecutive semesters, the institution may choose to reprieve only one semester; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>The student must petition for consideration of academic reprieve according to institutional policy; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>All courses remain on the student’s transcript, but are not calculated in the student’s GPA.  Course work with a passing grade included in a reprieved semester may be used to demonstrate competency in the subject matter.  However, </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>the course work may not be used to fulﬁll credit hour </P>

<P>requirements. </P>

<P>F. Academic Renewal </P>

<P>Offering academic renewal for students is optional for all State System institutions. </P>

<P>Academic renewal is a provision allowing a student who has had academic trouble in the past and who has been out of higher education for a number of years to recover without penalty and have a fresh start.  Under academic renewal, course work taken prior to a date speciﬁed by the institution is not counted in the student’s GPA. </P>

<P>A student may request academic renewal from State System institutions with academic renewal policies consistent with these guidelines: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.  </Lbl>

<LBody>At least ﬁve years must have elapsed between the last semester being renewed and the renewal request; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.</Lbl>

<LBody> Prior to requesting academic renewal, the student must have earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher with no grade lower than a “C” in all regularly graded course work (a minimum of 12 hours) excluding activity or performance courses; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.</Lbl>

<LBody> The request will be for all courses completed before the date speciﬁed in the request for renewal; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4.</Lbl>

<LBody> The student must petition for consideration of academic renewal according to institutional policy; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5.  </Lbl>

<LBody>All courses remain on the student’s transcript, but are not calculated in the student’s GPA.  Neither the content nor credit hours of renewed course work may be used to fulﬁ ll any degree or graduation requirements. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<H5>3.12.7  Reporting Academic Standing </H5>

<P>A.   Retention Standards and Requirements </P>

<P>Each student’s transcript will list the student’s retention/ graduation GPA and may also include the cumulative GPA and will denote each semester when a student is placed on academic probation or is academically suspended from the institution. </P>

<P>B. Transcript Notations </P>

<P>The student’s academic transcript should be a full and accurate reﬂection of the student’s academic career.  Therefore, in situations which warrant academic forgiveness, the transcript will reﬂect all courses in which a student was enrolled and in which grades were earned, with the academic forgiveness provisions reﬂected in such matters as how the  GPA is calculated.  Speciﬁcally, for those students who receive academic forgiveness by repeating courses or through academic reprieve or renewal, the transcript will reﬂect the GPA excluding forgiven courses/semesters.  The transcript may also note the cumulative GPA which includes all attempted regularly graded course work. </P>

<P>The Explanation of Grades section of the transcript will note the courses and semester(s) reprieved or renewed.  Institutions will include a  legend developed by the State Regents and consistent with this policy which deﬁnes the grading symbols listed on the student’s transcript to the reader. </P>

<H5>Posting a Grade </H5>

<P>Faculty members are not required to post ﬁnal grades.  If a faculty member chooses to post grades, safeguards must be taken in order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.   </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Appealing a Grade </H5>

<P>The University believes students should be given the opportunity to meet with instructors and department chairman to resolve issues concerning assigned grades.  Student grade appeals are not intended to interfere with the instructor’s right to determine the evaluation process and to perform that evaluation.  They are intended for instances that deviate from the basic understanding of how grades are to be assigned. </P>

<P>Students wishing to appeal a grade should ﬁrst discuss the grade with the instructor.  If the student is still dissatisﬁed and believes there are circumstances that merit an appeal of grade, the student should discuss the issue with the department chair and, if necessary, the dean.  If further appeal is requested, information can be obtained on the process from the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs and/or designee.   </P>

<P>A grade appeal must be initiated within one calendar year of the semester in which the grade was issued, (i.e., a fall semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next fall semester, a spring semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next spring semester, and a summer term grade must be initiated before the end of the next summer term). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Grade Point Average </H5>

<P>Grade point numerical values are: A is 4; B is 3; C is 2; D is 1; F is 0; WF is 0; and I is 0.  Incomplete grades assigned prior to Fall 1993 were computed as F in grade point average calculation.  Incomplete grades assigned Fall 1993 or later are disregarded in ﬁguring a grade point average.  A grade point average is computed by multiplying the grade points earned in each course by the semester hours of that course, adding the results for each course, and dividing the total by the total credits attempted.  A student shall have the prerogative to repeat courses and have only the second grade earned, even if it is lower than the ﬁ rst grade, count in the calculation of the GPA, up to a maximum of four </P>

<P>(4) courses or eighteen (18) hours, not to exceed eighteen (18) hours, in courses in which the original grade earned was a “D” or “F.”  The ﬁ rst attempt shall be recorded on the transcript with the earned grade.  The second course with its grade will be listed in the semester earned.  The EXPLANATION OF GRADES section of the transcript will note that only the second grade earned is used in the calculation of the retention and graduation GPAs.  If a student repeats an individual course more than once, all grades earned, with the exception of the ﬁrst, are used to calculate the retention and graduation GPAs.  Students repeating courses above the ﬁrst 4 courses or 18 hours of “Ds” or “Fs” repeated may do so with the original grades and repeat grades averaged.  The ﬁ gure calculated is then rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.  For example, </P>

<P>1.594 is 1.59, and 1.595 is 1.60.  The grades “P”, “N”, “AU” and “W” are disregarded in ﬁguring a grade point average.  </P>

<P>(NOTE:  This East Central University policy is based on the State Regents’ Grading Policy and is subject to review and modiﬁ cation by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.) </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Transferring Grades </H5>

<P>A transferred grade other than A, B, C, D, F, and WF has a value as close as possible to the one assigned by the institution where it was earned.  A grade from an institution using a different grading system is given the value of a comparable grade at East Central University. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Attendance Requirements </H5>

<P>Individual instructors determine the degree that tardiness and absence from class affect a student’s grades and his or her ability to continue attending their classes.  Makeup work, if it is permitted, also is done under conditions set by the instructor. Instructors notify students of their policies in each of their courses at the beginning of each semester or term. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Conduct Requirements </H5>

<P>Students are expected to abide by the laws and norms of society, the rules of the University, and the rules issued by the Regional University System of Oklahoma board (see Student Handbook). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>English Proﬁciency Requirement for Faculty </H5>

<P>Instructors at East Central University are required to meet minimum English Proﬁciency standards.  The Oklahoma State Legislature requires all public schools to establish and abide by a set of standards.  East Central University’s policy is printed in the Faculty Handbook.  If a student feels a complaint should be ﬁled in reference to an instructor’s English Proﬁciency, he or she may do so in the Ofﬁce of the President of the University. </P>

<H4>RECORDS, GRADUATION, AND PLANNING FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL Student’s Records Graduation </H4>

<Sect>
<P>The academic record of anyone admitted to the University is conﬁdential, subject to his or her own examination and to the ofﬁ cial use of the University in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. </P>

<P>Transferred records for a student planning to graduate from East Central University are recorded complete.  Those records for a student planning to transfer to another institution may not be recorded in detail. If a transfer student holds a degree, the degree is noted, but the courses may not be.  Records of graduate courses are recorded if they apply toward a degree or certiﬁcate program at East Central University. </P>

<P>A person who has no delinquent obligations to the University may have ofﬁcial transcripts of his or her academic records delivered to himself or herself or mailed wherever he or she requests.  The transcript is a copy of the complete ofﬁcial scholastic record of a student.  Partial or abridged transcripts are not issued.  East Central University has retained Credentials Solutions to accept and process transcript orders. The transcript order form is available in MyECU or may be accessed via www.ecok.edu. Pricing and payment options are detailed on the order form. If you are unable to submit your request via the internet, you may contact Credentials Solutions at 847-716-3005 to order transcripts. There is an additional operator surcharge for placing orders over the telephone. </P>

<P>A student planning to graduate must ﬁle an electronic degree application by the dates published in the Schedule.  Students qualifying for two degrees during the same semester must make two separate applications.  Students receiving two majors but only one degree will apply once. See Records personnel with questions. </P>

<P>Graduation exercises are held at the end of the spring and fall semesters.  A student completing degree requirements at the end of the fall semester will attend the fall commencement exercises.  A student completing degree requirements at the end of the spring semester will attend the spring commencement exercises.  A student completing degree requirements at the end of the summer term will attend the commencement exercises in the spring prior to completing degree requirements. All students must pay a graduation fee prior to the degree being conferred. </P>

<P>Critically important is an increasingly large body of information that clearly demonstrates that AIDS is not transmitted by any form of casual interpersonal contact.  The causative virus is actually surprisingly fragile, and does not survive and multiply in the air, on inanimate objects, or on environmental surfaces.  It does not swim across pools or ﬂy.  Medical research studies in households and schools have demonstrated convincingly and repeatedly that the risk of transmission of AIDS is exclusively that of intimate sexual contact, mother to child, shared needles and that transmission in an ordinary academic, domestic, or work setting does not occur.  It is known that HTLV-III is present in the blood of most people with AIDS and AIDs related illnesses, and in some who are healthy carriers; thus, exposure to contaminated blood by sharing needles is dangerous.  That many Americans continue to believe that AIDS can be acquired from a drinking glass, toilet seat, or one’s casual companion undoubtedly reﬂects not just misinformation, but fear. </P>

<P>Current knowledge thus indicates that college and university students or employees with AIDS, AIDs related illnesses, or a positive HTLV-III antibody test do not pose a health risk to other students or employees in a usual academic or residential setting.  The Public Health Service has stated that there is no risk created by living in the same house as an infected person, caring for an AIDS patient, eating food handled by an infected person, being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person, casual kissing, or swimming in a pool with an infected person. </P>

<P>Education and communication form the basis of the institution’s strategy for dealing with the issues raised by communicable diseases on campus.  Based on current medical ﬁndings and recommendations of the American College Health Association, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and the Oklahoma State Department of Health Bulletin, East Central University has established administrative guidelines and educational strategies for students, faculty and/or staff with serious communicable diseases.  The University recognizes that no single policy statement can govern every situation which may arise; thus, individual cases shall be considered on their own needs and merits.  The University will continue to develop and review guidelines, educational programs and resources to meet the needs of all its students and employees. </P>

<P>Institutional Policy Statement and Procedure on Serious Communicable Diseases </P>

<P>I. Campus Life </P>

<P>A. Individuals with a serious communicable disease should have the same rights as any other person - free of discrimination on the basis of their infection, but will comply with University policy and procedures contingent on medical recommendations.  Individuals seeking reasonable accommodations originating from a documentable disease must register with the Ofﬁ ce of Disability Services so that said accommodations may be provided. </P>

<P>B. Housing On campus housing will be made available to persons with communicable diseases under the same conditions as applicable to any individual, but will comply with federal, state, local, and University policy and procedure in relation to the disease.  Requests by the infected individual for unique accommodations will be given every reasonable consideration, where possible, to meet the special housing needs of that individual.  Precautions will be taken on the advice of appropriate public or private health science professionals. </P>

<P>C. Class Attendance and Laboratories Laboratory instructors, workers, and students should follow safe procedures that would prevent transmission of body ﬂuids.  In the event of laboratory accidents that break the skin, precautions should be exercised to prevent transmission of body ﬂuid.  Laboratory procedures that involve blood samples, muscle biopsies and other biological materials should be collected and handled with care using recommended procedures.  All departments should develop guidelines for laboratory procedures when dealing with communicable diseases. </P>

<P>D. Athletic and Sports Activities Persons with communicable diseases should seek counseling concerning participation in athletic or sports activities.  Sports activities can result in bleeding or open wounds.  Individuals coming into contact with such injuries in any way should use utmost caution.  Procedures should be developed by all departments to cover such incidents. </P>

<P>E. Food Handling Persons involved in the preparation or serving of food or beverages should maintain current health certiﬁ cates and follow current health standard recommendations.  Persons identiﬁed as having a communicable disease will abide by federal, state, local, and University procedures in the performance of their duties. </P>

<P>II. Counseling and Health Services </P>

<P>A. East Central University will make all reasonable effort to provide referral for students, faculty and/or staff for counseling or health services in community and state agencies.  The Student Development Ofﬁ ce, Counseling Center, Health Services and Disability Services will maintain information regarding sources of assistance available to students, faculty and staff. </P>

<P>B. Conﬁ dentiality Conﬁdentiality must be carefully maintained in accordance with all legal requirements.  The patient’s right to conﬁdential treatment should be protected and the associated medical records should be kept conﬁ dential in accordance with existing institutional and legal requirements.  East Central University will make all reasonable efforts to insure that such information is kept conﬁ dential.  In addition, other University personnel will be made aware of the necessity for conﬁ dentiality. </P>

<P>III. Responsibility of Individual Infected with Communicable Diseases </P>

<P>East Central University emphasizes that individuals who know they have a communicable disease have a special responsibility to protect others from this infection.  This responsibility includes appropriate conduct in situations where the infection could likely be transmitted.  Behavior contrary to this responsibility may be considered as cause for disciplinary action by the University. </P>

<P>IV. Special Needs </P>

<P>The future may require difﬁcult decisions concerning the rights of the individual having a communicable disease, the need for medical or psychological assistance to the infected individual, and the protection of the welfare of the larger community.  To facilitate such decision making and to provide academic counseling or health care needs, University staff members may ﬁnd it necessary to seek the assistance of a limited number of key University personnel.  Such consultation will take place only with the consent of the student or employee involved, unless consent is refused and inaction is judged to endanger the welfare of others.  In all cases, steps will be taken to protect the identity of those involved and utilize only data pertinent to the decision making process. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Student Grievance Policy </H5>

<P>A student should attempt an informal resolution of his/her grievance with the appropriate faculty member, staff member or administrator.  If the grievance cannot be resolved at the level to which the complaint is made, it is referred to the next higher level.  The President will review lower level decisions if an appeal is made to the President.  The President may overrule any and all decisions.  Also, anyone choosing to do so may ﬁle a grievance directly with the President; the complaint will then be processed through the administrative channels to attempt resolution prior to the taking of ﬁ nal action. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Student Complaints </H5>

<P>Students may ﬁle complaints with appropriate institutional ofﬁ cers. Normally complaints are addressed to the individual most directly involved with the complaint.  Written complaints which are signed by the student and addressed to the President, the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs, or the Vice President for Student Development will be shared with the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association during on-site accreditation visits.  Individual identities will be shielded. Students may request contact information from institutional ofﬁ cers to ﬁle a complaint with the appropriate state agency of the institution’s accrediting body. </P>

<H5>Sexual Harassment Policy </H5>

<P>Section 1.  Purpose </P>

<P>The Regional University System of Oklahoma Board places a very high priority on each university governed by the Board maintaining a learning and work environment free from sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment is recognized as a barrier to the educational, scholarly and research purposes of the universities governed by the Board, and will not be tolerated.  Such conduct threatens the mission of the universities governed by the Board, and threatens the careers, educational experience, and well-being of students, faculty and staff. </P>

<P>Sexual harassment is especially serious when it threatens relationships between teacher and student or supervisor and subordinate.  In such situations, sexual harassment exploits unfairly the power inherent in a faculty member’s or supervisor’s position.  Through grades, wage increases, recommendations for graduate study, promotion, and the like, a teacher or supervisor can have a decisive inﬂuence on a student’s, staff member’s or faculty member’s career at a university and beyond. </P>

<P>While sexual harassment most often takes place in situations of a power differential between the parties involved, the Board also recognizes that sexual harassment may occur between persons of the same university status.  The Board will not tolerate behavior between or among members of the university community which creates an unacceptable working or educational environment. </P>

<P>Section 2.  Deﬁ nition/Prohibited Acts </P>

<P>No faculty, administrative, support employee, or student of any university governed by the Board shall engage in sexual harassment.  For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is deﬁ ned as unwarranted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: </P>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work or educational performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment for work or learning. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Section 3.  Examples of Sexual Harassment </P>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>g. </Lbl>

<LBody>Any instance of sexual harassment should be reported to the Director of Employment Services, Room 160, Administration Building or the Dean of Students, Room 103, Administration Building. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Section 4.  University Education and Grievance Procedure Requirements </P>

Pre-ProfessionalPrograms </Figure>

<Sect>
<P>Several students attend East Central University with the intention of entering a professional school located at another university.  For these students East Central University offers pre-professional programs in engineering, law, and several of the medical ﬁelds.  Students in these programs have the opportunity to spend from one to three years at East Central University completing the basic entrance requirements to the professional schools.  Students interested in this opportunity should contact the appropriate advisor for their program.  A description of the basic programs and their advisor follows below. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Pre-Dental Hygiene </H5>

<P>The dental hygienist is a licensed member of the oral health care team responsible for providing preventive, therapeutic and educational services for dental patients and the community.  Dental hygienist services are provided in a variety of settings including hospitals, public health clinics, schools and geriatric centers.  Basic admission requirements consist of a minimum of 60 semester hours of prescribed course work which may be completed at ECU.  The Professional program consists of 2 years of course work, clinical and practicum in a hospital or clinical setting.  For more information, contact the Department of Biology. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Pre-Engineering </H5>

<P>No matter what branch of engineering a student wishes to enter, the program for the ﬁrst four semesters contains mostly the same basic courses.  These include mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, English, history, and behavioral and social sciences. </P>

<P>The pre-engineering program at ECU allows students to ﬁ ll these requirements in two years, after which they transfer to a university with an engineering school to take advanced courses in their area of specialization.  Advisors customize students’ curriculum to match the engineering school they plan to attend.  This enables them to enjoy the small classes, personalized instruction, and friendly atmosphere at ECU while receiving an excellent academic foundation for further study.  For more information, contact the Department of Physics. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Pre-Law </H5>

<P>A successful career in law demands proﬁciency in three-skills areas: the ability to think critically, the ability to analyze information from a variety of sources and apply that analysis to solving problems, and the ability to communicate that analysis to others.  While completion of any undergraduate degree program confers eligibility for law school, the most successful candidates often come from programs located in the Liberal Arts which emphasize mastery of these skills.  ECU offers two programs, Political Science and Legal Studies, which have proven especially successful in helping graduates attain success in law school.  The speciﬁc choice of major (and minor), however, should be tailored to match the interests and particular needs of each student.  Please contact the Pre-Law advisor in the Department of Politics, Law, and Society for more information. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Pre-Pharmacy </H5>

<P>A pre-pharmacy curriculum is offered at ECU that will meet all requirements for admission to any school of pharmacy.  The curriculum requires two to three years to complete, after which the remaining four years of study must be taken at a school of pharmacy.  The courses to be taken in the two to three year segment include those in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, in addition to several of our general education courses such as English, history, and government.  The program is tailored to individual needs depending upon the choice of a particular pharmacy school.  For more information, contact the Department of Chemistry. </P>

<H5>Pre-Physical Therapy </H5>

<P>Physical Therapy is a dynamic health care profession dedicated to the promotion of optimal health, prevention of disability, and restoration of physical activity following a debilitating incident.  As an active member of the health care team, physical therapists provide therapeutic services to individuals of all ages with musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiopulmonary, sensorimotor, vascular, immunological and cellular disorders or trauma.  Physical Therapy services are provided in a variety of settings including hospitals, extended care facilities, ambulatory clinics, schools, and homes.  (The Professional program usually consists of three years of didactic and clinical courses selected in a hospital setting.)  A baccalaureate degree is required along with other prerequisites such as Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores and documentation of 40 hours of observation experience submitted with the application for admission to the Physical Therapy program.  (Speciﬁc course requirements and other admission criteria are available from the ECU Biology department.) </P>

<H5>Pre-Professional Sciences </H5>

<P>East Central University offers all courses that are required for admission to professional schools of medicine, dentistry, optometry, chiropractic, physician’s associate or veterinary medicine.  Although the pre-professional sciences student may select any degree major, most successful candidates major in either Biology or Chemistry.  Course work must be arranged so as to complete the required work in time for the admission exams and application in your program (usually Spring of junior year).  A pre-medicine professional student may earn the bachelor of science degree by completing three years of work in the bachelor of science degree program and one year in an accredited professional school of Medicine (M.D. or D.O.), Dentistry (D.D.S.), Optometry (O.D.), or Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.). For more information, contact the Department of Biology. </P>

<P>Few applicants are admitted with less than a bachelors degree.  You should follow a degree track at the time you are completing the preprofessional requirements.  East Central University does offer the Bachelors Combined Degree Program which allows the student who may be admitted to professional medical sciences school at the end of their junior year to receive the bachelors degree after successful completion of the ﬁrst year in professional school.  The requirements for this program are available from the appropriate Pre-Professional Sciences Advisor or the ECU Records Ofﬁ ce. </P>

<H2>DEPARTMENT OF ACCOUNTING </H2>

<P>Instructor and Chair, Dougherty Instructor Elliott, Stone Instructor and Chickasaw Endowed Professor, Lee </P>

<P>The primary purpose of accounting is to measure and communicate ﬁnancial information about proﬁt and non-proﬁt organizations to interested persons.  Accounting professionals operate within a broad socioeconomic environment.  Therefore, emphasis within the accounting program is placed upon a combination of conceptual knowledge and practical applications of accounting theory and concepts as they relate to satisfying the information needs of a disparate group of users.  The wide selection of courses in the accounting department enables the student to become familiar with such ﬁelds as taxation, ﬁ nancial accounting, managerial accounting, auditing, and governmental/not-for-proﬁ t accounting.       </P>

<P>The Accounting Program prepares the student for entry level professional positions and provides the prerequisite courses for admission to graduate study.  Students majoring in accounting are required to take a combination of business and accounting related courses, which enhance their knowledge of the various business functions.  Courses in computer technology and information systems, business communication, management, marketing, ﬁnance, business law, and economics are taken by all accounting majors. The Department also offers a minor in Accounting, and two certiﬁcate programs in Managerial Accounting and Treasury Management. </P>

<H2>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION </H2>

<P>Chair and Associate Professor Isaacs Professors Sherbourne Assistant Professors Felts, Jones, Koch, Sharber, Thornton Instructors Caruthers, Cunningham, Johnson, Snell </P>

<P>The Department of Education serves the University in three essential functions.  The ﬁrst function is to prepare students in the three areas of specialization the department offers at the undergraduate level: Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, and Special Education.  The areas of specialization lead to teacher licensure and certiﬁcation in Oklahoma. The second function is to provide professional education courses which enable competent educators in all of the teacher education programs at the University.  The third and ﬁnal function is the offering of eight options at the master’s level (see Section on School of Graduate Studies).  The graduate program prepares individuals for a variety of occupations in public schools, related positions in institutions, business, industry, or hospitals.  </P>

<P>Each teacher certiﬁcation program offered at East Central University is nationally accredited by The Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation.  The teacher preparation program addresses both national standards and Oklahoma’s required 10 competencies.  All standards are delivered within ECU’s PRIDE conceptual framework where faculty are committed to preparing Professional, Reﬂ ective, Innovative and Dedicated Educators. Integrated throughout the program are technology standards and best practices in STEM education. These experiences are enhanced by additional workshops organized through ECU’s Institute for Math and Science Education. Students preparing to teach in secondary schools acquire a content knowledge base and competency in their respective specialty ﬁelds to teach at the middle school, junior high, or high school level.  Special Education majors are prepared to appropriately educate children with disabilities at any grade level and in a variety of settings.  Elementary Education majors are prepared to teach in elementary, middle school, or junior high through eighth grade.  Early Childhood Education majors prepare to teach in nursery schools, kindergartens, and grades one through three.  Field experiences provide supervised interactions with public school children before and during student teaching.  </P>

<P>All teacher certiﬁcation programs provide academic backgrounds for students wishing to pursue graduate level education.  These advanced studies lead to an expanded professional knowledge base and set of skills which may provide access and entry into professional careers in education.  The professional careers include school administration, supervision, educational technology, library media, guidance and counseling, special education, school psychology and psychometry, and research. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Elementary Education Program </H5>

<P>Elementary Education majors develop skill and competency in educating children in grades one through eight.   The student acquires an academic foundation in language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies by completing at least twelve semester hours in each of these content areas.  Elementary Education majors expand their teaching knowledge and skills in the use of teaching methods, materials, various assessment instruments, and appropriate technologies toward meeting the educational needs of elementary students. They develop perspective and skills in planning, organizing, implementing, and evaluating learning activities and lessons.  Students also learn appropriate classroom management skills that provide a setting and climate conducive to learning and growth. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Early Childhood Education Program </H5>

<P>Students who major in Early Childhood Education complete courses concentrating on the development and education of young children.  This program leads to state certiﬁcation for teaching children in nursery school, kindergarten, and grades one, two, and three.   The study focuses students on (a) developing an understanding of the unique characteristics and needs of pre-primary and primary level children, </P>

<P>(b) learning to assess emerging skills, and (c) planning and executing learning activities appropriate for young learners at various stages of development.  Early Childhood majors complete twelve semester hours in each of these areas:  science, mathematics, social studies, and language arts.  The student who majors in Early Childhood Education will gain practical experiences with prekindergarten through third grade children before and during the student teaching experience. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Special Education Program </H5>

<P>Special Education majors prepare to understand the unique learning, psychological, and when appropriate, physical characteristics of children with disabilities.  They study teaching methods and materials and explore various technologies to meet the educational needs of these students.  Legal requirements and ethical considerations are explored regarding the student with disabilities.  Practicum experiences with children who are at various levels of academic functioning are completed before student teaching.  Special Education majors complete twelve semester hours in each of these areas:  science, mathematics, social studies, and language arts.  This program leads to state certiﬁcation for teaching children with mild/moderate disabilities from preschool through high school. </P>

<P>Teacher candidates who wish to certify in two of the following programs:  Early Childhood, Elementary, and Special Education, must complete an application, meet with the program coordinator of the additional certiﬁcation area, complete identiﬁed requirements and pass the appropriate Oklahoma State Subject Area Test. </P>
</Sect>

<H5>Requirements for Retention and Graduation in Teacher Education </H5>

<P>Students who are admitted to teacher education and intend to graduate from the program must maintain their eligibility while enrolled.  The Teacher Education Program has an ongoing informal evaluation, and speciﬁed reviews of teacher education majors regarding continued eligibility for retention, certiﬁcation, and graduation in teacher education.  The following is the review procedure for retention: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>A continuous informal evaluation is in progress for each candidate enrolled in professional education classes.  This evaluation is accomplished by each professor being sensitive to special problems or concerns that may be noted.  If a problem or concern is observed and is considered serious enough to be a part of the student’s record, the professor will ﬁle a formal report with the Director of Teacher Education.  This report will be the basis for a formal reevaluation of the student by an appropriate committee to determine the eligibility and suitability of the student to remain in teacher education. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>The second review in the retention program takes place as needed at the request of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology  and consists of the following three parts:  </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>(a)</Lbl>

<LBody> the student’s grade point average will be examined, (b) the student will be formally evaluated by the professor, and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>(c)</Lbl>

<LBody> the student’s portfolio will be evaluated.  A student who has not maintained an overall grade point average of 2.75 or better in all college work attempted may not enroll in additional professional education courses until the grade point average is 2.75 or better.  An unfavorable evaluation by the professor will lead to a formal reevaluation of the student by an appropriate committee to determine the eligibility and suitability of the student to remain in teacher education.  A student with an unsatisfactory portfolio will not be allowed to continue in the program until a satisfactory portfolio is presented. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>The third review in the retention process occurs at the time the student applies for student teaching when eligibility for student teaching will be examined. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>The evaluation process continues through EDUC 4262 and EDUC 4282, Student Teaching Seminar I and Student Teaching Seminar II, [EDUC 4954*,  EDUC 4964*, or EDUC 4974*]. *Enrolled in twice for eight (8) hours credit. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<H5>Denial of Admission or Dismissal From the Teacher Education Program </H5>

<P>The obligation for maintaining academic integrity, professional standards and ethics, and legal responsibilities should be considered fundamental in the preparation of future educators.  East Central University’s Teacher Education Program assumes this obligation to parents, public schools, and the State of Oklahoma.  In this respect, the Teacher Education Program will attempt to screen and deny admission or dismiss from the program those students deemed unsuitable teacher education candidates.  This is an attempt to protect public school students from unacceptable teacher education candidates.  In addition, this good faith effort will preserve the credibility and effectiveness of the Teacher Education Program in maintaining its relationship with public schools and demonstrate the program’s efforts to provide teacher candidates who are suited to teach public school students. </P>

<P>East Central University maintains the obligation to deny admission to or dismiss from the Teacher Education Program at any time, any student whose personal conduct is deemed detrimental to: </P>

<H5>Suspension From the Teacher Education Program </H5>

<P>A student shall be suspended immediately when there is reasonable belief that grounds exist for such suspension from the Teacher Education Program.  In addition, if there is a reasonable belief, the immediate suspension of a student is necessary because it is to be considered in the best interests of the Teacher Education Program, the public schools, or public school students; then the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology (or in the absence of the Dean, the Chair of the Education Department or designee) may suspend the student immediately from the Teacher Education Program, including ﬁ eld experiences or student teaching.  When circumstances arise indicating there is an immediate need to suspend, the student will be notiﬁ ed verbally or in a delivered message from the Dean.  The process for dismissal of a student from the Teacher Education Program will be initiated, if necessary within ﬁve calendar days following suspension of the student.  To the extent possible, students reinstated after the initiation of the suspension from the Teacher Education Program policy, will be restored to their previous position and status without action detrimental to their studies, progress and evaluation of their work. </P>

<P>Assistant Professor and Chair Prather Instructors Lorance, McCarty-J., McGaha-J., McGaha-M., Stowers </P>

<P>Physical Activity–an integral part of the educational experience– contributes effectively to a student’s general development. The Department of Kinesiology gives students the means to educate the total person for living in an enlightened society. The study of human movement is the unique content of the Kinesiology program. Choices in Wellness is the course that is offered for the general education requirement and provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to make lifestyle choices which positively affect one’s health and well-being. The Kinesiology Department also provides support courses for other majors or teaching concentrations. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Kinesiology Program </H5>

<P>The Kinesiology program prepares students for careers in the ﬁtness/wellness profession, as well as research oriented careers. Prospective employers include health clubs, recreational facilities, hospital-based wellness programs, cardiac rehabilitation programs, sports medicine clinics, as well as preparing students for various medical professions such as: athletic training, physical therapy, physical assistant, and physician’s assistant.</P>

<P> Many Kinesiology majors use interdisciplinary studies to prepare for working with special populations such as senior citizens or owning their own ﬁtness business such as personal training. The coursework for this degree includes a core of courses in the broad ﬁeld of Kinesiology concentrating on knowledge and skills necessary for appropriate exercise testing, prescription, and leadership. </P>

<P>Minor </P>

<P>In addition to the Kinesiology degree programs, a minor in Kinesiology is offered to allow students to gain more in-depth knowledge and skill in the selected ﬁeld and provides excellent supportive coursework to other major programs offered at ECU. </P>

<H2>DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY </H2>

<P>Associate Professor and Chair Klippenstine Professors Harris-Young Associate Professors U. Fountain, Velez Assistant Professors Campbell, Harwell, Pottratz, Roberson, Roring, Williams </P>

<P>The Department of Psychology is actively involved in fulﬁ lling the three functions of a University:  Teaching, Research, and Service.  These three functions merge as professors have students participate in  research, use research ﬁndings and student research to enrich classes, and provide a service to the community by teaching needed skills and providing needed services.  As a behavioral science, it employs the scientiﬁc method to greatly enhance the problem-solving abilities of people.  Further, since psychology involves the study of behavior, it enables people to understand themselves better and to understand others.  General Psychology is the course that fulﬁlls the general studies function.  It is a general course in which the student learns the principles of behavior and how to apply these to everyday living.  The Department of Psychology provides support courses for majors in other areas.  For example, majors in elementary education, special education, nursing, and professional programs in human services take courses in psychology to develop the understanding and skills necessary to function in their professions.  The Department of Psychology provides a major ﬁeld of study leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree.  Just as in the minor ﬁeld of study, some students majoring in psychology do not intend to become professional psychologists.  These students may use psychology to enter professional schools such as medicine, dentistry, law, or theology.  Others use psychology as a liberal education and enter business and industry or use this knowledge and these skills to become effective parents or citizens in the communities in which they live.  Finally, of course, students choose to major in psychology because they want to go on to graduate school and make psychology their professional career. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAM </H5>

<P>Psychology is the science of human behavior.  As a ﬁ eld, it attempts to develop technologies that will help understand the dynamics of human behavior as a means of developing a profession that will promote human welfare.  As such, the undergraduate program at East Central University prepares its students through classwork, student professional organizations such as Psi Chi, ﬁeld trips, assisting the faculty in professional endeavors such as research and application, and close relationships with the faculty to help understand and get to know, on a broad basis, the ﬁeld of psychology.  This training prepares the student to work at an entry level in the following areas:  mental health clinics, hospitals, counseling centers, corrections, and many other areas including being prepared to enter graduate school. </P>

<P>The mission of the Psychology Program is an integral part of the overall mission of East Central University.  The mission of the university includes providing a number of baccalaureate, preprofessional and graduate programs.  The program addresses this goal by providing an undergraduate degree program in Psychology.  Instruction in Psychology at the undergraduate level utilizes the following formats:  lecture, video and multimedia material, ﬁ eld trips, research and library report writing, and direct hands-on experience both in the research laboratory and clinic setting. </P>

<P>The Department of Biology provides undergraduate training for students interested in the life sciences who may wish to pursue careers in this area.  Biology is a continually expanding discipline with a variety of career opportunities. The faculty and facilities of the Department permit the investigation of Biology at the subcellular, cellular, organismal, population and community level.  Courses taught in the Department emphasize scientiﬁc principles and concepts that aid in understanding structure, function and behavior of individual organisms and how individual organisms interact within the natural environment. Several scholarships are available to qualiﬁed students.  Departmental scholarships include the Thomas J. McKnight Biology Scholarship and the Fred and Mary Pfeffer Scholarship.  Other scholarships are available through the Academic Scholarship Program and the East Central University Foundation. For students who plan to teach there are scholarships available through the College of Education and Psychology. </P>

<P>There are several clubs and societies available for biology students. The ones currently active are the Tri-Beta Club, the Pre-Denistry Club, and the Society for Wildlife and Ecological Biologists.   </P>

<P>BIOLOGY DEGREE CONCENTRATION </P>

<P>The Department of Biology offers majors in four bachelor degree concentrations.  A Bachelor of Science is designed for students who plan to become practicing biologists in industry or government, or plan to pursue a graduate degree in biology.  This degree concentration is usually chosen by those students who need pre-professional training before entering the schools of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, or other health-related professional schools.  A Bachelor of Science for Teacher Certiﬁcation gives a prospective science teacher an appropriate academic background in biology and in the methods of teaching.  The Bachelor of Science for Molecular Biology prepares students for graduate research and/or employment in the rapidly growing ﬁ elds of biotechnology, agribusiness, industry, law enforcement, and molecular biology.  A Bachelor of Science for Clinical Laboratory Science prepares students to conduct and supervise complex medical tests, clinical trials, and research experiments; manage clinical laboratories; and consult with physicians and clinical researchers on diagnoses, disease causation and spread, and research outcomes.  This degree concentration requires three years of prescribed study on campus followed by a year of clinical training in an approved hospital School of Clinical Laboratory Science.  </P>

<P>CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE CONCENTRATION </P>

<P>This concentration requires a minimum of ninety-four semester hours credit of prescribed study on the campus, followed by a clinical component (30 hours) which consists of a year of approved professional training in Clinical Laboratory Science.  The professional training must be done in a school of clinical laboratory science approved by the University and by the Oklahoma Consortium of Clinical Laboratory Science Afﬁ liates. </P>

<P>The Department of Chemistry/Physics is comprised of two disciplines--Chemistry and Physics.  The department offers Bachelor of Science degree programs with a major and a minor in each of these academic areas.  Speciﬁc features of each program are detailed below. </P>

<P>CHEMISTRY </P>

<P>The department of chemistry offers both a major and a minor in chemistry, a major in chemistry with a biochemistry concentration, a major in chemistry for teacher certiﬁcation, and courses needed for those wishing to teach biology, chemistry, physics, physical science, or general science at the public school level.  The department also functions as a support and service department for required courses in biology, nursing, environmental science, and allied health programs. </P>

<P>Additionally the department provides pre-professional studies for students pursuing medicine, engineering, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, physical therapy, and medical technology. </P>

<P>A quality program of study is made possible through small classes, opportunity for  student/professor interaction, and the unique situation of having the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Protection Agency Groundwater Research Laboratory located in Ada, OK.  Cooperative agreements with this governmental institution allow expanded opportunities for study, research,  quality analytical instrumentation, and possible student employment while at ECU. </P>

<P>CHEMISTRY PROGRAM </P>

<P>In compliance with the recommendations of the American Chemical Society for curricula in undergraduate chemical education, the department offers courses in all ﬁve major areas of chemistry:  inorganic, analytical, organic, physical, and biochemistry.  </P>

<P>PHYSICS </P>

<P> Physics is one of the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sciences.  It is an attempt to understand the foundations of our universe through the study of motion, force, energy, sound, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, heat, light, and quantum mechanics.  Physics students use advanced mathematics to solve challenging experimental or theoretical problems, so they often major in mathematics as well.  The ability to analyze a problem and ﬁnd the best possible solution is vital to success in many ﬁelds.  As a result, physics graduates often work in such seemingly non-related areas as medicine, law, biology, business, or military science, as well as in engineering, mathematics, computer science, or industry. </P>

<P>In addition to the university’s program of ﬁ nancial aid, the department provides positions for student workers.  Several  departmental scholarships are awarded annually, and the department participates in the LS-OKAMP program awarding scholarships and research stipends for qualifying minority students.  Interested students should contact the Department Chairman for further information. </P>

<P>PHYSICS PROGRAM </P>

<P>All physics students begin with Engineering Physics I and II and mathematics through Calculus II.  Advanced courses are selected to prepare them for one of four main areas: employment in physics or engineering, graduate studies in physics or engineering, the teaching profession at the secondary level, or graduate studies in medical physics. </P>

<P>DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES </P>

<P>Professor and Chair Weirick Professor and Robert S. Kerr Endowed Chair Sewell Assistant Professor Braun </P>

<P>The Department of Environmental Sciences maintains two degree programs, the Cartography Program and the Environmental Health Science Program. The Cartography program offers a major leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Cartography and the Environmental Health Science program offers a major leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Health Science. Both programs offer minors for students majoring in other degree programs. </P>

<P>CARTOGRAPHY PROGRAM </P>

<P>The Bachelor of Science degree in Cartography provides graduates with the education needed to work in public or private sector positions requiring geographical and geospatial knowledge and skills.  The degree also prepares students for graduate studies in Cartography, Geography and related disciplines. </P>

<P>Cartography majors select from one of two degree options, either a concentration in Geotechniques or a concentration in Geography.  The Geotechniques concentration places emphasis on the analytical, theoretical, and technical skills necessary for employment as a cartographer or geographic information system analyst.  These include cartography, remote sensing, geographic information systems, and global positioning systems.  This concentration also requires geography courses to enable students to apply geotechniques methodologies to real-world situations.  The Geography concentration provides a more traditional geography based education which trains students to think spatially and requires a ﬁeld course to help students understand the job of a professional geographer. Students in either concentration must complete a minor in a related ﬁ eld. </P>

<P>All Cartography majors gain valuable hands-on experiences through the use of the department’s state-of-the-art Devon Energy Spatial Graphics and Analysis Laboratory.  Cartography majors receive additional experience by giving a formal presentation based upon a senior project, are encouraged to participate in professional meetings and have opportunities to complete internships with governmental agencies or industrial corporations. </P>

<P>ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE PROGRAM </P>

<P>The Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Health Science (EHS) provides graduates with the interdisciplinary education needed for professional careers in areas such as: hazardous materials management, environmental program planning, industrial food safety, disease vector control, occupational safety and health, and water resources management.  EHS Program graduates have been selected for professional positions in public health departments, private industries, state and federal environmental agencies, the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and in private environmental consulting ﬁrms.  In addition, the program prepares EHS majors for graduate study in a wide variety of disciplines. </P>

<P>The EHS program is one of 31 baccalaureate programs accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council and has maintained accreditation since 1975. EHS majors must complete a total of 55 hours of core courses in environmental health and environmental science which includes a supervised, professional internship at an approved site.  The internship provides students with an opportunity to integrate their academic preparation with actual work experiences.  EHS majors must also complete supporting courses in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics.  A minor is advised, but not required. </P>

<P>DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE </P>

<P>Professor and Chair Ferdinand Associate Professor Wells Assistant Professors Harper, Jacob, Lastrina, Lynam, Uﬁ mstev, Tarver Instructor McClain </P>

<P>The Mathematics program offers three concentrations which leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The curriculum is ﬂexible and can be adapted to a variety of student interests. After completing one of the three concentrations,  program graduates typically enter the job market as certiﬁed teachers of secondary school mathematics, actuarial trainees, applied mathematicians in business or industry; or pursue study in graduate school leading to advanced degrees in mathematics, statistics, computer science, ﬁnance, or management science. Some program graduates elect to pursue further study in a professional school such as law or medicine. </P>

<P>The Computer Science degree program is designed to prepare its graduates for technical careers in various software ﬁ elds. Program graduates enjoy lucrative salaries and the opportunity to work on interesting and challenging projects upon employment in many of today’s primary industries. </P>

<P>Computing facilities include powerful Linux-based and Windows-based terminals as well as graphics workstations. Department computers have internet access and are loaded with mathematical and statistical software packages for use in classroom teaching and student research. All four department computer laboratories are accessible during the regular and evening hours. </P>

<P>MATHEMATICS PROGRAM </P>

<P>General Mathematics Concentration </P>

<P>The General Mathematics concentration provides preparation for the student who plans to enter a graduate program in mathematics. A student taking this concentration, in consultation with his or her advisor, should choose elective courses which meet the entrance requirements of the desired graduate program.  </P>

<P>Teacher Certiﬁ cation Concentration </P>

<P>The Teacher Certiﬁcation Concentration, in conjunction with professional education courses, prepares the student for teaching mathematics at the secondary level. </P>

<P>Applied Mathematics/ Pre-Actuary Concentration </P>

<P>The Applied Mathematics/ Pre-Actuary Concentration prepares the student for entry into the job market as an applied mathematician, an actuarial trainee, for a career in ﬁnance, or for entry into a graduate program in applied mathematics, actuarial science, statistics, ﬁ nance or quantitative management science. </P>

<P>COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM </P>

<P>The curriculum has been designed using guidelines published by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).  These courses will give the student excellent training in the scientiﬁc and technical areas of computing and also provide the preparation necessary to pursue graduate work in this ﬁ eld. </P>

<P>SCHOOL OF NURSING </P>

<P>Assistant Professor and Interim Director Duncan Instructors Curtis, Dilday, Heck, Hoffpauir, Ollila, Powers, Reed, Saidleman, Shalver Lecturer Gray, Scott </P>

<P>Nursing is an exciting and rewarding profession and professional nurses are highly valued in today’s health care system.  Nurses are recognized for their skills, judgment and decision-making ability.  Research has shown that there is a direct correlation between successful patient recovery and the number of baccalaureate nurses providing care. A baccalaureate degree in nursing from ECU is the stepping stone to an array of practice opportunities including advanced practice nursing, nursing education, middle-and upper-level management and advanced degrees. ECU graduates are heavily recruited by health care facilities throughout the central plains and the southwest.  </P>

<P>Enrolled nursing students are eligible for a number of grants and scholarships.  Awards available through the nursing program include the Carlock Scholarship, the Nursing Alumni Award, the Pfeffer Award, and the Francis W. and Elizabeth Schmelling Award.  As nursing majors, students also become eligible for Physician’s Manpower Training Awards, Indian Health Service Scholarships, and a number of awards/ scholarships from Oklahoma and Texas hospitals.  Financial Aid will provide a list of available assistance upon request. Also refer to the ECU Foundation website https://www.ecok.edu/administration/foundation. </P>

<P>The mission of the School of Nursing is an integral part of the overall mission of ECU.  It includes offering a high quality baccalaureate nursing program to provide south central and southeast Oklahoma with accessible, professionally delivered nursing care.  The goal of the program is to prepare students for the practice of professional nursing in a variety of settings and areas. For more information, please contact the School of Nursing at ECU or view the website at ecok.edu/nursing. </P>

<P>The School of Nursing offers the Bachelor of Science with a major in Nursing degree to pre-licensure (these are students who are not already registered nurses) students at its campus sites in Ada and Durant.  Pre-licensure students complete an eight semester program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science with a major in Nursing.  Graduates who meet the Oklahoma state requirements for licensure, including a clear criminal background check, are eligible to apply to write the National Council Licensing Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX, RN) to become a Registered Nurse.  During the ﬁrst three semesters in the major, students work toward completion of general education requirements and nursing support courses.  Unlike most pre-licensure baccalaureate nursing programs that offer only four semesters of clinical courses, ECU has ﬁve semesters of clinical courses.  Students apply for admission to the pre-licensure program at the beginning of the fall semester of their sophomore year.  Admission decisions are based upon published criteria.  A retention grade point average of at least 2.7/4.0, a program course GPA of 2.7/4.0, and grades of “C” or better in all prerequisite support courses and completion of at least 24 hours of the required support courses are required to be considered for admission.  A minimum composite score of 58.7 on the pre-entrance exam is required for admission. However, attainment of these minimum criteria does not guarantee admission to the clinical portion of the program.  Students with high retention and program GPAs and grades of “B” or better in science courses are highly competitive.  Students will experience a wide variety of clinical experiences. During the ﬁnal semester of the senior year, students work individually with a registered nurse in a preceptor experience. The program is taught face-to-face using a variety of teaching methods to students enrolled at ECU’s Nursing program in Ada and at ECU’s Nursing program at Southeastern in Durant. </P>

<P>The nursing program is approved by the Oklahoma Board of Nursing and accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, Inc., 3343 Peachtree Rd. NE, Suite 850, Atlanta, GA 30326, phone (405) 975-5000. </P>

<P>NURSING PROGRAM </P>

<P>A minimum of 124 credit hours are required for graduation.  For pre-licensure students, most prerequisite courses must be completed before the beginning of the junior year.  Some general education courses can be taken during the junior year, but because of the intensive clinical experiences that are taught during the senior year, it becomes challenging to schedule additional courses.  Students should complete their general education requirements during the ﬁrst six semesters of the program. Because of the complex and integrated nature of the nursing curriculum, it is strongly recommended that students visit with a nursing advisor as soon as possible to plan their course of study.  Students are required to make an appointment with their assigned nursing advisor before pre-enrolling each semester.  </P>

<P>Requirements for Admission to the Pre-Licensure Nursing Program </P>

<P>Applicants to ECU’s Nursing Program must also be admitted to the University before enrolling in nursing courses. See https://www.ecok. edu/student-development/admissions/applying-ecu-new-freshman. </P>

<P>DEPARTMENT OF ART </P>

<P>Professor and Chair Jessop Associate Professor Chubb Assistant Professors Dougherty, Seals </P>

<P>East Central University Art Department students and instructors interact in real work situations.  In studio studies, an experienced faculty presents various approaches to art tempered with an awareness of current developments in the arts.  A close instructor-student working relationship enables students to grasp both the methods of expression and what it means to be an artist in today’s society.  Students develop a personal, aesthetically based, problem-solving approach to the visual arts and acquire skills in drawing, painting, design, sculpture, ceramics, and digital media.  Lecture courses are designed to engage students in the contextuality of art as a historical dialogue. </P>

<P>The Department has the facilities and equipment to enable students to realize ideas in a variety of materials and techniques.  Facilities include: new state of the art studios for drawing, painting, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture, digital imaging and foundations.  The Department can access over 50,000 images via database for art history.  It houses a state of the art digital imaging laboratory and other equipment in the department include a:  high ﬁre, raku, and salt glazing kilns for ceramics; metal working equipment, a ceramic shell foundry, CNC machine, 3D printing, wood and stone carving equipment for sculpting; and equipment for etching, lithography, serigraphy, and relief printmaking. </P>

<P>The Department is also home to the Pogue Gallery exhibiting selected national and regional exhibits, statewide juried competitions, and annual shows of faculty, art students and the University collection.  The Department prides itself on its longstanding history of preparing students of the visual arts with educational experiences essential to artistic success in today’s society. </P>

<P>ART PROGRAM </P>

<P>The Department of Art offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with concentrations in studio art, art education and graphic design and minors in art and art history.

<P>The Communication Studies concentration serves students seeking experiences in learning to communicate effectively with others both personally and professionally.  Communication majors/minors are multi-faceted candidates trained for a wide variety of challenging careers in corporate and entertainment communications, education, government, journalism, and social services, as well as lead individual roles as motivational speakers and consultants. The Speech Teacher Certiﬁcation concentration prepares students to teach Speech, Drama, and Debate at the secondary level.

<P>DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH AND LANGUAGES </P>

<P>Associate Professor and Chair Peters Professors Hada, Hughes, McMahon, Murphy, Pierson, Sukholutskaya,  </P>

<P>   Walling Associate Professors Benton, Nicholson-Weir Assistant Professors, King, Nicholson-Weir, Peters </P>

<P>The Department of English and Languages offers a major in English.  It offers minors in English, Spanish, Humanities, Oklahoma Studies, and English as a Second Language, as well as course work in additional languages.  Students in the department’s major and minor programs enhance their reading and writing skills important in a variety of careers, absorb the cultural understanding necessary for success in a diverse society, and develop the critical thinking skills which will lead to professional and advanced academic success. </P>

<P>The major in English is appropriate for many professional and cultural objectives. By properly selecting courses, students may prepare for a variety of options:  </P>

<P>graduate work in literature, writing, or linguistics; </P>

<P>certiﬁcation for secondary teaching; </P>

<P>professional work in creative, expository, and technical writing; or </P>

<P>professional study in such areas as law or technical </P>

<P>communication. </P>

<P>Because of the comprehensive variety of courses offered, students have opportunity within the major to explore areas of special interest: for example, American, British and world literatures, the English language, or technical and creative writing. </P>

<P>ENGLISH PROGRAM </P>

<P>The Department of English and Languages offers undergraduate majors in English and English Teacher Certiﬁcation. English majors develop broad cultural awareness and advanced reading and writing skills through study of poetry, drama, ﬁ ction, ﬁlm, and critical theory. </P>

<P>Additional study of creative and persuasive writing, and grammar and linguistics prepares students for graduate study in literature, rhetoric and composition, creative or technical writing, linguistics, or for study of law.  English Teacher Certiﬁcation majors take additional courses in methods of teaching English to attain state certiﬁcation qualifying them to teach English at the middle and high school levels. The department also offers minors in English, English as a Second Language, Oklahoma Studies, and Humanities. </P>

<P>LANGUAGES </P>

<P>The department offers a minor in Spanish.  Courses in the Spanish minor may include work in literature, grammar, composition, conversation, and culture.  In addition,  the department offers basic courses in French, and Russian. All foreign language studies provide awareness of the culture of the language and insight into the unique world view of different languages. </P>

<P>HUMANITIES </P>

<P>The humanities are those branches of learning which deal with what is fundamentally human—self-consciousness, language, reason, creativity, human values and aspirations. Students can minor in humanities, a natural complement to a major in the liberal arts or social sciences.  The department and the college offer a wide range of humanities courses to serve the minor and satisfy university general education requirements. Examples include courses in literature, ﬁ lm, language, history, philosophy, religion, art, music, and theater. </P>

<P>DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY AND NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES </P>

<P>Professor and Chair, Barton Professor and Chickasaw Nation Endowed Chair Cowger Professors Barton, Clampitt Associate Professors Bean, Mount Assistant Professor Sutton </P>

<P>Success in any career today demands ﬂexibility based in three skill areas: the ability to think critically, the ability to analyze information from a variety of sources and apply that analysis to solving problems, and the ability to communicate that analysis to others. These skills are particularly critical for careers in law, government, business, teaching, medicine, as well as for success in graduate or professional school. </P>

<P>Founded solidly in the tradition of liberal arts, the History and Native American Studies Department at East Central University emphasizes developing these skills.  Each History and Native American Studies major may, with the help of faculty, tailor a program to best match individual career and intellectual interests. The department offers degrees in History, History (Teacher Certiﬁcation), and Native American Studies.  </P>

<P>HISTORY PROGRAM </P>

<P>History offers students the richness of past experience to comprehend more lucidly humanity’s progress and setbacks, great accomplishments and tragic failures.  Historical study teaches judgment, examines values, and explores issues and events; it uncovers the sources of creativity and stagnation during the entire course of civilization’s evolution.  The signiﬁcance of the past and its meaning for the possibilities of the present and future become a powerful tool of analysis and interpretation.  The History program offers a wide-range of courses in United States history, European history, and World history.  A student may major or minor in history, selecting an area of concentration for either a BA or a BA with teacher certiﬁ cation. </P>

<P>History as a major combined with other disciplines, provides excellent preparation for a productive and meaningful personal and professional life.  Majors utilize their skills to teach history and related courses in elementary and secondary school.  Graduates may also  pursue advanced degrees in history in order to teach and conduct research at the college level.  History majors also continue their education in other graduate and professional programs such as journalism, law, management, and public administration.  Graduates also seek careers in business, public service, and informational and research positions.     </P>

<P>NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES PROGRAM </P>

<P>ECU offers both a BA and a minor in Native American Studies.  Native Studies is an interdisciplinary program that reﬂects an awareness of the issues which contemporary native communities and peoples confront.  By approaching the multiplicity of Indian cultures from a variety of academic perspectives, a deeper understanding of native societies past and present emerges.  It makes use of the strengths of university faculty members in history, archaeology, political science, business, nursing, legal studies, art, English, professional programs in human services, and other disciplines. </P>

<P>We also offer a BA in Native American Studies - Cultural Resource Management (CRM). CRM students learn to manage cultural resources that include heritage and the arts. Archaeology and the study of material culture is central to their work. In addition to understanding Native American history and culture, students pursuing this major will learn about tribal, federal, state, and local regulations and guidelines that impact how we manage cultural resources. </P>

<P>DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC </P>

<P>Adolf Linscheid Distinguished Teaching Professor, Walker Associate Professor Baggech Assistant Professor and Program Coordinator, Berman Instructor Garcia Lecturer Pletcher </P>

<P>The Department of Music provides a general music education foundation for all students, individual professional preparation for selected major ﬁelds within the department, and cultural enrichment for both the campus and community.  The Department of Music at East Central University is committed to the basic principle that participating in the development of a musically enlightened citizenry is the most signiﬁcant contribution it can make to society. </P>

<P>The Department of Music offers the following degree programs:  the Bachelor of Science degree with music majors in the Instrumental Concentration, the Instrumental Teacher Certiﬁcation Concentration, the Vocal Concentration, the Vocal Teacher Certiﬁcation Concentration, the Piano Concentration, and the Piano Teacher Certiﬁ cation Concentration.

Students who wish to prepare for a career in music business may complete the minor in Business Administration for Music Majors. Other minors and special endorsements in music are also available. </P>

<P>MUSIC PROGRAM </P>

<P>The curriculum has been designed to assist all participating students in reaching their maximum potential.  Toward this end, the primary objectives of the undergraduate programs are (1) to further the performance ability in at least one musical medium, (2) to provide future teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to be successful as professional music educators, (3) to allow some “semi-specialization” through courses directed toward instrumental and/or vocal education, and (4) to provide students with a wide range of educational/musical experiences which will encourage continued professional growth. </P>

<P>East Central University is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music.  The requirements for entrance and for graduation are in accordance with the published standards of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. </P>

<P>Applied Music—Individual and Class Instruction Voice, Piano, Harpsichord, Organ, Wind, String and Percussion Instruments </P>

<P>Private and class lessons:  one semester hour credit for one half-hour private lesson, or two or more half-hour class lessons, with ﬁ ve hours of practice expected per week, for a semester or equivalent time in a shorter term.  Extra fees are charged for instruction and for practice rooms (see fee schedule). </P>

<P>The course numbers are progressive by semester in each of the Applied Music areas, and include one or two credit hours.  </P>

<P>Private instruction course numbers for music majors and minors are as follows:  2201 - minor instrument (lower level), 2222 - major instrument (lower level), 3301 minor instrument (upper level), 3332 - major instrument (upper level).

<P>The course description for all private instruction is “The study of solo vocal and instrumental literature of different historical periods and styles, and of diction in English, French, German, and Italian.” </P>

<P>DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS, LAW, AND SOCIETY </P>

<P>Professor and Chair Pappas Professor Petrowsky Associate Professor and Director of the Legal Studies Program Owens Associate Professor Peaden Assistant Professor Ananga, Becerra, Draper </P>

<P>The Political Science and Legal Studies programs offer very different objectives: the BA in political science and the BS in legal studies.  Political science majors are given more of an emphasis on critical thinking and written and oral communication skills. Classes are typically discussion-based and service learning and simulations are often employed.  The legal studies program is much more applied, teaching skills that will be applicable in the law ofﬁce, such as legal business applications and knowledge of specialty law subjects. Most classes are based on lectures and focused projects. Both programs study the connection between law and politics and both programs are popular avenues to law school.  Paralegals may not provide legal services directly to the public, except as permitted by law. </P>

<P>Sociology is the scientiﬁc study of the social causes and consequences of human behavior.  An understanding of sociology is a means to an appreciation of the interaction of individuals and social groups.  The subject matter of sociology has a broad range.  It includes the study of the intimate family, as well as the hostile mob.  Crime and its causes are studied, as well as religion and its inﬂuences.  Divisions of race and social class are included, as well as the sharing of beliefs in a common culture.  Sociology ranges from the study of work to the study of sport, from the study of the individual in society to the study of the international community, from the study of the scientiﬁc method to the understanding gained by living in a primitive culture. </P>

<P>SOCIOLOGY PROGRAM </P>

<P>The East Central University Sociology Department offers a wide variety of courses in sociology as well as both a minor and a major in sociology.  The goals of the Sociology Program are: (1) to contribute to the university’s general education program by offering three key optional courses in that program: Introduction to Sociology, Social Problems, and Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, (2) to offer a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Sociology, (3) to contribute to a variety of other baccalaureate and graduate programs in the university, and (4) to contribute to the advancement of the discipline of sociology in particular and to the advancement of knowledge in general. </P>

<P>Note 1: In some instances, students having suitable proﬁ ciency in piano may substitute study in organ for part of the normal requirement in piano. </P>

<P>Note 2: Participation in a music ensemble designated by the department as appropriate for the student’s degree program is required each fall and spring semester at ECU, except for the student teaching semester of music education majors. </P>

<P>Note 3: Music education majors must successfully complete seven semesters of MUS 1000 Recital Attendance (zero hours credit, P/NP graded).  Additional information, including modiﬁcation of the requirement for transfers who were music majors at their previous institution, is given in the Music Department Handbook. </P>

<P>Note 4: Proﬁciency tests in Piano, in Theory and in Applied Music must be taken at the end of the sophomore year or its equivalent; transfer students must take these proﬁ ciency tests during their ﬁrst week of classes at ECU.

In Applied Music, a Proﬁciency Jury must be passed in order to enroll in 3000-level courses. </P>

<P>Note 5: ECU requires all music majors to complete a senior Recital.  The recital sequence requires performing and passing a preview recital at least 30 days prior to the senior recital.  These requirements may not be met during the student teaching semester, and the recital requirements cannot be fulﬁ lled through transfer credit. The student’s passing grade will indicate successful completion of the recital in the ﬁ nal semester. </P>

<P>Note 6:  Students declaring a Music major starting in the fall 2015 semester or later, must successfully complete two semesters of SFA 1000 Cultural Attendance (zero hours credit, P/NP graded). Additional information is available in the ofﬁ ce of the Director of the School of Fine Arts. </P>

<P>Certiﬁ cates </P>

<P>East Central University’s Certiﬁcation processes are overseen by The Ofﬁce of Educational Quality and Accountability.  “Pursuant to SB1797, effective July 1, 2014, the Oklahoma Commission for Teacher Preparation (OCTP) consolidated with the Ofﬁ ce of Educational Quality and Accountability (OEQA). The responsibilities of the OCTP, enacted by legislation HB1549 passed in 1995, remains the same, creating a competency-based teacher preparation system that would ensure competent and qualiﬁed teachers in every classroom. The agency assumes three primary responsibilities: the accreditation of teacher preparation programs, the assessment of teacher candidates, and the ongoing growth and development of classroom teachers across the state.” </P>

<P>14. Student Appeal </P>

<P>The University believes students should be given the opportunity to resolve issues concerning assigned grades.  Student grade appeals are not intended to interfere with the professor’s right to determine the evaluation process and to perform that evaluation.  They are intended for instances that deviate from the basic understanding of how grades are to be assigned. </P>

<P>Students wishing to appeal a grade should ﬁrst discuss the grade with the professor.  If the student still believes there are circumstances that merit an appeal of grade, the student should discuss the issue with the department chair. </P>

<P>A grade appeal must be initiated within one calendar year of the semester in which the grade was issued, (i.e., a fall semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next fall semester, a spring semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next spring semester, and a summer term grade must be initiated before the end of the next summer term). </P>

<P>Any graduate applicant or graduate student with conﬂ ict other than grade appeal, and not approved by the Graduate Dean, is entitled to submit in writing the particulars of the conﬂict to the Chair of the Graduate Committee.  The Graduate Committee will consider and make a determination. </P>

<P>General Regulations for the Program </P>

<P>I. Admission to the Master of Science in Human   Resources Degree </P>

<P>The MSHR Program seeks mature, emotionally stable individuals with a strong sense of personal responsibility and integrity. With this in mind, applicants are assessed by the program’s Graduate Admission Committee through an evaluation and weighing of all admission materials (e.g., admissions statement, interview, work experiences, recommendation forms, test scores). In addition to academic performance, measured primarily by grade point average, the Admissions Committee considers other factors that contribute to the development of a professional. Formal work experience in the human services, particularly in settings that serve public social services clients, is important. Other factors considered include: volunteer experience in the human services; life experiences and opportunities for personal growth, leadership, communication and interpersonal relationship skills; problem solving ability; the ability to work with and respect persons from diverse backgrounds; health and stamina; and motivation for graduate work and a career in administration, counseling or criminal justice. </P>

Requests for review, including any additional materials the applicant desires to submit, must be received in writing within thirty (30) days of the applicant receiving notice of denial.

The Department Chair will communicate his or her decision to the applicant-appellant, in writing, within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the appeal. </P>

<P>II.  Credit Requirements </P>

<P>The Master of Science in Human Resources degree program requires completion of at least thirty-three (33) hours (sixty hours (60) in the Clinical Rehabilitation and Clinical Mental Health Counseling option) of applicable work above the bachelor’s degree.  Courses which may apply on the master’s degree program are those courses approved for graduate study at East Central University, and appropriate graduate courses transferred from accredited institutions. </P>

<P>The Master of Science in Human Resources has sixty hours (60) of applicable work. This option does not allow transfer hours. </P>

<P>III. Planning the Program </P>

<P>The student’s study program leading to the master’s degree is developed in consultation with his or her faculty advisor and is carefully related to the student’s individual needs. Needs are identiﬁ ed through consideration of undergraduate preparation and immediate and prospective career goals. </P>

<P>IV. Thesis </P>

<P>No thesis is required in the Master of Science in Human Resources degree program. </P>

<P>V. Transfer Work </P>

<P>A maximum of nine (9) semester hours of graduate credit transferred from other accredited colleges or universities may apply, if appropriate, to the program. Only grades of “B” or above may be considered for transfer.  Because the Clinical Rehabilitation and Clinical Mental Health Counseling Program is accredited by CACREP, application of transfer credit from other universities will not be accepted unless the coursework was from an equivalent CACREP counseling program. The student who plans to transfer credit is responsible for assembling sufﬁcient supporting material to allow the department chair and graduate dean to make an adequate evaluation of the transfer credit request. </P>

<P>VI. Grade Regulations </P>

<P>The grades of A, B, C, D, P, F, N, W, AW, WF, and I may be assigned to graduate students.  The grade mark “P” indicates pass without exact grade; the grade mark “W” indicates withdrawn; the grade mark “AW” indicates administrative withdrawal; the temporary grade mark “N” indicates the semester grade was not submitted by the instructor by the appropriate deadline. Grade marks have grade point values per semester hour as follows:  A - 4, B - 3, C - 2, D - 1, F - 0, and WF - 0.  Grade marks of “P” and “W” are disregarded with respect to grade points and hours attempted in computing grade average. </P>

<P>An incomplete grade may be used at the instructor’s discretion to indicate that additional work is necessary to complete a course.  It is not a substitute for an “F”, and no student may be failing a course at the time an “I” grade is awarded.  To receive an “I” grade, the student should have satisfactorily completed a sub-stantial portion of the required course work for the semester.  “I” grades must be changed by the instructor within one year from the end of the semester in which the “I” was assigned or they will remain as a permanent “I” and not contribute to the student’s GPA.  </P>

<P>No more than six (6) semester hours of C grade may be counted in the plan of study for the Masters degree in Human Resources, and the grade point average for all graduate courses taken on the degree program must be 3.0 or above.  Departmental courses in which a passing grade is made may not be repeated. Courses in which a lower grade is made may be repeated only with advisor and/or departmental approval.  The last grade is counted with reference to graduation requirements. No additional credit is allowed for a repeated course.  Students accumulating more than six (6) semester hours of C or lower in courses will have their admission to the program reviewed. Credit with grades of D will not satisfy speciﬁc degree requirements. After appropriate review and discussion with the student, the Department may recommend to the Graduate Dean the termination of student’s admission to the degree program, place the student on departmental probation with stated criteria for reinstatement, and/or recommend remedial action which the student must complete in order to return to good standing.  The student will be notiﬁed in writing by the Graduate Dean of the above actions. </P>

<P>VIII.  Practicum/Internship </P>

<P>The student must complete an application form for practicum/ internship placement at least ﬁve weeks before the semester in which the practicum begins. The Practicum/Internship Coordinator will determine the type and appropriateness of supervision for each placement. </P>

<P>IX. Degree Options </P>

<P>A student pursuing the Master of Science in Human Resources degree  (Clinical Rehabilitation and Clinical Mental Health Counseling, Criminal Justice, or Administration) must select one (1) of the following degree options. Such selection shall be made at the time of admission to the graduate program since a change of option may result in the student having completed inapplicable work. A student desiring to change their degree option after admission to a degree program must initiate that change with the School of Graduate Studies. Students who wish to change their degree option to Clinical Rehabilitation and Clinical Mental Health Counseling must submit an updated program application with current background check to the program coordinator and complete an interview with the MSHR admission committee to determine if an offer of admission may be made. </P>

<P>X. Ethics and Professional Standards </P>

<P>MASTER OF SCIENCE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES DEGREE </P>

<P>General Purpose and Objectives </P>

<P>The Master of Science in Psychological Services degree is designed to develop professionals who can function as Licensed Professional Counselors, Licensed Behavioral Practitioners, School Psychologists, Sport Psychologists or psychological assistants in such settings as mental health centers, guidance centers, mental hospitals, alcohol and drug treatment centers, correctional institutions, individual athletes and teams, and as an independent practitioner as deﬁned by the licensure or certiﬁcation board(s) of his or her chosen program of study. The role of these professionals is to help people more fully to develop their potential for creative productivity and emotional satisfaction.  The following general objectives are intended to prepare students to ﬁll this role: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>To provide opportunities for students to acquire knowledge of the general principles involved in providing psychological services; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl> 2. </Lbl>

<LBody>To prepare students to understand research methodology and to use research reports and psychological literature; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl> 3. </Lbl>

<LBody>To prepare students to provide the psychological services of counseling, consulting, and evaluating. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students in this program are expected to have or to acquire in the early phases of training knowledge of general psychology, statistical methods, psychology of learning and its application to behavior modiﬁcation, psychology of personality, abnormal psychology, and psychological evaluation.  A course in theory and research in psychological services builds on this background to develop competencies in research and the use of psychological literature.  Courses in individual mental testing, and individual psychological evaluation,  help students to acquire the skills to evaluate people.  Courses in behavior change and clinical psychology help students to provide counseling services to people.  A course in community consultation helps students to provide consultation in their work setting and community. </P>

<P>Small classes and ample opportunities for interaction with faculty and students provide an excellent opportunity for students to develop the skills necessary to function well in their occupations.  Graduate teaching assistantships and graduate research assistantships provide ﬁnancial assistance as well as unusual opportunities for learning.  </P>
