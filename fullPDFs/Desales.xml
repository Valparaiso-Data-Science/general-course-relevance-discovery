1 GENERAL INFORMATION </Figure>

<P>MISSION </P>

<P>The mission of DeSales University is to provide men and women with quality higher education according to the philosophy of Christian humanism as developed by Saint Francis de Sales and his spiritual heirs. The University imparts knowledge about and develops talents for personal, familial, and societal living. DeSales University enriches the human community and enhances the dignity of the individual through its educational endeavors. In its work, the University fosters a vital and respectful dialogue between Roman Catholic faith and human culture. </P>

<P>PHILOSOPHY </P>

<P>For DeSales University, Christian humanism means that every aspect of human experience is capable of enlightenment by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This Gospel brings light to each dimension of personal existence (physical, intellectual, social, moral, aesthetic, and religious) and every environment domain (natural world, social institutions, cultural achievements, historical periods, and religious societies). The encounter between the Word of God and the concrete world of the human person makes a fully meaningful existence possible. DeSales University strives to teach the student what it means to be Christian in a Salesian way, what it means to embrace one’s own life, and what it means to bring this Good News to the human family. </P>

<P>DeSales University is firmly and publicly committed to the principles of Roman Catholic doctrine and morality. It also fully recognizes that the search for truth requires an atmosphere of intellectual freedom and that love demands an openness to all that is good. DeSales University distinguishes carefully between the free pursuit of truth, which it guarantees every member of the campus community, and its own commitment to the teachings of the Catholic Church. </P>

<P>HISTORY OF DE SALES UNIVERSITY </P>

<P>On January 28, 1961, His Excellency, the Most Reverend Joseph McShea, was appointed first bishop of the Diocese of Allentown by His Holiness Pope John XXIII. This new diocese was composed of the five northern counties (Berks, Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Schuylkill) of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. At the request of the new bishop, the Oblates of Saint Francis de Sales agreed to assume the responsibility for establishing a Catholic, liberal arts college in the Lehigh Valley. </P>

<P>Planning for the new college began in April, 1962; and the charter for Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales, with full power to award the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, was granted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on May 27, 1964. Classes began for freshmen in September of 1965. Allentown College was fully accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools during the 19691970 academic year. In September 1970, the College became a coeducational institution. ACCESS, the College’s undergraduate evening program for working adults, was established in the fall of 1977. In 1984, the College began offering graduate programs with the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree. Other graduate programs include: Master of Science in Management of Information Systems (MSIS) in 1988, Master of Education (M.Ed.) in 1989, Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1991, Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS) in 1995, and a Master of Arts in Criminal Justice (MACJ) in 2005. The University recently launched two doctoral programs: the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) in 2012 and the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) in 2014. In 2018 an MFA in Creative Writing and Publishing was introduced. </P>

<P>In the spring of 1988, the College opened the Bethlehem Area Campus on Bushkill Park Drive for its ACCESS program, and in the fall of 2001 moved this campus to the Lehigh Valley Industrial Park VI off the Route #33 extension. In the fall of 2001, the College opened a campus in Lansdale, Pa., for its MBA and ACCESS programs. </P>

<P>Planning for the transition from college to university status began in 1998 with a regular evaluation visit by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Universities. Formal application to become DeSales University was presented to the secretary of education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the summer of 1999. The secretary appointed an evaluation team which visited the campus in October of 1999. With receipt of their positive report, the full faculty of the institution voted unanimously to become DeSales University on January 19, 2000. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania gave final approval on March 1, 2000. The Board of Trustees of Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales voted to become DeSales University on April 13, 2000. The formal date for the name and status changes was established as January 1, 2001. </P>

<P>THE OBLATES OF ST. FRANCIS DE SALES </P>

<P>The Congregation of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales was founded to advance the Gospel through the spirit and teaching of its patron saint. A chief focus of St. Francis de Sales was the gentleness and humanity of Jesus. The gentleman saint took this from his favorite Gospel quote: “Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart” (MT 11:29). Working to “Live Jesus,” DeSales sought for himself and implored others to integrate the very person and personality of the Savior into the character of the disciple. Consequently, “Live Jesus” grew to become a popular maxim for DeSales. </P>

<P>One of the foremost Christian humanists of his day, St. Francis de Sales developed a fascinating and engaging perspective of the human person.  He said, “The person is the perfection of the universe, the mind is the perfection of the person, love is the perfection of the mind and charity is the perfection of love.” </P>

<P>This unique conjunction, interpenetration, and interaction of intellectual and affective elements sees a person in his or her totality. In the Salesian view, with its attempt to harmonize and integrate the divine and human aspects, anthropology becomes inseparable from theology. Everything truly human comes under the study, care, and concern of the person. That is why Christian humanism engenders a universal openness and awareness. </P>

<P>Mother Mary Chappuis, a nun from the Order of the Visitation founded by St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane de Chantal, prevailed upon Father Louis Brisson to form a congregation of men committed to living and transmitting this ideal of Salesian humanism. In 1876, a small band of six men, led by Father Brisson, professed their first vows as Oblates of St. Francis de Sales and began to live the religious life in Troyes, France. </P>

<P>Despite humble beginnings, the order experienced a rapid growth. Oblate communities now exist in India, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, South America, South Africa, Namibia, Switzerland, and the United States. </P>

<P>The first foundation in the United States was Salesianum School, a high school for boys in Wilmington, Del., in 1903. Although the first undertaking of the Oblates in the United States was the Christian education of youth, members devote themselves to many other varied apostolates to serve people’s needs. </P>

<P>THE SALESIAN CENTER FOR FAITH AND CULTURE </P>

<P>Begun in 2000, the Salesian Center for Faith and Culture serves DeSales University by promoting the interaction of faith and culture through academic initiatives that focus on the authentic integration of social concerns and gospel values in the tradition of Christian Humanism. </P>

<P>The activities of the Salesian Center are qualified by their attention to the legacy of St. Francis de Sales and his spiritual heirs. Programs sponsored by the Salesian Center focus on three interrelated areas of concern. </P>

<P>Educational initiatives investigate the Salesian spiritual tradition in light of various developments in the modern world. Select students may be admitted to the Faith and Reason Honors Program and/or the Ryan Leadership Institute. </P>

<P>Dialogue opportunities concern the impact of Salesian spirituality on various aspects of contemporary life. Students have the opportunity to participate in lectures, discussions, arts presentations, and other public events sponsored by the Salesian Center. Select students may win writing awards in the annual “Salesian Spirit” essay contest. </P>

<P>Partnership ventures link various sectors of the local community to the work of the University. Students have the opportunity to participate in public discussions sponsored by the Forum for Ethics in the Workplace. </P>

<P>Through these and other programs, the Salesian Center for Faith and Culture enables students and others to promote a culture of life, foster the engagement of faith and reason, form themselves as ethical leaders, and make a positive social impact in the community. </P>

<P>THE CAMPUS </P>

<P>DeSales University is situated on a beautiful 600-acre campus containing 22 buildings constructed since the founding of the University, and a number of other smaller buildings which were renovated for University use. </P>

<P>Dooling Hall, the main academic building, consists of four wings and a central area. Within the wings are housed administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, and a computer science center. The central portion contains the offices for graduate programs and a student lounge. Wills Hall is a combination residence for the Oblate faculty and a chapel. </P>

<P>Conmy Hall, Tocik Hall, Aviat Hall, Welsh Hall, DeChantal Hall, and Donahue Hall are student residences, with facilities to accommodate 800 students. The Brisson and Chappuis complexes accommodate an additional 150, some of which have been converted in 2013 as designated singles. 160 students live in University Heights, a townhouse complex constructed in 1984, 1986, and 1991. Recent renovations in 2013 have converted some of these areas into apartments that serve the needs of our growing graduate student population. Within that same year, Finnegan and Harvey, two new apartment style housing buildings, were completed and are currently housing 114 students. Another apartment style building, Guerin, was added in 2017. This area of housing is known as the University Village and primarily serves our upperclassmen population. </P>

<P>Billera Hall is an 85,000-square-foot physical education building, housing facilities for intercollegiate and intramural sports and fitness activities. It is surrounded by eight athletic fields. </P>

<P>The McShea Student Union features the Commons, a large family room for student gatherings, which includes a variety of game tables, several large flat screen televisions, and a fireplace. It is located next to Sandella’s Flatbread Café, an alternative eating venue for students. In addition, the McShea Student Union houses all of the student services offices which include the Health Center, student leadership, campus ministry, student development, residence life, counseling, international learning, and the service and social justice office. </P>

<P>The Labuda Center for the Performing Arts houses the performing and fine arts department facilities and serves as a campus convocation center. The Albert M. Iacocca Studios house the University’s TV/Film major. Campbell Hall is a classroom building with a state-of-the-art distance learning center. The 37,000-square-foot Priscilla Payne Hurd Science Center houses classrooms, laboratories, and faculty offices for the natural sciences. The University Center now includes the University Campus Store and expanded meeting space in addition to the food court, student dining, and student lounge, which were completed in the initial phase. The Daniel G. Gambet, OSFS, Center for Business and Healthcare is the University’s newest building. Featuring a gross anatomy lab, a standardized patient laboratory, and a simulated trading room with a ticker, the building houses the University’s business and healthcare programs. </P>

<P>Library. Trexler Library, dedicated to the memory of local industrialist Harry C. Trexler, is located at the center of the campus. Built in 1988, this 36,000-square-foot facility seats 300 and is designed to accommodate 160,000 volumes. </P>

<P>The current collection numbers more than 550,000 items, including 132,000 volumes and 40,000 electronic books, more than 12,000 electronic journals and newspapers, and 400,000 microfiche. The periodical collection includes 550 paper and microform subscriptions. Paper and computer indexes help students to access the collection. </P>

<P>The library staff, in consultation with the faculty, selects reference materials to meet curriculum requirements and general information needs. In the general collection, book selection is based primarily on the various majors offered at DeSales University. The library collections of the other five independent colleges of the Lehigh Valley, totaling more than one million volumes, are also available to DeSales University students through an interlibrary loan system. Students may access more than 35 million titles across Pennsylvania via the E-Z Borrow System for quick interlibrary loan. State-of-the-art computers and audiovisual equipment are available to faculty and students. The library is a member of PALINET (Pennsylvania Library Network) and is directly connected to the national bibliographic center, OCLC. </P>

<P>The library’s on-line catalog and electronic resources are available within the library and from the library’s web page— www.desales.edu/library. Extensive information concerning library services is provided at the public service desk and on the library’s web page. </P>

<P>DISTANCE EDUCATION AND INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY </P>

Most computers purchased today have wireless capability and NIC already installed. All residence halls are completely wireless. Students who want to connect their systems via RESNET should connect to the DESALES wireless network. Entertainment systems (Smart TVs, game systems, and the like) may be connected to the DeSales Entertainment network via a Help Desk request. </P>

<P>Students must electronically sign a RESNET Acceptable Use Policy statement each year to enable their connection and make it functional. </P>

<P>DE SALES UNIVERSITY SUMMARY OF THE STUDENT E-MAIL POLICY </P>

<P>DeSales University provides students with a DeSales e-mail address to enable faculty, staff, and administrators to communicate more effectively and efficiently with students. Appropriate use of e-mail is essential to the success of this mode for contacting students. </P>

<P>The following points are only part of the complete DeSales University Student E-mail Policy and are intended to inform students about the key components of e-mail usage. A copy of the full version of the DeSales University Student E-mail Policy is available on the DeSales website http://www.desales.edu/ emailpolicy. </P>

<P>Responsibility for checking e-mail regularly. E-mail is an official mechanism of communication within DeSales University. Students are expected to check their e-mail on a frequent and consistent basis (minimally once per week, preferably 3 times per week) to stay current with University-related communications. Students have the responsibility to recognize that certain communications may be time-critical. “I didn’t check my e-mail”, an error in forwarding mail, or e-mail returned to the University with “Mailbox Full” or “User Unknown” are not acceptable excuses for missing official University communications via e-mail. </P>

<P>Using other e-mail accounts. Students wishing to have e-mail redirected from their official DeSales University address to another e-mail address (e.g., @aol.com, @hotmail.com, or some other e-mail account) may do so, but at their own risk. The current Gmail system provides a mechanism that allows students to forward their official University e-mail to another e-mail address. The University will not be responsible for the handling of e-mail by outside vendors. Having e-mail redirected does not absolve a student from the responsibilities associated with official communication sent to his or her DeSales University account. </P>

<P>If a student does not have access to e-mail. Students have the right to request that the University not communicate with them by e-mail, but instead use an alternative form of communication. A student who does not own a computer or have access to the Internet might request an alternative form of communication. To request this, the student must notify the registrar’s office in writing that he or she wishes not to be communicated with by e-mail, and specify the form of communication and the location at which the student will receive that communication. Requesting and using an alternative form of communication does not absolve the student of the responsibility to frequently monitor and respond to University communications. </P>

<P>Privacy, security, and confidentiality. The University will make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity and effective operation of its electronic mail systems, but users are advised that those systems should in no way be regarded as a secure medium for the communication of sensitive or confidential information. Because of the nature and technology of electronic communication, the University can assure neither the privacy of an individual’s use of the University’s electronic mail resources nor the confidentiality of particular messages that may be created, transmitted, received, or stored thereby. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>The computer networks and e-mail servers that support </H5>

<P>members of the DeSales community at all locations are the property of the University. E-mails resident on University servers or hosted servers, whether personal or related to the business of the University, are the property of the University and not the property of the e-mail account holder, be they students, faculty, administrative staff, or consultants. Users should exercise extreme caution in using e-mail to communicate confidential or sensitive matters, and should not assume that e-mail is private and confidential. It is especially important that users are careful to send messages only to the intended recipient(s). Particular care should be taken when using the “reply” command during e-mail correspondence. </P>

<P>The University reserves the right to filter e-mail to reduce the quantity of spam. The University is not responsible for any e-mail that may not be received due to the filtering of e-mail. </P>

<P>Educational uses of e-mail. Faculty will determine how electronic forms of communication (e.g., e-mail) will be used in their classes. The DeSales University Student E-mail Policy will ensure that all students will be able to comply with e-mail-based course requirements specified by faculty. Faculty can therefore make the assumption that students’ official DeSales University e-mail accounts are being accessed, and faculty can use e-mail for their classes accordingly. </P>

<P>Student Personal E-mail Use. University student e-mail may be used for incidental personal purposes provided that, in addition to the foregoing constraints and conditions, such use does not: 1) directly or indirectly interfere with the University operation of computing facilities of e-mail services, or 2) burden the University with noticeable incremental cost. E-mail records arising from such personal use may, however, be subject to the restrictions set forth above. </P>

<P>Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges Regular Cross Registration Policy </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>A. Cross Registration Policy </H5>

<P>Full-time undergraduate degree seeking students in good academic standing who are not first semester freshmen and are enrolled at a member institution of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (Cedar Crest College, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Moravian College and Muhlenberg College), may register for up to two undergraduate courses per term or summer session with a limit of 8 cross registered courses during their academic career. The student may cross register at any one of the member institutions provided that the appropriate approvals have been obtained from the home and host institution, and provided that such course, or courses, does not produce an overload on the student’s schedule. Cross registration is permitted on a space available basis, as determined by the host institution. </P>

<P>Students are eligible to cross register under the terms of this policy only if they pay the full-time comprehensive fee of the home institution. All other students must cross register under the terms of the Supplemental Cross-Registration Policy. Normally, this program is to be used for courses that cannot be scheduled at the home institution; however, special circumstances may cause this requirement to be waived. Cross registration would enable the student to receive both course credit and grade for the course. However, the number of credits assigned to a given course is the responsibility of the home institution. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>A.1. Cross Registration For January Term, Summer Session, and Special Programs </H5>

<P>Cross registration for LVAIC students is available for the January term, summer sessions, and special programs, but the student must pay the appropriate fees charged by the host institution rather than the tuition cost of the home institution (which is the normal cross registration procedure). All billing will be handled directly by the host institution and the individual student. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>A.2 Cross Registration Limitations For Experimental And Independent Coursework </H5>

<P>Cross registration for LVAIC students is not available for the following types of instruction: independent study, tutorials, internships, practicum field experience, supervision of instructors and student teaching experiences, private music lessons, distance education, and online courses. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>B. Cross Registration Procedures </H5>

<P>When a student wishes to enroll for a course offered by one of the participating institutions, the student must review the course offerings available for cross registration and select a course to request. </P>

<P>After completing the Request for Cross Registration, the information is sent to the student’s advisor who will approve or deny the request. </P>

<P>Advisor approved course requests will be sent to the student’s home Registrar for any additional approvals. </P>

<P>If approved by the home Registrar, the information will be sent to the host Registrar for review. </P>

<P>Registration by the host school is dependent upon course availability and registration time lines. Students may not know the result of their request until the beginning of the semester. Students will be informed of the result of their request by the host Registrar. </P>

<P>At the end of the term, transcripts or certified grade reports will be forwarded automatically without charge from the Host Registrar to the Home Registrar for any cross registered students. </P>

<P>C. Cross Registration Procedures – General Considerations </P>

<P>student may take during any degree program, or the use of any course as a substitute for any requirement in a major or minor program. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students who register for courses at other LVAIC member institutions must assume responsibility for the costs and means of transportation and accept the inconvenience of different calendars. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>A student who registers for an off-campus course will be subject to the academic policies of the home institution and the requirements of the off-campus course. The Academic Dean of the home institution will handle difficulties arising out of conflicts of policy. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students ineligible for cross registration, or seeking to register for more than two courses per term, or who seek to have a prerequisite waived, must petition to do so at both the home and host institution. No ineligible student may attend class until both home and host institutions have approved the petition. The process for petitioning varies for each institution; details may be obtained at the Registrar’s Office of the appropriate institution. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<P>“…an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>(1)</Lbl>

<LBody> one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or, </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>(2)</Lbl>

<LBody> at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.” </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The Pennsylvania Department of Education (22 Pa. Code Section 31.21) states that a “semester hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty.” </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>DeSales University Credit Hour Policy </H5>

<P>The number of credits is included with each course description in the Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog. </P>

<P>DeSales University complies with the above standards for the assignment of credit hours as established by the U.S. Department of Education and by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In addition, DeSales University is in compliance with policies set forth by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, using acceptable and consistent methods for assigning credit hours to all courses and programs of study and conforming to commonly accepted practice in higher education. </P>

<P>The number of credits is included with each course description in the Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog. Information about the number of credits, meeting dates and times, classroom location, and mode of delivery is published online and made available to students prior to registration. </P>

<P>Unit of measurement </P>

<P>All DeSales University undergraduate and graduate courses are assigned credits as a unit of measurement for curricular material regardless of time frame or mode of delivery. A credit is the equivalent of one hour (50 minutes) of faceto-face classroom instruction per week for a semester of approximately 15 weeks. There is an expectation of two hours of outside study by the student for each hour of classroom instruction. </P>

<P>Outside Study Activities </P>

<P>Outside study activities may include readings, review of notes, written assignments or journals, group projects, preparation for quizzes or exams, vocal or instrumental practice, rehearsal for dramatic productions, quantitative problem solving, literature research, theatrical rehearsal, creation of lesson plans, review of films and/or dramatic productions, preparation for presentations, lab reports, preparation for clinical experiences, or other assigned work as appropriate to the student learning outcomes of the course.   </P>

<P>Academic Period and Instructional Time </P>

<P>The traditional undergraduate academic year consists of a fall and spring semester that are approximately 15 weeks in length with an additional week for final examinations. One credit is awarded for one hour (50 minutes) of classroom instruction per week for the semester of approximately 15 weeks with a minimum of 14 hours of instruction. If a course meets for three 50-minute class periods or two 75-minute class periods per week, it is said to be a three-credit course and has a minimum of 42 hours of classroom instruction. </P>

<P>The ACCESS academic schedule consists of 10 sessions throughout the calendar year. The majority of the courses run for eight weeks, but ACCESS also offers a winter minimester that runs for 3 weeks, summer sessions that run for 3 weeks and 6 weeks, and 4-5 credit courses (e.g., Natural Science courses) that run for 12-14 weeks. Courses are offered either as hybrid or completely online and meet the same number of hours as equivalent full-semester courses by requiring more frequent meetings, longer meeting times, asynchronous/ synchronous online meetings, and/or utilizing instructional equivalencies (described below under online and hybrid courses).       </P>

<P>The academic year for the DPT, MEd, and MSPAS programs consists of fall, spring, and summer sessions that are typically 14 to 16 weeks in length. The academic year for the MBA, MCJ, MSIS, MSN, and DNP programs consists of fall, winter, spring, and summer sessions. The fall, winter, and spring sessions are typically 12 weeks in length, and the summer session is 6 weeks in length. Regardless of whether the graduate programs consist of three or four sessions per year, courses meet the same number of hours as equivalent full-semester courses by requiring more frequent meetings, longer meeting times, asynchronous/synchronous online meetings, and/or utilizing instructional equivalencies. </P>

<P>Periodic Review </P>

<P>Assignment of credit hours for each course is determined by the program/major based on the amount of work required to achieve the course’s student learning outcomes. Undergraduate and graduate students are provided with a course syllabus that conforms with the DeSales’ “Credit Hour Policy.” Faculty are required to submit to Division Heads all course syllabi prior to the start of the semester/session allowing time for review and approval. Final review and approval is made by the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate courses and the dean of graduate education for graduate courses. In addition, existing courses are evaluated for compliance with federal and state regulations during each program’s five-year self-study and assessment. </P>

<P>New Course and Approvals </P>

<P>For the approval of a new course, the “Petition to Present a New Undergraduate (Graduate) Course” is completed by a faculty member and approved by the chair of the major (if applicable), department chair (if applicable), and division head, and is reviewed for compliance by the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate courses and by the dean of graduate education for graduate courses. This petition must be accompanied by a syllabus which conforms to the “Instructions for Drafting a Course Syllabus” and to the “Credit Hour Policy.” New courses that request inclusion within the core curriculum must receive additional approval from the General Education Core Curriculum Committee. </P>

<P>Below are the general guidelines for assigning credit hours to a particular method of instruction. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Face-to-Face Classroom Instruction </H5>

<P>Face-to-face courses in the undergraduate and graduate programs utilize lectures, discussions, demonstrations, or other methods of instruction. DeSales University’s traditional academic year consists of a fall and spring semester that are approximately 15 weeks in length with an additional week for final examinations. One credit is awarded for one hour (50 minutes) of classroom instruction per week for the semester with a minimum of 14 hours of instruction. </P>

<P>The table above displays the minimal amount of student activity per credit for face-to-face classroom instruction. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>Online and Hybrid Courses </H5>

<P>Through a combination of in-class contact hours and online activities, online or hybrid courses must provide the “instructional equivalent” of the number of in-class contact hours delivered in a traditional classroom setting. In the case of a fully online class, all of the instructional hours are calculated through “instructional equivalencies.” DeSales’ formal policy (Documentation of Instructional Equivalency Hours for Online and Hybrid Courses) as well as guidance for instructors (Credit Hour Instructional Equivalency Calculation for Online and Hybrid Courses) are posted for the university community on the MyDSU portal under “Policies &amp; Procedures” in the “Distance Education and Instructional Technology” folder. Online and hybrid courses have the same quality, assessment, learning outcomes, requirements, etc. as courses offered face-to-face. Templates are used for consistency of syllabi across multiple </P>

<H5>Internships </H5>

<P>Internships are supervised learning experiences that take place outside the classroom for which academic credit may be granted. Internship applications are reviewed and approved by the coordinator of experiential learning and the student’s faculty supervisor. Students with a GPA of 2.5 or above are eligible to complete a 3-credit internship for academic credit. Internship applications for more than three credits must also be approved by the student’s division head and the dean of undergraduate education. Internships are graded pass-fail.

<H5>Student Teaching </H5>

<P>The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) requires 170 hours of supervised clinical field hours prior to student teaching. Education students seeking certification complete a series of supervised, 1-credit clinical field courses that, when combined, meet the 170 hour requirement. PDE requires a 14-week in-school experience for completion of program requirements for student teaching. During the 14-week in-school experience, 12 credits are awarded for a minimum of 64 days of student teaching. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Independent Study </H5>

<P>Independent study courses permit a student to study independently and periodically with a faculty member. Independent study proposals are reviewed and approved by the faculty supervisor, the department chair (or division head), and the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate students and by the faculty supervisor, program director, and dean of graduate education for graduate students. Credit hours are assigned based on the amount of academic activity associated with the course, the faculty supervision, and the amount of outside study (defined above under outside study activities). Most independent study courses are approved for 3 credit hours. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Tutorials </H5>

<P>At times a student may wish to take a course which is listed in the undergraduate or graduate catalog but which is not scheduled to be offered in a given semester. The student may ask a full-time faculty member (usually one who has previously taught the course) if he/she is willing to offer the course tutorially. Tutorials must match the minimum instructional time and minimum outof-class student work per week assigned for face-to-face classroom instruction. Tutorial proposals are reviewed and approved by the advisor, the department chair (or division head), and the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate students and by the advisor, program director, and dean of graduate education for graduate students. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Research in Natural Science Department </H5>

<P>During research courses, students conduct research in collaboration with a faculty member who has expertise in the subject matter. In the Natural Science Department (biology, chemistry, and biochemistry-molecular biology), one credit is awarded for a minimum time commitment of 3 hours per week for at least 14 weeks. </P>

<P>THE CURRICULUM DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: </P>

<P>The minimum course load required for graduation is 40; the minimum credit hours, 120. In addition, 3 one-semester, one-credit courses in physical education are required. A course that is listed for fewer than three credit hours may not be counted as one of the 40 courses required for graduation unless the courses are part of an approved series (e.g. TR 3611/3612/3613, DA 305/306) </P>

<P>The maximum number of one-credit courses from the performing and fine arts that a student may take for credit and be applied toward the 40-course graduation requirement is 12. </P>

<P>To graduate, each student must also satisfy the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>

<P>THE UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM </P>

<P>The undergraduate curriculum consists of three components: </P>

<P>I. General Education Core </P>

<P>II. Major </P>

<P>III. Electives or Minor </P>

<P>I. GENERAL EDUCATION CORE </P>

<P>The General Education Core consists of a maximum of 16 courses (plus 3 one-credit physical education courses) and is designed to offer each student a broad appreciation for human life and learning. It is structured around four elements: </P>

<P>A. Basic Requirements: 2 courses (Composition &amp; Rhetoric 1 and 2), offered by the English faculty, that develop foundational skills: thinking, reading, writing, speaking, and research; plus 3 physical education courses: PE 100 Foundations, that explores broad concepts of total fitness, and 2 other courses that teach specific sports for life-long activity. Note: PE 100 is a graded course. </P>

<P>B. Cultural Literacy: 6 courses that develop sequentially an appreciation for human culture, especially our Western heritage, offered by the history, political science, foreign language, art, music, English, and philosophy faculty. </P>

<P>C. Modes of Thinking: 5 courses that present the processes that professionals in broad domains of intellectual activity (literature, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and social science) use as they attempt to contribute to human learning. These courses explore issues like: What information is important? What questions are asked? How are data processed? What conclusions can be reached? What are the values and limitations of the discipline? </P>

<P>D. Christian Values and Theology: 3 courses that encourage students to reflect upon the meaning and value of the Catholic faith, to live in a manner consistent with Catholic teaching and tradition, and, in light of that faith and teaching, to evaluate human action and decision, to make moral choices, and to accept responsibility for them. The Values Seminar is a capstone for the General Education Core. </P>

<P>Under the General Education Core each student must complete: </P>

<P>A. Basic Requirements: </P>

<P>(ACCESS students are exempt from the physical education requirement.) </P>

<P>B. Cultural Literacy: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>2 courses studying a foreign language other than English, numbered consecutively within the same language (e.g., SP 101, and SP 102; FR 102 and 201; etc.). This requirement may also be fulfilled in one of the following ways: 1) study abroad, 2) two world cultures courses or one world cultures course and one approved course with an international travel component when the student completes the travel that is part of the course. The dean of undergraduate education will decide whether a particular course or experience satisfies the study abroad option. Please note: taking one foreign language course and one course with an international travel component, together, does not satisfy this requirement. Similarly, taking two separate language courses (e.g., SP 101 and FR 101) does not satisfy this requirement. Students who have earned a high school (or equivalent) degree from any school whose chief instructional language is not English will be awarded six credits and will be exempt from the foreign language/world cultures requirement. </LBody>

<P>Students who take a General Education Core course that fulfills more than one General Education Core requirement may only use the course to fulfill one General Education Core requirement. For example, if a world cultures course also fulfills a Humanities III requirement, the course may only be used to fulfill one General Education Core requirement—either the world cultures requirement or the Humanities III requirement, but not both. </P>

<P>II. MAJOR </P>

<P>The major is designed to offer the student a thorough and systematic study of one subject area and to provide her/him with an integrated grasp of its content, methodology, and bibliography. The major ordinarily controls a maximum of 16 courses which may be in more than one discipline. Normally, no more than 12 of the 16 courses may be in the major discipline itself. The remaining courses taken as a part of the stipulated maximum of 16 in the major are considered major controlled electives and must be chosen from within or outside the major, at the discretion of the program’s faculty. The graduation requirements for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student’s official acceptance to the major. </P>

<P>A student must complete five courses in the major at DeSales University. [There are several professional programs, e.g., nursing, physician assistant studies, and education, that may have additional requirements coming from their individual accreditation agencies. Please check with the chair or director of such programs.] Where personnel permits, departments offering majors provide various course sequences within the major designed to accommodate the student with differing or undetermined career interests. Each major provides a recommended matrix for the courses in its program of studies. </P>

<P>DeSales University offers majors in the disciplines listed above under “Degrees.” </P>

<P>III. ELECTIVES OR MINOR </P>

<P>In fulfilling the 40-course graduation requirement, a student may select elective courses or complete a minor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Electives </H5>

<P>Electives are chosen by the student under the guidance of the academic advisor. Normally, electives provide opportunities for learning in academic areas of special interest outside the student’s major or supplement academic areas in which the student’s background is deficient. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Minor </H5>

<P>A student who wishes to complete a minor must choose one from among the subject areas listed below. The minor consists of 6 courses and will be indicated on the student’s permanent record. Students may not take courses required for the minor under the pass-fail option. A G.P.A. of 2.0 or higher is required in the 6 courses required by the minor, at least 3 of which must be completed at DeSales University. The student is responsible for scheduling his/her minor program in such a way that he/she can take the required courses as they are available during the four-year period. After degree conferral, a minor may be added within one year. Students who seek to add a minor after graduation, however, may not be eligible for additional financial aid. The choice of a minor should be made in consultation with the student’s advisor. Please note that in some cases scheduling conflicts between required major and minor courses may occur, preventing a student from completion of a minor. Tutorials and independent study courses are not considered an acceptable way of resolving such conflicts. For this reason, a student would do well to begin taking appropriate courses as early as possible in his/her collegiate career. Additional information and “Completion of a Minor” forms are available in MyDSU under the Forms and Documents heading as well as in the academic affairs office. Courses used to satisfy area of emphasis in the liberal studies program may not be applied toward a minor. </P>

<P>THE FAITH AND REASON HONORS PROGRAM </P>

<P>The Faith &amp; Reason Honors program establishes an arena for academically advanced students to explore questions and examine ways in which to integrate faith and culture. This highly selective and competitive program offers opportunities for challenging, reaching, and learning beyond the traditional curriculum. Through this program, students build strong, lasting, and meaningful relationships with senior faculty at DeSales University. </P>

<P>The four-year honors program includes three major components: Liberal Studies seminars, cultural experiences, and an Honors Thesis. </P>

<P>Liberal Studies seminars are one-credit learning experiences about fundamental questions that pervade human life, including conversations about the human person, God, the world, beauty, truth, and goodness. The seminars meet weekly and are hosted by one or more senior faculty members who select readings chosen from classical and contemporary texts that reflect a variety of academic disciplines. Students who participate in the seminars regularly and actively receive an “A” for the course and one credit for each seminar. Honors students complete six seminars, which fulfill two free elective requirements toward graduation. (Credits earned for these seminars do not fulfill any General Education requirements.) </P>

<P>Cultural experiences involve off-campus learning opportunities. Honors students are required to participate in at least one experience each semester of the program. These experiences include trips to museums, lectures, shows, historic sites, and other places of cultural interest. </P>

<P>The Honors Thesis is the culmination of the program. Under the direction of a faculty advisor, honors students research and write a 30- to 50-page paper. Students earn three credits for this work as an “independent study” course. Students present their work publicly during the annual Honors Colloquium. The best thesis each year, as judged by the Review Committee of the Salesian Center for Faith &amp; Culture, receives the annual “Faith &amp; Reason Award.” </P>

<P>Participation in the honors program is by invitation and application only. Each fall semester, invitations to apply to the program are extended to members of the Freshman class who have received presidential or trustee scholarships. Applications require a letter of intent from the student and a recommendation from a faculty member or the student’s academic advisor. Only 15 students are admitted to the program each year. </P>

<P>Honors students who complete all components of the program have their participation noted on their university transcripts and receive special recognition of their accomplishment at the commencement exercises. </P>

<P>TIME-SHORTENED DEGREES </P>

<P>There are no rigid time requirements for the DeSales University degree. It is possible for a superior student to shorten the time ordinarily required to complete the undergraduate degree by as much as one year. This can be done by taking advantage of the various credit-by-examination procedures, the overload policy, and by attending college during the summer months. </P>

<P>SECOND DEGREES </P>

<P>DeSales University will grant a second baccalaureate degree to students who have already received a baccalaureate degree from DeSales University or another accredited institution, and who wish to earn a degree in a different major field of study. </P>

<P>To be eligible for admission to this program, the student must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 from the first institution. In addition, the department chair and/or division head of the new major must accept the student into the second degree program (some departments have specific limitations, e.g., business) and approve the student’s program of study. </P>

<P>To graduate from this program, the student must satisfy the requirements of DeSales University’s General Education Core and the requirements of the academic majors, in accordance with the DeSales course-transfer policy. The student must complete at least ten three-credit courses toward the second degree at DeSales University; at least five of these courses must be in the major field of study. Graduates of DeSales University must complete a minimum of ten three-credit courses beyond the conferral date of their most recent DeSales degree. The student also must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of </P>

<P>2.0 both in the major field of study and in all courses taken at DeSales University. (Students who have graduated from DeSales University under the old curriculum will be seen as having completed the General Education Core for the purposes of this policy.) </P>

<P>ACCELERATED POST-BACCALAUREATE PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS </P>

<P>Accelerated post-baccalaureate professional programs grant professional degrees (and/or certification) in preparation for professional licensure to individuals already holding undergraduate degrees. DeSales University offers an accelerated post-baccalaureate BSN program. </P>

<P>INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM </P>

<P>Juniors and seniors whose cumulative grade point average is 2.0 or better may, if they choose, take one course per year of independent study. Each department regularly lists one 3-credit course, usually numbered 499, for independent study. </P>

<P>The student who wishes to matriculate in this course must develop an independent study project, secure a project advisor, who, for day students, must ordinarily be a full-time faculty member, and obtain the approval of the project advisor, the department chair, and/or the division head, and the dean of undergraduate education before registration for the term in which the student intends to complete the project. These approvals must be obtained on an official form available in the academic affairs office or online. Successful completion of the course will consist of fulfilling all requirements and satisfying the standard of evaluation previously agreed upon by the student and his or her project director. The course designation and number and the project title will be entered on the student’s transcript when successful completion has been certified by the project advisor. </P>

<P>TUTORIALS </P>

<P>At times a student may wish to take a course which is listed in the Undergraduate Catalog but which is not scheduled to be offered in a given semester. The student may ask a full-time faculty member (usually the one who offers the course) if he/ she is willing to offer the course tutorially. If the faculty member agrees, the student completes the Application for Tutorial form available in the academic affairs office or online, obtains the appropriate signatures, and submits the form to the registrar at the time of registration. (A tutorial differs from an independent study project because a tutorial is simply a different mode of offering an already existing course, while an independent study project requires the student and the faculty member to design a new project.) </P>

<P>ACADEMIC POLICY REGARDING INTERNSHIPS </P>

<P>Internships are elective, planned, and supervised learning experiences that take place outside the classroom, preferably at off-campus sites, for which academic credit is granted as an added dimension of the student’s academic major. The program is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors who have completed course work that, in the judgment of the faculty supervisor, is required by the nature of the internship proposal. If a student’s GPA falls below a 2.5, they are seeking more than 3 credits, or they will be put at a course overload, they will need additional signatures as designated on the application form. Students must be in good academic standing and not on academic probation to be approved for a credited internship. If their GPA falls within the 2.0-2.49 range, it is up to the discretion of the department chair/division head and the dean of undergraduate education to approve or not approve your internship for academic credit. </P>

<P>The Career Development Center staff and/or the student’s faculty supervisor can assist the student in identifying possible internship sites. Assignments and duties of the student intern should constitute a new, meaningful, and challenging experience. Menial tasks must not comprise the major part of the internship.  Questions should be referred to the coordinator of experiential learning or the student’s faculty supervisor. </P>

<P>The coordinator of experiential learning administers the program’s policies and procedures. The Career Development Center staff can provide assistance to the student in preparing a resume and in interviewing with the sponsoring employer. The faculty supervisor ensures that the internship is a worthwhile experience. This is done, in part, by carefully reviewing the student’s learning contract containing the internship’s objectives and methods for evaluating student performance. The employer supervisor at the work site develops a description of the student intern’s job responsibilities and project assignments, provides orientation and job training for the student, supervises the student’s work, and completes a final evaluation of the student’s performance. An offer letter should be provided by the employer. </P>

<P>All students must attend a mandatory orientation where they will sign an agreement with the Career Development Center that states their understanding of program requirements and will receive a packet with the required paper work and due dates. All students must complete an internship application and submit a resume and offer letter/e-mail before they can be registered by the registrars office for an internship. In addition, students must be enrolled in the college’s student accident insurance plan or have similar coverage under a family or personal accident insurance plan. All students must register for internships according to the registration deadlines posted in the Undergraduate Catalog (typically the last day for dropping and adding courses). </P>

<P>It is assumed that students are not paid for internships. In cases where salary may be provided to the student, the faculty supervisor and coordinator of experiential learning must concur that the learning objectives and nature of the internship are satisfied first rather than salary consideration. </P>

<P>Internships are ordinarily limited to three credits (one course) per semester, and a student may not register for the same internship in successive semesters. Internship proposals for more than three credits during the regular academic year must include additional complex job responsibilities and must be approved by the student’s department chair and the dean of undergraduate education. Credits awarded are based on the following number of total hours worked during the internship and all internships are graded pass-fail: </P>

<P>3 credits (1 course) - 135 to 150 hours total </P>

<P>6 credits (2 courses) - 270 to 300 hours total </P>

<P>9 credits (3 courses) - 405 to 450 hours total </P>

<P>12 credits (4 courses) - 540 to 600 hours total </P>

<P>ACCESS students may complete an internship with their current employer with the approval of the faculty supervisor, department chair/division head, and coordinator of experiential learning. In order for the internship to be approved, the following criteria must be met: </P>

<P>1) The proposed work experience must be different from </P>

<P>his/her current day-to-day job </P>

<P>2) The student must be supervised by someone other than </P>

<P>his/her current immediate supervisor </P>

<P>Traditional students taking internships during the fall or spring semester will be charged the appropriate full-time or part-time rate. Traditional students taking internships during the fall or spring that preclude them from taking courses on campus (e.g., due to location or time frame) will still be charged the appropriate traditional day rate. Traditional students taking internships in the summer will be charged the ACCESS rate. ACCESS students taking internships during the fall, spring, or summer will be charged the ACCESS rate. </P>

<P>Students must provide their own transportation to internship sites. </P>

<P>Exceptions to any of the program’s prerequisites and requirements are referred to the department chair/division head and the dean of undergraduate education for final determination and decision. Requests for exceptions must be made before the time of registration for an internship. </P>

<P>PROFESSIONAL AND PRE-PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS </P>

<P>Accounting: This program is intended to prepare students for various careers in accounting and to provide them with the academic background for professional certification. </P>

<P>Forensic Accounting: This program is intended to prepare students for a career in forensic accounting and to provide them with the academic background for certification as a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE). In addition to fulfilling requirements for the accounting degree, students on the forensic accounting track must complete AB 323 or 324, AB 463 or AC 508 (MBA), CJ </P>

<P>109. CJ 375, MG 233, and MG 475. </P>

<P>Accelerated BS/MBA in Accounting: The DeSales accelerated BS/MBA degree program permits students to earn a BS in Accounting and the MBA graduate degree in four and one-half years and simultaneously to satisfy the education requirements for CPA certification in Pennsylvania and other states. In addition to taking the ten courses required in the business undergraduate core, BS/MBA in Accounting students will take: AB 301, AB 302, AB 322, AB 451, AB 453, an undergraduate AB elective, and 11 graduate MBA courses. Students in the accelerated BS/ MBA program must maintain a 3.0 GPA to remain in the program. </P>

<P>Criminal Justice: A major objective of this program is to prepare professionals who will be capable of making meaningful contributions toward improving the criminal justice system. </P>

<P>Financial Planning: The financial planning track of the finance major is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board Registered Program, which prepares students to become certified as a CFP professional. Students in other majors or already holding a bachelor’s degree can complete the certificate in financial planning program, which is also a CFP Board Registered Program. Successful completion of either program allows students to sit for the CFP Certification Examination. </P>

<P>Nursing: The baccalaureate degree in nursing, master’s degree in nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice program, and MSN APRN certificate programs at DeSales University are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http:// www.aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation) </P>

<P>Physician Assistant: This program prepares students to become professional physician assistants who work under the direction of a physician after successful completion of the national boards. Students are capable of obtaining histories and performing physical examinations on a wide variety of patients in multiple medical settings and order and perform routine testing on those patients. Students are given didactic and clinical experiences which enable them to work in a variety of health care settings. </P>

<P>Physical Therapy: The undergraduate major in Health Science prepares students for early admission to the doctoral program in physical therapy at DeSales University. Upon completion of the 3-year graduate phase of the program, students will be eligible to sit for the National Physical Therapy Examination in order to earn a license to practice as a physical therapist. Physical therapists are healthcare professionals who diagnose and treat individuals of all ages who have medical or health-related conditions that impair their abilities to move and perform daily functional activities. Physical therapists perform a variety of examination techniques in order to develop individual plans of care to reduce pain, restore function, improve movement, and prevent disability.  Once in the graduate program, students participate in didactic and clinical experiences that prepare them to work in a wide variety of health care settings including hospitals, outpatient clinics, home health agencies, public schools, sports and fitness facilities, work settings, and long-term care. </P>

<P>Pre-Law: For admission to law school, no specific major is required. However, the law and society major has been specifically designed to meet the needs of students who hope to go to law school. In addition, the criminal justice, history, and political science majors have tracks developed to accommodate students who plan to attend law school. Students who select other majors may wish to minor in law and society. All students interested in law should contact the pre-law advisor, Dr. Jennifer Moore, in the Department of Social Sciences at the earliest possible time. </P>

<P>History majors intending to go to law school should follow the pre-law track, which has two groups of requirements: 1) the completion of 12 courses in United States, European, and comparative history; and 2) four more courses in philosophy, politics, criminal justice, and law. </P>

<P>Pre-Medicine, Pre-Dentistry, and Pre-Veterinary: Students who wish to prepare for entrance into a school of medicine or dentistry are advised to major in either biology or chemistry. Both programs provide the flexibility to include all the required and recommended courses prescribed by medical, dental, and veterinary schools. </P>

<P>Teacher Education: DeSales University offers an undergraduate program of certification for teachers of early childhood and elementary education and secondary education, which is described in detail in the education section of this catalog. The University has received program approval for teacher certification in biology, chemistry, communication, early childhood and elementary education, citizenship education, English, French, mathematics, social studies, and Spanish. Dual certification and dual-certification five year programs are available in conjunction with graduate studies in instructional technology, online instruction, special education (pre-K–eight and grades 7–12), , and TESOL (teaching English to speakers of other languages). </P>

<P>DUAL MAJOR </P>

<P>A student who wishes to major in two areas is responsible for designing a program of studies which satisfies the degree requirements for each of these majors. The appropriate department chair or division head must approve the student’s program of studies, designating one area as the official major, which determines the degree (BA or BS). The degree will be awarded only in the official major. Upon completion of all the graduation requirements of the other major, a notation will be made on the student’s permanent record. DeSales University does not guarantee that the student can complete the dual major in four years, and its completion may require additional semesters. The student who takes advantage of this option will be assigned a separate academic advisor for each major. After degree conferral, a dual major may be added within one year. Students who seek to add a dual major after graduation, however, may not be eligible for additional financial aid. </P>

<P>If either major is within the Division of Business, at least five courses used to meet the requirements of the second major must be distinct from the courses used to meet the requirements of the official major. A triple major consisting of three Division of Business majors is not permitted. </P>

<P>INTERNATIONAL STUDY (STUDY ABROAD) </P>

<P>DeSales University encourages qualified students to study abroad. Currently, the University offers the opportunity to study in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Switzerland, and Monaco. Detailed information about these and other programs are available from the Office of International Learning. Study abroad must be planned well in advance and receive the approval of the appropriate division head and the student’s academic advisor, the director of financial aid, and the director of international learning. </P>

<P>Certain regulations governing the status of foreign institutions, the acceptance of creditable courses, the relevance to a student’s objectives and major field of study, the student’s academic record, foreign language competence at least at the intermediate level, and other factors must be thoroughly explored before permission for the year, semester, or summer session is given. Study abroad opportunities during the academic year are usually open to students who have at least sophomore or junior year status, and ordinarily a 2.75 cumulative GPA overall. Students interested in study abroad must plan early, review their plans with their academic advisor and the director of international learning, and observe the deadlines published by the Office of International Learning. </P>

<P>Information about financial aid procedures is available from the director of financial aid and through the Office of International Learning. Please note that DeSales University merit-based scholarships/grants that are non-need related are not applicable to the cost of study abroad for programs not offered by DeSales University, but need-based aid is applicable. Students who study abroad for a semester but enroll in a course at the University will be assessed a tuition charge at the part-time traditional undergraduate rate per credit hour. </P>

<P>DE SALES SEMESTER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM IN ROME </P>

<P>During the fall semester of their junior or senior years, full-time DeSales University students are encouraged to study abroad in DeSales University’s program in Rome, Italy. Detailed information about this program is available from the program coordinator, Professor Elizabeth Rosa. </P>

<P>CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS </P>

<P>The programs listed below are offered as certificate programs. These are available to students who desire a systematic knowledge in one or several areas related to their current interests and plans. For complete details about the objectives and requirements of these certificate programs, students should contact the ACCESS office. </P>

<P>Business Administration </P>

<P>Financial Management </P>

<P>Financial Planning (CFP®) </P>

<P>Human Resource Management </P>

<P>Information Technology </P>

<P>Management/Leadership </P>

<P>Marketing </P>

<P>Marriage and Family </P>

<P>Philosophy </P>

<P>Public Accounting </P>

<P>Theology </P>

<P>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES </P>

<P>DeSales University does not consider extracurricular activities as a body of exercises totally distinct from the academic program, but views them rather as an integral part of the liberal education which it offers. It sees and encourages participation in extracurricular activities as an opportunity for exercise in the skills and attitudes which it endeavors to impart to the student through its academic program. Viewed in this context, extracurricular activities form an integrated and significant element in the academic program of DeSales University. Student publications and debating provide opportunities for exercise in the skill of intelligent self-expression; intramural athletics furnish occasions for the exercise of skills learned in the physical training program; social events advance the development of the student’s social personality; attendance at lectures supplements the general cultural training received; and religious activities provide the opportunity for the concrete expression of that total religious commitment which the theology program of DeSales University seeks to inspire. </P>

<P>ACADEMIC RESOURCES </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Student Advisement Program </H5>

<P>Individual attention is one of the major benefits offered by DeSales University to its students. DeSales University’s Student Advisement Program constitutes a major part of this benefit. The program’s purpose, simply stated, is to help each student as an individual in every way possible to derive maximum benefit from the educational experience here. This means the advisor counsels the student in effective methods of learning and seeks to remove any known obstacle (academic, disciplinary, psychological, personal) to the learning process by appropriate referrals. </P>

<P>Each advisee is assigned an advisor in his/her department. Students who have not declared a major are assigned to an advisor who works specifically with students in the exploratory studies program. Exploratory studies students remain with the same advisor until they declare a major. Efforts are made to provide continuity, vis., to keep the same group of advisees with the same advisor over their sophomore, junior, and senior years. </P>

<P>One of the advisor’s major responsibilities is academic programming. While the ultimate responsibility for fulfilling all course requirements belongs to the student, students should always consult their advisors for guidance in academic matters. At a minimum, advisees must meet with their advisor once per semester to discuss course registration for the following semester and to receive registration clearance. However, students are encouraged to schedule additional appointments with their advisors as needed. The student advisement program is under the supervision of the director of the academic resource center. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Academic Resource Center </H5>

<P>The Academic Resource Center (ARC) offers a wide variety of services to assist undergraduate students (traditional, ACCESS, and accelerated BSN) in achieving their academic goals.  These services include peer or professional tutoring in specific subjects, and assistance with essays and research papers via the Writing Center.  Assistance with general academic skills such as study techniques, reading comprehension, and time management is also available for traditional day students. The ARC also sponsors workshops for all students on methods of studying more effectively. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Special Services-Gateway To Success </H5>

<P>Gateway To Success (GTS) is a program designed to help underprepared students adjust to the academic rigors of university life. It provides support in areas such as academic advising, curriculum planning, goal setting, tutoring, and student development. </P>

<P>First-year students complete a summer program during which they are oriented to the campus and prepared for the University’s academic requirements. These students participate in social events, academic workshops, and career programs. Staff members also help students to emerge as campus leaders and to graduate with marketable skills. Candidates for this program are identified during the admissions process. </P>

<P>DISABILITY SERVICES </P>

<P>DeSales University is committed to full compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and all subsequent amendments, and supports the inclusion and equal access of students with disabilities. </P>

<P>Policies and procedures have been developed to provide students with as much independence as possible and to promote self-advocacy. The Disability Services Office (DSO) offers strategies and individualized sessions in effectively transitioning into the higher education environment; including executive functioning skills, time management, organization, study skills, note taking skills, and appropriate coping strategies. </P>

<P>The DSO works closely with students who self-identify in order to ensure equal access to University programs, services, and activities. Students are encouraged to submit documentation in a timely manner in order to give the DSO sufficient time for review, particularly because accommodations are not retroactive. Students will then participate in an interactive dialogue with a DSO staff member for the purpose of determining any appropriate and reasonable accommodations. The university does not provide, nor is financially responsible for personal care attendants. </P>

<P>DeSales, like all post-secondary schools, expects that students who plan to attend the University will have already acquired compensatory strategies and will be willing to be self-advocates with faculty and staff. Students with disabilities, similar to their peers without disabilities, must be qualified based on all academic and non-academic criteria for admission to the University, continued enrollment, and graduation from the University. </P>

<P>All questions, documentation, and requests concerning academic, residential, or dining accommodations should be addressed with the Disability Services Office. For more information, please contact the DSO or visit www.desales.edu/disability. </P>

<P>HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARS </P>

<P>The DeSales University High School Scholars Program enables high school students to take college courses for credit, tuition free, on the University campus. Highly talented and motivated students who are nominated by their high schools may take one day course during the regular fall and/or spring semester, on a space-available basis. This high school/university articulation program promotes communication and cooperation between basic and higher education while enriching and expanding the curriculum for students capable of completing college courses while still in high school. </P>

<P>Complete application information, including conditions and procedures, is sent to local high school guidance counselors each semester. Students are nominated by their high school guidance counselor, principal, or a screening committee designated at their school. Each participating school may nominate at most two students and two alternates per semester. </P>

<P>The chairs of the departments offering the requested courses review the applications and recommend acceptance or denial to the associate dean of academic life. A department chair may request a personal interview or telephone conversation with the student applicant. The department chair determines the student’s placement on the basis of the student’s course request, course enrollments, and the student’s background. After reviewing the student’s application and the chair’s recommendation, the associate dean of academic life will notify the student and the nominator as to his decision. DeSales University will endeavor to accommodate qualified applicants, but it cannot guarantee admission to the requested courses. Ordinarily, the student will be limited to one course per semester. </P>

<P>The student will not be charged tuition but will be responsible for the cost of textbooks, laboratory fees, and other course materials, if applicable, and transportation. Participants will be expected to adhere to the attendance policy of the course and to the University calendar. The course must be taken for a letter grade, not for pass/fail or audit. </P>

<P>HIGH SCHOOL DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM </P>

<P>The DeSales University Dual Enrollment Program enables high school students, juniors or seniors, to take college courses for credit at a reduced rate. Available courses include both online and on-campus options. An online application, eligibility criteria, course offerings, and updated costs are all available at www. desales.edu/dualenrollment. </P>

<H2>A. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS </H2>

<P>CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS </P>

<P>A freshman is a regular student who has satisfactorily completed fewer than eight courses that carry a minimum of three credit hours each. </P>

<P>A sophomore is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least eight courses (3 or more credit hours each) but fewer than 18 courses and 54 credits. </P>

<P>A junior is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least 18 courses (3 or more credit hours each) but fewer than 29 courses and 87 credits. </P>

<P>A senior is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least 29 courses (3 or more credit hours each) and at least 87 credits. </P>

<P>A regular student is one who is matriculated in a degree program on either a full-time or part-time basis. </P>

<P>A full-time student is one who carries 12 or more credit hours in any given semester. </P>

<P>A part-time student is one who carries fewer than 12 credit hours in any given semester. </P>

<P>A special student is one who, whether full-time or part-time, is provisionally accepted and has previously attended college. A special student in the day program who desires to follow a degree program may be given a maximum of two semesters to earn status as an accepted student. The amount of time granted will be determined by the Admissions Committee at the time of the student’s admission as a special student. A special student who fulfills the stipulations in his/her letter will be notified by the director of admissions that his/her status has been changed to accepted. If the student fails to achieve the minimum requirements outlined in the Admissions Special Student letter, the student will not be permitted to continue at the University. Once the student has been admitted as a regular student, the credits earned as a special student may be applied retroactively to the degree program. </P>

<P>A provisional student is one who is taking courses full-time at the University but is provisionally accepted, and has had no previous college experience. Provisional students become accepted students after the successful completion of two semesters at the University, fulfilling the minimum requirements outlined in the Provisional Student letter. If these provisions are met, the student is notified by the director of admissions that his/ her status has been changed to accepted, and the courses already taken will be applied to the degree. If the student fails to achieve the minimum requirements after two semesters, the student will not be permitted to continue at the University. </P>

<P>A Continuing Education or ACCESS student has a different primary role from that of the traditional student. The circumstances that surround the life of the ACCESS student ordinarily demand involvement in primary life roles other than education and necessarily divide the student’s energies. Usually, ACCESS students are beyond the traditional college age and, therefore, have greater independence and more responsibilities outside of education than the traditional student. ACCESS students typically are homemakers, workers, or retirees, and do not live in the residence halls. They normally restrict their use of college services to the ACCESS Office, registrar’s office, treasurer’s office, classrooms, library, computer center, snack bar, and bookstore. Participation in the LVAIC cross-registration program is specified in the section entitled Interinstitutional Cooperation. Once students are accepted into ACCESS, they are ordinarily not permitted to take courses at other colleges for transfer purposes except as noted in the policy on Supplemental LVAIC Cross-Registration or unless special circumstances are noted and approved in writing by the assistant dean of lifelong learning. However, courses from other colleges can be transferred into ACCESS at the time of admission providing the courses meet DeSales University criteria. The right to classify students (e.g., as regular day, special, or ACCESS) is reserved to DeSales University. Day students whose status has changed and who desire to be reclassified as Continuing Education or ACCESS students must submit a written request to the dean of undergraduate education. This request must usually be documented with a letter from the student’s employer specifying that the student is employed full-time and receives a full benefit package. A reclassification is not retroactive but takes effect at the beginning of the next semester or session that follows the letter of reclassification. Those who are classified as Continuing Education or ACCESS students qualify for the ACCESS tuition rate. </P>

<P>D+/D Indicates a limited grasp of course content and evidence of minimal achievement in critical, independent, and creative thought. </P>

<P>F indicates an insufficient grasp of course content with evidence of an unacceptably low achievement in critical, independent, and creative thought. </P>

<P>FA Failure because of excessive absence. (See Attendance Policy below.) </P>

<P>I Incomplete: The mark of an Incomplete is given only in instances where the student is near the end of the semester/session and through no fault of his or her own is unable to complete course requirements. </P>

<P>Traditional Day Program: The maximum time limit for the make-up of an Incomplete is four months from the last day of the semester in which the Incomplete was given; otherwise, unless an extension of this limit is granted in writing by the Dean of Undergraduate Education, the grade becomes an “F.” The last day of the semester is specified in the academic semester calendar. </P>

<P>ACCESS Program: The maximum time for the make-up of an Incomplete is eight weeks from the end of the previous session/semester in which the Incomplete was given; otherwise, unless an extension of this limit is granted in writing by the assistant dean of lifelong learning, the grade becomes an “F.” The last day of the semester is specified in the ACCESS calendar. </P>

<P>Incompletes as Pre-Requisites. An unresolved incomplete course that carries over into the subsequent academic term may prevent a student from beginning another course(s) for which the incomplete is a pre-requisite. </P>

<P>AU Audit (no credit) PO Pass on Pass-Fail option. (See The Pass-Fail Option </P>

<P>below) FO Failure on Pass-Fail option P Satisfactory W Official withdrawal WP Official withdrawal, passing at time of withdrawal WF Official withdrawal, failing at time of withdrawal </P>

<P>GRADE CHANGE </P>

<P>Traditional Day Program: The maximum time limit to change a grade (other than an Incomplete) is six months from the last day of the semester in which the grade was given. The last day of the semester is specified in the academic semester calendar. </P>

<P>ACCESS Program: The maximum time limit to change a grade (other than an Incomplete) is six months from the end date of the previous session/semester in which the grade was given. Specific dates are listed in the ACCESS calendar. </P>

<P>THE PASS-FAIL OPTION </P>

<P>Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take courses under the pass-fail option under the following conditions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>This option may be used for only one course per semester taken as a free elective, or for an internship. ACCESS sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take free elective courses under the pass-fail option. For ACCESS students, this option may be used for only one course per semester </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>The pass-fail option requires the approval of the student’s academic advisor and of the course instructor (except for internships, as stated below). </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Neither mark, PO (pass) or FO (fail), is computed in the student’s grade point average. The mark of PO indicates that the student receives full credit for the course toward graduation; the mark of FO indicates that he or she has failed the course and must repeat it, or an equivalent, under the usual </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>procedures. </P>

<P>4. Students may not take any courses required for a minor under the pass-fail option. A student may switch from pass-fail to letter grade (or </P>

<P>from letter grade to pass-fail) within one month of the first day of a given term with the permission of the instructor, the academic advisor, and the dean of undergraduate education. For courses in ACCESS sessions, deadlines for changing from credit to pass-fail (or pass-fail to credit) are indicated on the ACCESS calendar. Students taking these courses must adhere to the deadlines. </P>

<P>AUDITING </P>

<P>An auditor is permitted to attend lectures and, with the permission of the instructor, to take part in class discussions. The auditing student does not, however, take examinations, receive grades, or earn credits. For full-time students, there is no additional tuition for auditing a course. For part-time students, the tuition is approximately one-half that charged per credit hour (applicable course fee will be charged at approximately half the normal fee). A course audited may not be used for credit or repeated for credit unless approved in writing by the associate dean of academic life. The approval of the instructor in the course to be audited and of the student’s academic advisor must be secured for a student to audit any course. The instructor may request of the associate dean of academic life that an auditor be officially withdrawn from the course whenever it is clear that the student is not profiting from the course or that the auditor’s presence in the class is interfering materially with the learning process of the other students. A student may switch from audit to credit (or from credit to audit) within one month of the first class day of a given term with the permission of the instructor and the academic advisor. For courses in ACCESS sessions, deadlines for changing from credit to audit (or audit to credit) are indicated on the ACCESS calendar. Students taking these courses must adhere to the deadlines. </P>

<P>ATTENDANCE POLICY </P>

<P>Students are expected to attend classes regularly. If absences do occur (for whatever reason), it is the student’s responsibility to make up whatever work has been missed. Instructors are under no obligation to make special arrangements for students who are absent. Freshmen are limited to twice as many absences as credits are given for a particular course. An absence on class days preceding and following a holiday is counted as a double absence. In cases where classes meet twice per week for 75 minutes each, the first absence shall be counted as a single absence, the second as a double absence. If the class meets once per week for a three-hour period, a single absence is counted as three absences. ACCESS students should also refer to the attendance policy in Section 6 below. </P>

<P>Upperclassmen who are on academic probation automatically become subject to the attendance regulation for freshmen. Freshmen and upperclassmen on academic probation who are absent more than twice the number of credit hours in any subject in one semester may be barred from examinations and may forfeit credit in that subject at the discretion of the instructor. </P>

<P>Regular class attendance for sophomores, juniors, and seniors is encouraged, but not compulsory except as noted below. They are, of course, responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the courses they take. DeSales University presumes that upperclassmen will be mature and responsible enough to understand that voluntary regular attendance at classes is necessary if course requirements are to be fulfilled adequately. </P>

<P>Permission to make up missed examinations or laboratory exercises may be given at the discretion of the instructor. Students who miss an announced quiz or examination may be given an “F” for that quiz or examination at the discretion of the instructor. Faculty may stipulate, with the approval of their division head, their own absence policy for courses subscribed by upperclassmen. Faculty who set forth such a policy must publish it in writing to all the students whom it affects at the beginning of the course to which it applies. No such policy, however, may be more restrictive than that which is applicable to freshmen. An instructor may ask a student to justify excessive absences. Permission to make up laboratory assignments, studios, quizzes, announced tests, or examinations may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. </P>

<P>GRADE REPORTS </P>

<P>Instructors submit a progress report for each student to the registrar’s office in the middle of each semester. Final reports are submitted at the end of a semester, and these final grades become part of a student’s permanent record. </P>

<P>Midterm grades are issued only to traditional students and are not part of the student’s permanent record. Final grade reports are issued to all traditional day students and ACCESS students on the dates indicated on the official Academic Semester Calendar. Final grades become part of a student’s permanent record. Grade reports are posted on student WebAdvisor accounts and are not mailed. However, if a student wants a hard copy grade report mailed to his/her permanent address, the student must click the “Mail Grade Report Request” link under “Academic Profile” WebAdvisor by the drop/add deadline each semester. </P>

<P>GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA) </P>

<P>The student is required to maintain a specific grade point average to be in acceptable academic standing, to maintain financial aid eligibility, and to graduate. The grade point average is calculated in the following way: </P>

<P>The quality points per course are determined by multiplying the number of credit hours (1, 2, 3, etc.) by the number of quality points assigned to the grade received (e.g., A = 4.0 quality points). The sum of the quality points received for all courses is then divided by the number of credit hours attempted. </P>

<P>Quality points per course = credit hours multiplied by quality points. </P>

<P>Grade Point Average = sum of the quality points of all courses divided by the number of credit hours attempted. </P>

<P>Only courses for which a letter grade is given are computed into the grade point average. Only the higher grade is counted for a repeated course. Courses accepted in transfer are awarded credits not grades or quality points. </P>

<P>DEAN’S LIST </P>

<P>The Dean’s List is published each semester. To be eligible for this list, a day or ACCESS-by-day student must have taken no fewer than 12 credit hours (excluding pass/fail and audited courses) and attained a grade point average of 3.25 or better during the semester in question. A student with a grade of Incomplete for a given semester is not eligible for the Dean’s List for that semester until the Incomplete has been removed. Special students are not eligible for Dean’s List. </P>

<P>ACCESS evening students are recognized on an ACCESS Dean’s List when they have earned 9 credit hours (excluding pass/fail and audited courses) and attained a grade point average of 3.25 in fall, spring, and summer semesters. </P>

<P>COMMENCEMENT </P>

<P>Students must apply for graduation via WebAdvisor by the deadline date indicated on the official Academic Semester Calendar. All transfer work must appear on an official transcript and be received in the Registrar’s Office by the deadline for final grades as indicated on the official Academic Semester Calendar.  All students must pay the graduation processing fee and successfully complete all degree requirements to be eligible for graduation. There are three opportunities to graduate each year: January, May, and September. Commencement ceremonies are held only during May. </P>

<P>Students who lack a maximum of two (2) three-credit or more courses to fulfill their degree requirements may attend baccalaureate, march at commencement, and receive a handshake (but not a diploma) from the President during commencement. The student must apply for this privilege no later than the Tuesday before commencement. The University will not initiate the contact. The Registrar will verify the graduation requirements that have not been met. The request must be approved by the Division Head. A graduation fee must be paid upon completing the application for graduation. A student may choose to participate in an additional commencement ceremony. No student may march more than twice for an undergraduate degree. </P>

<P>COMMENCEMENT HONORS </P>

<P>DeSales University awards commencement honors for outstanding academic achievement as follows: </P>

<P>Cum laude: for a cumulative GPA of 3.25 to 3.49. </P>

<P>Magna cum laude: for a cumulative GPA of 3.50 to 3.74. </P>

<P>Summa cum laude: for a cumulative GPA of 3.75 to 4.0. </P>

<P>HONORARY SOCIETIES </P>

<P>In 1971, DeSales University was given approval to establish a chapter (Delta Delta) of Delta Epsilon Sigma, a national scholastic honor society for students, faculty, and alumni of Catholic colleges and universities. </P>

<P>Other honorary societies at DeSales University include Alpha Sigma Lambda (continuing education), Chi Tau Epsilon (dance), Delta Mu Delta (business), Kappa Delta Pi (education), Kappa Mu Epsilon (mathematics), Phi Alpha Theta (history), Pi Sigma Alpha (political science), Psi Chi (psychology), Sigma Theta Tau (Mu Omicron Chapter) (nursing), Sigma Tau Delta (English), and Theta Alpha Kappa (theology). </P>

<P>ACCEPTABLE ACADEMIC STANDING </P>

<P>Students are said to be in acceptable academic standing if they earn the minimum applicable cumulative grade point average listed below: </P>

<P>For 4 or more courses and 12 credit hours attempted, the </P>

<P>minimum is 1.50 </P>

<P>Students with fewer than 8 courses and fewer than 24 </P>

<P>credit hours whose GPA is under 1.5 will receive an aca</P>

<P>demic warning. Students with a GPA below 1.0 will be </P>

<P>placed on academic probation (see Academic Probation </P>

<P>for Traditional Day Students below). </P>

<P>For 8 or more courses and 24 credit hours attempted, the </P>

<P>minimum is 1.60. </P>

<P>For 16 or more courses and 48 credit hours attempted, the </P>

<P>minimum is 1.80. </P>

<P>For 21 or more courses and 63 credit hours attempted, the </P>

<P>minimum is 2.00. </P>

<P>In the case of transfer students, the number of courses and credit hours transferred will be added to the number of courses and credit hours attempted at DeSales University to determine the applicable minimum cumulative grade point average. </P>

<P>All students are expected to achieve acceptable academic standing. Students who fail to achieve acceptable academic standing have their grade reports and transcripts stamped “Academic Probation” at the end of the fall and/or spring semesters. ACCESS students who fail to achieve acceptable academic standing have their grade reports and transcripts stamped “Academic Probation” at the end of the fall or spring semester. Students who fail to achieve acceptable standing for two consecutive semesters are subject to review by the Academic Regulations Committee. </P>

<P>ACADEMIC PROBATION FOR TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS </P>

<P>Academic probation constitutes a formal warning to students that they are no longer in acceptable academic standing because their academic work has fallen below the standards set forth above or because they have received a grade point average below 1.00 in their last semester (fall or spring). Students who have either fallen below the standards set forth above for two consecutive semesters or have received a grade point average below 1.00 for one semester are liable for dismissal from the University. These students must appear before the Academic Regulations Committee, convince the committee that they would benefit from another semester at the University, and be approved for return by the dean of undergraduate education to continue their studies. Students who have either fallen below the standards set forth above for one semester or have been permitted to return to the University as a result of an appeal to the Academic Regulations Committee are given one additional probationary semester to achieve acceptable academic standing. If they fail to accomplish this, they are liable for dismissal. During this additional semester they are on academic probation. Probationary status for a completed fall or spring semester cannot be revoked or changed by subsequently using summer or winter coursework to alter a student’s GPA. Students on academic probation are subject to the following regulations: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students on academic probation are not eligible to participate on a DeSales University intercollegiate sports team. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students will be strongly encouraged to reduce their course load to four courses during any probationary period. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students on academic probation are strongly encouraged to consult with their academic advisor on a monthly basis during any period of probation. Failure to consult with the advisor will be a major criterion for determining grounds for dismissal. Advisors will review students’ academic progress and at the same time provide assistance in academic or related matters to help students return to acceptable academic standing. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Probationary students will be restored to good academic standing if, at the end of the probationary semester or next summer session, they meet the standards indicated above. Such students may also take Summer Session courses at DeSales University and be restored to acceptable academic standing before the probationary semester begins if they meet the same standards. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>If at the end of one probationary semester students have not achieved acceptable academic standing, but, in the opinion of the Academic Regulation Committee, they have a reason</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>able chance of attaining acceptable academic standing, one additional probationary semester will be allowed. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students who have received a warning of academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be liable to dismissal. </LBody>

<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>Upperclassmen who are on academic probation are subject to the same class attendance policy as freshmen. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>ACADEMIC PROBATION FOR ACCESS STUDENTS </P>

<P>All ACCESS students are expected to achieve acceptable academic standing as defined above. ACCESS students who fail to achieve acceptable academic standing have their grade reports and transcripts stamped “Academic Probation” at the end of the fall and/or spring semesters. Students who have received a warning of academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be liable to dismissal. </P>

<P>OVERLOAD </P>

<P>An overload of one course (of three or more credits) per semester may be permitted a superior student subject to the approval of his or her academic advisor. (For the purposes of this policy, three 1-credit courses taken during a semester will be considered an overload unless one of these is a P.E. course.) A “superior student” in this context is ordinarily defined as one who has achieved a grade point average of 3.0 or better in the work of the semester preceding that in which the student seeks the overload. A student who achieves a cumulative GPA of 3.25 may be permitted an overload of two courses per semester subject to the approval of the advisor. </P>

<P>COURSE WITHDRAWAL POLICY </P>

<P>A student may drop any course during the first week of each semester. In the event of such a drop, the course is not listed on his or her permanent record. Subsequent withdrawal (withdrawal with permission) requires the approval of the registrar’s office for traditional day students, or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students. The last day for withdrawal with permission is the date published in the Academic Semester Calendar, which appears at the end of the Undergraduate Catalog. The last date for dropping or adding courses is also published in the Academic Semester Calendar. </P>

<P>If a student withdraws with permission, he/she will be given a grade of either W, WP or WF, at the instructor’s discretion. The grade given in such instances will become part of the student’s permanent record but will not be used in the computation of his or her grade point average. Withdrawal after the course withdrawal deadline results in a failure (F). </P>

<P>By withdrawing from a course, a student may put himself/ herself in jeopardy of losing financial aid or of not graduating on time. If withdrawing will result in a total course load of fewer than 12 credits or if the student has withdrawn from courses in the past, then it is strongly recommended that the student speak with a staff member in the financial aid office before submitting a withdrawal form. The student may also want to speak with his/her advisor about summer courses or overloading to graduate on time. A student is not officially withdrawn from a course until the student has submitted the signed Approval Form to the registrar’s office. </P>

<P>REPEAT COURSE POLICY </P>

<P>1. Repeat of Failures </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a.</Lbl>

<LBody> If a student fails a course and then repeats it with a passing grade (excluding pass/fail grades), both the original failure and the repeated grade appear on the transcript but only the higher grade is used in the calculation of the GPA. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b.</Lbl>

<LBody> If a student fails a course which was failed before, only one failure is calculated on the transcript. Ordinarily a student may repeat a course only once, but in case a student twice fails a course required for graduation, the student may petition the advisor and the dean of undergraduate education to be allowed to take the course a third time. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Repeat of a course in which a “C-,” “D” or “D+” was earned. Any course in which a “C-,” “D” or “D+” was earned may be repeated once provided the student has permission of the academic advisor. Both grades will be recorded on the transcript but only the higher grade will be used in the calculation of the GPA. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>A course in which a grade higher than a “C-” was earned may not be repeated (except in 4 below). </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>All nursing students are required to achieve a grade of C+ or higher in all nursing courses. Any nursing student who receives less than a C+ may repeat that nursing course once. A nursing student can repeat a total of one (1) nursing course throughout the BSN curriculum. All nursing courses must be repeated at DeSales University. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Grades earned in repeat courses completed at Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg and Lehigh through the LVAIC cross-registration policy may replace the previous grade in the calculation of GPA, though both grades will appear on the transcript. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>MAKE-UP OF FAILURES </P>

<P>Failures of required courses must be made up by repeating the course with a passing grade at DeSales University or with a minimum grade of C- at another institution. Prior approval to take any course for transfer credit at another institution must be obtained from the associate dean of academic life, in accordance with the transfer course approval policy directly below. Grades earned in repeat courses completed at Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg and Lehigh through the LVAIC cross-registration policy may replace the previous grade in the calculation of GPA, though both grades will appear on the transcript. For courses repeated elsewhere, the transfer grade will not be computed in the student’s GPA. DeSales University will not transfer course work completed at any institution unless the grade earned is at least a C-. </P>

<P>Make-up of Failures Received in Senior Year: An instructor may permit a student who has received a failure for a course taken in either semester of the senior year to take a re-examination in that course. Such re-examination must be completed no later than one week before commencement. </P>

<P>TRANSFER COURSE APPROVAL </P>

<P>Prior approval for all transfer courses completed elsewhere must be secured from the associate dean of academic life if the student wishes to transfer the work to his/her program at DeSales, using the form available in the academic affairs office or via MyDSU. The approval column must be signed by a department chair or division head only in cases where a course is required for the major. The student completes this form, secures departmental or division signatures where applicable, and presents it for approval to the associate dean of academic life with a catalog description of the course to be taken. Individual courses will be evaluated in accordance with the undergraduate transfer policy, which can be found in Section 4 below. This procedure need not be followed for courses taken at DeSales University. </P>

<P>At the conclusion of the course, the student must request that an official transcript be sent from the other college or university to the DeSales registrar’s office. Transfer credit is granted only for courses in which the student earned a grade of C- or better. The DeSales registrar’s office validates the approval transfer of credit. Transfer of grades is allowed only if a student cross-registers at one of the LVAIC institutions (Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg, and Lehigh). For classes at those institutions, a student must complete a cross-registration form, available at the registrar’s office. </P>

<P>CHANGE OF MAJOR </P>

<P>The change of major is a formal procedure. The student should obtain the signature of his/her present academic advisor and then take this form to the registrar’s office. If the student plans to follow a specific track or concentration in the new major, the track or concentration must be listed. The registrar’s office will circulate the form to the department chair or division head of the new major for his/her approval. The department chair or division head sends the form to the registrar’s office. The student will receive a confirmation of the change of major via e-mail from the Academic Resource Center (ARC). The graduation requirements for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student’s official acceptance to the major. </P>

<P>CREDIT BY EXAMINATION </P>

<P>Full-time and part-time undergraduate students who have acquired substantial knowledge in certain subject areas may apply for permission to verify this knowledge by examination, and consequently receive credit. Credit by examination may be earned for any course unless specifically excluded by the offering department (e.g., Education 101: Academic Literacy and Strategies; English 100: An Introduction to Academic Writing; Mathematics 107: Mathematics for Teachers I: MOT/ Mathematics, Mathematics 109: Survey of Mathematics, Mathematics 110: Finite Mathematics, and Mathematics 111: Probability and Statistics; and the 101-102 level of a foreign language). Students should check with individual departments and/or divisions concerning other courses not open to credit by examination. An examination is always required, but other forms of evaluation may also be required by a department and/or division, e.g., written, laboratory, studio, or other type of evidence as is normally required by students who are regularly enrolled in the course. </P>

<P>Interested students may obtain from the department and/ or division titles of books normally listed in the course syllabus or other information as to course content. Students who believe they have the necessary knowledge, preparation, or background to establish credit by examination shall make application to the appropriate department chair and/or division head no later than the end of the third week of the term. If, in the opinion of the appropriate department chair and/or division head, the student has a reasonable chance of establishing credit, the student, by no later than the close of the term, shall arrange for the examination together with satisfactory completion of all course assignments and requirements demanded by the department. The nature of the examination given shall be entirely the decision of the department chair and/or division head in consultation with members of the department. </P>

<P>No course in which the student has at any time previously been registered for either credit, auditing, or enrichment purposes may be challenged under this program. A student attempting credit by examination shall not be entitled to formal instruction in the subject matter of the course. Ordinarily, a student may attempt only one challenge examination per semester. </P>

<P>Before the examination the student will choose one of two methods of evaluation: </P>

<P>1. The student may request that the examination be assigned a specific letter grade. In this case the student may accept or decline the grade made. If the student accepts, the grade will be placed on the student’s permanent record. If the student declines, the grade will not be recorded, but the student will forfeit any further credit by examination opportunity in the course and receive no credit. </P>

<P>2. The examination may be evaluated as Pass or Fail and recorded on the permanent record if passed. Failures will not be recorded on the student’s permanent record, but the student will forfeit any further credit by examination opportunity in the course and receive no credit. A $75 administrative fee is required of all full-time tradi</P>

<P>tional students. All other students, including ACCESS students, are required to pay 30% of the tuition to sit for the exam. </P>

<P>THE COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) </P>

<P>DeSales University offers a student the possibility of receiving credit by examination through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). A new or matriculated student may receive up to 75 credits (25 courses) for demonstrating college-level competency on these exams developed by the Educational Testing Service. Credits earned through CLEP are considered transfer credits (See Transfer Policy). By recognizing college-level achievement learned through employment experiences, purposeful private study, military-industrial-business training, or advanced work in high school, this program gives the student an opportunity to reduce the cost of a degree at DeSales University in terms of time and money. DeSales University has been designated as a CLEP Testing Center. The exams are administered at the Bethlehem Area Campus. CLEP examinations are computer-based and students obtain their scores immediately. Only scores sent directly from CLEP to DeSales University are considered official and will be accepted. </P>

<P>The CLEP examinations are of two types, the General Examinations and the Subject Examinations. Both types measure the knowledge and understanding of factual information, as well as the ability to see relationships and apply basic principles to new situations. These examinations are based on typical college courses offered across the country. </P>

<P>CLEP General Examinations. The five CLEP General Examinations measure material often covered in the first two years of college as part of a general liberal arts requirement. The examinations in humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and history are 90-minute multiple choice tests. It is important to realize that the CLEP General Examinations are analogous to end-of-the-year exams and require more than a cursory knowledge of the subject area. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>A student is eligible to take any or all of the General Examinations if he or she has not taken or transferred more than one course in the specific areas covered by the exam or exams. </LBody>

<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>If the minimum acceptable score is received on a General </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Examination, the student will receive six credits. These </P>

<P>cable. </P>

<P>CLEP Subject Examinations: The CLEP Subject Examinations measure the achievement of principles, concepts, and knowledge from specific college courses. All of the Subject Examinations are 90-minute multiple choice tests. Depending on the particular test and the score obtained, a student may earn credit for one or two courses. </P>

<L>
<LI>

<LBody>A student must have the permission of his or her department chair and/or division head to test out of major requirements. CLEP Examinations may be repeated three months after the </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>first administration. No CLEP Examination may be taken more than twice. Students who are interested in the CLEP Examinations should inquire at the ACCESS Office. </P>

<P>ADVANCED PLACEMENT </P>

<P>Students seeking advanced placement must take the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examination(s) in the subject(s) involved. Only the results of the first administration of each examination can be considered as a basis for granting credit, i.e., students may not retake exams until they achieve a satisfactory score. In addition, all examination results to be considered for advanced placement and/or credit are to be submitted before the applicant’s matriculation in DeSales University. Only scores sent directly to DeSales University from the College Board are considered official and will be accepted. </P>

<P>Students who achieve scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the Advanced Placement Economics: Macroeconomics Examination will receive 3 credits in place of EC 209; and those students who achieve scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the Economics: Microeconomics Examination will receive 3 credits in place of EC 210. </P>

<P>DeSales University abides by the following policy with regard to the Advanced Placement Examinations in English Language and Composition and Literature and Composition: a score 1, 2, or 3, no advanced placement or credit; a score of 4, the student is awarded 3 credits for EN 103 and is exempt from that course; a score of 5, the student is awarded 6 credits for EN 103 and EN 104 and is exempt from both courses. </P>

<P>Entering students who achieve a score of 3 on the World Language Advanced Placement Examination (e.g., French or Spanish) will receive 3 credits for 201 (Intermediate, one semester); they will be required to take one additional language course. </P>

<P>Students who are not on probation and who must or wish to interrupt their education may apply to the associate dean of academic life or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students for a leave of absence. The application should contain the reasons for requesting the leave of absence and an estimate of its duration, usually not to exceed one year. Ordinarily, leaves are not approved after the withdrawal deadline. Moreover, students must fulfill conditions a, b, and c under No. 1 Honorable Withdrawal above. Students granted such a leave may return to DeSales University without further formal action by the Admissions Committee but must submit a written request for readmission to the associate dean of academic life no later than one month before the beginning of the term for which readmission is sought. However, if the authorized period for the leave of absence has expired without an approved request to extend the leave, the student must reapply for admission through the admissions office. </P>

<P>Given that the last date of attendance before a leave may impact a student’s financial responsibilities, it is recommended that a student interested in a leave speak directly with the Bursar’s Office and/or Financial Aid Office for additional information about the implications for their tuition and financial aid. Questions about housing should be addressed to the residence life office. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>4. “Stop Out” Policy </H5>

<P>Day or ACCESS students who find it especially profitable or economically necessary to “stop out” for work, travel or other experience will be permitted to do so, at the discretion of the dean of undergraduate education without loss of credit or standing (as described in Leave of Absence above). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>5. Academic Dismissal </H5>

<P>DeSales University reserves the right to dismiss a student for academic reasons whenever there is clear evidence that the student is no longer deriving benefit from its educational program. A student is always liable to dismissal: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>If the student has received the warning of academic probation for two consecutive semesters; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>If the student achieves a grade point average of less than </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>1.00 in any semester of any year, regardless of whether or not his or her cumulative grade point average is thereby brought below the minimum non-probationary standard. A list of students “liable to dismissal” is presented by the </P>

<P>dean of undergraduate education or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students to the Committee on Academic Regulations at the end of each semester. The decision to dismiss rests with this committee, subject to the approval of the pro-vost/vice president for academic affairs. The words “Academic Dismissal” appear on the official transcript of a student who is dismissed for academic reasons. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>6. Reinstatement </H5>

<P>Students who are required to withdraw for academic reasons are ordinarily not eligible for reinstatement until they have successfully completed 8 courses (24 credits) at an accredited institution of higher education. Reinstatement is not automatic; rather students must reapply to the college and submit all required application documents. Students will be evaluated by the Admissions Committee to determine if the student has met the qualifications to be reinstated at the institution. If readmitted, students may request one semester of “academic bankruptcy.” </P>

<P>Before the student is reinstated to the University, the student’s bursar account will be checked. If an outstanding balance exists, the student must clear the account before being permitted to return. </P>

<P>Before the student is reinstated to the University, the student’s disciplinary record will be checked. Any violations of the student code of conduct will be taken into consideration as part of the admission’s decision. </P>

<P>Financial aid eligibility will be determined based on demonstration of need, filing by the deadlines, and availability of funds. Additionally, students must meet financial aid satisfactory academic progress standards to be eligible for financial aid. For more information regarding academic progress, refer to section 4-A “Financial Aid” of this catalog. </P>

<P>7. Suspension and Expulsion </P>

<P>Occasionally students are separated from the University for non-academic reasons. Usually the letter of suspension or expulsion clearly states the conditions of the action taken by the University and the possibilities for further association with the University. Please consult the Student Handbook for a fuller explanation of these types of separation from the University. </P>

<P>ACCESS COURSES TAKEN BY TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS </P>

<P>If courses are not offered in the day session, limited seats may be available for traditional day students in hybrid ACCESS courses under unusual circumstances. The student must request an exception by submitting a completed Approval Form (available in MyDSU under the Forms and Documents heading as well as in the academic affairs office) to the dean of undergraduate education. If registration of an ACCESS course is allowed the following regulations apply: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Traditional day students may not take online ACCESS courses during the fall or spring semesters. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Normally, no more than five (5) seats will be available per hybrid class </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Courses during Sessions 1 through 4 are considered as part of their five-course load. They may also overload courses, if they qualify, in these sessions on a space-available basis. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Registration for ACCESS courses must be completed by the date for changing or adding courses as indicated on the academic calendar for each day semester. Permission to withdraw from a day course and add an evening course after the date for changing and adding courses is granted by the dean of undergraduate education only by way of exception and for serious reasons, e.g., serious illness. The desire merely to improve one’s GPA or to avoid a failure is not a good reason for granting this exception. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Permission to withdraw from evening credit courses must be obtained from the student’s academic advisor and from the director of the academic resource center. Withdrawal from evening credit courses will follow the applicable deadlines for these courses, which are published on the ACCESS calendar, available online. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>After the date for changing or adding courses, traditional day students are not permitted to withdraw from a day course and add an ACCESS evening or weekend course during Sessions 2 or 4. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students enrolled in ACCESS courses must follow the ACCESS calendar for those courses in all respects. This is especially important for breaks. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>TRADITIONAL DAY COURSES TAKEN BY ACCESS STUDENTS </P>

<P>Before the advertised pre-registration dates for traditional day students each semester, there will be five (5) seats held for ACCESS students in all traditional day courses. Additional ACCESS registrations in traditional day courses will be accommodated after pre-registration on a space available basis. ACCESS students who need to get into a traditional day course that is closed due to space limitations (e.g., science and computer labs, smart classrooms, and limits set by the University for core courses) must obtain a signature from the chair of the department offering the course. </P>

<P>TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS ENROLLING IN SUMMER ACCESS COURSES </P>

<P>Traditional day students who want to take ACCESS summer and winter session courses must register for them in WebAdvisor and pay the appropriate tuition. The tuition for summer courses is due before the summer course begins and cannot be deferred until the fall semester. The tuition for winter courses is due before the winter course begins and cannot be deferred until the spring semester. These courses may not be considered part of a fall or spring course load. </P>

<P>ONLINE COURSES FOR TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS </P>

<P>To prepare all students to engage in future online educational opportunities as a form of lifelong learning, DeSales University offers full-semester online courses specifically for traditional day students. Traditional day students, with the exception of first-semester freshmen, may register for as many as two of these online courses in any fall or spring semester, provided that they do not exceed a total of two such courses during the entirety of their undergraduate program. Final exams for these online courses may be administered in a classroom on campus or online, at the discretion of the instructor. As noted above, traditional day students may not take online ACCESS courses during the fall or spring semesters. </P>

<P>TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS IN GRADUATE COURSES </P>

<P>Ordinarily, full-time students who have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 and have senior status may enroll in graduate courses while fulfilling the requirements for an undergraduate degree. Ordinarily, they may register for no more than two graduate courses at a time and may accumulate no more than nine graduate credits unless specifically required by the program. The students must have the permission of their division head (or his/ her delegate), the appropriate graduate program director, the dean of undergraduate education, and the dean of graduate education. Departments which sponsor accelerated programs may establish criteria which are more stringent than those delineated above. </P>

<P>Ordinarily, students may not carry an overload course during a semester or session in which they are enrolled in a graduate course. Students may not take the graduate course(s) for a Pass/ Fail grade. Registration is on a space-available basis. All prescribed course sequences and all prerequisites must be followed. Full-time undergraduate traditional day students who register for both undergraduate and graduate courses as part of their five course load pay no additional tuition. </P>

<P>ACCESS STUDENTS IN GRADUATE COURSES </P>

<P>ACCESS students and other undergraduate students who pay tuition on a per-credit basis, have senior status, and have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0, may enroll in graduate courses while fulfilling the requirements for an undergraduate degree. Ordinarily they may register for no more than two graduate courses at a time and may accumulate no more than nine graduate credits unless specifically required by the program. The students must have the permission of the appropriate division head (or his/her delegate), the dean of undergraduate education, the appropriate graduate program director, and the dean of graduate education. Departments which sponsor accelerated programs may establish criteria which are more stringent than those delineated above. </P>

<P>Ordinarily, students may not carry an overload course during a semester or session in which they are enrolled in a graduate course. Students may not take the graduate course(s) for a Pass/Fail grade. Registration is on a space-available basis. All prescribed course sequences and all prerequisites must be followed. These students must pay applicable graduate tuition. </P>

<P>CANCELLATION OF COURSES ELIMINATION OF PROGRAMS </P>

<P>The University reserves the right to cancel courses due to insufficient enrollment, staffing difficulties, or other contingencies. In such cases, students will be informed in a timely manner so that other courses might be selected. </P>

<P>Occasionally, majors, minors, or certificate programs may be terminated. Reasonable efforts will be made so that students who have matriculated into them will be able to complete their programs in a timely fashion. </P>

<P>ACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY </P>

<P>Acts of academic dishonesty violate the deepest convictions of the University community and will not be tolerated. Such acts, including plagiarism, cheating, and other unacceptable behaviors are strictly prohibited. This policy applies to all academic courses, regardless of the method of delivery (e.g., traditional lecture, laboratory, online, and hybrid courses). </P>

<H5>Procedures </H5>

<P>1. The faculty member or, when appropriate, university professional staff member, who discovers or is made aware of a case of plagiarism, cheating, or unacceptable behavior will, on his/her own initiative and in a manner he or she deems appropriate, normally resolve the situation with the student in a private, one-on-one setting. The faculty/staff member may alternatively choose to resolve matters in consultation with the appropriate administrator (the dean of undergraduate education, in the case of undergraduate students; the dean of graduate education, in the case of graduate students). </P>

<P>2. When a faculty/staff member and student meet to resolve a case of plagiarism, cheating, or unacceptable behavior, the faculty/staff member, having previously determined that the case before him/her is beyond question a proven and unmistakable offense, will present his/her position, hear the student’s position, and in the end, may determine that ignorance on the part of the student warrants only a warning to the student. If, however, he/she determines a degree of guilt on the part of the student, he/she is empowered to levy any one of the following sanctions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>grade penalty for the individual assignment </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>grade penalty for the course </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>failure in the course. In the case of library violations, temporary suspension or permanent loss of library privileges may be levied. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>The faculty member will compose a letter stating the nature of the offense as well as the sanction imposed. The faculty/ staff member will send the letter to the student and will send a copy of the letter to the appropriate administrator to be kept on file. Should there be an appeal, any subsequent actions in regard to the incident will be duly recorded by the appropriate administrator. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Should it be determined that this is a second offense involving this student, the incident will then be resolved by the appropriate administrator in conjunction with the faculty/ staff member. In such cases, the appropriate administrator’s decision for resolution may supersede the original decision of the faculty/staff member, when made without knowledge of the first offense. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>In the case of a second offense, the administrator will solicit written statements from the faculty/staff member and the student in question. He/she may then meet with the student and/or faculty/staff member for any needed clarification. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>On the occasion of a second offense, the vice president for academic affairs may impose the penalty of dismissal from the University. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>In the event a faculty/staff member and appropriate administrator working in consultation determine that an egregious breach of academic ethics has been committed, the student may be liable for dismissal from a major, a program, or the University, even on the first offense. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>8. </Lbl>

<LBody>When the appropriate administrator reaches a decision, he/ she will inform the student of that decision in writing and will also inform the student of his/her right to appeal the decision and/or the severity of the sanction before the full Academic Affairs Committee. The faculty/staff member involved also will have the right to appeal. The appropriate Academic Affairs Committee (undergraduate or graduate) </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>will hear all appeals—undergraduate, graduate, ACCESS, and faculty. </P>

<P>9. The words “Academic Dismissal” appear on the official transcript of a student who is dismissed for academic reasons. </P>

<P>ACADEMIC DUE PROCESS </P>

<P>The undergraduate student who feels that he or she has an academic grievance should follow the procedure outlined below: </P>

<P>The student should first discuss the problem or grievance with the faculty/staff member. If, following discussion with the faculty/staff member, the student is not satisfied and continues to believe that he/she has not been dealt with fairly, he/she should discuss the grievance with the chair of the department and/or the division head involved. Students may be asked to present their grievance in writing. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student has recourse to the dean of undergraduate education. </P>

<P>As a final appeal, the student may request the Academic Affairs Committee to evaluate the situation and make a recommendation to the provost/vice president for academic affairs. This request must be presented in writing and include the pertinent information regarding the situation. The Academic Affairs Committee will normally act upon such an appeal within one month of its receipt. The provost’s decision will be final. </P>

<P>When the Academic Affairs Committee does not meet (e.g., during the summer) the order of appeal shall be: faculty/ staff member, chair of the department and/or the division head involved, dean of undergraduate education, and provost/vice president for academic affairs. </P>

3 STUDENT SERVICES </Figure>

<P>COUNSELING CENTER </P>

<P>The Counseling Center provides counseling services to full-time, traditional day students free of charge. The center is staffed by two professional counselors and master’s level interns. The counselors offer group and individual counseling designed to help students develop their full potential and overcome obstacles related to their educational or personal growth. Some of the reasons students seek or are referred for counseling include problems relating to adjustment issues, relationship difficulties, concerns about mood, self-esteem and self-concept issues, and drug and alcohol issues. The counselors, upon request, provide outreach programs in the residence halls as well. </P>

<P>In addition to traditional counseling, the center also promotes a wellness lifestyle. Efforts are made to help students understand their cognitive, behavioral, and emotional functioning, and the effects of this functioning on various dimensions of their life (i.e., intellectual, spiritual, physical, nutritional, interpersonal, educational/vocational, recreational, emotional, and social.) </P>

<P>The center’s goals are promoted through outreach programming, faculty/staff and student workshops and training, newsletters, and other special programming events. Additional services offered by the center include consultation and referral. For more information, call the center at 610.282.1100, ext. 1462 or 1551. </P>

<P>PACE (PEER ADVISING, COUNSELING, EDUCATING) </P>

<P>PACE is a team of trained and certified students who serve as advisors, counselors, and educators to the student body. They are trained by the BACCHUS initiative of NASPA (National Association of Student Personnel Administrators). </P>

<P>DeSales University recognizes that students often relate better to, or are more comfortable with, their peers when it comes to confiding personal struggles. For this reason, the PACE team is trained to provide confidential, one-on-one peer counseling. Students in need of guidance and/or support can schedule appointments directly with a PACE counselor of their choice. Students can schedule an appointment by emailing pace@ desales.edu, or calling 610-282-1100, ext. 7223. </P>

<P>As educators, PACE hosts programs throughout the year to raise awareness about suicide, substance abuse, body image, bullying, responsible use of social media, identifying abusive relationships, alcohol safety, mental health awareness, nutrition, time management, coping with stress, and more. </P>

<P>CAMPUS MINISTRY </P>

<P>Through its worship and other spiritual activities, Campus Ministry seeks to form Christian Humanists by helping the traditional student community to be faithful, maturing, and prayerful disciples of Jesus who minister to and lead the Church and society. The life, teachings, and spirituality of St. Francis de Sales are the guiding force in the ministry. Campus Ministry seeks to form students who will value and pursue life-long faith development; be full, conscious, and active participants in Sunday Eucharist and parish life; can discern, develop, and live an attractive personal life of devotion, prayer, and service appropriate to their vocation and state in life; and be able to articulate a working understanding of Salesian spirituality. While DeSales is a proudly Roman Catholic institution in the Salesian tradition, Campus Ministry seeks to serve the needs of the entire student body, including those of other faith traditions and of no particular faith. </P>

<P>CENTER FOR SERVICE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE </P>

<P>The Center for Service and Social Justice provides volunteer service opportunities for all members of the University community and works to create and foster a vibrant commitment to community service through meaningful outreach activities. A variety of opportunities are available for individuals and groups to put their faith into action. The programs promote genuine human interaction between the members of the University community and our neighbors in the Lehigh Valley and beyond. </P>

<P>The Center for Service and Social Justice provides various activities to accommodate a broad range of community needs, the diverse skills and interests of the DeSales community, and the different schedules of all involved. Its programs include: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>One time service projects: A number of events and activities take place only once per semester or once per year, such as the DeSales Blood Drive, Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, and the Catholic Charities’ Halloween and Christmas parties. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Spring and fall break service trips: Students participate in week-long service projects at locations outside the Lehigh Valley. Recent destinations include Pittsboro, N.C.; Washington, D.C., New Orleans, and Joplin, Mo. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>HEALTH SERVICE </P>

<P>The Health Center is dedicated to helping students stay well and directing them toward proper treatment if they become ill. </P>

<P>The center is open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to </P>

<P>4:00 p.m. Treatment given by the nursing staff is without charge. Student visits to the University physician are covered by the Student Life Fee. If a student is referred for further off-campus diagnostic testing or blood work, every effort is made to access care within the parameters of the student’s personal health insurance carrier. In emergency situations, students are sent to a nearby hospital. </P>

<P>All students must submit a completed physical examination as part of the admissions process. </P>

<P>ATHLETICS AND RECREATION/ INTRAMURALS </P>

<P>Students participate in a full and active program of intramural and recreational sports housed in Billera Hall. The facility includes four regulation basketball courts, four volleyball courts, a fitness center, and an aerobics studio, which is open to all members of the University community. </P>

<P>Outdoor facilities include an all-weather track and field facility, as well as field hockey, soccer, and softball fields, baseball, tennis, and lacrosse venues. Additionally, the cross country course, which traverses the campus, is one of the best in the eastern United States. </P>

<P>DeSales University is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the Middle Atlantic Conferences (MAC), the Freedom Conference, and the Lehigh Valley Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (LVAIAW). The University sponsors a 16-sport intercollegiate athletic program, offering competition in baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, track and field, and golf for men; and in basketball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball for women. </P>

<P>THE DE SALES EXPERIENCE IN CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP </P>

<P>The mission of the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership is to foster students’ character and intellect in an environment that nurtures self-exploration. The Experience is co-curricular, linking character formation, service, and leadership with the student learning outcomes of the DeSales undergraduate academic program. The DeSales Experience provides students with the knowledge and skills to become leaders and ethical citizens in the Salesian tradition. </P>

<P>The DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership is a four-year program that begins with students’ completion of Character U, extending throughout the first year. During their sophomore and junior years, students are expected to complete 40 hours of community service, hold a leadership position on campus, and complete a career development experience. They must also complete one academic course from the categories of Salesian spirituality and Christian humanism; ethics and character; globalization, social justice, or human rights; or career, leadership, or vocation; which will provide knowledge and skills that contribute to leadership and ethical citizenship. Finally, students must participate in the Senior Success Series throughout their senior year and maintain a good student conduct record. </P>

<P>Upon graduation, those students who complete the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership will be presented with an honorary pin at the Baccalaureate ceremony, and will wear an honorary cord at graduation to represent their accomplishments. </P>

<P>CHARACTER U – THE FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE </P>

<P>The Character U program is DeSales University’s first-year experience. This unique, outside-of-the classroom program helps freshmen transition into college life and immerse themselves in the campus community. This is achieved by having the students attend various events throughout their first year at the university including, but not limited to, social, academic, service, spiritual/Salesian, cultural, and wellness events. Each month is dedicated to a specific trait from The Golden Counsels of St. France de Sales (September: Patience, October: Trust/Cooperation, November: Perseverance, February: Love, March: Forgiveness, April: Hope). </P>

<P>To help students better understand these traits, Character U hosts nationally recognized keynote speakers who share their personal stories and relate them to the character trait for the month. Each freshman is also assigned a mentor who initiates contact over the summer and offers the student help in preparing for opening day and orientation. A group of ten freshman mentees and one mentor continue to work together throughout the students’ first year, including weekly meetings to discuss health and wellness, academic progress, and other important components of a successful first year. In an effort to stimulate thinking about character development, citizenship, and life after graduation, mentors also guide freshmen through a curriculum based on moral dilemmas that they may encounter during their time at DeSales University. </P>

<P>Completion of Character U is the first requirement of the four-year program, the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership. </P>

<P>SENIOR SUCCESS SERIES </P>

<P>The Senior Success Series is the culminating requirement of the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership. As Character U prepared the students for their tenure at DeSales, the Senior Success Series will prepare students for life after graduation. This series of programs and events affords students the opportunity to network with and learn from industry professionals and successful DeSales graduates. Twice per month, students will attend sessions that address various components of the transition from University life to the world of work. As much as possible, alumni and members of the community will share their knowledge about the transition to work and the value of a liberal arts education. The sessions that the students attend include: </P>

<P>RESIDENCE LIFE </P>

<P>The Office of Residence Life and the Office of Campus Life (Housing) are committed to providing residence halls that are safe, secure, and conducive to the learning and growth of each resident. In accordance with Salesian spirituality, the residence life staff strives to create a welcoming living environment in which students’ rights and responsibilities are protected, differences are celebrated and appreciated, constructive social interaction is valued and advanced, and students are challenged to be contributing members of the community. The majority of DeSales University students live on campus in one of 10 residential communities: Aviat Hall, Brisson Hall, Chappuis Hall, Conmy Hall, DeChantal Hall, Donahue Hall, Tocik Hall, University Heights, Welsh Hall, and Finnegan, Guerin, and Harvey Houses (University Village). </P>

<P>The Office of Residence Life oversees the supervision of the residence hall staff and enforcement of residence hall regulations. The Office of Campus Life coordinates all aspects of housing, including housing assignments.  The live-in professional staff members are directly responsible for the general operation of an assigned housing area, supervising the resident advisors (RAs), planning and coordinating residence hall programs, responding appropriately to student concerns, and ensuring compliance with University regulations/residence hall policies. Each residence hall floor/unit has a RA who serves as a resource for the residents, as a leader in building community, and who documents any violations of University/residence hall policy. </P>

<P>University policies and residence hall regulations are designed to ensure a high quality of daily life and to prevent behavior that is an infringement on the rights of others, detrimental to personal growth and the common good, or in basic discord with the mission of the University. </P>

<P>For additional information, please contact the Office of Residence Life at 610.282.1100, ext. 1442 or the Office of Campus Life at 610.282.1100, ext 1425 </P>

<P>CAREER DEVELOPMENT CENTER </P>

<P>Career development assists students from all academic programs and class years with exploring majors and careers, gaining career-related experience, and achieving their career goals. Programs and resources help students define career goals, expand their knowledge of career alternatives, understand effective decision making/goal setting, have meaningful career-related experiences, and build a strong strategy for job searches or graduate education. </P>

<P>We welcome students and embrace opportunities to collaborate with employers, graduate and professional schools, faculty and staff, student organizations, parents, and alumni to provide the highest quality service to students. </P>

<P>Career development can help students attain successful employment or acceptance into graduate/professional schools with the following phases of career development: </P>

<P>Career development also helps students who are seeking internship experiences related to their academic majors and career goals. The program is a partnership among the student, the faculty supervisor, the employer, and DeSales University— represented by career development. Each partner has a responsibility to be honest and ethical. Each student represents not only himself or herself, but also his or her academic department and the University. Conduct and performance should be of the highest standards. Internships give students educationally-relevant work and learning experiences that integrate theory learned in the classroom with practical application and job skill development. Through this experience, students should also achieve greater maturity, including an enhanced understanding of their own personal and professional ethical codes. </P>

<P>STUDENT CONDUCT </P>

<P>The University expects its students to conduct their lives in a responsible manner. Students who exhibit behavior, which is inconsistent with the stated mission and goals of the University and the regulations, which flow from them, are subject to formal disciplinary procedures. </P>

<P>MULTICULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </P>

<P>Student affairs strives to build an environment at DeSales that welcomes all members of the community in a respectful manner through cultural activities, educational opportunities, and exploration of the world we live in. </P>

<P>TRANSFER STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATES </P>

<P>DeSales University has a tradition of serving transfer students and helping them to continue their academic program and complete their degree. Transfer students must complete 15 courses at DeSales University and 5 of those courses must be related to the major for a DeSales University degree to be transferred. For majors in the Division of Business, at least three of these five courses must be in the specific major and be at the 300-level or higher. In addition, sport management majors may only count one course (3 credits) of SS 450 toward this requirement. </P>

<P>To be eligible for general transfer admission to DeSales University, students should have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 (2.5 preferred) on a 4.0 scale. Certain programs, such as education and nursing, require a higher GPA for admissions. The theatre and dance programs require an audition. Transfer students interested in the physician assistant program or doctor of physical therapy (DPT) program must first complete a bachelor’s degree at a regionally accredited institution. During or after their senior year, students can apply to DeSales’ Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS) program or the DPT program. Students must satisfy the prerequisite course work for the physician assistant program or DPT program during their undergraduate program. </P>

<P>Students who have registered for 24 or more credits at any post-secondary institution should apply for admission as transfer students. Students who have registered for fewer than 24 credits are considered freshmen with college work and should follow the traditional admissions procedures. </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>UNDERGRADUATE TRANSFER POLICY </P>

<P>The following regulations govern the transfer of credits </P>

<P>into DeSales University. In all cases, transfer courses must be </P>

<P>documented by an official transcript. In some cases, additional </P>

<P>information, including syllabi, course descriptions, or other sup</P>

<P>porting materials may be required. </P>

<P>1) With the exception of internships, all 3-credit courses taken at institutions accredited by the following regional accrediting bodies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or by the U.S. Department of Education (namely, Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and Western Association of Schools and Colleges) are eligible for transfer consideration at DeSales if the courses are meant to be transferable, are completed with a grade of C- or higher, and are consistent with DeSales’ mission, philosophy, and liberal arts tradition. </P>

<P>2) The acceptance or denial of transfer credit is not determined exclusively on the basis of the accreditation of the sending institution or the mode of delivery, but, rather, considers course equivalencies, including expected student learning outcomes and comparison with DeSales’ curricula and standards. Courses that are accepted for transfer must be substantially equal in quantity and quality to the DeSales work for which they are offered as a substitute. </P>

<P>3) No course in which a grade below C- was earned is accepted for transfer credit, except in the case that the student has completed an A.A. (Associate of Arts) or A.S. (Associate of Science) degree. All credits earned in an associate degree program and meant to be transferable will be transferred to DeSales, provided that the student achieved (a) a minimum cumulative GPA (Grade Point Average) of 2.0 for all courses presented for the DeSales degree and (b) a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 for courses required in and offered by the major at DSU. If the student has not satisfied both (a) and (b), the student’s courses will be evaluated individually, and only courses in which a C- or higher has been earned will transfer into DeSales. </P>

<P>4) A student must complete at least 15 courses of three or more credits at DeSales to earn a degree from DeSales. A student can transfer a maximum of 25 courses of three or more credits into DeSales. A minimum of 40 courses of three or more credits are required to earn a DeSales degree. </P>

<P>5) A student must complete 5 courses in the major at DeSales. (There are several professional programs, e.g., nursing and education, that have additional requirements imposed by their individual accreditation agencies. Please check with the chair or director of those DeSales programs.) </P>

<P>6) All nursing (NU) courses with a required laboratory or clinical component must be completed at DeSales. For additional information, refer to the Nursing heading in Section 8 of the Undergraduate Catalog. </P>

<P>7) Only credit is transferred. The grades for transfer courses are not calculated in the student’s DeSales GPA. An exception is that grades earned at LVAIC institutions (Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges: Lehigh University and Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, and Muhlenberg Colleges) via the cross registration process are included in the calculation of the student’s DeSales GPA. Once courses have been transferred, they become part of the student’s permanent record and cannot be removed. </P>

<P>8) Courses not using traditional letter grades (A-F) will be considered for transfer only if additional documentation detailing successful completion of the courses is provided. </P>

<P>9) Courses taught online or in a hybrid format will be accepted assuming they meet the criteria above. </P>

<P>10) DeSales courses are assigned as credit hours. Courses evaluated for transfer from colleges and universities with different systems (e.g., quarter hours, units) are converted into credits. </P>

<P>11) The dean of undergraduate education is responsible for the final determination of the acceptance or denial of transfer credit. </P>

<P>12) Depending on status at the time of admittance, students will be exempt from certain parts of the University’s general education core as noted below: </P>

<P>Transfer with 8 to 17 courses </P>

<P>If students enter at the sophomore level (i.e., have transferred 8 to 17 courses of 3 or more credits each), they are exempt from: </P>

<P>a) MOT (Modes of Thinking) Philosophy b) MOT Social Science c) Composition and Rhetoric I (EN103) d) Composition and Rhetoric II (EN104), provided they </P>

<P>have transferred at least one three-credit English composition course which included the writing of a research paper. If they have not written an acceptable research paper, they must take Composition and Rhetoric II. </P>

<P>e) World Cultures I f) World Cultures II g) PE 100 + two activities courses (traditional day stu</P>

<P>dents only) </P>

<P>Transfer with 18 to 25 courses </P>

<P>If students enter at the junior level (i.e., have transferred 18 to 25 courses of 3 or more credits each), they are exempt from the general education courses typically required in the freshman and sophomore years, namely: </P>

<P>a) MOT Philosophy b) MOT Social Science c) Composition and Rhetoric I (EN 103) d) Composition and Rhetoric II (EN 104), provided </P>

<P>they have transferred at least one three-credit English composition course which included the writing of a research paper. If they have not written an acceptable research paper, they must take Composition and Rhetoric II. </P>

<P>e) World Cultures I f) World Cultures II g) Humanities I h) Humanities II i) MOT Mathematics j) MOT Natural Science k) MOT Literature l) Introduction to Catholic Theology m) PE 100 + two activities courses (traditional day stu</P>

<H2>A. FINANCIAL AID </H2>

<P>INTRODUCTION </P>

<P>The funding of a DeSales education is the primary responsibility of the student (and parent[s] of dependent students). Resources are available to assist the student in meeting costs of higher education from the federal and state governments, DeSales University, and outside resources. It is the student’s responsibility to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) yearly for consideration of the various financial aid programs. </P>

<P>DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY </P>

<P>Filing the FAFSA allows the federal government to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The Office of Financial Aid will use the EFC to develop a financial aid package, based upon the student’s need and available resources. Need is determined by subtracting the EFC from the Total Cost of Attendance (tuition, fees, room, board, books, personal, commuting, and living expenses). </P>

<P>The financial aid package specifies the types and amounts of assistance, including non-federal aid a student will receive to cover his or her education related expenses. Government and University funds are limited and the amount awarded to a student may not meet all financial need. Parents may apply for Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) and students may apply for Alternative Loans to fully fund up to the Total Cost of Attendance. </P>

<P>All awards are subject to revisions. Factors affecting a student’s eligibility include changes in residency status or enrollment, and adjustments as a result of the verification process. If an adjustment of an award is made, the student will be notified and advised to access their financial aid information through the student portal. </P>

<P>FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCEDURES </P>

<P>Prospective Undergraduate Students </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•</Lbl>

<LBody> Gather end of the year income information and documentation to prepare tax returns. Retain copies of all documentation sent to the IRS (1040, W2’s, required schedules, etc.) </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•</Lbl>

<LBody> Complete the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.ed.gov as soon as possible after October 1. DeSales University’s Federal School Code is 003986. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•</Lbl>

<LBody> It takes approximately 1-2 weeks for the results of the online FAFSA to reach DeSales University. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•</Lbl>

<LBody> For maximum consideration for institutional assistance, the FAFSA should be completed before December 1. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>NOTE: Students do not have to be accepted by the University to complete the FAFSA. </P>

<P>Upon deposit, the Office of Financial Aid will send a packet of information that will include an official award letter. </P>

<P>Returning Undergraduate Students </P>

<P>Renewal of financial aid is not automatic. Students who have received aid are required to reapply each year. For renewal of aid, the FAFSA should be filed by May 1 for the upcoming academic year. Funding may be limited for those who file after this date. </P>

<P>For state grant consideration, students must submit the FAFSA and the appropriate state grant applications by the published deadlines of their home state agencies. (Pennsylvania residents must file the FAFSA by May 1 for State grant consideration.) </P>

<P>After the FAFSA has been processed and the Student Aid Report (SAR) is received, the Office of Financial Aid will provide an official award letter provided verification has been finalized (if applicable). </P>

<P>ACCESS Students </P>

<P>Students enrolled in ACCESS have financial aid opportunities through the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Loan Programs. ACCESS-by-day students and those enrolled primarily in in-classroom courses may also qualify for a Pennsylvania State Grant. To award federal and state financial aid to ACCESS students, the ACCESS sessions have been grouped as follows: </P>

<P>Fall semester: Fall Day, Session 1 and Session 2 </P>

<P>Spring semester: Wintermester, Spring Day, Session 3 and </P>

<P>Session 4 </P>

<P>Summer semester: May term, Session 5, Summer </P>

<P>Minimesters, and Session 6 </P>

<P>With the exception of the Federal Pell Grant program, students must enroll in at least six credits per semester to be eligible for financial aid. Please note that for financial aid purposes, CLEP, Challenge Exams, and/or Portfolio Assessment credits do not count toward the semester enrollment. </P>

<P>ACCESS students who enroll in classes during the traditional day semester will be charged a fee for doing so. </P>

<P>ACCESS students applying for financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). </P>

<P>To participate in the Federal Direct loan program, students must complete a master promissory note and entrance counseling. These processes are done online from the U.S. Department of Education website at www.studentloans.gov. </P>

<P>Students must present payment for courses taken until a financial aid deferment is approved by the Office of Financial Aid and the Treasurer’s Office. Only after students have completed all forms, are enrolled, and their file is complete in the Office of Financial Aid, will they be sent a notice of financial aid eligibility. Financial aid can then be viewed via the MyDSU student portal. </P>

<P>Financial aid may not completely cover tuition. Students are responsible for costs accrued after financial aid (grants and/ or loans) has been credited to their accounts. ACCESS students receiving any financial aid at DeSales University will be reviewed for satisfactory academic progress toward a degree at the end of each semester. </P>

<P>The maximum time frame to obtain a degree using federal aid programs is approximately six years (or 12 full-time semesters). Pennsylvania residents may be eligible for a maximum of 8 semesters of state grant funds. ACCESS students are not eligible for university aid due to the reduced costs of the ACCESS program. No federal loans can be awarded retroactively to pay for past due balances. All questions should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid. </P>

<P>VERIFICATION PROCESS </P>

<P>Verification Policy </P>

<P>The U.S. Department of Education selects a portion of all FAFSA filers for a review process called “Verification.” Additionally, during the process of reviewing financial aid information at any time during the academic year, the Office of Financial Aid is required to question any inconsistent information by selecting the application for verification. If the student is selected by the Department of Education or by the institution, DeSales University will be comparing information from the FAFSA application with requested documentation submitted to the Office of Financial Aid. If a student/family chooses not to provide this information, they are advised that the University will be unable to administer any forms of federal aid and institutional need-based awards. If there are differences between the student application information and financial documents, the Office of Financial Aid may need to process corrections on the FAFSA once the changes have been finalized. </P>

<P>Verification Documentation </P>

<P>Students selected for this process may be asked to submit one or more of the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A verification worksheet </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•</Lbl>

<LBody> For dependent students: the student’s and the parent(s)’ financial documents (IRS tax transcripts, W-2 forms, etc.) </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>For independent students: the student’s and the spouse’s (if applicable) financial documents (IRS tax transcripts, W-2 forms, etc.) </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>• An expense/resource worksheet (if applicable) All information must be completed in its entirety, all documents signed as required, and submitted by the specified deadlines. </P>

<P>Verification Deadline </P>

<P>The deadline for each applicant depends on when financial aid application information is received. Verification and Missing Document request letters are sent to students every week, after financial aid (ISIR) information is received. These letters are sent five times over a ten-week period. The final request notifies the student that s/he will not receive any need-based federal or institutional funding if the requested documents are not received by the date listed in the letter. This date is generally one week from the date the letter is generated. </P>

<P>Notification of Award Changes due to Verification </P>

<P>The method by which DeSales University notifies applicants if the award changes because of the verification process is to send an “Official Award Letter.” Initially, the Office of Financial Aid sends first year students an “Estimated Award Letter.” On that particular award letter, it is stated: </P>

<P>An Official Award Letter will be sent to you after you </P>

<P>deposit with the Office of Admissions and all required </P>

<P>documentation has been received and processed. All need-</P>

<P>based awards are subject to change if you are selected for </P>

<P>verification and/or discrepancies are found with finalizing </P>

<P>your Free Application for Federal Student Aid. </P>

<P>Continuing students do not receive an Estimated Award Letter, but Official Award Letters are not prepared until after verification is completed and corrections (if needed) have been processed. If any overpayments were to occur, they would be reported to the Department of Education by way of the Overpayment reporting option on the National Student Loan Database (NSLDS) system. </P>

<P>SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS </P>

<P>To retain eligibility for federal and institutional financial aid, students must maintain satisfactory progress in their academic program, and they must be in good academic standing. Students are required to complete 40 three-credit courses and are expected to average 5 three-credit courses per semester. </P>

<P>Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each term for traditional day and ACCESS students. Students will be ineligible for federal and institutional financial aid when their academic progress fails to meet the following qualitative and quantitative requirements: </P>

<P>Qualitative Assessment </P>

<P>Attempted Credits 12-23 24-47 48-62 63+ Min. Cumulative GPA 1.5 1.6 1.8 2.0 </P>

<P>Quantitative Assessment </P>

<P>Attempted Credits 12-23 24-47  48-62 63-180* Completion Rate 50% 54% 58% 67% </P>

<P>Any additional students who are placed on Academic Probation because of failure to meet the institution’s Academic Standards based on a combination of attempted credits AND attempted courses will also be ineligible. </P>

<P>The completion rate is calculated as the number of passed courses (courses for which a student earned a passing grade) divided by the number of attempted courses (the total of earned courses, and courses for which a student has received a grade of W, F, FA, FO, WP, or WF). Courses dropped during the published 100% refund period and audited courses are not treated as attempted or earned courses. For courses that have been repeated, attempted and earned courses for all occurrences are included. For transferred courses, courses accepted will be included in attempted courses only for the purpose of determining placement in the charts above. </P>

<P>Regardless of cumulative GPA and completion rate attained at any time, students will be ineligible for federal and institutional financial aid when their total courses attempted exceed 150% of the credits required for their program (example: 120 x 150% = 180). </P>

<P>A degree audit is performed for any student who changes programs or pursues additional degrees. If a student has exceeded the maximum time frame based on total attempted courses, including transfer courses, additional time to attempt the remaining courses required for completion may be granted if courses already taken are not applicable to the new programs or if additional courses are needed to earn an additional degree. </P>

<P>Financial Aid Warning </P>

<P>Students not making satisfactory academic progress for the first time may receive one semester of financial aid on probation. The one time financial aid probation provides one term for a student to get back on track and regain eligibility. Students must attain satisfactory academic standing by the end of the semester for which they receive aid on probation. </P>

<P>Financial Aid Probation </P>

<P>If a student finds himself or herself on academic probation or not making satisfactory academic progress in a subsequent semester, s/he may appeal to the Financial Aid Committee for one additional semester of financial aid on probation. In order for the financial aid committee to review a student’s appeal the following information is needed: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A written statement from the student explaining why s/ he was unable to achieve satisfactory academic standing; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A written plan outlining how he or she will achieve satisfactory academic standing that has been reviewed with an academic advisor; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>One written letter of reference from the academic advisor or a SAP waiver request, on the student’s behalf, from the dean of undergraduate studies. Waivers may be granted due to serious illness, severe injury, or the death of a relative. The dean may grant an appeal one time under these circumstances only </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>if it is possible for a student to mathematically meet </P>

<P>the qualitative and quantitative program requirements </P>

<P>within 150% of the published length of the program. </P>

<P>While appeals are generally granted for only one semester, detailed multi-semester academic plans may be developed, on a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the dean of undergraduate education. If granted, academic plans are monitored each semester to ensure that the student meets all requirements. Students must meet all of the conditions of the academic plan in order to continue to receive financial aid. </P>

<P>Financial Aid Suspension </P>

<P>No appeal will be granted and other financial arrangements (such as an alternative loan and/or payment plan) must be used if a student finds himself or herself on academic probation and not making satisfactory academic progress in any subsequent semester after s/he has received a semester of aid on warning and a semester of aid on appeal or if s/he fails to meet the conditions of an academic plan. </P>

<P>Academic Progress for State Aid </P>

<P>Before crediting a State Grant to a recipient’s account, the school must verify that, for the last academic year during which the student received state grant aid, the student completed the required minimum total number of credit hours for the terms to which grant aid was applied. </P>

<P>APPEAL FOR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES </P>

<P>If a family’s financial situation changes after the FAFSA has been filed due to the death of a custodial parent, separation, divorce, disability, or total loss of employment by one or both of the custodial parents, the student should write a letter of appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. The Office of Financial Aid will determine the appropriateness of the appeal and as deemed necessary request additional information throughout the process to have a complete assessment of the situation. Upon final review of the appeal, the family will be notified in writing of the outcome. Approved appeals may receive additional funds on a case-by-case basis. </P>

<P>EXPLANATION OF ENROLLMENT STATUS </P>

<P>Undergraduate Students </P>

<P>Full-time 12 or more credits per semester Three-quarter time 9 -11 credits per semester Half-time 6 - 8 credits per semester Less than half time 5 credits or less </P>

<P>Graduate Students </P>

<P>Full-time 6 or more credits per quarter Half-time 3 credits per quarter Less than half time less than 3 credits per quarter </P>

The deadline for application is May 1 before enrolling in a postsecondary educational institution. Recipients are selected by the Department of Education in their state. </P>

<P>Endowed Scholarships </P>

<P>Through the generosity of individual donors, endowed funds have been established to provide annual scholarships. Endowed scholarship funds are traditionally awarded to returning undergraduate students. The following two scholarships may be awarded to freshmen. </P>

<P>Dr. Julius G. Bede Scholarship for Computer Science &amp; Mathematics </P>

<P>Incoming freshmen who major in mathematics and/or computer science and demonstrate strong academic achievement may receive up to $2,500 per year for four years. Eligibility requirements include minimum score of 1100 on SAT (Math/Verbal combined) or 24 on ACT, strong academic performance in high school (minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0), and interview with faculty member(s) from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. To retain the scholarship from year to year, students must remain a mathematics and/or computer science major and achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 at DeSales University. </P>

<P>Moriello Scholarship  </P>

<P>This endowment was established for the benefit of DeSales University undergraduate students studying in the Division of Business. Selected students receive a merit-based scholarship of $5,000 per year for four years. Incoming freshmen must submit a resume and a two-page essay discussing their interest in a business career by February 1. Final selections are made by the scholarship committee after interviewing candidates. Continued eligibility is contingent upon maintaining a 3.0 GPA throughout all four years. </P>

<P>Dan &amp; Ellen Cunningham Dance Scholarship </P>

<P>This scholarship was established by Danny Cunningham ’86 in recognition of the love and generosity of his parents, who provided him with a rich education in Dance, Theatre, and the Liberal Arts. It was established for the benefit of a DeSales University freshman undergraduate student in the Division of Performing Arts who is a Dance major. The amount of the scholarship will be $2,500 each year, with renewal contingent upon meeting the criteria identified below. These scholarship gifts will not impact any need-based or academic-based aid that the students would already receive. </P>

<P>A recipient will be selected annually by the Head of the Division of Performing Arts and Dance faculty after Dance major auditions. Each recipient must have a demonstrated financial need, maintain a GPA equal to or above 3.0, and remain in good academic standing in accordance with University guidelines. </P>

<P>Students receiving endowed funds will be required as a condition of the financial grant to write a letter annually to the donor of the grant. They may also be required to participate for one night in our annual fund-raising phonathon and to attend a reception held for donors and student grantees. </P>

<P>ACCESS Scholarships </P>

<P>At present, two scholarships are awarded annually to ACCESS students. The Father Alexander T. Pocetto, OSFS Scholarship is awarded to students based on academic achievement and who exhibit an appreciation for the pursuit of higher education. The Pocetto Scholarship is named in honor of Fr. Alexander T. Pocetto, retired senior vice president of DeSales University and one of the founders of the ACCESS program. </P>

<P>The David M. Petzold Scholarship is awarded to a criminal justice major based on academic achievement and a record of service to the community. The David M. Petzold Scholarship was established in memory of Officer David M. Petzold, who was killed in the line of duty on November 9, 2006. David was an alumnus of the DeSales University ACCESS criminal justice program. </P>

<P>Other Scholarships </P>

<P>Other scholarships are available through private donors and organizations. Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for information. </P>

<P>Family Tuition Reduction </P>

<P>Whenever two or more dependent children from the same family are in attendance during the same semester at the University as full-time undergraduate students, the family tuition reduction policy may apply. The second and succeeding children will be eligible for a tuition reduction up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%). The exact amount will be determined after all other forms of applicable financial aid have been determined and deducted. Please be advised that this program is not available to ACCESS students, graduate students, or traditional students who have used up their 8 semesters of eligibility. </P>

<P>Tuition Payment Plans </P>

<P>Using University sponsored payment plans, students and their families can make 10 regularly scheduled monthly installment payments during an academic year without interest or carrying charges. A separate enrollment fee is required, and the first one-tenth payment is usually due before May 1. For more information, contact the treasurer’s office at 610.282.1100, ext. 1343. </P>

<P>SPECIAL PROGRAMS </P>

<P>Teacher Certification </P>

<P>Post baccalaureate students attending DeSales University and pursuing a teaching certification from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are eligible to apply for Federal Direct loans pending enrollment in 6 or more credits. Teacher certification is considered to be a fifth year undergraduate program and students who answer no to all the dependency status questions on the FAFSA will be considered dependent students. This means these students will be required to provide their parents’ financial information on the FAFSA. </P>

<P>WITHDRAWAL AND REFUNDS </P>

<P>Students withdrawing from the institution must inform the registrar’s office in writing. The official date of withdrawal for the purpose of a refund will be the last date of attendance as determined by the registrar. </P>

<P>Students withdrawing from the institution who are residence hall students and/or are on the University meal plan should consult the treasurer’s office. </P>

<P>RETURN OF FEDERAL STUDENT AID (TITLE IV) FUNDS POLICY </P>

<P>The Department of Education has established a policy determining the amount of Title IV program assistance that you can earn if you withdraw from school. The Title IV programs covered by this law include Federal Pell Grants, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, SEOG Grants, Direct and Perkins Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans. </P>

<P>When you withdraw during your payment period, the amount of Title IV program assistance that you have earned up to that point is determined by a specific formula. If you received (or your school or parent received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount you earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds. If you received more assistance than you earned, the excess funds must be returned by the school and/or you. </P>

<P>The amount of assistance that you have earned is determined on a pro rata basis. For example, if you completed 30% of your payment period of enrollment, you earn 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive. Once you have completed more than 60% percent of the payment period, you earn all of the assistance that you were scheduled to receive for that period. </P>

<P>If you did not receive all of the funds that you earned, you may be due a post-withdrawal disbursement. If your post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan funds, your school must get your permission before it can disburse them. You may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds so that you don’t incur additional debt. Your school may automatically use all or a portion of your post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition, fees, and room and board charges (as contracted with the school). The school needs your permission to use the post-withdrawal grant disbursement for all other school charges. If you do not give your permission (DSU asks for this when you enroll), you will be offered the funds. However, it may be in your best interest to allow the school to keep the funds to reduce your debt at the school. </P>

<P>There are some federal financial aid funds that you were scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to you once you withdraw because of other eligibility requirements. For example, if you are a first-time, first-year undergraduate student and you have not completed the first 30 days of your program before you withdraw, you will not receive any Direct loan funds that you would have received had you remained enrolled past the 30th day. </P>

<P>If you receive (or your school or parent receives on your behalf) excess Title IV program funds that must be returned, your school must return a portion of the excess equal to the lesser of: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>your institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of your funds, or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>the entire amount of excess funds. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The school must return this amount even if it didn’t keep this amount of your Title IV program funds. </P>

<P>If your school is not required to return all of the excess funds, you must return the remaining amount. Any loan funds that you must return, you (or your parent for a PLUS Loan) repay in accordance with the terms of the promissory note. That is, you make scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time. </P>

<P>Any amount of unearned grant funds that you must return is called an overpayment. The maximum amount of a grant overpayment that you must repay is half of the grant funds you received or were scheduled to receive. You do not have to repay a grant overpayment if the original amount of the overpayment is $50 or less. You must make arrangements with your school or the Department of Education to return the unearned grant funds. </P>

<P>The requirements for Title IV program funds when you withdraw are separate from any refund policy that your school may have. Therefore, you may still owe funds to the school to cover unpaid institutional charges. Your school may also charge you for any Title IV program funds that the school was required to return. </P>

<P>Withdrawal date for Title IV purposes is defined as the date the student began the institution’s withdrawal process, the student’s last date of recorded attendance, or the midpoint of the semester for a student who leaves without notifying the institution if the last date of attendance cannot be established. </P>

<P>Attention ACCESS students: </P>

<P>If an ACCESS student has a Pell Grant, the sessions not yet begun will be discounted, and the Pell Grant will be reduced to the lower enrollment status before calculating the aid to be returned. Student loans are contingent upon a student being enrolled at least half time (6 credits) per semester. If you enroll and later drop classes that you have never begun so that your enrollment status falls below 6 credits, you are not eligible for a student loan that semester. If a loan disbursement was made before you dropped below half-time, that disbursement can remain. However, subsequent disbursements must be cancelled. </P>

<P>For financial aid purposes, a student who stops attending (or officially withdraws) at any point in the ACCESS semester is considered to have withdrawn, even if one or more classes have been completed with a passing grade. In other words, a student is considered to have withdrawn if he/she does not complete all days scheduled to complete within the semester. If a student is enrolled simultaneously in two courses within a Session and stops attending only one of those, it is not considered a withdrawal. </P>

<P>If a student officially drops classes that he/she has never begun attending before his/her withdrawal from the institution, those classes are not counted in the “days scheduled to complete.” The school must document completion of all courses with a passing grade. If there is no passing grade in the last scheduled course, the school must demonstrate the student completed the period. </P>

<P>The following questions and examples may help clarify this: </P>

<P>1. Did the student cease to attend before completing or fail to begin attendance in a course scheduled to attend? If yes, go to question 2. If no, it is not a withdrawal. </P>

<P>2. When ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in an enrolled course, was the student attending other courses? If yes, not a withdrawal. If no, go to question </P>

<P>3. </P>

<P>3. Did student confirm in writing attendance in a later Session in the term? If no, student is a withdrawal. If yes, not a withdrawal if attendance is resumed in the later Session and the resumption of attendance is within 45 days of the withdrawal. </P>

<P>Example 1: </P>

<P>Student has two 8 week sessions within a semester with two classes each session. </P>

<P>The student begins attendance in both courses in the first session but stops attending both after a few weeks. No written confirmation of intent to attend session 2 is received. </P>

<P>This student is a withdrawal and a Return of Tittle IV funds calculation must be performed. </P>

<P>Example 2: </P>

<P>Same scenario as above, but student stops attending only one of the two courses in the first session. The student is not a withdrawal. </P>

<P>Example 3: </P>

<P>Same scenario as above. During the first session, the student withdraws from both courses in the second session, and he/she completes both courses in the first session with a passing grade. The student has not ceased to attend a course he was scheduled to attend because the course was dropped within the first module and before they began. So the student is not a withdrawal. However, recalculation of a PELL grant is required because he/she was paid for two courses that he/she never attended. </P>

<P>Example 4: </P>

<P>Same scenario as above. The student begins attendance in both courses in the first session but stops attending both after six weeks. However, he/she provides a written confirmation of intent to attend session 2. The student is not a withdrawal unless he/she fails to begin session 2. If he/she fails to begin session 2, the withdrawal date and days of attendance are determined as if the confirmation of future attendance was never provided. </P>

<P>When a Return of Title IV funds calculation is required, the total calendar days used in the calculation include all days in which the student is scheduled to attend but does not count days of courses officially dropped before complete cessation of attendance. </P>

5 EXPENSES </Figure>

<P>FULL-TIME DAY STUDENT </P>

<P>Full payment of tuition and fees is due before each semester from each full-time student registered for twelve credits or more. Students authorized by the dean of undergraduate education to register for an academic overload shall not be charged additional tuition. Applicable fees shall be charged. </P>

<P>PART-TIME STUDENTS </P>

<P>Part-time, non-continuing education students with an academic course of eleven credit hours or less in any semester shall be charged for tuition at the rate of $1,500 per credit hour. Applicable fees shall be charged. </P>

<P>DEPOSITS </P>

<P>A deposit of $400, to be applied to the tuition charge, must be paid at the time of accepting the offer of admission by new students. This deposit is not refundable. </P>

<P>A refundable security deposit of $400 applicable to all full-time students must be paid at the student’s initial registration only. The deposit will be refunded after cessation of student status, less any outstanding indebtedness. </P>

<P>WITHDRAWAL </P>

<P>Any notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for refund must be in writing to the registrar, in the case of day students, and to the ACCESS Office in the case of ACCESS students. </P>

<P>REFUND ON WITHDRAWAL </P>

<P>A refund of payments will be made to a student who withdraws honorably from DeSales University. In all cases, the refund will be calculated based on the official withdrawal date as determined by the registrar and the amount of time the student has spent at the University until the semester is 60% complete, at which time all applicable charges—tuition, fees, room and board, and financial aid—shall be considered to be 100% earned. For example, if the length of the semester is 100 days, and the student withdraws after 30 days, 30% of all charges would be considered earned and a 70% refund of all charges will be applied. If the student withdraws after 75 days, all charges are considered 100% earned and a refund will not be applied. </P>

<P>When rooms are vacated voluntarily during the term, there </P>

<P>will be no refund for the semester’s room and board for students who have not withdrawn from the University. If the vacating is involuntary, because of discipline or some other University-initiated reason, a pro rata refund will be disbursed. </P>

<P>Please note: Students who have already received a refund of a credit balance may owe money to the University and/or to the Title IV financial aid programs in the case of withdrawal within the first 60% of the semester. </P>

<P>No transcripts will be issued by DeSales University for any student who has an outstanding financial obligation. </P>

<P>STUDENT LOANS </P>

<P>DeSales University itself does not lend money to students or advance credit toward their expenses. Information on the current federal loan programs may be obtained in Section 4 under the Financial Aid Programs Available heading. </P>

<P>DEFERRED PAYMENT PLANS </P>

<P>Tuition, room and board payments may be made through a deferred payment plan. Inquiries should be addressed to the bursar’s office. </P>

<P>TUITION, FEES—FULL-TIME DAY STUDENTS </P>

<P>All charges and fees are payable in advance, in full, on or before the registration day of each semester. The amounts listed are estimated expenses for 2018-19 and are subject to change. No student will be considered registered nor be admitted to classes until all obligations in this respect have been fully satisfied, and verified by the bursar’s office. </P>

<P>Room contracts are for the full academic year. Also, all students who have room contracts are required to enroll in a board plan. </P>

<P>Students will not be released from their room and board contract before the completion of the academic year. </P>

<P>Students who study abroad for a semester but enroll in a course at DeSales University will be assessed a tuition charge at the part-time traditional undergraduate rate per credit hour. </P>

<P>NINTH SEMESTER STATUS </P>

<P>Students who have paid the full-time undergraduate tuition for 8 fall and spring semesters and need to take more courses to complete their graduation requirements or are seeking to obtain a second undergraduate degree will be entitled to take courses at the ACCESS tuition rates for courses taken beyond the original 8 fall and spring semesters. Physician assistant courses are excluded from this special tuition rate. </P>

<P>TRANSCRIPTS OF CREDITS </P>

<P>A fee of $8 will be charged for each transcript of credits. Current students can order transcripts via MyDSU under Applications (eTranscripts). Transcripts will not be issued unless all financial obligations have been discharged. </P>

<P>OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS </P>

<P>Students who separate from the University, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, with an outstanding balance due are subject to being turned over to a third-party collection agency. If this action is taken, the University has the right to collect the associated collection fees charged to the University by the collection agency. These collection fees can range from 25% to 50% of the past due balance. Transcripts and/or diplomas will not be issued until the total financial obligation and any associated collection fees have been paid in full AND the University has received the payment from the collection agency, which may take up to 6 weeks. </P>

6 ACCESS: ACCELERATED DEGREE PROGRAMS </Figure>

<Sect>
<P>In 1977, the ACCESS Program was established to serve the educational and career needs of working adults. This accelerated program was the first of its kind in the Lehigh Valley. In keeping with the mission statement of DeSales University, the mission of ACCESS is to provide lifelong learners with a liberal arts education and professional training according to Christian Humanist tradition, emphasizing excellence, individual attention, and program flexibility. </P>

</L>

<P>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PERSONAL ENRICHMENT </P>

<P>DeSales University encourages members of the community who seek professional development or personal enrichment but do not want to pursue a class for credit through two options: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Auditing – Participation in the course will be reflected on a transcript; however, no credit will be awarded. This is appropriate for individuals who want the ability to provide documentation of participation in a course. </LBody>

<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Value Initiative Program (VIP) – No permanent record will be maintained. </LBody>

The cost for taking courses through either of these options is included with tuition/fees information. Anyone who is interested should contact an ACCESS advisor. </P>

<P>ACCESS EVENING-WEEKEND NURSING PROGRAM </P>

<P>DeSales University has a national-class reputation for strong undergraduate and graduate nursing degree programs. ACCESS has combined the strengths of the DeSales nursing education with a format that enables busy adult learners to earn a BSN degree while continuing to work, care for a family, and handle other responsibilities. </P>

<P>Evening-Weekend nursing students are able to complete classes offered in the evenings and on weekends. Many are available in 8-week sessions with multiple scheduling options, including online. </P>

<P>SENIOR CITIZEN PROGRAM </P>

<P>Senior citizens (60 years of age or older) may enroll on a space-available basis in up to four non-studio credit courses per term (e.g., spring, fall, summer) at the rate of the current one-credit tuition fee. This may be a combination of courses (up to four) offered during the day or through ACCESS; for example, one course in Session 1, one course in Session 2, and two fall day courses. In addition to the registration fee, special course fees as applicable will be charged. Senior citizens may enroll in courses for enrichment, audit, or credit; and must meet the necessary prerequisites. </P>

<P>All applicable academic regulations will be in effect for such students. Proof of age is required at the time of registration. </P>

<P>ACCESS ADVISING </P>

<P>All ACCESS students are encouraged to take advantage of the advising services. Students should plan to meet with an advisor on a consistent basis to discuss course planning, scheduling options, and other academic issues. Advising is available in person, through e-mail, or by telephone. </P>

<P>ACCESS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS </P>

<P>A certificate program provides the student with a coherent program of study that has specific and readily obtainable objectives and yet does not require the number of courses or the time commitment of a degree program. Professionals and college graduates who want or need additional higher education credentials outside their major area of collegiate study are also good candidates for an ACCESS certificate. </P>

<P>The assistant dean of lifelong learning is responsible for administering certificate programs for ACCESS students. For complete details, students should contact an ACCESS advisor. </P>

<P>ACCESS INDIVIDUALIZED MAJOR (AIM) </P>

<P>The ACCESS Individualized Major (AIM) offers students an opportunity to earn an interdisciplinary, self-designed degree. As a BA in liberal studies, it is intentionally structured to cross traditional discipline boundaries to address the student’s specific academic and vocational needs. AIM “customizes” a student’s education while ensuring rigorous standards within a carefully constructed yet flexible framework. </P>

<P>CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING </P>

<P>DeSales University recognizes that many adults acquire college level learning in non-collegiate settings such as work, the military, community organizations, and independent study. The ACCESS program provides the adult learner with a variety of methods to demonstrate that they have acquired college level learning. Students who desire to earn college credit for their prior learning may choose from one or a combination of the following options: </P>

<P>DeSales University Challenge Exam Program </P>

<P>Credit by examination may be earned for most DeSales University courses. In addition to the DeSales University Challenge Examination Program, standardized examinations have been developed by the following nationally recognized organizations. Students should consult their advisor before taking any exams. </P>

<P>College Level Examination </P>

<P>DeSales University is an official CLEP Test Center. CLEP tests are administered at the Bethlehem Area Campus. Students may earn credits through the CLEP program, which may apply to a DeSales University degree. Interested students should contact the Bethlehem Area Campus at 610.814.3026. </P>

<P>Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DSST) </P>

<P>The DSST exams were originally designed for military personnel, but the exams are now open to anyone and exams are offered in the social and physical sciences and business. </P>

<P>Military Training </P>

<P>Since 1954, the American Council on Education has been evaluating military training programs for college credit. Credit recommendations are published in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Forces. </P>

<P>Non-Traditional Training </P>

<P>The American Council of Education has evaluated many professional training programs for college credit. Credit recommendations are published in the National Guide to Educational Credit for Training Programs. Training programs have been evaluated for hundreds of organizations nationwide. </P>

<P>Portfolio Assessment </P>

<P>The portfolio process is used to evaluate knowledge for college credit. The process involves the collection of evidence and documentation to support a formal credit request for specific courses and is considered transfer credit. Students are required to pay 30% of tuition for assessment of a portfolio related to a given course. For more information, contact an ACCESS advisor. </P>

<P>CHANGE OF MAJOR </P>

<P>The change of major for an ACCESS student is a formal procedure. The procedure to declare or change a major begins with the student’s ACCESS academic advisor. After a meeting with the ACCESS student’s advisor, during which the student’s program record will be evaluated in terms of the new program major, an ACCESS approval form will be completed. The request form will be signed by the student and by the advisor who is making the recommendation for the change. The completed approval form will be sent to the appropriate department chair for approval. The registrar’s office is responsible for changing the major on the student’s permanent record once the form with proper signatures has reached the office. The graduation requirements for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student’s official acceptance to the major. </P>

<P>HIGH SCHOOL HONORS PROGRAM </P>

<P>The High School Honors Program provides access to college credit courses to academically talented high school juniors and seniors who receive appropriate recommendations from their principal and counselor and approval from the University’s dean of lifelong learning. The High School Honors Program serves to provide academically talented juniors and seniors from area high schools with opportunities to pursue learning at the college level as an enriching supplement to their secondary-level courses of study and with opportunities to earn college credits while they are still enrolled in high school. High school students who successfully complete credit courses may apply these credits toward a degree if they decide to enroll at DeSales University after graduation from high school or they may wish to present their earned credits for transfer to other colleges or universities. A student participating in the High School Honors Program will be billed at the ACCESS tuition rate and will be responsible for any related course fee. </P>

<P>ACCESS ATTENDANCE POLICY </P>

<P>In ACCESS, for courses that meet during an eight-week period, students who miss more than one class may be withdrawn from the course. For courses meeting during a 16-week period, students who miss more than three classes may be withdrawn from the course. Students enrolled in online courses who fail to log on within the drop/add period will be dropped from the course.

<P>For those ACCESS students who receive financial aid, the following refund policy is applicable: a refund will be credited from the date the student completes the registrar’s official withdrawal form and will be based on the amount of time the student has spent at the University, until the semester is 60% complete. At this time, all applicable tuition and fees shall be considered to be 100% earned and a refund will not be applied. For example, if the length of the semester is 100 days, and the student withdraws after 30 days, 30% of all charges would be considered earned and a 70% refund of all charges will be applied. If the student withdraws after 75 days, all charges are considered 100% earned and a refund will not be applied. </P>

<P>Sessions 1 and 2 include all fall sessions, 3 and 4 include all spring sessions, and 5 and 6 include all summer sessions. </P>

<P>Please note: Students who have already received a refund of a credit balance may owe money to the University and/or to the respective financial aid programs in the case of a withdrawal within the first 60% of the semester. </P>

<P>ACCESS COURSE WITHDRAWAL POLICY </P>

<P>ACCESS students who wish to withdraw from courses should consult the ACCESS calendar to determine the last day of withdrawal. If students withdraw with permission, they will be given a grade of either W, WP, or WF at the instructor’s discretion. The grades given in such instances will become part of students’ permanent record but will not be used in the computation of students’ GPA. Withdrawal after the designated withdrawal date results in failure in all cases except those exempted as the result of student appeal. </P>

<P>ACCESS: TUITION, FEES, AND DEFERRED PAYMENT </P>

<P>Tuition and fees are subject to change without advance notice. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>When students have a government grant of any kind, VA, Federal Pell, PHEAA, etc., tuition will be deferred until the grant is received from the government. If the aid is less than the charges, the difference is immediately due and payable. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>When students are eligible for tuition reimbursement from their employers, written evidence of this eligibility is required from the employer. Only the amount of tuition that can be reimbursed will be deferred. In cases where all reimbursement is contingent upon successful completion of the course(s) and the student fails the course, DeSales University will require payment by students from their own funds. If they do not pay, they will not be permitted to matriculate in any subsequent session until all bills are paid and they will be ineligible in the future for tuition deferment of any kind. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>When students negotiate a loan through the government or a bank or other agency, written evidence of the loan is required. Tuition is deferred until the loan money is received. </LBody>

</LI>
</L>

<P>TRANSCRIPTS OF CREDITS </P>

<P>A fee of $8 will be charged for each transcript of credits. Current students can order transcripts via MyDSU under Applications (eTranscripts). Transcripts will not be issued unless all financial obligations have been discharged. </P>

<P>OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS </P>

<P>Students who separate from the University, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, with an outstanding balance due are subject to being turned over to a third-party collection agency. If this action is taken, the University has the right to collect the associated collection fees charged to the University by the collection agency. These collection fees can range from 25% to 50% of the past due balance. Transcripts and/or diplomas will not be issued until the total financial obligation and any associated collection fees have been paid in full AND the University has received the payment from the collection agency, which may take up to 6 weeks. </P>

<P>Candidates in the professional educator program participate in numerous observation and practice-based field experiences beginning in freshman year through the student teaching experience. Candidates should be prepared to complete a minimum of 170 clinical field hours before student teaching. Field experiences are conducted in public and nonpublic schools within a 20-mile driving distance of the University’s Center Valley campus. The purpose of the program is to further develop, demonstrate, and assess the competencies of the certification program, thereby preparing the candidate for student teaching and eventual full-time employment as a professional educator. The field program strives to develop sensitivity and culturally responsive attitudes in working with diverse student populations: races, genders, religious beliefs, national origins, and socio-economic backgrounds. All clinical field experiences and student teaching experiences will include field-based reports, evaluation, and feedback by cooperating teachers, University supervisors, and/or peers. See the Field Experiences Guide for Students for additional detail. </P>

<P>The goal of the media studies major at DeSales University is to produce media professionals with basic skills for content production and advanced tools of critical thought necessary for critiquing that content, with an emphasis on media theory. Students will take courses in media theory, journalism, digital media, and media production. </P>

<P>Media professionals must carry into their chosen field the appropriate tools for critical thinking about how media function as institutions, as content producers, and as political influencers, among other things. Equally so, scholars who choose a path of studying media in higher education should have a knowledge of the technical aspects of the production process that will help inform their scholarship. </P>

<P>The major incorporates experiences both in and out of the classroom to produce students who have experience in production and theory and an awareness of ethical concerns present in the contemporary world of the media industry. </P>

<P>The mission of the physician assistant program is consistent with the enduring Christian Humanistic traditions of DeSales University and seeks to graduate physician assistants who dedicate themselves to the total well-being of the patient. Graduates of the program will deliver competent compassionate health care including preventative services and wellness education to patients of diverse populations in a variety of settings. They will consider the patient holistically in the context of family, community, and society, and incorporate ethical principles into a patient-focused practice. They will serve their patients by using evidence-based medicine and promoting life-long learning in the profession. </P>

Nursing courses are rooted in the tenets of Salesian Christian humanism in which persons are viewed holistically and nursing action aims to foster each person’s full physical, intellectual, moral, social, aesthetic, and spiritual/religious development. The goals of nursing include health promotion, maintenance, restoration, and palliation. </P>

<P>The undergraduate nursing major prepares the graduate for general practice at a beginning professional level in nursing and provides a knowledge base for graduate study and an awareness of the need for life-long learning. Upon successful completion of the undergraduate nursing program of study, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is granted. A four-year academic program is offered in a traditional day format and in an evening-weekend format. An Accelerated BSN Program is offered for students who have already completed a baccalaureate degree in a non-nursing major. </P>

<P>Academically qualified traditional students may be eligible for direct admission into one of the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) programs through the Nurse Scholars Program. Traditional students must fulfill all requirements for the BSN degree before attaining status as graduate students. MSN programs prepare students to pursue advanced practice nursing specialties, including family nurse practitioner, psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner, adult gerontology clinical nurse specialist, or adult gerontology acute care nurse practitioner. MSN degree options also include forensic nursing with certification in investigative forensics, nursing informatics with certification in healthcare information management, and nurse executive via the dual MSN/MBA program (students interested in the dual MSN/ MBA program must apply separately to the MBA program for admission consideration; acceptance into the MBA program is not guaranteed). </P>

<P>The baccalaureate degree in nursing, master’s degree in nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice program, and post-MSN APRN certificate programs at DeSales University are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http:// www.aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation). </P>

<P>The Department of Nursing and Health adopts the Pennsylvania Nursing Articulation Model (1994) as the framework that guides its RN to BSN student articulation. Forty three-credit hour courses must be successfully completed to graduate from DeSales University with a BSN degree. Students who graduated from the nursing programs at community colleges must take a minimum of ten of these courses at DeSales University, with the option of taking the remaining courses at either DeSales University or their original community college as per preexisting articulation contracts between the University and these respective community colleges. All other RN to BSN students must take all remaining courses at DeSales University once they are accepted as DeSales University students. Students may be given transfer credit for alternative/elective courses only if the transfer of all analog courses has been approved. </P>

<P>RN to BSN General Progression Policies </P>

<P>All nursing (NU) courses with a required laboratory or clinical component must be completed at DeSales University. Didactic nursing courses, specifically NU 305 Therapeutic Nutrition, NU 310 Concepts of Professional Nursing Practice for RNs, and NU 325 Evidence-Based Nursing for RNs, are eligible for transfer consideration provided the courses were completed with a grade of “C+” or higher, were taken at an institution accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), and were completed within the last five years of the student’s matriculation into a DeSales BSN program. The BSN program’s prerequisite science courses are eligible for transfer consideration provided the courses adhere to the transfer policy detailed in Section 4 of the Undergraduate Catalog. </P>

<P>Required Nursing Courses: Phase I </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students are required to take the following nursing courses and attain a grade of C+ or higher. Courses equivalent in credits hours and content may be accepted for transfer: Nursing 305, 310, 315, 325, 441. </P>

<P>Any student who receives less than a C+ can repeat a maximum of one nursing course one time throughout their course of study. Failure of a nursing course is defined as any grade below the minimum progression requirement of C+. Failure of a second nursing course will result in dismissal from the program. </P>

<P>Nursing Credits by Advanced Course Validation </P>

<P>RN to BSN students will receive credit for ten courses for the following courses upon satisfactory completion of Phase I nursing courses. At that time, credits for analogous completion of these courses will be awarded and designated upon students’ transcripts without assigning a numeric grade equivalent: Nursing 205, 220, 230, 335, 340, 350, 365, 370, 430. </P>

<P>Required Nursing Courses: Phase II </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students will take the Phase II nursing courses after successfully completing Phase I nursing courses and receiving advanced nursing course validation. These students are required to take the following nursing courses and attain a grade of C+ or higher: NU 451, NU 456. Any student who receives less than a C+ can repeat a maximum of one nursing course one time throughout their course of study. Failure of a nursing course is defined as any grade below the minimum progression requirement of C+. Failure of a second nursing course will result in dismissal from the program. </P>

<P>Required Non-Nursing Courses </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students are required to take the following courses. Previously completed courses that are equivalent in credit hours and content may be accepted for transfer if they have been completed at an accredited college or university with a grade of C- or higher: CH 107, BI 252, TH 262, PL 109, PS 109, PS 240, MA 111, Humanities 3 and Humanities 4 Electives, Values Seminar Elective, and free electives (of 3 credits or more) as needed to fulfill the forty course requirement for graduation. </P>

<P>General Requirements </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students must satisfactorily meet all the health, background, drug, and clearance requirements outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog under the section “BSN Clinical Requirements;” all items must be satisfactorily met prior to taking any nursing course with a project component. All RN to BSN students must adhere to and abide by content in the RN-BSN/ MSN Nursing Student Handbook. Any deviation or failure to comply with the content may warrant dismissal from the nursing program. All RN to BSN students must abide by the nursing progression requirements outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time of acceptance into the nursing program. Additionally, students must meet all other graduation requirements outlined by DeSales as necessary to be awarded a bachelor’s degree. </P>

<P>The maximum time for completion of the RN to BSN program is seven years from the date of enrollment in the first course. This includes any time lapsed due to an approved leave of absence or time associated with failure to progress. Any dismissed, withdrawn, or inactive student, as defined by University policy, must formally reapply to the nursing program. Re-admission is not guaranteed. Re-admitted students will be required to repeat all nursing coursework, regardless of previous course grades achieved, and are subject to the progression policies outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog under which they are re-accepted. </P>

<P>RN to MSN Completion Program </P>

<P>RN to MSN students must maintain a minimum GPA of </P>

<P>3.0 throughout the program. If the cumulative GPA falls below 3.0, the student is then placed on academic probation. Probation guidelines are fully described in the Graduate Catalog. Students in the RN to MSN program must adhere to both the progression policies for the RN to BSN student as well as the progression policies outlined for the MSN student in the Graduate Catalog. Additionally, students enrolled in the RN to MSN program may only enroll in MSN level courses according to the curriculum plan developed and approved by their nursing faculty advisor. </P>

<P>All RN to MSN students must satisfactorily meet all the health, background, drug, and clearance requirements outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog under the section “BSN Clinical Requirements” and for MSN students as outlined in the Graduate Catalog. </P>

<P>Accelerated BSN Program: </P>

<P>DeSales University offers an accelerated nursing degree program to eligible post-baccalaureate students; namely, an Accelerated BSN Program. The Accelerated BSN Program is offered over a 15-month intensive time frame with courses sequenced in a “lockstep” fashion. Students enrolled in this program take the same undergraduate nursing courses that DeSales University Traditional Day BSN students take, but in an accelerated format. Likewise, program non-nurse course requirements mirror those for current Traditional BSN students. </P>

<P>Admission Requirements </P>

<P>Philosophy Major Program </P>

<P>Liberal arts education has traditionally placed strong emphasis on the importance of philosophical reflection for the formation of the human person. The philosophy program at DeSales University recognizes this fact and strongly promotes it. This program seeks to encourage the development of the intellectual and moral virtues, helping students not only to think clearly about reality and to know the greatest truths, but also to understand how to conform their practical activity to this knowledge; philosophy at DeSales regards the entire person in his or her humanity. This program is designed to enable students to see philosophy as a dialogue among persons seeking truth, and to promote personal participation in that search. The philosophical insights that result from this search should help students to discriminate and relate the different kinds of knowledge that make up the sum of human learning, and hence enable them to interpret their study of the sciences and the humanities in their significance for the human race. This training takes place within the Christian intellectual tradition and DeSales University’s dedication to Salesian spirituality and Christian Humanism. </P>

<P>The Division of Performing Arts offers a degree program in Theatre that presupposes the fact that the theatre does and will continue to exert a tremendous influence on the intellectual life and cultural development of civilization. In view of that presupposition, the goals of the department are to offer its majors the broadest knowledge of drama and the most valid experience of theatre that its resources will allow. </P>

<P>The division believes that the theoretical approach to theatre must be supplemented with practical experience. Therefore, theatre students are required to participate as actors and/or crew members for all productions of ACT 1 and participate in Studio Theatre productions (ACT 2). So that theatre students receive credit and evaluation for performance and crew work on ACT 1 productions, they must complete TR 361 and TR 362. (See entries corresponding to these course numbers.) </P>

<P>The program requires all students to take a group of courses that provide a broad based understanding of the major areas of theatre practice. The program also requires that each student, in consultation with his/her advisor, select one of the following tracks for specialized study: (1) acting for the stage and screen, </P>

<P>(2) musical theatre performance, (3) design/technology, and (4) communications-theatre. All programs lead to the Bachelor of Arts degree in theatre. </P>

<P>Admission into the theatre major is twofold. The applicant must be accepted by the University and must successfully audition and/or interview separately for the major. </P>

<P>The theatre core consists of six courses taken by all TR majors: </P>
