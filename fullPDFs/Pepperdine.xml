<H3>Dean’s Message </H3>

<P>The 21st century presents colleges with unprecedented challenges and opportunities. This century, now often labeled the “global century,” demands that we think carefully and strategically about how best to educate the young minds and hearts that will be called upon to address and resolve longstanding difficulties and issues not yet conceived. Those issues range from ecological to societal to spiritual. With the explosion in knowledge, and information moving at warp speed, colleges must not only educate the mind to handle deftly these challenges, but </P>
</Sect>

<P>also educate the heart to make solid ethical choices that benefit society and bless human life upon this planet. </P>

<P>At Seaver College we remain convinced that the best education for these challenging times is the traditional liberal arts education that emphasizes the fundamental skills of critical reading and mathematical analysis, interdisciplinary thinking, coherent writing and speaking, and ethical sensitivity. The traditional liberal arts curriculum engages the soul and the mind, while exposing students to the best thinking and analysis of the past and present. Numerous contemporary leaders today are issuing a clarion call for the need for a solid liberal arts education to deal with the challenging forces of our time. At Seaver College we enmesh our liberal arts curriculum within our major degree programs. This empowers our students to receive an education that is simultaneously broad and yet appropriately specialized to their particular interests. </P>

<P>This entire educational enterprise is set against the backdrop of the Christian faith. As our founder George Pepperdine stated in his inaugural address, educating a person without addressing the moral implications of decisions made makes one dangerous to society and others. We aspire to produce graduates who are passionate about how their education can be used to benefit others and to make our world a better place for all. </P>

<P>If you find this kind of education appealing, Seaver College is likely an excellent choice for you. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2822">History of Seaver College </H3>

<P>Pepperdine University was originally established in 1937 as a small, residential, mostly undergraduate liberal arts college in what is now South Central Los Angeles. A generous gift of 138 acres from the Rindge-Adamson family allowed Pepperdine to develop the Malibu campus, which opened to students in the fall of 1972. The Frank R. Seaver College was officially dedicated in 1975. </P>

<P>Frank Seaver was a generous supporter of independent higher education in California. His widow, Blanche Seaver, was the primary benefactor in the development of the Malibu campus, donating millions of dollars to the University in honor of her late husband. </P>

<P>Mr. Seaver, son of a pioneering California family, graduated in 1905 from Pomona College. He married Blanche Ellen Theodora Ebert, the child of Norwegian immigrants, in 1916. Mr. Seaver founded Hydril Company, which developed equipment essential for oil-drilling operations. The couple became interested in Pepperdine University in the early 1960s, and Pepperdine was named as a beneficiary to Mr. Seaver’s will when he died in 1964. In subsequent years, Mrs. Seaver devoted much time, money, and energy to ensuring the growth of Pepperdine University, the development of the Malibu campus, and the success of Seaver College. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2823">The Educational Philosophy of Seaver College </H3>

<P>Seaver College stresses both academic excellence and Christian values. Its programs emphasize the importance of thinking critically and creatively, communicating effectively, feeling keenly, and exploring thoroughly. The curriculum has been designed to enable students to acquire both breadth and depth of knowledge, and the liberal arts core of general education courses emphasizes skills and broad knowledge in several areas, including communication, humanities, fine arts, international studies, natural science, religion, and social science. Specialization in an academic major or minor provides students the opportunity to develop depth of knowledge as they pursue career and life goals consistent with individual interests and skills. </P>

<P>Seaver College faculty members are committed both to excellent classroom teaching and to meaningful scholarship. Faculty members publish broadly, present papers at meetings of professional societies, hold offices in professional organizations, and conduct innovative research. While engaging in many scholarly activities, faculty members remain committed to the challenge of nurturing the intellectual growth of students. Students at Seaver College have the unique opportunity of establishing close, professional mentoring relationships with their professors. </P>

<P>A degree from Seaver College signifies that the recipient has completed a rigorous undergraduate education under the guidance of professors who are committed to high academic standards and to Christian values. The graduate leaves Seaver College with a rich foundation of knowledge essential to a meaningful personal life and a system of values necessary for coping with the complexities of modern society. </P>

<P>Health Center </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2826">The Student Health Center (SHC) is committed to providing high-quality, low-cost healthcare to our diverse community of students. Its primary focus is keeping students healthy by providing preventive care, timely treatment of injuries and illness, and making appropriate referrals when necessary. The SHC emphasizes health education and aims to provide care in a confidential, respectful, and safe environment. </P>

<P>The SHC provides a wide variety of services, including care for respiratory problems, women’s and men’s health, dermatology, allergy, immunizations, labs, in-house testing, nutrition, and massage therapy. All procedures are confidential and protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which protects the disclosure of health information. </P>

<P>The SHC strives to keep costs low, and students’ insurance companies often cover all or some portion of the costs. Students may pay for SHC services with cash, personal check, or as a charge to their student account. The center will provide information to be submitted to their insurance company for reimbursement. Students enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) must first be seen at the SHC to be referred to an outside specialist. </P>

<P>The SHC is open Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 5 PM. Students are encouraged to make appointments either online or by phone. For more information, visit

<Sect>
<H5>Limitations </H5>

<P>Admission to a graduate or post-baccalaureate certificate program is valid only for the term indicated in the acceptance letter. Seaver College does not defer admission.

</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Classification of Graduate Admission Status </H5>

<P>Admission for graduate work is not necessarily synonymous with admission to the program leading to the master’s degree or post-baccalaureate certificate, and permission to enroll in graduate programs does not imply that the student is, or will be, automatically guaranteed the right to continue in a degree or certificate program. </P>

<P>Regular Status: For admission with regular status, applicants must meet the minimum requirements for admission together with any and all requirements specified by the school, major division, or program in which the work is to be taken. </P>

<P>Students may be admitted with regular status to work toward the master’s degree or post-baccalaureate certificate if they have maintained a 3.000 GPA or better in the field of their undergraduate major, or a 2.500 overall undergraduate academic GPA in an accredited institution. They must also have maintained a 3.000 GPA in all graduate work. </P>

<P>Students who do not have all the prerequisites for admission to graduate study in the academic discipline may be admitted with regular status with prerequisites. Such prerequisite courses are indicated in the acceptance letter and must be made a part of the student’s program of study, thus increasing the number of credit units required for graduation. </P>

<P>Provisional Status: Provisional status may be granted to students whose academic records indicate deficiencies but suggest some promise of success in graduate study. Students with provisional status must earn grades of A (4.000) or B (3.000) in their first 12 units of graduate credit in order to continue graduate study. A B- (2.700) is not an acceptable grade for clearing provisional status. Grades must be B (3.000) or above. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2837">Students may attend with provisional status for one term only, renewable with permission until provisions are met. No amount of credit taken while having provisional status will assure a student of regular admission. </P>

<P>Nondegree Status: Students may apply for nondegree enrollment if they do not wish to pursue a degree or credential but intend to have credits received from the University transferred elsewhere, or desire to take courses for personal enrichment only. No amount of nondegree course work taken will assure admission. Students with this status may not advance register and are not eligible for financial assistance. </P>

Students who drop units within flat rate (12–18) are not eligible for a refund. Students are responsible for dropping any class that is cancelled and may add another class in its place. </P>

<P>Students who withdraw from all classes after the initial registration and up until the last day of the add/drop period for the term will be charged a $150 withdrawal fee. </P>

<Sect>
<H3 id="LinkTarget_2847">Preregistration </H3>

<P>Any continuing student who has a current account will be permitted to preregister without additional payment until the designated due date. Students with accounts that have previously been in collections, however, are required to prepay for any future terms prior to registration. In the event that a student preregisters but fails subsequently to attend class, the student should formally withdraw through OneStop to avoid continued obligation for tuition and term fees that will accrue daily finance charges if not paid. </P>

<P>The $150 withdrawal fee will be applied to the accounts of students who preregister and do not attend class. The University reserves the right to cancel the course registration for any student who preregisters for a subsequent semester but fails to clear the student account balance of any outstanding charges by the end of the preceding semester. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Refund Policies </H3>

<P>University operating expenses and student charges are planned on an annual basis. The refund policies have been established in recognition of both the University’s advance commitment to operating expenses and a spirit of fairness for students who find it necessary to discontinue the use of University services. The tuition refund policies for dismissal and suspension are the same as for voluntary withdrawal. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Tuition </H5>

<P>Consideration for refund of tuition requires written notice from the student to OneStop of the student’s intention to drop a course or withdraw from the University. The date this notice is received by OneStop is the effective date for determining the refund amount according to the schedule below. </P>

<P>Part-time and graduate students who withdraw after the add/drop period but prior to the fifth week of school are subject to the percentage refund schedule. Tuition for classes not meeting on a regular semester schedule will be refunded in the same proportion as the class time below is to the total class time for a regular semester. Specific dates are contained in the Schedule of Classes for the fall and spring semesters. Consult the appropriate Schedule of Classes for the summer term policies. </P>

<P>Through the add/drop period* ..................................100% minus $150 </P>

<H5 id="LinkTarget_2848">Room and Board </H5>

<P>Students are responsible for room and board fees for the term of the Housing Contract once they have checked into an assigned room or apartment. For students arriving in the fall, the Housing Contract term is one academic year, from August to April. Withdrawing from the University is the only reason a contract is cancelled. Residents who withdraw from school during the year need to notify OneStop and officially check out with their RA. Room and board charges will be prorated from the date that they check out. Students who withdraw from the University or who petition and are approved for a contract release will be charged a contract release fee to their student account. Residents who are dismissed due to policy violations or move off campus without approval from the Housing and Residence Life Office are responsible for the entire room and board charges for the contract. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Overpayment Refunds </H5>

<P>Payments in excess of the amounts due the University may be rejected and returned to the payor. Students are responsible for accurate and timely payments. Any overpayment amounts accepted by the University may be refunded at the end of the term with the student’s written request. A $50 processing fee will be deducted from the amount of the refund. </P>

<P>Students applying for financial aid for the term please note: financial aid is not applied to your charges until the start of the term. If you need help determining the amount to pay before that time, please contact the Office of Student Accounts or OneStop for assistance. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Refunds-Account Credit Balances </H5>

<P>Credit balances resulting from financial aid will be processed automatically after add/drop ends. Refunds will be issued through direct deposit, which means the funds will be sent directly to a bank account (determined by the student) once the refund is processed. Students will be required to sign up online with their bank information. Students who do not sign up for direct deposit will be issued a check mailed to their campus mailbox. Credits from Parent Federal Direct PLUS Loans will be issued as a check mailed to the borrower of the loan, unless indicated on the Federal Direct PLUS application that the refund should go to the student. </P>

<P>To receive a refund for any credit balance not related to financial aid remaining on the student’s account after all charges and credits have been processed, the student must make a request to the Office of Student Accounts for a refund, either in writing or through their Pepperdine email account. </P>

<P>Refund payments of credit balances will not be made until all funds have cleared the bank and are showing on the student’s account; this includes credits from loan funds, checks, and dropped courses. If the credit includes a payment by check, there is a 10-day waiting period before the funds may be returned. </P>

<P>Students should consult with the Office of Financial Assistance concerning the effect of withdrawal or change in course load on financial assistance. The student must pay all charges owed at the time of withdrawal or dismissal. </P>

<H3>Security Interest in Student Records </H3>

<P>A student may not receive any diploma, certificate, or transcript until all accounts, current or otherwise, have been settled in accordance with University policies described above. Such documents will be retained by Pepperdine University as security for such obligations until they are satisfied. </P>

<P>If a student defaults on payment of a student Pepperdine Institutional loan or student account balance, all records will be held until the student either pays off the balance owed or brings the loan or account to current status. In addition, every student with a Pepperdine Institutional loan must complete an exit interview with the Accounts Resolution Office before any records will be released. Each student also agrees to pay all costs of collection upon default including, but not limited to, collection agency fees, attorney fees, and location searches. </P>

<H3>Financial Assistance </H3>

<P>Pepperdine University offers financial assistance to eligible students through federal, state, private, and University-funded programs. However, the University believes that parents and students have the primary responsibility for meeting the cost of their education. NOTE: Funds provided by the University may not in themselves, or when combined with state grants, exceed the need level (as calculated by the federal formula) or the cost of attendance. </P>

<P>All financial assistance provided to Seaver College students is administered by and coordinated through the Office of Financial Assistance, located on the second floor of the Thornton Administrative Center. </P>

<P>Pepperdine University awards financial assistance on the basis of verified financial need or merit and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, disability, or prior military service. </P>

<H5 id="LinkTarget_2851">Seaver Undergraduate Financial Assistance Policy </H5>

<P>Seaver students are limited to a maximum of eight regular semesters (fall/spring) of financial assistance. After eight regular semesters of aid, students will no longer be eligible to receive institutional, federal, or state aid. Students pursuing additional major(s) and/or minor(s) are also limited to the maximum of eight regular semesters of financial assistance as well as summer sessions completed before graduation. If students want to pursue an additional degree, they may be eligible to borrow through federal loans, provided they have not yet reached their aggregate loan limits, and/or may qualify for outside sources of financial assistance such as outside scholarships and/or private loans. Students may also inquire within their major’s department regarding departmental scholarship opportunities. </P>

<P>Financial assistance is intended for full-time students (12–18 units) per semester. Students enrolled in 19 units or more may qualify for loans to cover the difference. If during the fall/spring semester(s) a student’s enrollment drops below full-time status, their institutional financial assistance (grants and scholarships) will be prorated based on the revised tuition charges. Institutional grants/scholarships will be prorated using the same tuition grant percentage (TGP) that they receive based on full-time enrollment during the current regular academic year. This TGP is not the same TGP used to calculate summer grant tuition percentages. The academic year federal and state aid will also be prorated. Students must enroll in a minimum of six units to qualify for most federal and state financial assistance. Students are encouraged to reference the proration guide and to utilize the online proration calculator on our website for additional information.</P>

<P> Students enrolled in the five-year bachelor of science/MBA program will no longer qualify for Seaver undergraduate financial assistance once they are no longer enrolled at Seaver. Financial assistance may be available at the Pepperdine Graziadio Business School for the remaining semesters if they qualify. </P>

<H5 id="LinkTarget_2853">Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy </H5>

<P>Pepperdine University is required by federal regulations (34 CFR 668.16(e), 668.32(f), and 668.34) to establish specific standards for measuring Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for students receiving financial assistance. Pursuant to federal law, the University’s SAP policy ensures that all students who receive University, state, private, and/or federal financial aid progress toward degree completion. The Office of Financial Assistance will monitor compliance with the SAP policy for each student. Students must meet the requirements of the SAP policy outlined below to be eligible to receive financial aid. Questions about SAP policy should be addressed to the Office of Financial Assistance. </P>

<P>The SAP standards consist of the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>GPA Standard: students must maintain a minimum cumulative 2.000 GPA. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Pace Standard: students must maintain a 67 percent completion rate of all attempted units per semester, which will be re-evaluated at the close of each term. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Maximum Time Frame Standard: Students cannot exceed 150 percent of the units and time normally required to complete an academic program. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>GPA Standard: This standard is a qualitative measure of progress as determined by the student’s cumulative grade point average (GPA). Undergraduates must maintain at least a 2.000 Pepperdine cumulative GPA in all attempted units and complete a minimum of 12 units per semester. Graduate students must meet the minimum GPA (3.000) required by their program. </P>

<P>Pace Standard: This standard is a quantitative measure of progress that calculates the pace at which a student is moving toward program completion by dividing the number of units completed by the number of units attempted. Undergraduate and graduate students must successfully complete for credit 67 percent of the units they attempt. For example, students who attempt 16 units during their fall semester must pass 11 units or more to meet Pace Standard [(11/16) x 100 = 68%]. Please note the following regarding attempted units and completion rate (pace). </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must complete at least 67% of all attempted units including transfer units if applicable. For example if a student has attempted 18 units, the minimum earned hours must be 13. See the chart below for </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Classes with grades of A, B, C, D, and Cr (credit) are considered to have been completed. Classes with grades of F, NC (no credit), I (incomplete) and WD, W, WF (grade withheld) will not be considered as completed but will be calculated in the attempted units. </LBody>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Courses graded as Incomplete, Failed, Not Passed, or Withdrawn count toward attempted units. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>In the event that a student receives permission to repeat a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. Only the first repeat of a passed course may be covered using federal financial aid. Any second or subsequent repetition of a passed course may not be covered using federal financial aid funds. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Transfer units will be counted toward both the attempted and completed units that have been accepted by the University for degree credit. The maximum number of transfer units the University will accept is 64. </LBody>

<P>Maximum Time Frame Standard: This standard is also a quantitative measure of progress; it determines whether a student is completing the academic program within a reasonable overall time frame, based on both units attempted and years enrolled. The maximum time frame is calculated by multiplying the units/time normally required to complete an academic program by 150 percent. An undergraduate degree requires 128 units, and students are expected to complete their undergraduate degree by the end of four years of full-time study. Therefore, the maximum time frame for an undergraduate student’s degree completion is 192 attempted units (128 required units x 150% = 192 possible attempted units), or six years of full-time enrollment (4 years x 150% = 6 possible years), whichever comes first. Graduate students must complete all degree requirements within 150 percent of the maximum time frame described in the Academic Catalog and measured in attempted units. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2854">Monitoring SAP Standards </H5>

<P>The Office of Financial Assistance will monitor GPA, Pace, and Maximum Time Frame Standards for undergraduate and graduate students at the end of each fall, spring, and summer term. Students who fail to meet SAP standards will be notified via email of the impact on their aid eligibility. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2855">Warning Status </H5>

<P>Students who fail to meet SAP for the first time (excluding students who have already exceeded their maximum number of units attempted or years enrolled) are placed on Warning Status for one term and are expected to meet SAP standards by the end of the following term of enrollment. Students who fail to meet SAP requirements the following term will be placed on financial aid suspension (FAS). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2856">Financial Aid Suspension (FAS) </H5>

<P>Students on FAS are not eligible to receive financial assistance, and all aid (federal, state, and University) will be cancelled for future semesters unless the student successfully appeals the suspension and is placed on financial aid probation. Students may also gain future financial aid eligibility, subject to availability of funds, if they are allowed to enroll at their own expense and do well enough in their course work to regain SAP. Please note that this will only make students eligible for future aid once reinstated; it is not retroactive. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2857">SAP Appeal Guidelines </H5>

<P>If special circumstances cause a student to be placed on FAS as a result of failure to meet SAP standards, a written appeal may be submitted. Specific instructions for submitting a SAP appeal will be emailed to the student. Examples of special circumstances include, but are not limited to, death of an immediate family member, injury, or medical condition of the student. The SAP appeal must address and document these special circumstances and describe how those circumstances have changed to allow for the student to demonstrate SAP at the next evaluation. The student will be notified via email of the decision to approve or deny financial aid eligibility. SAP appeals must be submitted by the stated deadline to the Office of Financial Assistance and must include the Appeal Form and supporting documentation. Incomplete SAP appeals or those missing adequate documentation will not be reviewed. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2858">Financial Aid Probation </H5>

<P>Students who have successfully appealed FAS are placed on probation status. Students on probation are eligible to receive financial aid for one semester, subject to availability of funds, after which the student must meet SAP or the requirements of his/her academic plan approved by Academic Advising/OneStop. Financial aid probation is for financial aid purposes only and is separate from academic or disciplinary policies for other University scholarships. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2859">Conduct </H5>

<P>Eligibility for financial assistance provided from University resources is partially based upon a student’s personal conduct and citizenship. Students who demonstrate behavior inconsistent with established University guidelines and policies for personal conduct, as outlined in the student conduct codes (
<Link>pepperdine.edu/admission/student-life/policies</Link>
), may forfeit their institutional awards. Students who engage in illegal activities as defined by state and federal law may forfeit all financial assistance immediately, even if charges are not formally filed against them. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2860">Return of Federal Funds </H5>

<P>A student who withdraws from all classes may lose eligibility to keep the full amount of disbursed federal funds. The withdrawal date will determine the amount of unearned aid. Seaver College is required to return unearned federal Title IV funds (Federal Direct Loan Program, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program) as stated in Federal Regulations, 34 CFR parts 668, 682, and 685, Return of Title IV Aid. The amount of federal funding returned is determined by Return of Title IV Funds Program calculations. Funds are returned in the following order: Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, Federal Direct PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal SEOG. Additional information regarding return of federal funds may be obtained from the Office of Financial Assistance. </P>

<P>The return of federal funds may result in an outstanding balance on the student’s account. If a student’s account is not paid in full by the due date, it will accrue finance charges and late fees. Outstanding balances on a student account may prevent students from preregistering, and academic transcripts will not be released. </P>

<P>Pepperdine Grant </P>

<P>Pepperdine Grant funds are made available from University resources. This grant is need-based with an academic component.

Students must maintain a minimum </P>

<P>2.0 cumulative GPA and Satisfactory Academic Progress to continue receiving this grant each semester.

<P>Academic Scholarships </P>

<P>Pepperdine University’s academic scholarship program rewards the academic achievement of entering freshmen and transfer students.

The awards are renewable for as many as four years total or eight semesters as long as the student qualifies. </P>

<P>Students who receive academic scholarships must maintain at least a 3.25 Pepperdine cumulative GPA and full-time status, and may not be placed on academic or disciplinary probation while at Pepperdine. For those students who apply and qualify for need-based financial assistance, the academic scholarship will become part of the financial assistance package, coordinated with other aid, and may be adjusted according to financial need. </P>

<P>Graduate Student Fellowships and Assistantships </P>

<P>Fellowships and assistantships for a limited number of highly qualified graduate students are available. Students should contact divisional deans for specific details on fellowships and assistantships. </P>

<P>Outside/Private Scholarships </P>

Your local high school counselor may be able to refer you to local scholarship sources. You may also research outside and private scholarship sources on our website or on the internet at 
<Link>finaid.org</Link>
. Outside and private scholarships must be coordinated with the need-based award according to established University policies. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2870">It is the responsibility of the student to be familiar with and complete the requirements for the degree being sought. The faculty and staff of Seaver College will assist each student, but it is the student who must ensure that all general education, major, degree, and graduation requirements have been completed in the manner outlined in this catalog. </P>

<P>The University reserves the right to change its academic policies and requirements. Such changes will be publicized to minimize inconvenience to students. Although most policy changes will apply to all uniformly, students may be allowed to fulfill degree requirements as stated in the Seaver College catalog of the year of first enrollment. </P>

<P>Seaver College reserves the right to modify or discontinue any academic offerings or degree programs when demand falls below reasonable levels. In such cases, the College will make reasonable efforts to allow current students to complete the program or will assist in their transfer to other acceptable programs or institutions. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Academic Policies for All Students </H3>

<P>Academic Advising </P>

<P>Every admitted student is assigned an advisor from the Academic Advising Center to assist in planning a program of study in conjunction with the student’s first-year seminar advisor and/or major advisor. </P>

<P>Students without declared majors are encouraged to take advantage of services and assistance available from the Career Center and Academic Advising Center. </P>

<P>Students are also encouraged to maintain close contact with their faculty and academic advisors in order to plan their college programs properly. Seaver College seeks to provide the information and advising assistance that students need in their academic career. </P>

<P>One of the most important academic tools, in addition to personal contact with the academic advisor, is this catalog. It is the responsibility of each student to become thoroughly familiar with the catalog in order to be certain that all requirements are being met. </P>

<P>Academic Internships </P>

<P>Seaver College defines an academic internship as a structured, supervised, professional work experience within an organization. The internship is guided by learning goals and reflective assignments. It is supervised academically by a faculty member and professionally by an internship supervisor. </P>

<P>All academic internships must be approved in advance, and students must be concurrently enrolled in academic internship units. Students who have completed 25% or more of their total internship work hours and have failed to register may no longer enroll in units related to that particular internship. </P>

<P>Individual majors or internship courses may have additional requirements Students studying in F-1 visa status must additionally be authorized for curricular practical training by the Office of International Student Services (OISS) in order to participate in an internship. </P>

<P>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities </P>

<P>Pepperdine University is committed to complying with all mandates set forth in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students should contact the Office of Student Accessibility (OSA) before their academic program begins to register with the office. Upon verification of the student’s disability, the OSA will work with each student on a case-by-case basis to determine appropriate accommodations while maintaining the academic integrity of the courses. </P>

<P>Students should expect a two-week time frame for registration in which the documentation and accommodation request will be reviewed. If the documentation is incomplete and/or does not meet the guidelines, students will be required to submit complete documentation before accommodations may be granted. </P>

<P>Students who have completed registration with the OSA will receive accommodation letters that they may provide to faculty to verify their accommodations. Registered students must request accommodations each term through a completed Semester Request. Students are expected to be in close communication with professors and OSA regarding the implementation of accommodations. </P>

<P>Inquiries should be addressed to the Office of Student Accessibility at (310) 506-6500. Please visit 
<Link>pepperdine.edu/student-accessibility</Link>
 for further information regarding documentation guidelines, office forms, and resources for students. </P>

<P>Add/Drop Policy </P>

<P>Students may add and/or drop courses during designated periods for the semester (consult the academic calendar in this catalog for exact dates). The student’s transcript will not show any course that has been dropped during this period. Students who drop all of their courses after the initial registration through the last day of add/drop will be charged a $150 withdrawal fee. Special policies apply for students enrolled in courses which do not follow the traditional semester calendar. Additional information is available from OneStop. Students are responsible for dropping any class that is cancelled but may add another class in its place. </P>

<P>Auditing a Course </P>

<P>Students may audit certain classes, space permitting, with the consent of the instructor. An audited course will appear on the student’s transcript, but units are not earned, and no grade is assigned. Audited classes cannot fulfill any program requirements. In addition, students may not later take for credit or challenge any class they have previously audited. </P>

<P>An audit fee is assessed for students who attend class but are not enrolled. Please refer to the Financial Policies section of the catalog for more information. Students should contact OneStop to initiate this process. Physical education courses, studio art classes, and private music lessons may not be audited. Persons who only audit courses for a term are considered visitors during that particular term. If a person does not have an active student record for an established academic plan, she or he must first be admitted with a nondegree status. </P>

<P>Students in nonimmigrant visitor status (B1/B2, Waiver/ESTA) are not eligible for nondegree enrollment. Also, students who enroll with nondegree status are not eligible for financial assistance or issued a Form I-20 for study. </P>

<P>Basis of Academic Credit </P>

<P>Academic credit in the Seaver College curriculum is granted in semester units. </P>

<P>Changes of Curriculum (Major or Minor) or Advisor </P>

<P>Students are required to notify the University if there is a change in their major or minor. A student whose major is not listed correctly with the University will not have access to a Degree Audit Report (see more information on the DAR on page 
<Link>63</Link>
) that correctly reflects the requirements needed to earn the degree. In order to change a major, minor, or advisor, students should contact OneStop in person or via Pepperdine email or the division office offering the intended major and file a change request. </P>

<P>Code of Academic Integrity </P>

<P>The Seaver College Code of Academic Integrity is a crucial part of the educational process. It makes possible an atmosphere conducive to the development of the total person. The Code of Academic Integrity attempts to stimulate not only intellectual growth but also spiritual, ethical, and emotional growth. Seaver College’s Code of Academic Integrity fosters among students, faculty, and administrators a spirit of community where such development can take place. Furthermore, it creates a climate of mutual trust, respect, and interpersonal concern in which openness and integrity prevail. </P>

<P>The code emphasizes the dignity of each individual in pursuing self-improvement and developing full personal potential. It provides free competition and independent intellectual effort, not tolerating dishonesty, cheating, or plagiarism in any form. Each member of the Seaver College community is expected to adhere to and enforce the code. </P>

<P>A full statement of the Seaver College Code of Academic Integrity is included in the Student Handbook and is available at 
<Link>seaver.pepperdine.edu/ </Link>

<Link>academics/academic-support/integrity</Link>
. It is the obligation of every Seaver student to be familiar with this code. </P>

<P>Credit Hour Policy </P>

<P>One credit hour earned in lecture, seminar, and discussion work should represent one hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work per week during a fifteen week academic semester. A minimum of 45 hours of student work is expected for each credit hour in classes in which the instructional time is partially or wholly occupied with seminar, studio, field, clinical, or laboratory work; or internships, service learning, directed study, or intensive semester (e.g. summer or courses offered in shorter form) experiences. </P>

<P>Cross-Registration </P>

<P>Students who are not admitted to an established Pepperdine joint-degree program may still enroll for a limited number of courses in the University’s other four schools. Permission must be given by both the appropriate associate dean or designated administrator of the other school and the instructor of the course. Students should also have the permission of their academic advisor to ensure that the course taken will apply to their degree program. Students must complete the Cross-Registration Enrollment Form and may enroll only if space is available in the course. Students may not enroll in a course at the University’s four other schools if the same course is offered at Seaver College. </P>

<P>For complete information regarding how tuition will be charged for students enrolled in cross-registered courses, please contact the Office of Student Accounts. </P>

<P>Declaration of a Concentration or Emphasis </P>

<P>Several majors require students to declare an outside concentration or specialization. Students should meet with the advisor of their intended major to seek further information. </P>

<P>Degree Audit Report </P>

<P>The Degree Audit Report (DAR) is a record of the student’s personalized degree plan and an analysis of academic progress of the student based on the catalog requirements for a degree. The report includes the student’s major or pre-major curriculum, general education requirements, areas of concentration or emphasis, minor, and electives. Transfer credits that have been accepted are also reflected in the report. The Academic Advising Center does record maintenance either automatically through normal registration processes or manually for substitutions, waivers, and other exceptions that are made to the student’s degree plan. The DAR is available to students and faculty members through WaveNet and serves as an important advising tool. </P>

<P>Exceptions to Academic Policy </P>

<P>The Seaver Credits Committee is the faculty body that reviews all exception requests. Students seeking an exception to any Seaver College academic policy may contact OneStop for assistance with the petition process. </P>

<P>Grade Dispute Policy </P>

<P>Grades measure student performance and serve as a means of determining graduation eligibility and honors. As such, Seaver College recognizes that a fair and rigorous assessment of student course work is vital to the mission of the school and wishes to ensure that disagreements arising over assigned grades are handled promptly, fairly, and professionally. </P>

<P>This policy outlines the procedure that students must follow to dispute a grade received in a course at Seaver College. The process of disputing a grade assignment must be initiated by the student before the midpoint of the next non-summer semester which immediately follows the course in question. Most grade issues can and should be resolved privately between the student and instructor. This is the starting point with all grade disputes. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by these means, the following appeals procedure shall apply: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>The student shall submit a written appeal to the divisional dean with a copy to the instructor, identifying the course, semester, grade received, and the reason for the appeal. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>The student shall assemble all relevant class materials (syllabi, returned assignments, tests, papers, etc.) distributed or returned by the instructor to the student. These materials need to be compiled within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. If the student cannot assemble all such documents, the grade dispute is concluded with no grade change. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Concurrently, the instructor will assemble all relevant class materials retained for this student (final exams, midterms, etc.) within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. A copy of these documents along with the syllabus, grade book, and the instructor’s written response to the student appeal is to be forwarded by the instructor to the divisional dean. If the instructor cannot produce all relevant documents pertinent to the student’s work in the course, the grade dispute will be taken up by the instructor’s divisional dean in consultation with the associate dean. </LBody>
</LI>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>The divisional dean will appoint an ad hoc committee of two faculty members within the division who teach the course (or a similar one) in question. This committee will then evaluate the student’s course materials based on the following criteria: </LBody>
</LI>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Have all assignments and examinations been administered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the course syllabus? </LBody>

<LBody>Has all student work been graded fairly, consistently, and accurately? </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</L>
</L>

<P>At the conclusion of the committee’s evaluation of the course material, it will submit a written recommendation and explanation to the divisional dean. The recommendation must be one of the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Uphold the grade given by the instructor, or </LBody>

</L>

<P>• Recommend a specified grade change. Based on the ad hoc committee’s findings, it shall be the divisional dean’s decision, in consultation with the associate dean of Seaver College, as to </P>

<P>whether the grade shall be changed. This decision will be final. No further appeal in possible. </P>

<P>Incomplete and In-Progress Courses </P>

<P>A grade of I, indicating incomplete work, is assigned to a student who has attended class but, because of a documented emergency in the last quarter of the term, fails to complete required course work. The student must initiate the I request at the Academic Advising Center and upon approval, must complete a contract with the professor in order to receive an I. If an I is assigned at the end of the fall semester, the course work must be completed by the date specified in the student’s contract with the instructor but no later than the end of the subsequent spring semester or the I will default to an F. If an I is assigned at the end of either the spring semester or the summer term, the I will default to an F at the end of the following fall semester. Courses taken on a Cr/NC basis will default to NC if not completed on time. A shorter period of time for completion may be assigned at the instructor’s request. In such cases, the student will not be notified by the Office of Student Information and Services that the I grade has lapsed into the F grade. Students requesting an extension of the I deadline must petition the Credits Committee before the deadline. (See “Exceptions to Academic Policy.”) Students with financial assistance should refer to the financial assistance policies and how these grades may affect eligibility. </P>

<P>A grade of IP is assigned at the end of the semester only in courses which, by catalog definition, are allowed more than one semester for completion, e.g., student teaching, graduate readings, graduate theses, and graduate projects. Students who receive a grade of I or IP should not re-enroll in the course for the subsequent semester. Different policies may apply for Incompletes resulting from disciplinary action. </P>

<P>Instructor-Initiated Drop </P>

<P>Students who improperly register for any course may be subject to an instructor-initiated drop. That is, prior to or during the add/drop period, the division or the instructor of the course in question may notify the registrar to drop the student from the course. Improper registration includes registering without the prerequisites stated in this catalog, registering in upper-level courses before having successfully completed 30 units if placement examination requirements have not been met, and registering without the instructor’s permission as specified in certain courses. </P>

<P>Students who fail to attend a course within the first 100 minutes of scheduled class meeting time may be dropped from the course by the instructor. Instructor-initiated drop is not automatic for students who improperly register or who do not attend the first 100 minutes of class. It is the student’s responsibility to drop or withdraw from a class that he or she fails to attend since instructor-initiated drops do not apply automatically. </P>

<P>Intent to Graduate </P>

<P>The Office of Student Information and Services contacts each potential graduate prior to the deadline to apply for each graduation. To apply for graduation, potential graduates must confirm their intent to graduate and their diploma address information either through WaveNet or in person at OneStop. The deadline to indicate one’s intent to graduate is included in the notification. </P>

<P>Students failing to indicate their intent to graduate by the deadline for the semester in which they plan to complete their degree may not be allowed to graduate in that semester. </P>

<P>Commencement exercises are held at the end of the spring semester. Degrees are posted to reflect the same official date of graduation on the diploma and on the transcript of academic record. </P>

<P>International Students </P>

<P>International students registering at Seaver College for the first time are required to attend all international student orientation sessions conducted by advisors in the Office of International Student Services and to report to the immigration advisor (DSO) for immigration clearance. International students may take an English placement exam in order to be placed into the proper general education English course, and, if applicable, a foreign language placement exam in order to seek advanced placement or to satisfy the GE foreign language requirement. Please see “Placement Examinations” for further information. More information regarding immigration, credentials evaluation, and Degree Audit Reports is available from the Office of International Student Services or at 
<Link>pepperdine.edu/international-students</Link>
. </P>

<P>Maximum Credit Policy for Summer Sessions </P>

<P>Students may not register for more than eight units per summer session without permission from their academic advisor. Summer courses, while taught in a compressed time period, still require work equivalent to a semester-length course. Even a single course can create a considerable workload, and consideration of this workload should weigh heavily in decisions to take more than one class per session. </P>

<P>Prerequisites </P>

<P>Students must complete 30 semester units of college work before enrolling in upper-division (300–500 level) courses. In addition, many courses have prerequisites, which are listed in the Seaver College catalog. Students who have not met the prerequisites for a course may be dropped from the course by the instructor or division prior to or during the first week of class. </P>

<P>Readmission of Military Service Members </P>

<P>Students who cannot attend Pepperdine because of military service will be readmitted with the same academic status achieved when they last attended or were accepted to the University. The student must notify Pepperdine of the military service and the intention to return to school as follows: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Notification of military service. The student (or an appropriate officer of the armed forces or official of the Department of Defense) must give oral or written notice of such service to the school as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Notification of intent to return to school. The student must also give oral or written notice of an intent to return to Pepperdine within three years after the completion of the period of service. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>A student’s readmission rights terminate in the case of a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, general court-martial, federal or state prison sentence, or other reasons as described in 34 CFR 668.18(h) federal regulations. </P>

<P>For additional information, please contact the Veterans Affairs Office: </P>

<P>(310) 506-7999. </P>

<P>Registration </P>

<P>An official registration period is scheduled for each semester. After the official registration period, a late registration fee is charged. Students who do not complete registration properly or who fail to secure final approval from the Office of Student Information and Services are not considered officially enrolled, may not attend courses, and will be denied all credit for the semester. </P>

<P>Transcripts of Academic Records </P>

<P>Transcripts are furnished upon payment of a fee for each transcript issued. Normally, official transcripts are delivered by mail. Official transcripts can be given to the student only in a sealed envelope. If the seal is broken, the transcript ceases to be official. Students may request transcripts at OneStop or at 
<Link>pepperdine.edu/registrar/transcripts</Link>
. For pick¬up or walk-in service, the request should be filed at OneStop at least one day before the transcript is needed. More time may be required for transcripts from semesters prior to January 1987. At the end of each semester, two weeks may be required to process a transcript request due to grade processing and degree postings. Requests for partial transcripts will not be accepted. No transcript will be supplied for course work taken at other institutions. The Office of Student Information and Services will not release transcripts unless the student has made satisfactory arrangements with the Office of Student Accounts. (See the Security Interest in Student Records policy in the Financial Information section of this catalog.) Current students may obtain unofficial transcripts through WaveNet. </P>

<P>Veterans and Standards of Progress Information </P>

<P>Veterans, service people, and qualified dependents intending to use VA benefits should contact the VA coordinator and be aware of the following policies: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>It is the student’s responsibility to notify the VA coordinator immediately when increasing or decreasing unit load, withdrawing, or taking a leave of absence. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Appropriate credit for previous education will be granted. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>All students using VA benefits must make satisfactory progress toward their educational objectives. In general, unsatisfactory progress for veterans’ benefits is considered attainment of less than a 2.000 GPA for two consecutive semesters (3.000 for graduate students). In addition, the VA will only reimburse students for classes required to earn their degree. Students who withdraw from the college may have their benefits terminated as of the date of withdrawal. Students who fail to complete all courses attempted in a semester will have their benefits adjusted. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Students who withdraw from a course (or courses) in the middle of the semester will have their benefits adjusted based on the date of withdrawal. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>For graduate students who are veterans: in the academic year, full time enrollment is defined as eight or more units; three-quarter is five to seven units; half-time is four units, and less than half-time is one to three units. In the summer, full-time enrollment is four units; three-quarter time is three units; half-time is two units; less than half-time is one unit. Students granted permission to enroll in GR 699 are classified as full-time. For information on status definitions for federal financial aid, please see “Full-Time and Part-Time Student Status” in the catalog sections dealing with academic policies for graduate students. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Withdrawal from Courses </P>

<P>Prior to the end of the eighth week of a semester (second week during the summer session), a student may withdraw from any course by contacting OneStop by Pepperdine email or in person. The transcript will indicate a grade of W for such withdrawals. No financial adjustment will be made for withdrawals after the fifth week of a semester or the second week of a summer session. Students should be aware that adding and withdrawing from classes may result in charges over and above the flat-rate tuition charge. Special policies are in effect for students enrolled in classes that do not follow the traditional semester calendar. </P>

<P>Students wishing to withdraw from a course after the end of the eighth week of the semester must do so through OneStop no later than one week prior to the last day of regular class meetings. The instructor will assign a grade of WP indicating withdraw passing, WF indicating withdraw failing, or WP/NC in Cr/NC classes, depending on the student’s status at the time of last attendance. The WF will be calculated as an F in the GPA. </P>

<P>Students who have attended classes but who do not officially withdraw will automatically be assigned an F by their instructors. Students may not withdraw from a first-year seminar unless they are completely withdrawing from the University. </P>

<P>Withdrawals are official only upon timely written notification to OneStop. Information or changes in the registration of any student receiving veterans’ benefits will be forwarded to the Veterans Administration whenever such changes occur. </P>

<P>International students in F-1 visa status must obtain permission from the Office of International Student Services before withdrawing from courses if they cannot maintain full-time enrollment, consisting of at least 12 units. </P>

<P>Withdrawal from the College </P>

<P>A student who fails to attend class or leaves Seaver College for any reason must officially withdraw through OneStop. In addition, students living on campus who withdraw after the add/drop period must check out with the Housing and Residence Life Office. Only those students who follow these procedures are considered to have withdrawn officially. The withdrawal fee policy applies. (See Add/Drop Policy in this section.) International students in F-1 visa status must obtain clearance from the Office of International Student Services before withdrawing from the University. </P>
</Sect>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2871">Academic Policies for Undergraduate Students </H3>

<P>Academic Probation and Dismissal </P>

<P>A minimum GPA of 2.000 (C) for work taken at Seaver College and for work done in the major(s) is required for the bachelor’s degree. When a student’s cumulative GPA falls below 2.000, that student is placed on academic probation, which is considered a warning. Any student on academic probation must: (1) earn a minimum GPA of 2.000 in the next term of enrollment, and (2) be removed from academic probation within one calendar year. Failure to meet either stipulation will result in academic dismissal. Before requesting readmission, students who are academically dismissed must demonstrate successful completion of a full load of classes elsewhere for at least one term and fulfill all other requirements as specified by the Credits Committee. </P>

<P>A student is considered in good academic standing unless he or she is placed on continued academic probation. Continued academic probation occurs when a student on academic probation earns a term GPA of 2.000 or higher in the subsequent academic semester, but his or her cumulative GPA remains below 2.000. Students on continued academic probation may remain enrolled but will no longer be considered in good academic standing. </P>

<P>International students in F-1 visa status who are placed on continued academic probation should promptly make an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO) in the Office of International Student Services for important immigration advisement. </P>

<P>Please consult the Academic Advising website for additional information: 
<Link>community.pepperdine.edu/seaver/academicadvising/probation</Link>
. Registration will be cancelled for any student who is dismissed after having registered in advance for a subsequent term. </P>

<P>Students receiving veterans’ benefits should consult the special veterans’ information section in this portion of the catalog for more important information concerning standards of progress for veterans. </P>

<P>Class Status </P>

<P>Class status is based on earned units and is defined as follows: </P>

<P>0–29 First-year </P>

<P>30–59 Sophomore </P>

<P>60–89 Junior </P>

<P>90 and more Senior </P>

<P>Concurrent Enrollment </P>

<P>Students may not be jointly enrolled at Seaver College and at another academic institution for purposes of transferring units to Seaver College without receiving the written approval of the Academic Advising Center in advance of such joint enrollment. Students must request such permission by completing a “Seaver Student Exception Request” form at OneStop </P>

<P>Students in F-1 visa status who wish to concurrently enroll at another institution should meet with a Designated School Official (DSO) in the Office of International Student Services to obtain a permission letter. </P>

<P>Convocation Series </P>

<P>From its beginning, Pepperdine has included regular assemblies where students gather to worship, hear engaging speakers encourage and challenge them with God’s word, and learn more about how they can make a difference in the world. The Seaver convocation program honors the vision of George Pepperdine, the University founder, as it endeavors to present, through teaching and example, the diverse manifestations of the Christian life. Convocation seeks to create open spaces, methods, conversations, and attitudes of Christian worship that cultivate continued growth through spiritual practices. Numerous convocation opportunities are offered each semester through weekly chapel services, small groups, and one-on-one mentoring. All Seaver undergraduate students participate in at least 14 events to earn an A. </P>

<P>All full-time Seaver undergraduate students will be enrolled each fall and spring semester in “SEAVER 200: Convocation Series,” which carries one half unit of credit for each semester, with a letter grade assigned according to the number of convocation events attended. This course applies to every regular semester of a student’s attendance up to, but not exceeding, eight semesters. Thus, the maximum number of SVR 200 credits that can be earned is four units, which do not count toward the 128 units required for degree completion. No tuition is charged for SVR 200, and all convocation credit accrued each semester is applied solely to the grade for that term. </P>

<P>Grading System: Attendance at convocation programs will be used to determine a grade that will be averaged into the student’s cumulative Pepperdine GPA. Units earned and grades assigned for SVR 200 will be calculated as part of the overall GPA of all Seaver graduates and will be counted in the calculation of all graduation honors. The grade earned each semester is determined as shown below: </P>

<P>Attendance Credit: Attendance is recorded by card readers. Students must have their Pepperdine student ID cards scanned upon entering and exiting to receive attendance credit, unless otherwise instructed. Card readers will automatically enter a “tardy” if a student arrives five minutes after the beginning of the program, and three tardies will result in the reduction of one attendance credit. Card readers will not count students present who are scanned in more than 10 minutes late or who are scanned out before the conclusion of the program. </P>

<P>Exemptions and Exceptions: Graduate, non-degree-seeking, part-time students, students over the age of 25, student teachers, and students enrolled in specific mandatory internships are automatically exempt from enrollment in the Convocation Series but have the option to do so.. Students wishing to request an exemption from attending the Convocation Series must complete an Exemption Request Form, located in the WaveNet “Convocation” pagelet, by the posted deadline. </P>

<P>Course Load </P>

<P>The standard course load for each semester is 16 units. An undergraduate student enrolled for 12 or more units is considered a full-time student. Students may enroll in more than 18 units only with permission of the Academic Advising Center and/or dean of the division in which the student’s major falls. Permission to enroll in more than 18 units will be granted only if the student’s GPA, employment schedule, maturity, and seriousness of purpose indicate that the student can successfully complete the proposed program. Students enrolled in more than 18 units will be charged an additional per-unit fee for every unit over 18. Students enrolled in fewer than 12 units are not eligible for on-campus housing. </P>

<P>Course Numbering System </P>

<P>Remedial-Level Courses: Courses numbered 000–99 are remedial in nature and do not count toward fulfilling any requirements for a degree. These units are not included in the total of 128 units required for the degree. Grades received for remedial courses are not calculated into the student’s GPA. </P>

<P>Lower-Division Courses: Courses numbered 100–299 are open to lower-division students and cannot be counted as upper-division work in any division. If a student receives permission to substitute a lower-division course for an upper-division requirement, the student receives lower-division units or credit for the course. </P>

<P>Upper-Division Courses: Courses numbered 300–599 are open only to students who have successfully completed 30 units of work. A minimum of 40 upper-division units must be included in the 128 units required for the bachelor’s degree. Students taking 500-level courses for graduate credit will be required to do assignments in addition to those required for undergraduates. </P>

<P>Credit/No Credit </P>

<P>A limited number of courses at Seaver College are offered with the grade of Cr (credit) for acceptable work or NC (no credit) for unacceptable work. Undergraduate students may choose to receive grades of Cr/NC rather than the usual letter grades in any course except those fulfilling the general education requirements or major or minor requirements. (Consult course descriptions for some courses in the major that may be taken for Cr/NC.) </P>

<P>Students must notify OneStop of their desire to receive Cr/NC grades before the end of the second week of classes in the fall and spring semesters and before the end of the fourth day in each summer session. A maximum of 16 units required for graduation at Seaver College, including physical education, may be taken as Cr/NC. </P>

<P>For undergraduate students, a grade of Cr is assigned to indicate work equivalent to an A, B, or C. A grade of NC is assigned to indicate work equivalent to a C-, D, or F. Credit/no credit grades are not computed into the overall semester GPA. If there is a question of academic probation or academic dismissal, each NC will be considered evidence of poor academic work. </P>

<P>Once a student has chosen the Cr/NC grading option, letter grades may not be assigned. When the grade of NC is assigned to a student in a course which is a prerequisite or a requirement, that course must be repeated. </P>

<P>Credit by Examination (Challenge Procedure) </P>

<P>Seaver College students may challenge certain courses designated as “challengeable” by each division’s faculty and receive credit by performing satisfactorily on examinations in the courses challenged. Students may challenge a particular class only once. Students who want to challenge a course must obtain written permission from the appropriate divisional dean and supervising faculty member. The divisional dean will designate a faculty member to compose or administer a challenge exam. The fee for the examination is listed in the “Financial Information” section of this catalog. Any credits earned are on a Cr/NC basis. </P>

<P>A maximum of two languages (totaling 16 units) offered at Seaver College may be challenged by examination. Students taking a language examination may earn credit for courses numbered 251 and 252 (four or eight units, including AP and CLEP credit) by scoring at the third- and fourth-semester college level on an objective exam and satisfactorily completing extra assignments given by a language professor. International students may not take challenge exams in their native language for credit. They may, however, take a placement exam in their native language in an attempt to qualify for a language substitution. Please see Placement Examinations for further information. </P>

<P>A maximum of 32 units may be earned by examination, including credit from AP, IB, and CLEP. Within a given discipline, a student cannot challenge a course which is at a lower level than one in which credit has been earned. A student may not challenge a course which has been failed or previously audited. </P>

<P>Credit for Courses Taken at Other Institutions After Initial Enrollment at Seaver College </P>

<P>After initial enrollment at Seaver College, students can transfer at most 12 units from another school. Students who are dismissed by the Credits Committee in order to complete a full term at another school before returning to Pepperdine may transfer at most 16 units. Courses taken at a two-year college are transferable only if the student has earned fewer than 64 units, including work at Seaver College. Academic and non-remedial courses completed at other regionally accredited institutions within seven years of the term of matriculation at Pepperdine normally transfer to Seaver College as elective units. The Academic Advising Center will review other courses on a case-by-case basis. Approval must be obtained in advance from the Academic Advising Center to apply transfer courses to general studies or major requirements. Only those courses with grades of C (2.000) or higher may transfer to fulfill requirements at Seaver College. No grades from transferred courses will apply to the GPA. Credit received on a basis other than the semester unit will be converted to the semester system. Lower-division classes taken at another college will transfer only as lower-division credit, even if they are upper-division classes at Seaver College. Some extension courses, up to a maximum of 15 units, are transferable as elective units only. With divisional dean approval, these courses may fulfill major and general studies requirements. Transferable extension courses are only those which are automatically accepted for degree credit by the institution offering them. (See the separate section regarding the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) for further information.) </P>

<P>Regardless of the number of units accepted for transfer, students are required to satisfy the residence requirement at Seaver College (see “Residence Requirements” in this section). </P>

<P>Dean’s List and Honors </P>

<P>A Dean’s List of undergraduate students achieving high scholarship is compiled each semester. A letter is sent to each student to recognize this memorable achievement. To be eligible, a student must complete at least 12 letter-graded units during the semester, receive no grade below C for the semester, receive no grades of I or NC, and be in the top 10 percent of the class. In any case, the GPA must not be less than 3.500. </P>

<P>Students who achieve a GPA of 3.500 in their entire Pepperdine undergraduate career are graduated cum laude; those with a 3.700 GPA are graduated magna cum laude; and those with a 3.900 GPA are graduated summa cum laude. GPAs will not be rounded. Eligibility for valedictorian and salutatorian honors at the Seaver College graduation ceremony is limited to students earning their first bachelor’s degree. A student who has earned previous bachelor’s or advanced degrees is ineligible for valedictorian and salutatorian honors. </P>

<P>Definition of the Grade-Point System </P>

<P>The quality of achievement in a course is measured as follows: For undergraduates, A indicates excellent achievement; B, good; C, average; D, below average; and F, failure. Grades are calculated as follows: </P>

</Table>

<P>Academic divisions or programs have designated certain courses that require students to achieve a minimum C- grade before advancing to the next course in the sequence, or for admission to the major, or for satisfying minimum competency requirements. </P>

<P>Double Major </P>

<P>Students may simultaneously complete the requirements for two majors (i.e., English and theatre or biology and chemistry) which will be reflected on both the transcript and the diploma. Pepperdine University awards one diploma for each level of academic degree earned (e.g., bachelor, master). This diploma reflects all majors/programs completed for that level of degree. General studies requirements must be fulfilled only once whether a student is working for two majors or one. However, as a general rule, no more than two upper-division courses from the specific requirements of one major can apply to the requirements of another major. In those cases in which more than two courses are common requirements for both majors, the student must take sufficient additional work to earn a minimum of 16 upper-division units which are unique to each major. Students pursuing a double major should refer to the Seaver Undergraduate Financial Assistance Policy regarding maximum limitations for institutional and federal aid. </P>

<P>Full-Time and Part-Time Student Status </P>

<P>Full-time enrollment for an undergraduate student is defined as 12 or more units per semester; three-quarter time is nine to 11 units; half-time is six to eight units; and less than half-time is one to five units. This information is essential to the student who is receiving financial assistance and is unable to maintain continuous enrollment for loan deferment purposes. </P>

<P>In accordance with federal regulations, international students in F-1 visa status must obtain specific authorization from the Office of International Student Services before withdrawing from courses which would result in less than a full course load. </P>

<P>Graduation and Undergraduate Degree Requirements </P>

<P>A minimum of 128 units is required for a degree, including no more than four units of physical education. Forty units must be in upper-division courses. All requirements for a particular degree must be completed, including those for the major, the minor, areas of concentration or emphasis, and general education courses. All residence requirements must be met (see Residence Requirements in this section). The student is responsible for completing all degree requirements outlined in the catalog for the intended degree. Note: students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 in work completed at Seaver College (“Pep GPA”) and in their major (“major GPA”). Students must consider how institutional and federal aid eligibility might impact their ability to utilize financial assistance while pursuing undergraduate degree requirements. (See Seaver Undergraduate Financial Assistance Policy.) </P>

<P>Graduation Cancellation </P>

<P>Students who apply to graduate in the spring or complete their degrees in the following summer term but withdraw from registered courses during the semester will lose their eligibility to march in the graduation ceremony and will be removed from the graduation roster. </P>

<P>Honors Programs </P>

<P>Exceptional students may wish to pursue the honors programs that are offered in selected disciplines. Interested students should contact the divisional dean for further information concerning these programs. </P>

<P>Hybrid and Online Courses </P>

<P>Seaver College defines an online course as one where online or learning technologies are used to deliver 70 percent or more of the instructional content. In an online course, the faculty member and student do not share a common coincident location and course content is delivered either synchronously or asynchronously to the student. A hybrid course combines the features of both traditional and online courses and typically supplements the traditional synchronous face-to-face faculty/student instruction with online instructional engagement. In a hybrid course, online or learning technologies are used to deliver somewhere between 20 percent and 70 percent of the instructional content. </P>

<P>Seaver College offers a limited number of hybrid or online courses and will grant credit for hybrid or online courses completed both before and after initial enrollment at Seaver College in accordance with existing academic policies (see “Admission of Transfer Students” in the Admission Information section of the catalog and “Credit for Courses Taken at Other Institutions After Initial Enrollment at Seaver College” and “Residence Requirements” in this section). After initial enrollment at Seaver College, a maximum of 18 total units of hybrid or online courses may act in fulfillment of the 128 units required for graduation. Within the 18 units of allowable hybrid or online course work, a maximum of 8 units may act in fulfillment of general education requirements and a maximum of 8 units may fulfill requirements in an academic major. A maximum of 4 units of hybrid or online course work may act in fulfillment of the requirements in an academic minor. </P>

<P>When participating in a Seaver College international program, undergraduate students may enroll in a maximum of 4 units of hybrid or online courses offered at Seaver College in an academic term. Additionally, students may not enroll in a hybrid or online course if a materially equivalent course is offered in residence at the international program site in the same academic term. </P>

<P>According to U.S. federal regulations, international students in F-1 status are allowed each semester to enroll in one online class that has no amount of physical attendance requirement and may count up to three units of the class toward the regulation requiring a full course of study. </P>

<P>Involuntary Military Service </P>

<P>Students who are involuntarily called to active military duty may withdraw from courses and the University at any time during the term. Transcripts will be coded as WM (withdrawal due to military service) for withdrawals that occur after the add/drop period. The student will receive a 100 percent tuition refund. No withdrawal fees will be charged. </P>

<P>If the involuntary withdrawal occurs during the period of a term when the grade of incomplete (I) can be granted, students may request an incomplete from the professor. All appropriate rules for incomplete courses apply with one exception: if the student is still on active duty when the expiration date to complete the course and remove the incomplete occurs, the grade will default to WM (rather than F), and a full refund will be made to the student. </P>

<P>Furthermore, once students complete their involuntary tours of duty, upon request, Pepperdine will readmit them within the first 12 months following completion of their tours of duty without requiring them to reapply to the University. The students’ tours of duty time will not count as part of the time limit set for degree completion. Students who cannot attend Pepperdine because of military service will be readmitted with the same academic status achieved when they last attended or were accepted to the University. The student must notify Pepperdine of the military service and the intention to return to school as follows: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Notification of military service. The student (or an appropriate officer of the armed forces or official of the Department of Defense) must give oral or written notice of such service to the school as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Notification of intent to return to school. The student must also give oral or written notice of an intent to return to Pepperdine within three years after the completion of the period of service. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>A student’s readmission rights terminate in the case of a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, general court-martial, federal or state prison sentence, or other reasons as described in 34 CFR 668.18(h) federal regulations. </P>

<P>For additional information, please contact the Veterans Affairs Office: (310) 506-7999. </P>

<P>Major and Minor </P>

<P>Students may simultaneously complete the requirements for an academic major and one or more minors, which will be reflected on the transcript. However, as a general rule, no more than two upper-division courses from the specific requirements of a major or the General Education program can apply to the requirements of a minor. In cases in which more than two courses are common requirements for both the major and a minor, the student must take sufficient upper-division courses unique to the minor to meet the minimum upper-division unit requirement for the minor. Students must consider how institutional and federal aid eligibility might impact their ability to utilize financial assistance while pursuing one or more minors. (See Seaver Undergraduate Financial Assistance Policy.) </P>

<P>Military Training (ROTC) </P>

<P>Through arrangements with neighboring institutions, two-, three-, and four-year programs in Air Force Reserve Training Corps and Army Reserve Officers Training Corps are available to qualified Seaver College students, and both lead to a commission as a second lieutenant. Academic units earned in these programs are counted as elective, lower-division units toward fulfillment of graduation requirements. Scholarships covering full tuition, fees, and subsistence allowance are available. For additional information contact: Air Force ROTC Detachment 060, University of Southern California, 3560 Watt Way, PED Room 112, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0054, telephone </P>

<P>The Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Program and the Marine Women Officers Candidate Program are available to Seaver College students. Both programs lead to a commission as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. While no Seaver College academic credit is involved, scholarships and summer training are available. For additional information, contact United States Marine Corps Officer Selection Office, 5051 South Rodeo Road, Los Angeles, CA 90016-4794, telephone (323) 294-3704. </P>

<P>Placement Examinations </P>

<P>Placement examinations in language, math, and written English (for international students) may be administered to incoming students. Performance on these examinations determines placement in course levels. There is no credit earned nor is there any effect on the GPA as a result of scores achieved on these exams. </P>

<P>Readmission </P>

<P>Students who withdraw after being accepted to or attending Seaver College must follow readmission procedures that vary depending on circumstances of the withdrawal and the length of time that has passed. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•</Lbl>

<LBody> New students who choose to withdraw before the start of their first term at Seaver College must withdraw through the Office of Admission. Should a student wish to return to Seaver College within two semesters of the original application term, a brief reapplication form will need to be submitted to the Office of Admission. If the return date is past two semesters of the original application term, the student must reapply through the Common Application and submit new supplemental materials to the Office of Admission. </LBody>

<P>requirements stated in the catalog of the academic year of reenrollment. </P>

<P>• Students who attended other institutions after leaving Seaver College must submit official transcripts from those institutions prior to readmission. </P>

<P>Repeating Courses </P>

<P>Required courses for which a student earns a grade of F, WF, WP, W, or NC must be repeated. When repeating a course (one or more times) for which a grade of C- or lower was earned, all grades are calculated into the GPA and the units count only once toward graduation. Courses for which a student earns a grade of C or better may be repeated, but any succeeding grades will not be calculated in the GPA or the unit total. </P>

<P>Residence Requirements </P>

<P>Undergraduate students must complete at least 64 units in residence at Seaver College, including at least 24 units of upper-division work in the major. It is required that their last 28 units of required courses and/or units toward the bachelor’s degree be taken in residence at Seaver College. Up to 64 units are transferable from an accredited two-year or four-year college. Once the total of all units earned from all schools has reached 64, no further two-year college courses are accepted. Once enrolled, Seaver students can transfer at most 12 units from another school. </P>

<P>Second Bachelor’s Degree </P>

<P>Students who transfer to Seaver College with a bachelor’s degree from another accredited college or university may earn a second bachelor’s degree, provided they: (1) complete at least 64 units in residence at Seaver College; (2) fulfill the final 28 units of required courses and/or units in residence at Seaver College; (3) complete the Seaver College general education requirements; and (4) complete the courses required for a major, including a minimum of 24 upper-division units in the major in residence and courses in the area of concentration or emphasis required in the major. </P>

<P>Students who have previously received a bachelor’s degree from Seaver College and return to complete the requirements for another major will not be given a second diploma, nor will their transcripts reflect a second degree, unless that degree is a different type. They will, however, be certified as having completed an additional major. </P>

<P>Summer Graduates </P>

<P>Students who are planning to complete the bachelor’s degree during any of the summer sessions or by the end of the summer term will be eligible to march in the spring graduation ceremony only if they meet the following criteria and agree to the stipulations below.

</L>

<P>Time Limit </P>

<P>All requirements for the bachelor’s degree must be completed within seven calendar years from the date on which the student begins undergraduate work at Pepperdine University. If seven years elapse from the time of initial enrollment, the student must meet the requirements of a catalog dated no earlier than seven years prior to the anticipated date of graduation. </P>

<P>A student who has been absent for a period of two years must reapply for admission and fulfill the degree requirements of the catalog of the academic year of re-enrollment. A student who has been absent for two or more semesters (excluding summer terms) but less than two years must be readmitted by the Office of Student Information and Services and may fulfill the degree requirements of the original catalog. For further information, see the Readmission section of this catalog. </P>

<P>Undergraduate Registration in Graduate Courses </P>

<P>An undergraduate student enrolled in the final semester before graduation and within nine units of graduation may be permitted to enroll in courses for graduate credit. However, before the last semester of undergraduate work, the student must submit a program to the dean of the division of the student’s major and a petition to the senior associate dean of Seaver College for approval of the program. If the graduate study is in a different division from the undergraduate work, the student must obtain approval from the dean in the appropriate division of graduate study as well. Graduate credit will not be permitted to count for work that is required for the bachelor’s degree except as otherwise stated. The applicant will be notified in writing concerning the petition and admission status. </P>

<P>Candidates for the California Preliminary Teaching Credential may be permitted to enroll in professional development courses for post-bachelor’s degree credit reflecting a dual career enrollment. However, the student must obtain permission from the director of Teacher Education prior to enrollment. This policy may apply to any credential-required course that a student chooses not to apply toward undergraduate graduation requirements. Courses will be applied toward post-bachelor’s degree credit and annotated as such on the transcript. </P>

<P>International students who are in F-1 visa status are required to maintain 12 units each term. Therefore, they should consult a Designated School Official (DSO) in the Office of International Student Services before deciding how to incorporate the teaching credential requirements into their course load each term prior to completion of their degree. </P>

<Sect>
<H3 id="LinkTarget_2872">Academic Policies for Graduate and Post-Baccalaureate Students </H3>

<P>Advisor and Committee </P>

<P>During a student’s first semester in graduate school, the divisional dean or a member of the faculty designated by the divisional dean will advise students concerning their program. As students near the comprehensive exam and/ or thesis stage of their programs, a committee will be appointed to facilitate either the exam or the thesis defense or both in applicable programs. The student’s advisor normally chairs this committee, and students should consult with their advisors for information specific to their programs. </P>

<P>Appeal Process </P>

<P>If the student feels that his or her interests were not sufficiently dealt with, a written appeal must be submitted to the divisional dean or director of the graduate program. The divisional dean or the director of the program must sign the appeal indicating his or her recommendation and forward it to the senior associate dean. Neither the divisional dean nor the program director can suppress or withhold such a signature. If the student is petitioning regarding a particular course, the recommendation should come from that instructor instead of the divisional dean. </P>

<P>Comprehensive Examination </P>

<P>Some programs require both written and oral examinations. In programs that require a comprehensive exam, the exams are coordinated by the student’s academic advisor in consultation with the other members of the student’s academic advisory committee. The academic advisory committee serves as the examining committee. The committee has the authority to require the student to repeat the examination in whole or in part. Specific procedures and grading policies for the examination may be obtained from each of the divisional programs. </P>

<P>Continuance in the Program </P>

<P>Students admitted to graduate or post-baccalaureate study may continue in the program as long as their academic performance and their personal conduct meet the standards set by the University. Students must maintain a GPA of 3.000 (B) on all graduate work done at Pepperdine University and on all work for a master’s degree. Students falling below a GPA of 3.000 in their work taken at Seaver College (“Pep GPA”) will be placed on academic probation. Students will also be placed on academic probation upon receipt of a second C+ or below regardless of their cumulative GPA. Any student who is on probation and (1) shows lack of progress or (2) fails to clear probation within one semester is subject to academic dismissal. Registration will be canceled for any student who is dismissed after having registered in advance for a subsequent term. </P>

<P>No grade lower than a B- will carry graduate credit unless the student’s graduate program director recommends and the associate dean of Seaver College approves that such credit be allowed, although all courses attempted will be counted in the student’s GPA. Such approval must be granted before the end of the semester following the one in which the course was taken. No student will be allowed to apply more than eight units (two courses) of C+ or below grades toward meeting the requirements of a master’s degree. </P>

<P>Students receiving veterans’ benefits should consult the special veterans’ information section in this portion of the catalog for more important information concerning standards of progress for veterans. This information is also available at 
<Link>pepperdine.edu/registrar</Link>
. </P>

<P>Continuous Enrollment </P>

<P>Graduate and post-baccalaureate students must maintain continuous enrollment. Continuous enrollment means that students must register for two semesters each academic year (fall, spring, or summer) from the time of first enrollment until completion of all requirements for the graduate degree. A student who is unable to maintain continuous enrollment prior to the completion of academic course work should apply for a leave of absence (see “Leave of Absence”). </P>

<P>A student who has completed all academic course work for a graduate degree but who has not passed the final comprehensive examinations and/or successfully completed the thesis or project and received all the appropriate signatures on their thesis or is in the process of completing an “in progress” in a final directed readings course must maintain continuous enrollment by registering in GR 699, Reading for Master’s Comprehensives, and by paying the associated fee each semester as described in the Financial Information section of the catalog. The fee permits the student to use the library and research facilities of the University. The student is considered active, full-time, and eligible to defer payments on government loans. </P>

<P>Any student who has not maintained continuous enrollment and has been absent from Seaver College for one semester but less than two years must file an Application for Readmission with the Graduate Program Office at least two weeks prior to registration. Applications for readmission must be accompanied by readmission fees of $100 per semester for each semester in which the student was not enrolled. A student who has been absent for two or more calendar years must file a new application for admission with the Graduate Program Office and pay the regular application fee. These students must complete the degree requirements stated in the catalog of the academic year of re-enrollment. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to complete their degree in a timely manner. Students with numerous enrollments in GR 699 may be asked by the director of the program or the divisional dean to submit a degree completion plan in advance of GR 699 registration. </P>

<P>A student must also be enrolled in a course during the semester in which a degree is granted. </P>

<P>Course Numbering System </P>

<P>Upper-Division Courses: Courses numbered 500–599 are open to upper-division undergraduate or graduate students. These courses represent advanced upper-division work or graduate-level courses. Students taking 500-level courses for graduate credit will be required to do assignments in addition to those required of undergraduates. </P>

<P>Graduate Courses: Courses numbered 600–699 are open to graduate students only. </P>

<P>Definition of the Grade-Point System </P>

<P>The quality of achievement in a course is measured by grades. For graduate students, A indicates superior work, B indicates average or satisfactory, and C is the lowest passing grade. Grades are calculated as follows: </P>

<P>Full-Time and Part-Time Student Status </P>

<P>Full-time enrollment for a graduate student is defined as eight or more units per semester; three-quarter time is five to seven units; half-time is four units; less than half-time is one to three units. Full-time enrollment for graduate students enrolled in the summer term is four units; three-quarter time is three units; half-time is two units; less than half-time is one unit. For summer financial aid purposes only, graduate students enrolled in four units or more may qualify for federal loans. Graduate students enrolled in three units or fewer may qualify for private/alternative loans. Students granted permission to enroll in GR 699 are classified as full-time. </P>

<P>Graduate Degree Requirements </P>

<P>All graduate degrees require either a comprehensive exam or a thesis or project. Some require an exam along with the thesis or project. All course work must be completed with a GPA of 3.000 or better. Clearance for the graduate degree requires: </P>

<P>In order to participate in the commencement ceremony, a student must meet all the above criteria. The academic division offering the master’s degree will process the academic clearance for each potential graduate. Students must also apply to graduate. Contact the graduate programs office for details. </P>

<P>Leave of Absence </P>

<P>Students may petition for a leave of absence with the approval of their program director and the senior associate dean of Seaver College. To apply for a leave of absence, a letter must be submitted to the student’s program director indicating reasons for the request. A leave will be granted only under extenuating circumstances. Students may be granted a leave of absence for two consecutive semesters. Time spent on a leave (for a maximum of one year) is not considered part of the time limit for completion of the degree. International students in F-1 visa status must obtain clearance from the Office of International Student Services before taking a leave of absence. </P>

<P>Residence Requirements </P>

<P>Regardless of the amount of graduate work done elsewhere, a candidate for the master’s degree must complete a minimum of 24 units of graduate work at Pepperdine University in order to earn the degree. </P>

<P>Second Master’s Degree Regulations </P>

<P>Graduate students who already hold a master’s degree from Pepperdine University and desire to study for a second master’s degree in a related field must meet all the admission requirements and those of the prospective department or division. They must also complete the minimum number of units of graduate residence work as outlined by the major division for the master’s degree. The student is required to submit an application form and pay the admission fee. </P>

<P>Thesis and Project </P>

<P>In graduate programs requiring a thesis or project, the topic must be approved in advance by the student’s graduate program director. Rules for thesis or project preparation may be obtained from each divisional office. Thesis and project guidelines, including a schedule of deadlines, are available on the Seaver Graduate Programs website at 
<Link>seaver.pepperdine.edu/ </Link>

<Link>academics/programs/graduate/policies-guidelines/thesisguidelines.htm</Link>
. </P>

<P>It is ordinarily expected that the thesis for the master’s degree will be a limited piece of original research that makes a contribution to scholarship in the student’s particular field. </P>

<P>Academic Policies </P>

<P>The student is required to defend the thesis orally. The oral defense will take place after the thesis has received tentative approval from the academic advisory committee, but no later than three weeks (or 21 days) prior to the last day of regular classes of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. The senior associate dean of Seaver College must be informed of the date, time, and place of oral defense at least one week in advance. </P>

<P>Oral defenses are open to all members of the faculty. Any member of the faculty present at the oral defense has the privilege of questioning the candidate. Only members of the student’s academic advisory committee are eligible to vote. The thesis and oral defense must receive the unanimous vote of the committee in order to be approved. </P>

<P>The student must submit an electronic copy (PDF) and a hard copy of the thesis as well as the signed routing sheet, and thesis digital archive submission release form to the dean’s office no less than two weeks (14 days) prior to the last day of regular classes of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. Consult the thesis guidelines for current details on the submission process for all theses and projects: 
<Link>seaver.pepperdine.edu/ </Link>

<Link>academics/programs/graduate/policies-guidelines/thesisguidelines.htm</Link>
. The specific dates are indicated on the Academic Calendar in this catalog. Theses completed after these dates will qualify candidates for graduation at the end of the next term. </P>

<P>Time Limit </P>

<P>All requirements for the master’s degree must be completed within seven calendar years from the date on which the student begins graduate work at Pepperdine University. All requirements for the post-baccalaureate certificate must be completed within 15 months from the date on which the student begins certificate work at Pepperdine University. In rare cases, the senior associate dean of Seaver College, in consultation with the program director, may grant a limited extension of time. A Seaver Student Exception Request Form must be presented to the dean to obtain this extension of time. </P>

<P>In most cases, a student who exceeds the time limit but wishes to complete the degree may reapply for admission. If accepted, the student must take a written qualifying examination covering the course work in the program of study. Based on the results of the examination, the student’s academic advisory committee will formulate a new program of study that includes course work currently necessary for a master’s degree in the discipline </P>

<P>Transfer of Credits </P>

<P>For degree purposes, at least 24 units of graduate work must be taken at Pepperdine University. For the master of arts or master of science degrees, a maximum of two courses totaling not more than 8 units of graduate work may be transferred for credit upon approval of the appropriate division and the senior associate dean. For the master of divinity degree, a maximum of 36 units of “core graduate course work” (excluding language and fieldwork requirements) may be transferred for credit with approval of the Religion and Philosophy Division and </P>

<P>Withdrawal from Courses </P>

<P>Prior to the end of the eighth week (second week during the summer sessions), a student may withdraw from any course by contacting OneStop via Pepperdine email or in person. The transcript will indicate a grade of W for such withdrawals. No financial adjustment will be made for withdrawals after the fifth week of a semester. Special policies are in effect for students enrolled in courses which do not follow the traditional semester calendar. </P>

<P>Students wishing to withdraw from a course after the end of the eighth week of the semester must do so through OneStop no later than one week prior to the last day of the regular class meetings. The instructor will assign a grade of WP indicating withdraw passing, WF indicating withdraw failing, or WP/NC in Cr/NC classes, depending on the student’s status at the time of last attendance. The WF will be calculated as an F in the GPA. Students who do not officially withdraw from a class will automatically be assigned a grade of F by the instructor. </P>

<P>Withdrawals are official only upon timely written notification to OneStop. Consult the Academic Calendar for specific information regarding deadlines and refunds. Information or changes in the registration of any student receiving veterans’ benefits will be forwarded to the Veterans Administration whenever such changes occur. International students in F-1 visa status must obtain permission from the Office of International Student Services before withdrawing from courses if they cannot maintain full-time enrollment, consisting of at least eight units. </P>

<P>Work Taken Before Admission </P>

<P>Applicants who have completed graduate courses before admission to a graduate program are advised that such courses are acceptable for credit toward the master’s degree only upon the recommendation of the graduate program director and with the approval of the senior associate dean. At the time of admission, the number of units already completed and acceptable as credit toward the master’s degree will be noted and made a part of the student’s record. </P>

<H5>General Education Program </H5>

<P>The General Education Program at Seaver College is the heart of a liberal arts curriculum and complements the University’s Christian mission by grounding students in the skills, knowledge, and perspectives that will equip them to serve purposefully and become leaders in their chosen fields. Upon completion of this curriculum, students will have a sound foundation in the core competencies and thus will be well prepared to write and speak effectively, think critically, conduct informed research, and interpret quantitative data. Recognizing that an awareness of difference/ diversity is essential to success in the modern world, the curriculum provides opportunities to explore cultures, values, and ideas that situate the student within the global community and foster the ability to empathize with others. The variety of courses introduces each student to academic disciplines and ways of thinking that are different from his or her own and thus broadens each student’s perspectives. </P>

<P>Since deep learning occurs in community, the GE curriculum has been designed to cultivate that community through shared experiences such as the first-year seminar. Students also have the freedom to select courses that speak to their own interests and vocational inclinations through multi-semester colloquia such as Great Books or Social Action and Justice, and students can further individualize their GE experience by selecting from a variety of courses that satisfy the requirements in most of the areas. At Seaver College, each student’s chosen major and the general education curriculum work together to provide the necessary tools that will equip him or her to make meaningful and ethical decisions in his or her professional and personal endeavors. </P>

<P>The requirements for the general education program include 19 courses, totaling 63–64 units. To develop further the fundamental core competencies introduced in the general education curriculum, students also fulfill the junior writing portfolio requirement and the presentation skills, research methods, and writing intensive course requirements in their majors. </P>

<P>Each of the various areas of emphasis in the General Education Program has learning outcomes that address knowledge, skills, and/or perspectives: </P>

<P>Mathematics (3) </P>

<P>This requirement develops in the student an appreciation of the beauty and creativity of mathematics. It enhances reasoning ability and the grasp of logical principles, improves problem-solving skills, provides exposure to the pervasiveness of mathematics in our modern society and some of its historical underpinnings, and provides an understanding of the basic principles of analyzing numerical data using statistical methods. </P>

<P>Courses fulfilling the mathematics requirement: MATH 120. This requirement may also be satisfied by MATH 140, MATH 141, MATH 150, MATH 220, COM 240, POSC/PSYC/SOC 250, MATH 270 (for the liberal arts for education major), or MATH 316. Each of these courses assumes that the student has completed at least two years of high school algebra or MATH 99 or MATH 103 or MATH 104 with a grade of C- or higher. </P>

<P>In the mathematics requirement, students will: </P>

<L>

</LI>
</L>

<P>Language (4) </P>

<P>This requirement helps students attain a functional competency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing at the intermediate level in a language of their choice. The equivalent of third semester language is required. Students are placed at the course level (151, 152, or 251) indicated by the Foreign Language Placement Exam. To be successful in languages, students should take all classes in sequential semesters; that is, a student should not skip a semester between courses. Should this happen, it may be necessary to require a student to repeat the previous course. As with the placement exam, finishing a language course ensures only admittance to the next course level for one year. The language requirement is waived for students who place at the 252 level on the Foreign Language Placement Exam proctored in the International Studies and Languages (ISL) Division. However, no unit credits can be earned through the placement exam process. Unit credit may be earned only by the challenge procedure through the ISL Division, which is available only for languages taught in that division. (See “Credit by Examination” for further information about this procedure.) </P>

<P>The requirement is waived for international students who verify academic study of their native language. Transfer students may receive credit for language courses taken at a regionally-accredited college or university; such students do not need to take the Foreign Language Placement Exam. The Seaver College requirement is not second language acquisition, but rather language proficiency that supports the global world view of the liberal arts. American Sign Language therefore does not meet the criteria by which Seaver’s general education language requirement is defined. </P>

<P>Courses that fulfill the language requirement: ARBC 251, CHIN 251, FRE 251, FRE 282, GER 251, GER 282, GRE 351, HEB 351, ITAL 251, JAPN 251, SPAN 251, SPAN 282. </P>

Courses regularly taught overseas include HUM 212 and HUM 313 of the Western Culture sequence and courses that satisfy the general education requirements, which may include courses in fine arts, modern languages, world civilizations, political science, sociology or psychology, mathematics, and natural science. The Seaver College curriculum has also been designed with the aim that any student from any major can study in an international program for at least one semester. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Great Books Colloquium </H5>

<P>The Great Books Colloquium is a four-course sequence on masterpieces of Western civilization. The purpose of the colloquium is to engage students in close, critical reading and small-group discussions of selected works from the time of the Greeks to the modern day. The courses are conducted by discussion under the leadership of a qualified professor dedicated to fostering open, shared, and rigorous inquiry. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2879">The Great Books Colloquium is a limited-enrollment program. The only prerequisites for entry into the colloquium are eligibility for English 101 and a willingness to commit oneself to the time and effort required by the courses. Students should be advised that the reading and writing assignments are substantial. However, past students have testified that the greater challenge has given them precisely what they desired from a university education: an opportunity to read fine works, rigorous training in writing and discussion, a forum for sharing ideas, and a close-knit group in which to grow intellectually. </P>

<P>Students should remain in the colloquium for the entire series of seminars. Students completing all four Great Books courses receive credit for the First-Year seminar, two courses from Group A: ENG 101, upper-division literature, and one course in the Humanities Sequence (HUM 111, HUM 212, or HUM 313); and two courses from Group B: REL 301, COM 180, POSC 104, and SOC 200. Students completing Great Books I receive credit for First-Year Seminar, even if they choose not to complete the sequence. Students who do not complete the sequence but complete a course or courses beyond Great Books I will receive unit credit toward graduation, but no General Education credit besides the First-Year Seminar. </P>

<P>Usually, students enter the colloquium in the fall of their first year and finish in the spring of their sophomore year. However, many students may wish to participate in an international program during their sophomore year. This is entirely compatible with participation in the Great Books seminars. Students may take the first two courses in their first year, spend their sophomore year abroad, and finish the colloquium when they return in their junior year. In addition, it is sometimes possible to finish the colloquium at one of the international campuses when an experienced Great Books teacher is assigned to such a campus. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>The Social Action and Justice Colloquium </H5>

<P>The Social Action and Justice (SAAJ) Colloquium is a four-course, interdisciplinary program focused on issues of social justice such as human rights, wealth and poverty, the environment, the interplay of religion and culture, and the role of media in shaping social movements. The colloquium includes historical, theoretical, and practical perspectives on social issues, providing knowledge and opportunities for social action to students interested in a variety of vocations. The colloquium encourages students to reflect on how their choices of world view and vocation will affect their lives and society in the 21st century. </P>

<P>In each of the first two semesters, students and faculty members engage in service-learning activities appropriate to the issues they are studying, providing opportunities for students to be in the community exploring possible vocational choices. Each of the first two courses in the colloquium is a small seminar composed of 18 students and a faculty member. Based on student interests and with faculty guidance, each class will read, discuss, research, and write about primary texts related to social justice issues. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2880">To develop a historical and theoretical basis for social action, students in the first-semester course examine how each of the following has affected social justice in the United States from the 18th century to the present: the social construction of racial identity, the role of gender in social equality, and the influence of socio-economic background. In the second semester, students examine the impact of religious activism, the social construction of ability and disability, social perceptions of sexual difference, and concerns about the environment. </P>

<P>In the third semester, students may choose more specialized courses that provide an in-depth examination of a particular social issue. Faculty members will encourage students to select courses related to their particular concerns and possible vocation. </P>

<P>In the fourth semester, students will complete extended experiential learning assignments appropriate to their talents, concerns, and values. Ideally, the third-semester course on a particular issue will provide research opportunities and particular preparation for these experiences. As they complete the experiential learning component, students will continue to meet in biweekly seminars and for in-common activities. </P>

<P>Students who complete the four-semester SAAJ sequence will receive credit for the following general education requirements: first-year seminar, ENG 101, literature, and REL 301. If students drop out of the colloquium before finishing the four-course sequence, they will receive unit credit toward graduation but will not have fulfilled the above-named general education requirements. SAAJ 123 may be fulfilled by a course in the student’s major, but only one major course may fulfill the SAAJ requirements. No student may fulfill SAAJ 123 with a GE course. (See the Course Descriptions in the Humanities and Teacher Education Division section for information about each course in the SAAJ sequence.) </P>

<H5>Pre-Law </H5>

<P>Students who want to attend law school should plan their undergraduate programs with care. While law schools do not expect the incoming student to be knowledgeable in the field of law, the expectation is that the applicant will be well prepared for the rigors of graduate work in this field. This means that the pre-law student should complete an academic major which will equip him or her with the skills and discipline necessary to perform well in law school. No specific major is required for admission, so it is up to each student to make a responsible choice. </P>

<P>In selecting the major, the student should place emphasis on such skills as research, writing, analytical reading, logic, and organized expression of ideas, both oral and written. The student should be concerned with obtaining a broad liberal arts education which should help in developing insightful understandings of our culture and institutions. Beyond the chosen major, a judicious use of elective units can fill in additional areas of expertise that might otherwise be overlooked. Involvement in such extracurricular activities as Seaver College’s chapter of Phi Alpha Delta (International Law Society), and participation in intercollegiate debate may also benefit the student. Prelaw advisors in several divisions will be glad to aid all interested students in planning for their success in law school. </P>

<P>Frequently, students request that the advisor recommend elective courses which will be helpful in their pre-law education. </P>

<P>More specific information, including recommended courses, is available in the Social Science Division Office or through a pre-law advisor. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Contract Major </H5>

<P>As an alternative to one of the above majors, students with at least 30 earned units of college credit and a minimum GPA of 2.500 may initiate a special contract for an individualized major. Application for an individualized contract major, including a rationale and proposed courses, must be submitted to the Academic Advising Center. Divisional deans will appoint a committee of faculty members to review and approve or disapprove the combination of courses being proposed as a contract major. The student must complete at least 45 units at Seaver College, at least 30 units of which must be part of the contract, following the signing of the contract for the individualized major. Contract majors will only be authorized in cases where a student’s academic goals are so specialized that they cannot be met by another existing program of study. As a result, no student with an approved contract major may pursue a double major when the second major is one that already exists in the Seaver catalog. </P>

<ImageData src=""/>

<P id="LinkTarget_2884">The experience of study and travel overseas provides an essential dimension to a liberal arts education that can be obtained in no other way. For this reason, international programs have been designed to provide any Seaver College student, regardless of major, the opportunity to study, live, and travel overseas without interrupting other studies or postponing a career. Year-round or semester program locations in Heidelberg, Germany; London, United Kingdom; Florence, Italy; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Shanghai, China; Lausanne, Switzerland; and Washington, DC, offer students a unique opportunity to gain both an academic and a personal understanding of other cultures, institutions, and languages. Summer language programs in Switzerland and Spain or Argentina allow beginning students to complete their language requirement and offer advanced students the opportunity to study both the language and the culture of the country. Other summer programs provide special opportunities to focus on business, humanities, religion, science, medicine, theatre, music, or studio art. Upon graduation, many students conclude that participation in an international program was the single most significant experience of their undergraduate years. </P>

<P>Each program is a serious adventure in study and scholarship. A sufficient number and variety of courses are offered at each location to allow the student to arrange a full academic schedule. Classes are taught by visiting University faculty members from the Malibu campus, by Pepperdine University faculty members who reside in the host country, and by a group of well-qualified and distinguished local professors who have been specially selected to teach in the program. The curriculum has been designed so that students may complete a substantial portion of their general education requirements while enrolled. Many students elect to participate during the sophomore year, although any qualified student may apply. </P>

<P>The program design recognizes that selective travel is a valuable part of the educational process, but class attendance and academic performance are regarded as first priorities. Classroom instruction is augmented each semester by educational excursions to significant locations lasting several days. These educational field trips to locations of historic, literary, musical, or other significance may include guided city tours; visits to museums and historical sites; attending concerts, plays, and operas; or listening to guest lecturers. </P>

<P>Students in Heidelberg, London, Florence, Shanghai, Lausanne, and Washington, DC, live in University housing along with the Seaver faculty family. The same residential housing rules that prevail in Malibu apply insofar as possible, with certain exceptions made necessary by local conditions. Students in the Buenos Aires program and some summer language programs live with host families. </P>

<H5>Heidelberg, Germany </H5>

<P>Heidelberg, a beautiful and romantic city that has been a university center for over 500 years, is an ideal location for studying and absorbing European cultural heritage. Heidelberg is known for its institutions of higher education. The University of Heidelberg, founded in in 1386, is the oldest university in Germany and among the most prestigious in Europe. Heidelberg is also known for having been home to Germany’s greatest poet, Wolfgang von Goethe; the school of German Romanticism; Max Weber, father of modern sociology; and Friedrich Ebert, the first president of the German Republic. </P>

<P>The Heidelberg Program, which was established in 1963, was the first Pepperdine International Program. Student residential housing is located in University-owned Moore Haus, a spacious turn-of-the-century mansion that commands a breathtaking view of the Neckar Valley. Moore Haus also contains a study area, student center, computer facility, and offices. It is adjacent to Heidelberg’s famous castle, very near the University of Heidelberg, and within convenient walking distance of the downtown areas of the city. </P>

<P>Classes are conducted in a modern classroom facility in the center of the city. The language of instruction is English, but all students must register for a course in German, which must be taken for a letter grade. Students planning to participate in the program must begin their study of German before going overseas. </P>

<H5>London, United Kingdom </H5>

<P>London is one of the world’s largest and most important cultural and commercial centers. This crossroads of the globe is an ideal place for students to study the literature, history, culture, and institutions which provide many of the foundations of American civilization. Students in London have access to educational resources unmatched elsewhere in the world. Visits to the museums, art galleries, libraries, houses of Parliament, and other historical and cultural sites are an integral part of the program. The central location of the program allows students to reach London’s theatres, concert venues, and shopping areas in a matter of minutes by Tube or bus. </P>

<P>Students reside in the University-owned building in South Kensington, on the same street as the Victoria and Albert, Natural History, and Science museums. This facility, which is a splendid example of Victorian architecture, contains two classrooms, a library, a study area, a student kitchen, two student lounges, the faculty flat, and a private terrace overlooking a garden. </P>

<P>Students eat out in local restaurants three times a week and also have a large kitchen in which to prepare their own meals. They can participate in equestrian lessons in Hyde Park, volunteer opportunities in a local primary school, student groups at local churches, and spend a weekend with students from a local British university. </P>

<H5>Florence, Italy </H5>

<P>Florence, the city that gave birth to the Renaissance, was home to Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli, and the Medici family. One of the world’s greatest centers of artistic, literary, and historical treasures and traditions, Florence is filled with buildings that are themselves works of art, filled with art treasures. Scheduled visits to these sites are a regular part of the academic program. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2886">This former republic and once-capital of Italy provides an ideal location for the study of art, history, music, and literature. Florence is located almost at the center of the Italian peninsula. Rome lies only 145 miles away and France, Switzerland, Austria, and all of central Europe are but a few hours away. </P>

<P>Students reside in a University-owned facility which consists of the 19thcentury Villa Di Loreto and the contiguous Residenza Tagliaferri. Students live in rooms with private baths, most meals are prepared in the facility’s kitchen, and they attend classes in fully-equipped classrooms in the same facility. This property also contains a study area and recreational facilities. It is located within walking distance of the historic district of Florence with its numerous museums and historic sites and the city’s main railway station. </P>

<H5>Buenos Aires, Argentina </H5>

<P>Buenos Aires is one of the most interesting and exciting cities in the world. Its wide streets, often lined by sidewalk cafes, are responsible for its being known as the “Paris of South America.” The large metropolitan area includes the Federal District, the nation’s capital, and is home to busy commercial, historic, educational, and cultural centers. </P>

<P>Pepperdine students who study here live with selected host families and travel to their classes on one of the world’s better public transportation systems, which includes both a metro and extensive bus routes. Casa Holden includes offices, a computer laboratory, and student center. Adjacent to Casa Holden is Casa Olleros, where a Pepperdine library is located and classes are held. The language of instruction is English, but all students must register for a course in Spanish, which must be taken for a letter grade. Students planning to participate in the program must begin their study of Spanish before going to Argentina. </P>

<P>In addition to class attendance, scheduled visits to museums, attendance at local musical and theatrical performances, and visits to other cultural and educational locations are a regular part of the program. Educational field trips, also included in the program, may take the students to various locations in Argentina, or to places such as the magnificent falls at Iguazu, or the beautiful plains of Patagonia. </P>

<P>Students planning to attend the Buenos Aires program should remember that the city’s summer months are from December to February, when the mean high temperature is 83°F. The winter months are from June to August. The average annual temperature is a mild 60°F. Frosts may occur in the winter, but snowfall is rare. </P>

Since market restrictions were lifted, Shanghai has been a leading force in China’s economic reform, embracing the forces of business and emerging as an international metropolis with both modern and traditional Chinese features. Shanghai is cosmopolitan, fast-paced, and full of professional opportunities. </P>

<P>Shanghai has also developed into a global hub for culture and the arts. Students are just a bike or metro ride away from a number of world-class museums and burgeoning art enclaves. The city’s diversity is also represented in the restaurant scene, which includes every cuisine imaginable, often for prices lower than the global average. </P>

<P>Students live together in a Pepperdine-operated house centrally located near the prestigious former French Concession—an area of Shanghai that includes consulates. A visiting faculty family from Pepperdine lives with the students. The language of instruction is English, but all students must register for a course in Chinese language, which must be taken for a letter grade. Students planning to participate in the program must begin the study of Chinese before going overseas.

<H5>Lausanne, Switzerland </H5>

<P>Lausanne is located in the heart of the French-speaking area of western Switzerland along the shores of majestic Lake Geneva. Founded originally by the Romans, the city boasts of a long history and offers visitors today a rich cultural life. Lausanne has a perfect blend of options for the urban dweller (restaurants, shops, and entertainment), but also appeals to the swimmers, hikers, bikers, and skiers who love the rugged adventure that the Swiss Alps provide. Its central location in Europe allows for easy train access to all the major cities of Europe: it is only 45 minutes from the Geneva airport, four hours from Paris by the high-speed train, and one hour from the best ski slopes in the Alps. </P>

<P>Students reside in a University-owned facility in Lausanne, only a few minutes from the train station. Lausanne is a city friendly to American students and provides a good environment for students to learn to speak French and experience Swiss culture. It is also home to the International Olympic Organization and is conveniently located near the world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival. The proximity to Geneva allows students to experience a city known for its international influence–Geneva is home to the European headquarters of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Red Cross, and the World Council of Churches. The language of instruction is English, but all students must register for a course in French. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2888">Students planning to participate in the program must begin their study of French before going overseas. During the summer, students can participate in Lausanne’s incredible internship program that provides them the opportunity to intern with some of the world’s best companies and organizations. </P>

<H5>Washington, DC Global Internship Program </H5>

<P>World-changing internships. Life-changing experiences. </P>

<P>Washington, DC, is not only the nation’s capital, it is also the internship capital of the world. Home to many of the world’s leading nonprofits, corporations, international institutions, and government agencies, the city offers thousands of internship opportunities to Pepperdine students of every major. The vision of the Washington, DC Global Internship Program is to enable Pepperdine students to turn their academic learning and curiosity into rewarding and fascinating careers with a global impact. </P>

<P>Past Pepperdine students have jump-started their future careers with internships in places such as the White House, World Vision, the Council on Foreign Relations, CNN, Teach for America, the Smithsonian, International Justice Mission, the U. S. Congress, and the Peace Corps. While living and learning in Washington, students gain the real-world experience and global awareness needed to compete for jobs in rewarding and exciting fields—jobs that will allow them to lead lives of purpose, service, and leadership in the US and around the world. </P>

<P>The Global Internship program offers a unique combination of professional development, global engagement, and leadership. In addition to internships, the program includes courses with a global focus, weekly briefings with experts in international affairs and social change, and networking events with other young professionals. During the academic year, students also deepen their global understanding through one-week International Study Tours (IST)—traveling to the Middle East during the fall semester and to Latin America during the spring. Recent classes have visited the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Cuba. </P>

<P>Students reside and study in a University-owned facility in the heart of Washington, just four blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The facility is next door to both George Washington and Georgetown Universities and is surrounded by numerous cafes, shops, and historic sites. The convenient location is near several Metro stops, which makes it easy for students to travel to internship work sites and provides them access to important historical and cultural locations and events all around the city. </P>

<P>In their free time, students can visit the US Capitol and see Congress in session; explore the city’s many free museums or memorials, including the National Museum of American History, the Washington Monument, or the Vietnam Memorial; tour the Supreme Court; or attend educational events and festivals hosted by 176 foreign embassies around the city. Students can also take advantage of the city’s location to explore the East Coast, as places like Boston, Philadelphia, and New York are within easy traveling distance. </P>

<H5>Global Fellows Program </H5>

<P>This is a program designed to produce the next generation of leaders who have the global knowledge, skills, and character necessary to confront the world’s most pressing problems. This is accomplished by offering a required package of multidisciplinary courses, a long-term overseas experience, an internationally focused internship in Washington, DC, and career mentoring. </P>

<P>Like a minor, it is designed to accompany most majors. In addition to prescribed course work the program requires the student to study overseas for one full academic year and one semester in Washington, DC. Students completing the Global Fellows Program will receive a certificate of completion that will appear on their academic transcript. For details on the program, see the description in the Interdisciplinary Programs section of the catalog. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2890">Expenses and Application Procedures </H3>

<P>Any Seaver College student who has demonstrated a level of academic and behavioral maturity compatible with the program’s requirements may apply for admission to an international program, although students may not participate until they have completed two semesters or 30 units. Exceptional students who have attended other colleges may also, on occasion, apply for admission to the program. However, such students must be admitted to Seaver College with a nondegree status before attending the program. </P>

<P>Since space is limited and admission to the program is competitive, students are urged to complete their applications as early as possible. Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis and students approved for admission to the program will be notified in writing. </P>

<P>Application information and other materials which provide complete program descriptions may be obtained by contacting: </P>

<P>The International Programs curriculum has been designed so that any Seaver College student, regardless of major, may benefit by participation. Students interested in attending the program should make this desire known to their academic advisors as early as possible so that this may be considered in the academic planning process. Admission decisions for the program are based on the student’s academic and Student Life discipline records, their application essay, a personal interview, and the potential for the student to profit academically and personally by participation. Students benefit most by participating in the program for an entire academic year, although single-semester applications will be accepted. </P>

<P>The cost for tuition is the same as for equivalent terms on the Malibu campus. The international programs charge covers the cost of room, most meals, round-trip air fare to the program, transfer from the airport to the program location, field excursions, an orientation program, and other benefits. All financial aid awards, except performance scholarships, may be used in these programs. Because students must be selected well in advance of the dates the programs begin overseas, the Malibu campus schedules are not applicable. All international programs begin with required orientation programs. Students who fail to complete the required orientation program may become ineligible to attend or continue in the program. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2891">Upon being accepted into an international program, the student is required to sign a contract and register for his or her courses. A $500 penalty is charged for withdrawal from the program. Other charges are detailed below. </P>

<H3>The Division </H3>

<P>The mission of the Business Administration Division is to provide students with a superior business and liberal arts education that prepares them for lives of ethical service and professional achievement in a competitive world. </P>

<P>The program at Seaver College is unusual in that it is embedded in a college of arts, letters, and sciences. More than tolerating or coexisting with the traditional goals of liberal baccalaureate education, the division seeks to embrace fully a liberal arts education as an essential component of the educated man or woman. The division expects its graduates to do well in business, yet of most importance is that they do well as individuals who are finding meaning and significance in life and are contributing to making the world a better place. Our goal is to educate students for ethical, fulfilling lives of service. </P>

<P>A liberal arts education has to do more with a spirit of inquiry than content; therefore, rather than taking a narrow approach, the division emphasizes broadly applicable skills: personal judgment and responsibility; an active, questioning mind sensitive to contexts; and the ability to make sense of “facts” and their implications for society. Questions of why or why not are more important than those of “how to.” </P>

<P>In addition to preparing students for life, the curriculum prepares students for careers in accounting, business, or management, and is an excellent foundation for graduate work in business administration. Special emphasis is currently available in the areas of economics, computer science, marketing, management, and finance if students choose their elective courses to match their interests. The various emphases allow students to prepare for entry-level jobs, while the other business requirements ensure a broader background for future professional advancement. </P>

<P>An accounting major is available for students who plan to do graduate work in accounting or to enter the fields of public or private accounting. This major involves more course work than the other majors. Its requirements are outlined below in the course requirements. </P>

<P>An international business major is available for students who are specifically interested in global business careers. This major requires some educational work abroad unless one is an international student. </P>

<P>The degrees offered by the Seaver College Business Administration Division are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2903">Special Programs and Opportunities </H3>

<P>The Communication Division sponsors a variety of programs and societies to supplement the regular academic schedule. </P>

<P>These organizations provide opportunities for communication majors to meet and work with professional journalists, broadcasters, advertising agencies, communication managers, organizational consultants, and public relations experts, and to enter professionally-sanctioned state and national competitions. Regular activities for journalism and broadcasting majors include the annual journalism and screen arts award banquets and participation in the Associated Collegiate Press convention, and the national conference of the Public Relations Student Society of America. There are active chapters of Lambda Pi Eta, the communication honor society; and the Public Relations Student Society of America. </P>

<P>The Pepperdine Communication mentoring fellowship offers students an opportunity to be mentored by members of the broadcast industry. Broadcast students participate in national video festival competitions at BEA and Reelstories. </P>

<P>Internship programs provide opportunities for all majors to work in a professional capacity with advertising and public relations agencies, with local radio stations, TV stations, and newspapers, and with governmental and industrial concerns. Students perform communication functions at the same time they complete their academic training. </P>

<P>Campus media and the forensics team, centered in the Communication Division, are important parts of student life. Students on the forensics team compete in British Parliamentary debate in the US and abroad. The University-operated television and radio stations provide entertainment and information to the campus and the Malibu community, and also provide invaluable on-air opportunities. Student publications inform the campus community through the newspaper, the Graphic; the Online Graphic; and the feature article magazine, Currents. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2904">Communication Bachelor of Arts Degrees </H3>

<P>Human symbolic activity is the focus of the communication disciplines. The use of symbols differentiates humans from all other forms of life. Hence, the heart of a liberal education is an understanding of how human symbols function in relationships, cultures, and societies. From ancient to modern times, philosophers and theorists have recognized the central importance of communication to human development and performance. </P>

<P>Communicating is a process that involves the interaction of human beings in society; it can be the means to create, maintain, or destroy societies and cultures. As communicators, humans are involved intrapersonally through thoughts, emotions, and beliefs and interpersonally through manifested symbolic communication activities. People also communicate via mediated channels and have messages distributed to mass audiences. By examining the various communication processes and systems, one can become a more beneficial and effective producer and consumer of various types of communication in an ever-changing global environment. </P>

<P>While there are many curricular differences in communication studies, the areas within the discipline share much in common. Clearly, our theoretical bases are all interrelated and interdependent. Differences do exist at the application level, but the concept of a common, supporting core of theory and research is fundamental to the Communication Division. Students majoring in any communication major must also take COM 180 as a part of their general education requirements. No other Seaver College general education course will serve as a substitute for this course. </P>

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Advertising </H3>

<P>The advertising major prepares students for careers in advertising agencies, in the advertising departments of the mass media, or in business organizations performing advertising functions. In addition to the general education requirements, all advertising students must take 44 units (34 upper-division) in the major and nine to 12 upper-division units in an outside concentration. </P>

<P>The outside concentration of nine to 12 upper-division units is designed to complement and support the major. The area of concentration must be outside of mass communication, and the student’s major advisor must approve the concentration area and the specific courses to be taken. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2905">Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies </H3>

<P>The student who majors in communication examines the role of verbal and nonverbal communication in human relationships. Since the process of communication is profoundly affected by contexts, modes, and media, as well as by personal characteristics, the major requires a broad range of courses. The study of communication is crucial to a broad liberal arts education. </P>

<P>Not only is the ability to communicate with symbols uniquely human (and, hence, central to understanding the human condition), but it is also of practical value. Communication skills are important in work and leisure, profession and home, politics and religion, and in many other areas. Many careers require a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of communication. </P>

<P>Because of our commitment to the liberal arts and the interdisciplinary nature of communication theory and inquiry, students in this major take course work in human communication, in mass communication, and in other complementary areas. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2909">Bachelor of Arts in Journalism </H3>

<P>The journalism major prepares students both theoretically and practically for careers in journalism across media including print and electronic text, television and the internet. The journalism major gives all students a broad interdisciplinary introduction to media theory and research plus philosophies, laws, and regulations important for the exercise of a free press in a democratic society. The major offers laboratory production opportunities in student media appropriate to students’ interests. Student media include a newspaper, a magazine, a cable television channel with entertainment and news programming, and a Web news site. Students also participate in internships at professional media outlets, especially in Southern California. </P>

<P>The best preparation for journalism includes a strong background in one or more academic areas beyond the journalism major. Thus, in addition to general education requirements and at least 46 units in the major, each student is required to take a minimum of 9 to 12 upper-division units in a field other than media selected in consultation with the student’s advisor. The selection should supplement and support the major and the career goals of the student. </P>

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Art History </H3>

<P>Study of the visual arts prepares students for leadership in the global, connected, and dynamic world of the 21st century. To truly understand the significance of a work of art, the art historian must comprehend not only its formal qualities, but also the political, social, and religious contexts in which the work was created. Students of art history place art in its comprehensive historical context, assess art and the field of art history critically and analytically, master research, writing, and presentation skills, and foster community engagement in art through outreach and education. By examining works of art from multiple perspectives, students develop an appreciation for diverse cultures and the vital role that art plays in human expression across time and space. </P>

<P>Students planning to major in art history spend the first two years taking two foundational courses, completing general education requirements, and mastering language skills. The junior and senior years are spent concentrating on the major. In consultation with an art history faculty advisor, art history majors can select one or more areas of concentration depending on interests and career goals. Majors are strongly encouraged to participate in at least one of Pepperdine’s international programs after consulting with an art history advisor regarding which international programs and courses would be most appropriate. </P>

<P>Art history majors should consider selecting German or French for their language requirement, as these languages are generally required in graduate-level art history programs. Students who test out of the Seaver College language requirement are strongly encouraged to take a 252-level language course and one upper-division language course in their language of choice. </P>

<H3>The Division </H3>

<P>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division believes that undergraduate education is the special place where students can refine their values and learn the ideas and methods of thinking that will enrich their lives and vocations. Its programs develop the excellence of mind and qualities of soul that foster intellectual independence: spirited inquiry and disciplined imagination; intelligent interpretation and persistent questioning of texts; reverence for language and rigorous exposition, argumentation, logic, and problem solving; attentiveness to the phenomena of time and the ordering of history; and aesthetic and ethical understanding. These programs of study are morally inscribed, mobilizing the virtues that go hand-in-hand with academic inquiry—courage and confidence in one’s undertakings, charity and civility, honesty and humility—all of which sustain communities of learning. This education aims to develop the whole person, whose habits of reflection and sound judgment strengthen students for lives of thoughtfulness, service, and responsible influence. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2931">This academic division offers degrees in the several areas of study listed above. Students majoring in the humanities disciplines have gone on to careers in elementary, secondary, and college-level education; law and advocacy; business and nonprofit corporations; professional writing and editing; stage and the arts; and television, radio, and film. The division’s emphasis on independent, rigorous thought and on collaborative analysis provides excellent preparation for graduate study in many fields. Graduates have achieved advanced degrees in business, creative writing, education, English, law, librarianship and information management, ministry and religion, and philosophy. Because the courses in this division develop skills and practices in written and verbal communication and in the arts of inquiry, they also complement any major. Double majors with non-humanistic disciplines are always welcomed. </P>

<P>The course offerings in the Humanities and Teacher Education Division are designed to: </P>

<H3>Professional Preparation </H3>

<P>Teaching and the Humanities </P>

<P>The Teacher Education department, housed in the same division with Humanities, maintains completely current instruction on all requirements toward a California teaching credential. The liberal arts for education major provides the breadth required of candidates for the multiple subject credential, while the English major provides the breadth and depth required of candidates for the single subject credential in English. (Single-subject teaching credentials are offered in a variety of other curricular areas as well.) Students can acquire both subject matter preparation and skills preparation, including: interpretation of literature; knowledge of the structure, history, and diversity of the English language; oral and written language skills; uses of technology; and (if they choose) teaching foundations and methodology. This study will prepare students for the appropriate credential examinations and for effective, well-informed teaching in their future occupation. </P>

<P>Business and the Humanities </P>

<P>The modern business world recognizes the value of a strong background in the liberal arts and the humanities for management positions in business. Corporate leaders have found that students majoring in the humanities have acquired the skills and training valuable for success in business: communication skills; flexibility; decision-making ability; research skills; appreciation of creativity and excellence; and sensitivity to cultural and ethnic differences. Humanities students considering business careers may take a number of business courses along with their Humanities Division courses. With this combined background they will find broad opportunities in the business field. </P>

<P>Pre-Law and the Humanities </P>

<P>Since the student will learn the content of law in law school, the best preparation in pre-law is an education that hones skills in analytical and logical thinking and in written and oral communication. A complete education should be the primary purpose of any liberal arts program, and the knowledge and intellectual maturity which the study of the humanities provides are aimed toward that goal. The English, history, and humanities degree programs are designed to provide training and practice in the skills needed in the field of law: logical thinking and analysis of arguments; close reading and analysis of texts; and effective writing and speaking. These skills will prepare students for the LSAT, for successful performance in their legal studies, and for a fulfilling career. </P>

<P>Professional Writing and Editing </P>

<P>The ability to write well has become a highly valued specialization; persons skilled in this area find careers in writing and editing not only in publishing companies and magazines, but in businesses and government agencies of all sorts, and in the creative arts. The degree programs in creative writing and in the English writing and rhetoric emphasis provide profession-oriented training and practice that foster creativity in a variety of genres and for a variety of purposes, critical appreciation of written texts, refinement of communication skills, and knowledge of language conventions. These degree programs coordinate classroom learning with practical application through University creative writing publications and internships. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3 id="LinkTarget_2932">Special Programs and Opportunities </H3>

<P>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division offers students many opportunities to broaden the study of their chosen discipline and to apply their knowledge in practice through tutoring, writing internships, and guided research. These activities prove valuable in developing knowledge and skills needed in graduate study and in various careers. </P>

<P>Minors </P>

<P>Students have the opportunity to add to their major in one of the humanities disciplines and minor in one (or more) of the following: African American studies, digital humanities, film studies, creative writing, writing, and women’s studies. In addition, the English and history disciplines offer minors as well as majors. In consultation with their advisors, students may design a rich and varied undergraduate experience. </P>

<P>Practical Application </P>

<P>Students who distinguish themselves in writing have the opportunity to gain practical experience applying their skills. After studying in a Writing Center practicum, they may be recommended for a paid position as a tutor in the Writing Center. In addition, writing internships are available in business, nonprofit organizations, and publishing companies. </P>

<P>Research </P>

<P>Students may participate in a summer research program under a faculty member who will direct a small group in a focused project. Summer research helps students to expand and refine their research skills, gain advanced knowledge in the field, develop professionalism, and identify their career goals. The summer research experience is especially valuable for students planning on graduate study in their discipline. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2933">Honor Societies </H3>

<P>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division includes a chapter of Kappa Delta Pi, the international professional honor society in education. Members are offered opportunities for professional and scholarly development, networking, and service. </P>

<P>Phi Alpha Theta </P>

<P>History majors will find a chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, the international honorary society in history, in the Humanities and Teacher Education Division.

The activities include participation in various professional gatherings and other events designed for the serious student of history. Members receive the society’s journal, The Historian. </P>

<P>Sigma Tau Delta </P>

<P>Pepperdine University shelters the Eta Psi chapter of Sigma Tau Delta, the international English honor society. Membership for students and faculty is a recognition of excellence in scholarship and creativity. The Pepperdine chapter sponsors activities related to the creative interests, scholarly and professional concerns, and service commitments of students of English. Students have the opportunity to submit creative writing and essays to the national society’s two journals. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing </H3>

<P>The creative writing major is primarily designed to prepare students for inspiring careers as professional writers of screen and television, the novel, poetry, and the short story. Through intensive practice in our three-tiered creative writing sequence, students hone not only their skills but their understanding of the expectations and challenges of writing and publishing. </P>

<P>The major also prepares students for advanced graduate degrees in creative writing, literature, and other fields, as well as a variety of professional careers. Many careers demand a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of writing; while providing this understanding, creative writing also fine tunes the student’s ear for language. These skills are important in work and leisure, written and oral media, self-exploration and politics, and in many other areas. </P>

<P>In addition to the general education requirements, students will complete a 34-unit sequence, which includes a course in spiritual writing and foundational courses in English literature. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2934">Bachelor of Arts in English </H3>

<P>The English major at Pepperdine University, with its focus on writing and rhetoric, literary study and criticism, and digital humanities, provides students with facility in the spoken and written word, a keen understanding of the power of language, and a more finely attuned moral and global awareness. Students who major in English possess the creativity and critical thinking skills sought by firms in media, technology, and business. They are prepared upon graduation to work in teaching and publishing, and they are well prepared for graduate and professional study that leads to careers in higher education and law. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Course of Studies </H5>

<P>Two lower-division and nine to 11 upper-division courses are required for the major.

Successful applicants are approved based on GPA, a recommendation from the ENG 201 instructor, and a demonstrated potential for successful completion of the honors thesis. In the fall semester of their senior year, students will work with a faculty advisor to develop a research proposal, which must be approved by the English Honors Committee by the end of the fall semester. The proposal should include a bibliography of relevant material (primary and secondary) as well as an abstract of the project. Students should work closely with their faculty mentor on the thesis. During the spring of their senior year, honors students will enroll in ENG 490 (an existing course that also includes non-honors students) and write an article-length thesis. The thesis will be submitted in April of the students’ senior year to their thesis advisor and to the English Honors Committee, who will determine whether honors will be awarded. Students are encouraged to present their research at local and national meetings and/or submit a revised article-length manuscript to a scholarly journal for publication. Students on whom the committee has conferred Honors on the basis of their theses will graduate with the notation “Honors in English” on their transcripts and diplomas. </P>

<H5 id="LinkTarget_2945">Teaching Credential Programs </H5>

<P>The objective of the Seaver teacher education program is to provide teacher candidates with the professional preparation and clinical experiences necessary to qualify them for the SB2042 Multiple Subject Preliminary Teaching Credential or the SB2042 Single Subject Preliminary Teaching Credential. The teaching credential program at Seaver is integrated into the bachelor’s degree so that a candidate can work toward a bachelor’s degree and a teaching credential simultaneously. Completing a bachelor’s degree and the teacher education program generally requires eight or nine semesters; therefore, careful attention should be given to course scheduling. EDUC 461, 462, and 463/464 should be taken before the Teaching and Content Area Methods course (EDUC 510 or 520). Teacher candidates should plan their schedules in order to be ready to take the methods courses and clinical experiences during their last two semesters. Teacher candidates are encouraged to complete all major course work before their full-day student teaching clinical experience begins and may choose to complete it either during their senior year or immediately upon graduation. </P>

<P>The credential programs were developed in compliance with requirements of the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The SB2042 credential issued by CTC includes English Learner authorization. To learn about California Teaching Credentials, see the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing at

<P>The multiple-subject teaching credential is generally considered to be an elementary school credential, most applicable to kindergarten and grades 1 through 6, where one classroom teacher traditionally is responsible for multiple subjects in the curriculum. This credential entitles the holder to teach a self-contained program, individually or as part of a teaching team, from preschool through grade 12. </P>

<P>Multiple-subject credential candidates must demonstrate subject-matter competence in the broad range of school curricula and teaching topics by passing the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET), which is offered regularly throughout the region by Evaluation Systems, Pearson. The state of California requires that students must have established subject-matter competence prior to beginning EDUC 510 and EDUC 521. This is a state requirement and cannot be waived. Other qualifications may need to be met through course work and/or tests. Students may discuss additional requirements with their advisor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2947">Single-Subject Credential </H5>

<P>Single-subject credential candidates may teach a single subject, specified on the credential, from preschool through grade 12. However, this credential is generally recognized as most appropriate for for those who want to teach middle and high school, grades 6 through 12. </P>

<P>Prior to beginning EDUC 520 and EDUC 521, teacher candidates must take and pass the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) to establish subject-matter competence. English majors in the commission-approved subject-matter program at Seaver are exempt from taking the CSET. All other candidates are required to take the CSET.

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in International Studies </H3>

<P>Every generation believes its own time to be of the greatest historical significance, but surely the past century was one of the more influential in history. Technological developments allowed scarcely-imagined advances in communication, transportation, and production. Medical research conquered ancient scourges and allowed millions to live who otherwise would have succumbed to disease. The world’s population soared from one to over six billion as a result of all these developments. Worldwide warfare brought to an end the age of empires, which had been a constant of the international scene since the dawn of history, and established the ideal of political and economic liberty. Religious belief, far from disappearing as many predicted, became increasingly influential worldwide. </P>

<P>These events have resulted in the emergence of a global metropolis where many different groups of people inhabit a world where traditional barriers of time and distance have fallen dramatically. The United States, the leading power of this time, has but four percent of the population of this new metropolis. Consequently, Americans—indeed, people from all countries— will need an ever-deeper understanding of the other residents of the global metropolis to maintain political stability, foster economic growth, and understand the views of those with markedly different attitudes, assumptions, and goals. This understanding will occur in a century in which constant change becomes a constant. In this volatile and interdependent world, students of international affairs must possess a keen grasp of the relationship of political, economic, and cultural forces. </P>

<P>To meet this challenge, Seaver College offers a bachelor of arts in international studies, which is an interdisciplinary major comprised of a sequence of courses in international politics, economics, and communication. Students further specialize in one of seven functional or regional areas such as economic studies, political studies, international management studies, international/intercultural communication studies, Asian studies, European studies, or Latin American studies. </P>

<P>The international studies major is designed for students who may enter such varied fields as diplomacy, government service, international mass media, multinational business, international religious service, and other fields requiring international understanding and expertise. It also provides a solid foundation for students wishing to pursue graduate degrees or to enter the job market for further experience and training in multicultural contexts. </P>

<P>The primary aims of the international studies major are: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>To provide undergraduates with the technical skills and conceptual ability to understand, appreciate, and interact profitably with communities outside American society. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>To demonstrate an understanding of the ethical implications of cross-cultural and global issues. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>To prepare students for careers in international affairs with government, private sector, and nonprofit organizations either upon graduation or through further study at graduate school. </LBody>

<Sect>
<H5>First-Year Program </H5>

<P>The international studies major should enroll in the typical first-year program as outlined in this catalog, taking COM 180, ECON 200, POSC 104, and languages as part of the general education work. Students planning to study abroad during their sophomore year should complete as many of these courses as possible during their first year. </P>

<H5>Required Courses for the Major </H5>

<P>The total number of units required for the major varies by specialization, but most require 32 units. See each specialization for exact course requirements. Four courses comprise the core of the international studies major. INTS 344, INTS 351, and INTS 514 provide students with an understanding of the economic, cultural, and political factors that comprise the international environment. (Students specializing in economic studies will take ECON 212 rather than INTS 351.) The Senior Seminar (INTS 497) is the major capstone course that integrates the student’s studies in these areas in general and the specialization in particular. </P>

<H5>International/Intercultural Communication Studies Specialization </H5>

<P>Cultural diversity is a fact of the global metropolis. Human societies have developed myriad ways of coping with and surviving the physical and social environment. Therefore, people are very different in their ways of making sense of the world, their acceptable rules for behavior, and their deeply-felt values. Increasing globalization brings many of these cultures in increasing contact—and conflict—with one another. The international studies major offers an international/intercultural communication studies track for students desiring to explore more deeply the cultural dimensions of international communication. This specialization has been developed especially for those who see their future work with individuals within international and intercultural institutions. Such work could relate to the mass media but is not limited to such efforts. Anyone working with educational, religious, or political institutions and any other group in which human interaction is of major significance could choose this particular specialization. In combination with business administration offerings or courses in political science, this emphasis also provides an opportunity for a broad-based preparation leading to enrollment in graduate programs or specific service career. </P>

<P>The Middle East/North Africa (MENA) is an area of great historical, cultural, religious, and strategic importance. It is an area that witnessed the first stirrings of civilization, the birth of the three great monotheistic religions, and a succession of empires. More recently, the area has experienced rapid economic development, fueled in part by its strategic location and vast reserves of oil and natural gas. Stretching from Morocco in northwestern Africa to Iran in southwestern Asia is a vast territory of great religious, ethnic, and linguistic diversity. Rapid economic, political, and social changes and divisions have at times sparked violent disputes, most notably the Arab-Israeli conflict and religious-based militancy. This specialization is intended for students interested in understanding in greater depth this area and for those interested in continuing their studies in graduate programs. </P>

<H5>The Honors Research Program in Biology </H5>

<P>Biology majors are encouraged to participate in the Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how scientists design experiments, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community. Students apply to the program in their sophomore or junior year and are admitted to the program based upon GPA, recommendations, career goals, and potential for successful completion of the program. Students are selected by a committee at midyear and, upon acceptance, develop research proposals in close consultation with a faculty member. After proposals are reviewed and approved by the committee, students begin preliminary experimentation. All students are required to spend the summer following acceptance to the program in full-time data collection and analysis. In order to complete the program, students must present their data in thesis form to an examining committee. After each candidate successfully completes an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student’s transcript and diploma be marked “Honors in Biology.” Thesis projects are often presented at local and national meetings and published in national and international scientific journals. </P>

<H5>Honors Research Program in Chemistry </H5>

<P>Chemistry majors are encouraged to participate in the Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how scientists design experiments, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community. Students generally apply to the program in their sophomore or junior year and are admitted to the program based upon grade point average, recommendations, career goals, and potential for successful completion of the program. Students are selected by a committee and, upon acceptance, develop a research plan in close consultation with a chemistry faculty member. Students work a sufficient length of time in the research laboratory to complete their project, often beginning their full-time work in the summer months. To complete the program, students must present their data in thesis form to an examining committee. After each candidate successfully completes an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student’s transcript and diploma be marked “Honors in Chemistry.” It is expected that students present their thesis projects at local or national meetings, and honors research projects are often published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. </P>

All students are expected to spend the second semester of their junior year, and possibly the summer between their junior and senior years, in data collection. The senior year is spent analyzing the data and preparing an honors thesis. To complete the program, students must present their data in thesis form to the examining committee. After successful completion of an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student’s transcript and diploma be marked “Honors in Sports Medicine.” It is expected that thesis projects will also be presented at local and national meetings and be published in national and international scientific journals. </P>

<H3>The Division </H3>

<P>With an emphasis on academic rigor and intellectual inquiry based on the personal commitment of each faculty member to Christ and the Christian faith, the Religion and Philosophy Division seeks to lead students into a deeper understanding of religion, especially of Christianity. </P>

<P>Academically, the division focuses on the one hand on biblical studies, Christian history, systematic theology, and practical theology/ministry; and on the other hand it explores matters of human knowledge and experience, morality and ethics, and reasoning. To those ends the division offers courses that introduce the student to the study of religion and philosophy within a variety of cultures, both ancient and modern. </P>

<P>Through its undergraduate majors, the division prepares students for a variety of undertakings. Some religion majors become ministers in local churches. Some will go on to earn graduate degrees (MA, MS, or MDiv) to enhance their ministerial skills and/or to pursue a career in university teaching. Majors in religion or philosophy provide students with a broad, liberal arts degree that prepares them well for graduate work and careers in law, journalism, business, psychology, counseling, government, and public service, to name but a few. </P>

<P>Through its three graduate degrees (MA in Religion, MS in Ministry, and MDiv), the division prepares students for a variety of Christian ministries, and for further graduate study in several related fields. Students who wish to combine their theological training with the training of the legal profession may earn the master of divinity degree jointly with the Juris Doctorate from the Pepperdine University School of Law. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3 id="LinkTarget_2974">Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy </H3>

<P>The philosophy major is designed to offer students a broad education in historical and contemporary philosophical explorations of various regions of human experience, including the nature of knowledge and reality, the theoretical foundations of morality and ethics, and the distinction between cogent and fallacious reasoning. Philosophy examines the fundamental assumptions and problems implicit in the framework of human experience, critically assesses those assumptions, and seeks to articulate and defend alternatives for their improvement. Consequently, the philosophy major offers students a valuable educational background for the pursuit of careers in law, journalism, government, Christian ministry, public service, and business. </P>

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Political Science </H3>

<P>Political science studies the world of governments and the governing process. It seeks an in-depth understanding of the political world, an understanding rooted in careful analysis and critical thinking, leading to thoughtful evaluations. The political science major is designed for students who are interested in public service and administration, politics, diplomacy, public relations, law, or business, or who wish to continue in graduate studies to pursue an academic career. A specialized major in government is also designed to satisfy the guidelines for a single-subject teaching credential in government. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Course Requirements </H5>

<P>All political science majors must take POSC 104 (four units). Normally, they should take this course before taking upper-division political science courses. </P>

<P>The political science major requires a minimum of 32 upper-division units. Political science majors who take POSC 250 must take 28 upper-division units to complete the major. To ensure a breadth of knowledge, a political science major must take at least one course from four of the following five fields of political science, and include a presentation skills/research methods course as well as a writing-intensive course: </P>

<P>Methodology: POSC 250 (GE, PS, RM), 310 (PS, RM), and </P>

<P>460 (PS, RM) Political theory: POSC 311 (WI), 416, 417, 518 American government and politics: POSC 409, 420–437 International relations: POSC 344 (WI), 442–449 Comparative government: POSC 353 (WI), 410, 451–459, 461 </P>

<P>No more than one supervised fieldwork class (POSC 495) can be included in the minimum of 32 upper-division political science units. A maximum of four units in supervised fieldwork may be taken for credit/no credit toward the required units in the major. Political science majors, particularly those planning to pursue graduate studies in political science, are urged to meet their general education mathematics requirement by taking POSC 250. </P>

<P>Students majoring in political science may choose to have one of the following classes applied toward the requirement of 32 upper-division units, but no more than one class will be accepted: INTS 445, INTS 453, INTS 455, or INTS 465. INTS 445 fulfills the Comparative Politics subfield requirement. INTS 453, INTS 455, and INTS 465 fulfill the International Relations subfield requirement. For students participating in the political science honors program, credit for POSC 491 and POSC 493 cannot be included in the minimum of 32 upper-division political science units. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>The Honors Research Program in Political Science </H5>

<P>Political science majors are encouraged to participate in the Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how professional political scientists design research projects, collect and analyze data or interpret philosophical texts, and communicate their results to the academic community. Students apply to the program in the spring semester of their junior year and are admitted to the program based on their GPA, career goals, successful completion of a course or courses in political methodology (such as POSC 250, 310, and/or 460), and the degree of congruence between the topic of the student’s proposed honors project and the expertise of the regular members of the political science faculty. Students are selected by a committee in the spring semester of the student’s junior year and are notified in time for preregistration for the fall semester of the next academic year. Upon acceptance into the program, students enroll in POSC 491: Honors Seminar. During the spring semester, the student will research and write an article-length manuscript under the supervision of one of the regular political science professors. In order to complete the program, students must present their findings in thesis form to an examining committee composed of the thesis supervisor and two other regular political science faculty. After each candidate successfully completes an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student’s transcript and diploma be marked “Honors in Political Science.” It is expected that the thesis will be presented as an academic conference paper and that a revised version will be submitted for publication as an article in a scholarly social science journal. </P>

<Sect>
<H3 id="LinkTarget_2986">Bachelor of Arts in Psychology </H3>

<P>The psychology major is designed for students who (1) plan careers as professional psychologists, (2) regard psychology as a liberal arts undergraduate foundation for subsequent training in other professions, and (3) are generally interested in understanding human behavior. Because graduate study is usually required for careers in the psychological professions, the major is designed to give adequate preparation for such study. </P>

<P>A total of 43 units is required for the major. These include 16 units of foundation requirements, 13 to 16 upper-division units selected from each of four basic content areas, and three to four upper-division units chosen from capstone courses, from either applied or integrative areas. Remaining units may be selected from the four basic content areas, capstone courses, or special interest areas. Scientific writing and service learning are important components of the psychology curriculum. Students wishing more information about the major and careers in psychology should pick up the Psychology Advisory Handbook in the Social Science Division office and attend functions of Psi Chi, the national honor society in psychology. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>The Honors Research Program in Psychology </H5>

<P>Psychology majors are encouraged to participate in the two-semester Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how psychological scientists design research projects, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community. Students apply to the program in the fall semester of their junior year and are admitted to the program based on their GPA, career goals, and successful completion of prerequisite psychology courses (PSYC 200 or 210, 250, 310, and enrollment in 442 during the spring semester of their junior year). Students are selected by a committee in the fall semester of their junior year and are notified in time for preregistration for the spring semester of that same academic year. Upon acceptance into the program, students enroll in PSYC 493 (Honors Research Seminar I) and PSYC 442 (Intermediate Statistics and Computer Applications) for the spring of their junior year, and then enroll in PSYC 494 (Honors Research Seminar II) for the fall of their senior year. During the first semester of the program, the student will design an original experiment including the formulation of a hypothesis, completion of a literature review, and creation of a research design under the supervision of one of the psychology professors. Students will be required to present their research proposals formally to the psychology faculty and the other students in the class. During the second semester of the program, students will collect and statistically analyze their data. In order to complete the program, students must present their research findings in written, APA format as a manuscript for publication as well as successfully complete an oral research presentation before the psychology faculty and students. Upon successful completion of these research requirements, the psychology faculty will recommend that students’ transcripts and diplomas be marked “Honors in Psychology.” It is expected that the research will be presented at a local, regional or national professional psychological conference. </P>

<H5>Industrial/Organizational Psychology Minor </H5>

<P>A minor in industrial/organizational psychology can be combined with a major in any field. A minimum of 19 units in the areas of psychology and business are required for the industrial/organizational psychology minor. Those majoring in the fields of psychology, sociology, and business may find an industrial/organizational psychology minor especially helpful to their career goals, but those majoring in political science, economics, religion, communication, and other fields may find it equally beneficial. A minor in industrial/organizational psychology may help students gain admission to master’s degree programs in business as well as industrial/ organizational psychology. The minor may also prepare students to secure employment in the human services field immediately after graduation with a bachelor’s degree. </P>

<P>Today, industrial/organizational psychologists continue to be active in offering professional services through the scientist/practitioner model in settings that involve human resource management. They work in both private and nonprofit sectors and in government agencies. Many offer service as professional consultants, managers, or evaluators. Other industrial/ organizational psychologists are employed in the public policy field, designing and promoting public and private sector businesses and programs that address the psychological concerns of the work setting today. </P>

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Sociology </H3>

<P>Sociology is the study of human societies and of human behavior and interactions in social settings. The sociology major is designed for individuals who (1) plan a profession in sociology (this will usually include an advanced degree in sociology), (2) are interested in a career in which sociology training would be beneficial, (3) are interested in a general study of human behavior in a social setting, or (4) desire to complement other courses of study. A total of 38 units is required for the major. </P>

<P>Given the relatively few units required for the major and the numerous overlaps in courses in related fields, students may want to consider a second major or minor. In many cases, a double major can be completed without having to take additional units beyond the 128 required for graduation. </P>

<P>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, also known as the Buckley Amendment or FERPA, provides, generally that (1) students shall have the right of access to their educational records, and (2) educational institutions shall not release educational records to nonschool employees without consent of the student, subject to the exceptions provided by law. “Students” as used in this notice includes former students but does not include applicants who have not attended Pepperdine University. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Right of Access </H5>

<P>With a few exceptions provided by law, students at Pepperdine University may see any of their educational records upon request. Access must be granted no later than 45 days after the request. Students further have the right, under established procedures, to challenge the factual accuracy of the records and to enter their viewpoints in the records. </P>

<P>Students may waive their right of access to recommendations and evaluations in the cases of admission, applications for employment, and nominations for awards. Pepperdine University may not require students to sign a waiver of their right of access to their records, but students and prospective students should be aware that users of recommendations and evaluations made without a signed waiver may discount their helpfulness and validity. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Disclosure of Student Records </H5>

<P>With several exceptions provided by law, Pepperdine University cannot release information concerning students to prospective employers, government agencies, credit bureaus, etc., without the written consent of the student. Students and alumni applying for jobs, credit, graduate school, etc., can expedite their applications by providing the University with written permission to release their records, specifying which records and to whom the release should be made. The student’s written consent is not required for the disclosure of grades, disciplinary action, or other information to parents of students who are dependents for federal income tax purposes. Parents requesting information may generally be granted access upon submission to the University of a signed statement or other evidence of federal income tax dependency. </P>

<P>The University has designated the following categories of information as “directory information,” which may be released to the public without notice or consent of the student: student’s name and ID number, address, telephone number, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, enrollment status, classification, thesis titles/topics, photograph, email address and the most recent previous public or private school attended by the student. </P>

<P>The student may request that certain categories of directory information not be released to the public without the student’s written consent. Such requests shall be submitted in accordance with the Student Records Policy of the University, which can be found at 
<Link>pepperdine.edu/registrar/policies</Link>

<H5>Further Information </H5>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_3013">Use of the Name of Pepperdine University or Seaver College </H3>

<P>Students, either individually or collectively, shall not, without the written consent of the proper University officials, use the name of Pepperdine University or Seaver College in connection with any activity of any kind outside of the regular work of the school.

<H3 id="LinkTarget_3014">Non-Discrimination Statement </H3>

<P>As a Christian University affiliated with the Churches of Christ, Pepperdine treats everyone with the respect and kindness that we have been called to show one another. The University community is a space where lives intersect and knowledge is discovered, which fortifies the strength found in our differences and uncovers the virtues revealed in diversity, unity, and restoration. To that end, Pepperdine is committed to fostering an environment free from discrimination as described in California Education Code Section 66270 and reserves its right to remain a Christian University by favoring co-religionists in its admissions decisions. </P>
