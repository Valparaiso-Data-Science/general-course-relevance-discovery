<H2>Origin and History </H2>

<P>Colgate University's origin dates to 1817 when 13 men — six clergy and seven laymen — met in the frontier settlement of Hamilton to found the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York. To this day Colgate people consider the number 13 a good omen. </P>

<P>The Baptist Education Society was chartered by the state in 1819 and chose Hamilton as the site for its school, which opened in 1820. The Colgate family connection was established in 1823 when Baptists in New York City — soap maker William Colgate among them — consolidated their seminary with the school in Hamilton to form the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution. </P>

<P>The oldest building on the current campus, West Hall, was built three years later in 1827. By 1834 the institution included preparatory, collegiate, and theological departments. The first students &quot;not having the ministry in view&quot; were admitted in 1839. </P>

<P>A state charter issued in 1846 changed the name to Madison University and established the right to grant degrees. Madison was changed to Colgate in 1890, recognizing nearly 70 years of continuous involvement and service by the Colgate family. </P>

<P>Colgate Academy, the preparatory department, was discontinued in 1912. The theological division merged with Rochester Theological Seminary in 1928 to become Colgate Rochester Divinity School, and Colgate has been non-sectarian since that time. The university became coeducational in 1970. </P>

<P>Colgate today is a highly selective, independent, coeducational liberal arts college enrolling approximately 2,900 undergraduates in programs that lead to a Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree. A small graduate program offers the Master of Arts (MA) and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degrees. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Accreditation </H2>

<P>Colgate University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, 267-284-5000. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education is an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Colgate University is also accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS). All Colgate degree programs are registered by the New York State Education Department, Office of Higher Education and the Professions, Cultural Education Center, Room 5B28, Albany, New York 12230, 518-474-5851. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Curriculum </H2>

<P>Fully reaccredited effective June 2018 by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Colgate offers a curriculum established around four academic divisions — Arts and Humanities, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Social Sciences, and University Studies. Colgate offers 55 undergraduate majors including several interdisciplinary programs. See Majors and Minors </P>

<P>The academic program consists of courses in the Liberal Arts Common Core, courses in the field of major, electives, and physical education classes. Competency must be demonstrated in a foreign or classical language and in English composition. First-year students enroll in a first-year seminar during the fall term. (See Undergraduate Program.) </P>

<P>Selection of the major is made before the end of the sophomore year from among the departmental majors or the interdisciplinary majors. Optional minors in all department fields are normally declared during the junior year. </P>

<P>Colgate offers a variety of academic experiences with an international emphasis including nine modern and two classical languages as well as more than 20 off-campus study groups, most of them overseas. As part of the liberal arts and sciences program, there are opportunities for honors, independent study, and research. The diversity within the academic program prepares students for many careers and life choices, including professions that require graduate school training. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Graduate Study </H2>

<P>Colgate offers a small graduate program leading to the Master of Arts (MA) in several academic fields and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. (See Graduate Program.) </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The University Community </H2>

<P>As a residential university in the village of Hamilton, Colgate is a community where students, faculty, and administrators share the challenges, joys, and responsibilities of learning. Respect for individuals is expected and fostered. Students are represented on both the Academic Affairs Board and the Student Affairs Board, the two major policy-making bodies in the governance system. The liaison committees reporting to the faculty and to the Student Senate are also composed of students, faculty, and administrators. These committees deal with matters ranging from multicultural affairs to the university budget. </P>

<P>Active and constructive participation is the key to Colgate community life. A look at the schedule of events for any given week will reveal many opportunities beyond the classroom, laboratory, and library — music, theater, art, lectures, films, athletics, and more — to suit almost every interest. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Centers and Institutes </H2>

<P>Colgate is home to several centers and institutes that serve the community by providing opportunities for research, service, and intellectual and personal development. </P>

<P>The Center for Freedom and Western Civilization seeks to enliven the intellectual discourse among students and faculty on campus by promoting a set of ideals that have their origins in Western civilization but are universal in scope and appeal. </P>

<P>The Center for International Programs was established in 2015 and houses the Office of Off-Campus Study and the Lampert Institute for Civic and Global Affairs. Activities that prepare students for their study abroad experience take place in the center, along with events sponsored by international student organizations. The center is a vibrant and flexible space to host events and programs that extend Colgate's reach around the world. With its conference room, lounge, and kitchen, the center serves as a gathering space for students, faculty and staff. </P>

<P>The Center for Language and Brain scientifically explores questions regarding neural mechanisms and functions of native and foreign language use and learning. </P>

<P>The Center for Learning, Teaching, and Research is dedicated to enhancing learning and teaching in support of students and faculty. It serves as a campus-wide clearinghouse for information and consultation about the development of academic skills and competencies that support high achievement. The center coordinates tutoring services and arranges one-on-one tutoring and peer-led group learning programs and undergraduate research. The center also has a variety of resources for faculty development, teaching, and scholarship. </P>

<P>The Center for Women's Studies located on the ground floor of East Hall, was established in 1991 to extend education on issues of gender and women's studies to the entire Colgate community. The center offers a classroom, offices, and a reading room with books, magazines, journals, and other resources. Dialogue among students, faculty, and staff as well as discussion groups, films, and other outreach programs sponsored by the center enhance the understanding of gender issues and the intellectual development of Colgate students outside the classroom. </P>

<P>Lampert Institute for Civic and Global Affairs provides a forum for study and debate in the areas of civic affairs and public leadership, applying insights from the liberal arts to the important challenges facing human beings around the world. </P>

<P>The Picker Interdisciplinary Science Institute fosters the creation of new knowledge that is obtainable only through the development of sustained interdisciplinary research. </P>

<P>The Max Shacknai Center for Outreach, Volunteerism, and Education (the COVE) was founded in 2001 and is Colgate's center for service, citizenship, and community building. Housed in Lathrop Hall, the COVE supports 40 student-led community-based teams (volunteer groups); offers alternative break opportunities; serves as a resource to faculty for service-learning courses; sponsors an internship program; offers a preorientation service program; is involved in campus life initiatives; offers topical, skill-based learning opportunities; raises awareness for local, national, and global social issues; and provides programming in social change-oriented career choices. The goal of the COVE is to foster a commitment to social responsibility and civic engagement within the Colgate community. The COVE includes a lounge, conference room, and staff offices. </P>

<P>The Shaw Wellness Institute promotes the holistic development of students and the Colgate community. </P>

<P>The Upstate Institute promotes a better understanding of the cultural, social, economic, and environmental resources of Upstate New York. </P>

<P>Writing and Speaking Center provides one-on-one peer assistance with writing projects and oral presentations from across the disciplines. Writers and speakers of all levels and abilities are welcome, with no referral necessary, and students may visit at any stage of the composing process, from initial brainstorming of ideas to review of a full draft or presentation. Appointments and walk-in hours are available at several campus locations each semester. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Students </H2>

<P>Colgate is a community of approximately 2,900 students — a size that support a richer variety of opportunities than would be possible within the context of a smaller college. The university seeks to admit individuals who are able and motivated to complete the academic program and who represent a diversity of talents and backgrounds that contribute to and enrich the campus community. Special promise in particular areas, such as art, music, theater, and athletics, is sought along with demonstrated academic achievement. Since 1967, academically and economically disadvantaged students with strong potential have been recruited and admitted to Colgate under the auspices of the Office of Undergraduate Studies. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Faculty </H2>

<P>The principal purpose of the university is undergraduate education, and all faculty members have teaching as their primary responsibility. Courses are taught by faculty members, not graduate students. Students and faculty share in the vigorous pursuit of learning, both inside and outside the classroom. </P>

<P>Colgate faculty members are productive artists, authors, and scholars whose professional work is important not only for the advancement of knowledge but also as a means by which teaching is continually refreshed and revitalized. </P>

<P>Interdisciplinary cooperation, exploration, and programming among faculty, as well as the university's commitment to undergraduate teaching and to the goals of academic freedom and excellence, make Colgate's teaching and learning experience outstanding. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Alumni </H2>

<P>Colgate's nearly 33,500 living alumni are particularly notable for their loyalty and have a tradition of strong engagement and philanthropic support. Their achievements as distinguished graduates in almost every field continually enhance Colgate's reputation. </P>

<P>Many alumni maintain an active interest in university affairs through admission recruitment, career advising, fundraising, reunions, speaking engagements on campus, Colgate publications, and more than 60 active district clubs around the world. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Campus </H2>

<P>Colgate University is located in the historic village of Hamilton, at the northern end of the Chenango Valley in upstate New York. Picturesque Hamilton, with a population of approximately 3,500, is centered on a village green. Students frequently shop in the village, although many resources are available to them right on the campus. The nearly 600 acres of the campus rise from the valley floor and village edge to a forested hill </P>

<Sect>
<H2>The Academic Program </H2>

<P>Colgate's curriculum includes a wide range of study opportunities in the arts, natural sciences, and social sciences. It is structured to provide a well-rounded liberal arts education and to prepare students for graduate and professional schools. A student's academic program consists of courses in the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, courses in the field of major, electives, and physical education classes. There are 55 majors offered, several of which are interdisciplinary in nature and offer honors programs. Qualified students are encouraged to participate in one of Colgate's more than 20 off-campus study groups. Other academic options include independent study courses, guided research, and approved off-campus (non-Colgate) study programs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Academic Curriculum </H2>

<P>The following sections describe important features of the curriculum. For more specific course requirements see Majors and Minors. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Academic Credit </H2>

<P>Academic credit toward the Colgate degree is expressed in terms of course credits. Most courses taken at Colgate carry one course credit (1.00) or the equivalent of four credits on the semester-hour basis. Fractional credit (0.25 or 0.50) is awarded for academic opportunities that do not fit easily into the standard one course/one credit structure. Fractional credit of 0.25 or 0.50 may be awarded for two types of courses: </P>

<P>(1) stand-alone fractional credit courses that have a clear intellectual rationale independent from other courses (e.g., approved half-semester courses, independent study/research); and (2) add-on fractional credit courses comprising components that intellectually engage students in ways that extend beyond the content of the full-credit course to which they are attached (e.g., laboratories, service learning, extended study, and performance). Add-on fractional credit may be either required or optional. A maximum of 2.00 course credits from add-on fractional credit courses may count toward the 32-course credit graduation requirement. There is no limitation on the number of stand-alone fractional credit courses that may count toward graduation. </P>

<P>All fractional credit courses receive separate grades. One-half credit courses are equivalent to two credits on the semester-hour basis and are indicated as 0.50 on the academic record. One-quarter credit courses are equivalent to one credit on the semester-hour basis and are indicated as 0.25 on the academic record. </P>

<P>As used in the catalogue, the term &quot;course&quot; means a full (1.00) course credit, as distinguished from fractional credit courses. All laboratories included in course descriptions as bearing academic credit carry </P>

<P>0.25 course credits, unless noted otherwise. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Curricular Requirements for Graduation </H2>

<P>Students must complete a minimum of 32.00 course credits (with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00) and requirements for the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, a major, and foreign language and writing (if stipulated upon admission). Additional requirements, including residency and physical education, are described in Academic Regulations. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Liberal Arts Core Curriculum: Crossing Boundaries </H2>

<P>Crossing Boundaries is the theme of Colgate's Liberal Arts Core Curriculum. The Core asks students to confront questions of identity, culture, and knowledge across intellectual boundaries. The Core crosses temporal and socio-political boundaries, as well as the boundaries of academic divisions and disciplines. It also emphasizes the capacities that are essential to a liberal arts education: critical reading and thinking, effective writing, being able to move from the specific to the general and back, understanding diverse perspectives, and an overall sense of intellectual wonder. </P>

<P>By having a Core, Colgate affirms the centrality of a common experience for our students as they grapple with enduring questions at the heart of a liberal arts education. That common experience takes seriously classic texts as well as multiculturalism and globalization, the importance of the past as well as the contemporary moment, the relevance of modern science and technology as well as the humanities. In sum, the Core asks students to think in integrative cross-disciplinary ways about their world and themselves. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Common Core </H2>

<P>Four inter-related components - Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, and Communities and Identities - constitute the Common Core. These courses provide contexts for engagement in cross-disciplinary conversation. They educate students in complementary ways about the origins, beliefs, traditions, social patterns, and profound ideas that shaped their own and other cultures, helping students see themselves honestly and critically within a diverse global and historical perspective. These courses also help students appreciate how an emerging global community can be transformed in dynamic and significant ways by advances in science and technology and by the rapid transmission of information, ideas, and practices. </P>

<P>The first two components are taught by faculty members from across the University who work together to develop these courses: all sections of these two courses share common texts. Legacies of the Ancient World explores ancient texts that have given rise to philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions that continue to influence academic and intellectual discourse and critical thought. In Challenges of Modernity, students and faculty explore a variety of texts that contributed to, or engaged with, the ideas and phenomena central to the intellectual legacy to which we and our students are heirs. </P>

<P>Scientific Perspectives on the World (SP) courses engage issues of broader social significance that require scientific literacy. These courses are multi-disciplinary in focus: the topics of the SP courses span the study of the physical world, biological processes, human behavior, mathematical methods, and technological innovations. Students fulfill their SP requirement by successfully completing one of the courses listed in the CORE: Scientific Perspectives on the World type in Course Descriptions. </P>

<P>Courses in the Communities and Identities (CI) component provide students with a multi-layered understanding of identities, cultures, and human experiences in particular geographically distinct communities and regions of the world. Students fulfill their CI requirement by successfully completing one of the courses listed in the CORE: Communities and Identities type in Course Descriptions. </P>

<P>These four Common Core courses are not sequential. Students may take the four required core courses in any order, but are expected to complete the four common core courses by the end of their sophomore year. Exceptions may be made for students completing certain programs (for example, pre-medical study) and for students with special individual circumstances. Students who have not completed the four common core courses by the end of the second year are required to obtain permission of the course instructor to enroll as juniors or seniors in core courses. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Areas of Inquiry </H2>

<P>Beyond the four common core courses, the Areas of Inquiry requirement is designed to foster breadth. Students take six additional courses from a range of disciplines with focus in certain areas. The curriculum is divided into three Areas of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression; Social Relations, Institutions, and Agents; and Natural Sciences and Mathematics. A student will fulfill the Areas of Inquiry requirement by taking two courses from two different departments or programs in each of the areas: </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Human Thought and Expression </H3>

<P>Courses in this component develop an understanding of what it means to be human: they focus on cultural and intellectual expressions throughout time. Most courses from the following departments/programs satisfy this area requirement: Art and Art History, the Classics, East Asian Languages and Literatures, English, German, Jewish Studies, Music, Philosophy, Religion, Romance Languages, Theater, and Writing and Rhetoric. Approved courses from other departments and programs (see the description of university studies below) may also satisfy the Human Thought and Expression Area of Inquiry requirement. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Social Relations, Institutions, and Agents </H3>

<P>Courses in this component expose students to the study of social order and human behavior in societies of the past and present. Most courses from the following departments satisfy this requirement: Economics, Educational Studies, Geography, History, Political Science, and Sociology and Anthropology. Approved courses from other departments and programs may also satisfy the Social Relations, Institutions, and Agents Areas of Inquiry requirement. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Natural Sciences and Mathematics </H3>

<P>Courses in this component apply theoretical and empirical methods to the study of living organisms, the physical world, and abstract and practical mathematics. Most courses from the following departments satisfy this requirement: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and Psychology, and several physical geography. Approved courses from other departments and programs may also satisfy the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Areas of Inquiry requirement. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to explore the range of departmental and programmatic offerings through the six-course Areas of Inquiry requirement early in their studies at Colgate. This can be helpful in making decisions about majors and minors. First- and second-year students should take the Areas of Inquiry requirement into account as they plan their programs. Areas of Inquiry courses can count toward the major or minor. </P>

<P>Students should note that the Areas of Inquiry requirement cannot be fulfilled by Advanced Placement credits or other pre-matriculation credit. Neither can this requirement be fulfilled by courses taken during a summer or winter/January intersession term, unless under exceptional circumstances and with permission of the department chair, division director, and associate dean of the faculty. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>University Studies </H3>

<P>As noted, approved courses from interdisciplinary programs can fulfill the Areas of Inquiry requirement. The Division of University Studies houses interdisciplinary programs in Africana and Latin American Studies; Asian Studies; Environmental Studies; Film and Media Studies; Jewish Studies; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies; Linguistics; Medieval and Renaissance Studies; Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies; Native American Studies; Peace and Conflict Studies; Russian and Eurasian Studies; and Women's Studies. It also houses the Department of Writing and Rhetoric and the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Global Engagements </H3>

<P>The Global Engagements (GE) requirement, furthers students' understanding of the complex and diverse world in which they live. Global Engagements courses provide students with an opportunity to analyze and debate the conditions and consequences of intercultural interaction, both in the United States and in the broader world, so that they will be prepared to confront responsibly the challenges of the 21st century. Courses in this component are drawn from departments and programs across the University; all inquire into the ways that people respond to and seek meaning in multicultural national and international contexts. These courses are identified in the registration materials available each semester. A course taken to fulfill GE credit may also fulfill an Areas of Inquiry and/or major/minor requirements. </P>

<P>In summary, the required Liberal Arts Core Curriculum has the following structure: </P>

<P>Common Core Courses </P>

<P>Legacies of the Ancient World Challenges of Modernity Scientific Perspective on the World Communities and Identities </P>

<P>Areas of Inquiry </P>

<P>Human Thought and Expression (2 courses) Social Relations, Institutions, and Agents (2 courses) Natural Sciences and Mathematics (2 courses) </P>

<P>Global Engagements </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Distinction Seminar in the Liberal Arts Core </H2>

<P>An optional component of the Liberal Arts Core program is the Distinction Seminar in the Liberal Arts Core. The goal of the distinction seminar is to complement honors work in departments and programs by giving students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their honors projects. This option is open to students who have completed their Core requirements with the requisite average grade. </P>

<P>For additional information see the Liberal Arts Common Core </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Language Requirement </H2>

<P>Foreign language competence is of critical value in understanding today's world. In addition, language skills are required by many graduate schools and may be necessary to qualify for certain professional positions, particularly in today's global economy. </P>

<P>The graduation requirement of competence in a foreign or classical language may be demonstrated in one of three ways: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>by successfully completing at least three years of study of one foreign or classical language (through the third level) in a secondary school prior to enrolling at Colgate; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>by demonstrating basic language skills as measured by tested proficiency (e.g., a score of 580 or better on the SAT Subject Tests in a foreign or classical language); </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>by successfully completing the study of a foreign or classical language at Colgate through at least </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>one term at the intermediate level. Students are expected to complete the language requirement by the end of the fourth term at Colgate. A registration hold will be placed on the record of a student who fails to satisfy the requirement by this time. The student will be required to register for an appropriate course in the fifth term. The registration hold will remain in place until the requirement has been satisfied. </P>

<P>Language study is also required prior to participation in some of Colgate's off-campus study groups. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>First-Year Seminars </H2>

<P>Director Frey </P>

<P>First-year seminars (FSEMs) are designed to introduce students to a variety of liberal arts topics, skills, and ways of learning, including the importance of academic integrity. The FSEM emphasizes all aspects of the learning process including the exploration of individual needs and strengths, interactions with classmates, and the multiplicity of resources beyond the classroom. Special emphasis is placed on improving writing skills and using the library's many resources. The merging of these elements into a single course provides a prime opportunity for the student to obtain a breadth of college-level experience and academic perspective. Many first-year seminars will earn credit within the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, including Areas of Inquiry. FSEMs are listed each year in the first-year student registration materials. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC) </H2>

<P>Colgate University seeks to create an international ethos for the liberal arts by expanding the range of curricular settings in which students and professors can develop and use foreign language skills. Beyond the foreign language departments, faculty in various departments and programs encourage the use of foreign language materials in their curricula, and certain courses - such as literature in translation - offer FLAC sections in which students can engage with the material in the relevant foreign language. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Major Programs </H2>

<P>Students investigate a body of knowledge in depth in a major. An official major must be selected and filed in the Office of the Registrar in the second term of the sophomore year. Students who fail to declare a major by the announced deadline will not be permitted to register for the upcoming term. A student may subsequently change majors with the approval of the new department chair or program director and the filing of a new declaration of major form with the registrar. Most major programs are centered on a single discipline and supervised by one academic department; however, a number of interdisciplinary majors permit students to major in a subject that involves several related departments. Some even cross divisional boundaries. A minimum grade of C- in introductory courses is normally needed for admission to a major. For graduation, the minimum grade point average (GPA) required for courses counted toward the major is 2.00 (C). </P>

<P>The major program includes at least eight courses. Most departments or programs also require a senior-level seminar or research course or independent study. </P>

<P>Students may pursue a double major, a major and a minor, or a major and two minors. No more than two majors, one major and one minor, or a major and two minors, may be recorded on a student's transcript. Students should see Majors and Minors for an alphabetical list. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Bachelor of Arts Degree (AB) Programs </H2>

<P>The major programs are approved by the Dean's Advisory Council and registered officially with the New York State Education Department. Specific major and honors requirements are found in Majors and Minors. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Double Major </H2>

<P>Some students elect to fulfill the requirements for two separate majors. This choice helps focus the plan of study but greatly reduces one's freedom in electing courses each semester. </P>

<P>Students wishing to declare a second major must formally file their plan with the registrar by the end of full-term course withdrawal period in the first term of the senior year. </P>

<P>The form filed first will be considered the primary major, unless the registrar is informed that the second form filed is to be the primary major. Students who elect to complete a double major must let each supervising department or program know that a second major is being pursued. </P>

<P>A course may be used to satisfy requirements in both majors. A student will only be considered to have completed a double major when at least seven of the courses completed in fulfillment of each major are unique. If the primary major requires cognate courses (which must be taken but which are not actually considered part of the major), these cognate courses may be counted toward the second major. The minimum GPA of 2.00, required for completion of the primary major, also applies to a second major. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Topical Majors </H2>

<P>Topical majors allow students, with the advice of a faculty adviser, to design an independent, interdisciplinary course of study outside the existing department and program structure. Topical majors are used for student major programs that encompass courses from more than one department or program. The three topical major programs are in Arts and Humanities, Natural Science, and Social Sciences. Although administered at the divisional level, some topical majors may cross divisional lines. Topical major programs are approved by the respective division directors. In all cases, Colgate's general requirements for graduation will apply. Topical majors are described under their respective divisions within the alphabetical order of Majors and Minors. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Minor </H2>

<P>Every department and nearly every program at Colgate offers an optional minor consisting of at least five designated courses or types of courses. A major and a minor may have overlap of course requirements, but at least seven courses must be unique to the major and at least four courses must be unique to each minor. Minors should include coursework at the intermediate or advanced level. A minimum GPA of 2.00 (C) is required in all courses counted toward a minor. Minors must be filed with the registrar by the end of full-term withdrawal period in the first term of the senior year. No student may declare a minor in the same field as the student's major. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Academic Advising </H2>

<P>Faculty advising can be essential to a student's success and sense of satisfaction with the academic program. Colgate recognizes that academic advising needs can be diverse, and individual expectations and requirements often change with time. Effective advising develops in a timely fashion when students take the responsibility of reading this catalogue and the Colgate Student Handbook, and seek assistance early and often. </P>

<P>Academic advising typically follows this pattern during the four years at Colgate: </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Prior to the first semester </H2>

<P>Students select courses for the first semester during July, prior to their arrival on campus for the fall orientation program. At this point the first-year web pages, and summer pre-matriculation faculty advisers serve as the primary resources for academic planning and course selection. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The First Semester - Course-Based Advising </H2>

<P>One of the four courses that each student selects for the first semester is a first-year seminar. The instructor for this course serves as the faculty adviser for each student enrolled in the seminar. During the first-year orientation program, students meet with their faculty advisers in individual advising sessions and review their fall course schedules. </P>

<P>Throughout the semester, the faculty adviser serves as an important source of counsel and guidance, gives information on course withdrawal and registration for spring term, and monitors midterm reports. Each semester, students are required to consult with their academic advisers prior to registration. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Second and Third Semesters - Transition Advising </H2>

<P>The advising relationship with the first-year seminar instructor usually continues until a major is selected. Students may change their official advisers by completing a form available from the Office of the Registrar. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Fourth Semester - Declaration of the Major </H2>

<P>In spring semester of the sophomore year, each student must declare a major by completing a form to be turned in at the Office of the Registrar. The student chooses or is assigned a major adviser at this time. The major adviser is a mentor who advises students about requirements in the context of a sound, comprehensive academic program. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Administration's Role in Academic Advising </H2>

<P>The academic advising program is administered by the Office of the Dean of the Faculty and Provost. Questions, concerns, and suggestions about academic advising at Colgate should be directed to the director of academic support and disability services in the Center for Learning, Teaching, and Research. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors and Awards </H2>

<P>Colgate University encourages students to strive for excellence in their chosen fields of academic endeavor and honors those who achieve distinction in their academic performance. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors in Major </H2>

<P>Students who earn honors in their majors have so mastered their disciplines that they are able to complete with distinction original work appropriate to their chosen fields of study. While specific requirements differ, all majors (except topical majors) offer the opportunity to pursue honors or high honors. Most major honors require completion of department or program courses with a designated grade point average (GPA) as well as a project designed and pursued independently under the guidance of a faculty sponsor. Departments and programs will determine whether the oral presentation and/or written reports are of a quality appropriate for honors. For details consult the departmental or program major listed alphabetically in Departments and Programs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>University Honors </H2>

<P>Students who maintain a consistently high grade point average (GPA) throughout their academic careers are recognized for their achievements by the awarding of university honors at graduation. University honors are summa cum laude (3.80 for all courses attempted), magna cum laude (3.50), and cum laude (3.30). GPAs for university honors are established and reviewed by the Dean's Advisory Council. A minimum of 22 Colgate courses taken for a grade will be considered for university honors. Transfer students who have taken between 16 and 22 Colgate courses for a grade will be considered for university honors. </P>

<P>The valedictorian and salutatorian are the students who have the highest and second highest rank in the graduating class based upon the cumulative GPA in all courses taken for a grade. Transfer students must be enrolled at Colgate for at least six terms in order to be considered eligible for the university honor of valedictorian or salutatorian. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Dean's Award </H2>

<P>The following awards are presented each term to students who achieve the following </P>

<P>Dean's Award with Distinction - Students who receive a term grade point average of 3.6 or higher while completing at least 3 course credits for a conventional letter grade and a minimum of 3.75 total course credits. </P>

<P>Dean's Award - Students who receive a term grade point average of 3.3 or higher while completing at least 3 course credits for a conventional letter grade and a minimum of 3.75 total course credits. </P>

<H2>Off-Campus Study </H2>

<P>Acquiring an intercultural perspective is an important goal of Colgate's liberal arts education. The university offers a wide variety of off-campus programs that combine rigorous academic study with meaningful cultural engagement. The world campus provides access to lectures by distinguished scholars and readings by well-known writers; it opens the doors of museums, libraries, theaters and temples; and it allows students to experience the day-to-day fascination of a new and stimulating environment. </P>

<P>Most programs require language study. Even when not required, the university strongly recommends that students undertake it to achieve a working knowledge of the language of their host country. This effort will not only greatly enhance cultural understanding, but also be regarded as a mark of sincerity and respect in the host country. </P>

<P>The off-campus study program is administered by the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs (OCSIP) in McGregory Hall. Options include semester-long Colgate study groups directed by Colgate faculty; semester-long approved programs offered by other universities or education providers; and extended study courses taught by Colgate faculty that include a three- to five-week off-campus component. </P>

<P>Students are advised to meet with an off-campus study adviser to learn more about their options and plan ahead in order to take best advantage of this opportunity. Students should consult their academic adviser and department early in the process to discuss degree requirements and any courses to be applied towards the major or minor. </P>

<P>For more information see Off-Campus Study. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Application and Enrollment </H2>

<P>Application to off-campus study programs is made through the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs. Applicants must meet the GPA requirements and prerequisites of their desired program, and be in good academic, financial, and disciplinary standing. Students must demonstrate personal and academic maturity equal to the demands of the off-campus program, which often exceeds the demands of the campus. This maturity should be attested to by the student's academic record, administrative dean, and academic adviser. Admission to an off-campus study program is competitive and not guaranteed. </P>

<P>The application deadline is normally in November for Colgate Study Groups (Faculty led) and may be found online at colgate.edu/OCS. The annual deadline for Approved, non-Colgate programs is in early February for all of the following year, fall and spring semesters. Programs are listed for review by academic department on the Off-Campus Study/International Programs website at Colgate.edu/OCS. </P>

<P>The number of students permitted to study off campus is managed by the university. Colgate makes every effort to accommodate requests for off-campus study that will enable students to deepen their liberal arts education with coursework sponsored by other institutions. Nonetheless, the university needs to balance enrollments across both semesters and so reserves the right to regulate the number of students who are granted permission to study off campus each semester. Careful planning is vital to successful off-campus study. Students should discuss projected off-campus study plans with OCSIP and their academic advisers, considering options for both fall and spring terms that will achieve their educational objectives. Students attending a Colgate study group, approved program, or extended study remain enrolled at Colgate during their time off-campus. </P>

<P>Please refer to the Off-Campus Study section in Academic Regulations, for additional policies concerning the transfer of credit and grades from off-campus study programs. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Tuition and Financial Aid </H2>

<P>Colgate's off-campus study tuition and financial structure make programs accessible for all students, regardless of financial means, just as it does for on-campus programs, and helps to ensure that the programs attended by our students meet the university's high standards for academic rigor and quality. </P>

<P>Students who study on a Colgate-directed study group or on an approved program continue to pay Colgate tuition and are eligible for Colgate need-based financial aid when studying off campus. Students are billed for tuition by Colgate for the semester they will be off campus plus the cost of any room, board, or other expenses charged by the study group or approved program. Students are responsible for paying other non-billable expenses, such as airfare, books, refundable deposits, optional fees, and personal incidentals directly. Estimated student budgets are available on the OCSIP web pages at colgate.edu/OCS. </P>

<P>Students receiving need-based financial aid will have their financial aid package reviewed by the Office of Financial Aid for the semester they will be abroad. Financial aid is applied to students' accounts at the time of billing. Students are responsible for paying any balance due to Colgate. If there is a credit due, it will be released to the student shortly before the start of the semester. </P>

<P>Financial aid may be increased to meet the additional cost of off-campus study for only one semester. Students participating in a second semester-long program will have their awards capped at the amount they would have received if they were to have remained on campus. Financial aid for extended study is limited to one extended study program. </P>

<P>For information regarding withdrawal from off-campus study, see Withdrawal and Refund Policy section in Expenses. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Colgate Study Groups </H2>

<P>Colgate study groups provide students the opportunity to study off campus for a semester under the guidance and mentorship of a Colgate faculty member. Each study group has a unique academic focus and immerses students in new cultures, perspectives and experiences. Depending on the program, students will live together with their peers or with local host families. Study groups primarily accommodate registered Colgate students, though students from other colleges may participate with visiting-student status on a space-available basis. Study groups normally enroll 15-18 students and are subject to minimum enrollment numbers to run. </P>

<P>Colgate regularly offers the following study groups on an annual or biennial basis. For specific details, consult the OCSIP web pages at colgate.edu/OCS. It should be noted that changes may occur in the scheduling of study groups and that new groups may be added. </P>

<H2>Approved Programs </H2>

<P>Colgate allows students to study off campus on a select list of approved programs offered by third-party educational providers or other U.S. universities, or to enroll directly in approved foreign universities throughout the world and transfer course credit toward degree requirements. Approved programs have been carefully vetted by the Off-Campus Study Committee and academic departments for compatibility with Colgate's curriculum. In addition to meeting Colgate's expectations for academic rigor, they offer strong on-site support services and emergency support, and provide opportunities for meaningful engagement in the host culture. </P>

<P>Colgate's approved programs list is available on the Off-Campus study web pages at colgate.edu/OCS, and includes over 100 programs in 50 countries. Approved programs expand the possibilities for students with diverse academic interests and goals by providing options in a wide range of locations as well as a variety of program models. </P>

<P>As a way of ensuring an immersive study abroad experience, students participating on approved programs that are hosted in a non-English speaking country or in a country in which English is one of many official languages, are required to take at least one language class in that program's native language or one course taught in a local language other than English during the program. This policy will go into effect with applications for the 2019-2020 academic year. Please consult the Off-Campus Study website for a list of language requirements for each country. Ordinarily, exceptions will not be granted. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Extended Study </H2>

<P>A number of Colgate courses offer short-term study components that extend the course beyond the campus and beyond the regular term. These programs offer opportunities for students to gain access to institutions and individuals relevant to their coursework that are not available on campus. Extended study is particularly attractive to students whose schedules do not permit them to participate in semester-long programs. The university has developed some twenty extended study courses, of which five or six are offered each year. </P>

<P>Prerequisites may exist for extended study courses. Any seniors electing to participate in a spring extended study will graduate at the next degree conferral date, but will be eligible to apply for participation in the May commencement ceremony. Please refer to the student handbook for details on commencement participation. </P>

<P>New extended study courses are added on a regular basis. Please see the OCSIP web pages for a complete listing of courses offering extended study components. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Other Programs </H2>

<P>Students with a compelling academic rationale whose academic interests cannot be met by a Colgate study group or approved program may petition the Off-Campus Study Committee to attend an alternate program. Students should begin by speaking with an off-campus study adviser who will involve the student's academic adviser and department chair only if the program meets Colgate's expectations for academic rigor, health and safety, and cultural engagement. Petitions are vetted and determined by the Off-Campus Study Committee and require the support of a student's academic department and faculty adviser. </P>

<P>Students who do not submit a petition or whose petitions are denied, will not be eligible for Colgate financial aid or grant assistance, nor will academic credit transfer toward the degree. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Petitions for Travel to Countries under a U.S. State Department Travel Warning  </H2>

<P>Colgate students are subject to the Colgate Travel Warning policy outlined on the Off-Campus Study website (colgate.edu/OCS). Students may not receive sponsorship for activities abroad, including credit for study abroad; funding for internships, research, or volunteer activities; or sponsorship for extracurricular activities, such as music or sport, for countries for which the U.S. State Department has issued a travel warning, unless granted special approval through a petition process. </P>

<P>Students who seek approval to visit a travel warning country must submit a petition package outlined on the website. The OCS staff, along with the university's risk manager, will review Colgate student petitions to study, intern, research, or volunteer. Students whose petitions are granted will be required to complete additional waivers and acknowledgment-of-risk forms and have them signed by their parents. All final approvals are contingent on the country maintaining its security or health status at the time of the approval. If country conditions deteriorate between the time of the approval and the departure date, Colgate reserves the right to revoke approval citing possible danger to the student. </P>

<H2>Pre-Engineering Studies </H2>

<P>Adviser Tseng </P>

<P>To combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University and Washington University (St. Louis), under which a competent student may pursue this option. He or she may earn bachelor's degrees from both institutions by spending three years at Colgate as a physics major and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan). The pre-engineering student may be eligible to continue study for a master's degree. For further information, students should consult the Pre-Engineering adviser or the chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. </P>

<H2>Sophomore Residential Seminars </H2>

<P>Director Wong and Fujioka </P>

<P>This program is a faculty-led, yearlong program that integrates residential, classroom, and academic-travel experiences. Students in the program live together with other members of their chosen seminar. Faculty who teach these seminars act as mentors to this group of students, encouraging reflection and fostering discussion. In doing so, they help the members of the seminar to build a community, one centered on an intellectual pursuit but which extends beyond the classroom. </P>

<P>Members of the seminar travel with their professor for one week in January, deepening and broadening their understanding of the class material. (There is no charge to students for the travel component.) In the spring, all sophomore residential seminar students complete a 0.25-credit course, in order to develop the conversation of the class in light of the travel experience. </P>

<P>Applications for the SRS program are made available to rising sophomores at the beginning of the spring semester of their first year. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Summer Research </H2>

<P>Each year approximately 200 Colgate undergraduates receive research assistantships and fellowships funded directly by Colgate, corporate or foundation grants, individual donors, or individual faculty research grants. This funding provides a weekly stipend to enable students to work full time during the summer on research or scholarly projects in close collaboration with one or more faculty members. Often these activities result in presentation of papers at professional meetings or publication in the scientific and scholarly literature, with undergraduate students as co-authors, performers, and exhibitors. </P>

<P>Student/faculty-initiated research proposals are used as the basis for awarding summer research assistantships or fellowships of eight to ten weeks in duration. Partially subsidized on-campus housing options and special academic and recreational events enhance this scholarly summer community at Colgate. </P>

<P>Colgate understands the educational value of research by undergraduate students and is committed to its support. The college is recognized as a national leader in this activity with students and professors from all academic divisions participating. Details about on-campus summer research opportunities may be obtained from department chairs, division directors, or the Center for Learning, Teaching, and Research. </P>

<H2>Teacher Preparation Programs </H2>

<P>Director Gardner </P>

<P>Programs are available to prospective secondary school teachers in the fields of English, mathematics, social studies (economics, geography, history, political science, sociology) and natural science (biology, chemistry, earth science, or physics). Students in these programs major in academic areas for which adolescence teaching certification is sought and take appropriate coursework in the Department of Educational Studies. The department also offers a childhood certification program in elementary school teaching for grades 1-6. Students who wish to gain New York State teacher certification have the option of completing their professional semester in the fall term following graduation as part of the ninth semester program. To be eligible for this special program, students must have received their Colgate degree in the academic year prior to the professional semester and completed all other certification requirements prior to enrolling in the ninth semester. In the ninth semester, students are allowed to enroll only in the professional semester courses, which consist of two or three seminars (depending upon adolescence or childhood certification) and student teaching. Students interested in the ninth semester program should meet with an educational studies faculty member to determine if they are eligible and apply to the program in the spring of their junior year. Colgate's undergraduate adolescence and childhood certification programs and the MAT adolescence programs are accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC) for a period of seven years from May 7, 2014 until May 7, 2021. </P>

<P>Successful completion of all requirements in all teacher preparation programs leads to recommendation for New York State initial teacher certification. </P>

<H2>New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium </H2>

<P>Established with the support of The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium facilitates collaboration among its member institutions in fulfilling their educational missions and serving the public good. Through the sharing of expertise and resources, the Consortium enhances options for students, faculty, and staff. In addition to Colgate, members of the consortium include Hamilton College, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Skidmore College, St. Lawrence University, and Union College. </P>

<P>Students who have completed at least one semester at Colgate have the opportunity to participate in a collaborative cross-registration program made possible through the New York Six Consortium. To be eligible to cross-register, students must be enrolled in a minimum of 3.00 course credits at Colgate. Courses taken as part of this cross-registration program will count as institutional (Colgate) credit, and grades earned will be recorded on the Colgate transcript and calculated into the Colgate grade point average. Because cross-registered courses count as part of the student's full-time Colgate course load, no additional tuition is assessed by the host institution. Normally students may only cross-register for one New York Six course per term. A maximum of three New York Six credits will count toward the Colgate degree. For additional information, please refer to the registrar's office web pages at colgate.edu/registrar. </P>

<H2>Less-Commonly Taught Language Program </H2>

<P>The Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTL) Program provides opportunities for students to study languages not available through the regular Colgate curriculum. LCTL courses are offered through two methods: shared course initiatives with instructors located on other campuses and self-instructional language courses overseen by the Director of the Keck Center for Language Study and the Language Council. LCTL courses are never offered for languages being taught on campus at Colgate nor do they count toward the completion of Colgate's language requirement. The Language Council regularly reviews the effectiveness of LCTL courses to determine whether they are suitable for the Colgate curriculum. </P>

<P>Upon approval from the Language Council, the Curriculum Committee, the Registrar, and any other relevant program of study, shared courses will be listed among the course offerings. Students will receive credit for courses taught through the New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium according to the guidelines of that agreement. Courses taught at any other institution will be treated as transfer credit. </P>

<P>Students with a compelling academic rationale to study a language not offered through any other means may apply for a self-instructional language course. The application procedure includes writing a detailed explanation of how the language study fits within the student's broader academic studies and an interview by members of the Language Council. Students may earn a maximum of 0.5 credits per semester for self-instructional language study. All self-instructional language courses must be taken with the S/U grade option. The final grade in the course will be determined by the director of the Keck Center, and will be based upon completion of self-instructional materials, regular meetings with a native-speaking language partner, and an assessment by an outside reviewer. All courses will have the 'LCTL' course designation. Students interested in LCTL should contact the director of the Keck Center for Language Study. </P>

<H1>Academic Regulations </H1>

<Sect>
<H2>Requirements for Graduation </H2>

<P>Colgate confers one undergraduate degree, the Bachelor of Arts (AB). A minimum of 32 academic course credits is required for graduation. A maximum of 2 credits from add-on fractional credit courses may count toward this requirement. </P>

<P>All students must meet the following requirements: a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of </P>

<P>2.00 for all Colgate courses and a GPA of 2.00 in the major. Both full and fractional credit courses are included in the GPA. Colgate grades range from a high of A+ (4.33) to F (0.00). </P>

<P>It is the student's responsibility to know where he or she stands in terms of completing graduation requirements. Students may track academic progress and plan for future semesters using Colgate's degree audit program, which is available in the Colgate portal. Unofficial transcripts are also available in the portal, or students may request a copy from the Office of the Registrar. Students should consult with their department chair or program director and with the registrar's office if there are questions regarding major, minor, or graduation requirements. </P>

<P>Students must meet all requirements of the academic program in order to be eligible for graduation, including the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, major, foreign language, and writing (if stipulated at admission). Additionally, physical education, residency, and all financial obligations to the university must be satisfied. </P>

<P>Degree requirements must be completed within 12 years of initial matriculation. Petitions for exemptions to this rule will be considered only in exceptional circumstances, and approved petitions for degree completion may require additional coursework to reflect changes in the university's academic program. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Residency Requirement </H2>

<P>Matriculated students entering as first-year students are required to complete seven terms in academic residence at Colgate. Transfer students are required to complete a minimum of four terms in academic residence at Colgate. A student participating in a Colgate study group is considered to be &quot;in academic residence&quot; for the purposes of this requirement. One semester of participation in an approved program will also count toward this requirement. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Physical Education Requirement </H2>

<P>Students must complete two units of physical education at Colgate. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of sophomore year. A complete listing of physical education and outdoor education activities may be found in the description of the physical education department web page. Athletes may earn one physical education credit for each season of participation on varsity teams. Students may earn a maximum of one physical education credit from a club sport. Questions about physical education credits should be directed to the Department of Physical Education. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Registration </H2>

<P>Students are expected to participate in official course registration on the announced dates for each term of attendance. Later registration will jeopardize admission to courses. </P>

<P>A student's registration will be canceled if the student is not confirmed in residence on campus by the sixth day of classes in a semester. Similarly, a student will be unable to initiate on-campus course registration after that deadline. </P>

<P>Students failing to meet announced deadlines for financial obligations in any term will be placed on a &quot;financial hold&quot; status and normally will not be permitted to register or make schedule adjustments until the hold has been resolved. </P>

<P>Registration changes made during the drop/add period must be processed via the Colgate portal or must be submitted in person to the registrar's office for processing by the announced deadline of the drop/add period for a term. The drop/add period for a course that meets less than or outside of the regular academic term is through the eighth day of the session. Students failing to finalize their registrations with the registrar's office on time will be assessed a $50 penalty. No financial penalty will be assessed for a course withdrawal during the withdrawal period. Please see Withdrawal from a Course, below, for deadlines. </P>

<P>Students are not permitted to modify their course schedule after the end of the drop/add period, except with special permission granted by the Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Normal Course Loads </H2>

<P>A normal full-time course load is 4.00–4.50 course credits per semester. During early registration, students may register for no more than 4.50 course credits. Students not on academic warning who wish to take 5.00 course credits in any term may add additional courses to their schedules during the drop/add period. Because of the demanding academic load, students who wish to register for 5.00 course credits are urged to discuss this matter with their faculty advisers. Students may register for 5.50 course credits only with the written permission of their faculty adviser. Students may not take or receive credit for more than 5.50 course credits in any term except with the approval of their faculty adviser and the associate dean of the faculty, which must be secured by the end of the drop/add period. </P>

<P>First-year students are expected to take 4.00–4.50 course credits per term and may deviate from this plan only with permission from their academic adviser. Juniors, Seniors, or special students who plan to take fewer than 3.00 course credits in any term should refer to the section on Per Course Billing. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Independent Study </H2>

<P>Although academic work consists primarily of courses taught in the classroom, laboratory, and field, there are a number of opportunities for independent study. Students may register for independent study during each term of the regular academic year. The essential features of the independent study program are as follows: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students may apply for independent study through a specific department/program, for which they receive course credit (0.50 or 1.00) and a grade. The credit weight must be decided at the time of application and may not be changed without administrative approval. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Not more than one half of a student's course load in any one term may be courses of independent study, except with the permission of the associate dean of the faculty. Permission must be secured before the beginning of the term. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Independent study courses must be approved by the faculty supervisor and the appropriate department chair or program director no later than the last day of the drop/add period in any term. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Independent study courses are not offered to students free of charge. Tuition is charged for independent studies according to the established rates whether taken as part of a full-time or part-time course load. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>A student who wishes to take an independent study course during a fall or spring semester when not in residence at Colgate must secure the approval of the faculty supervisor, the appropriate department chair, and the Associate Dean of the Faculty before the beginning of the term. Students must also make appropriate arrangements with the registrar's office for independent study courses well in advance of the beginning of the term. Work equivalent to the course credits earned must be completed during the semester in which the credit is received. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>Independent study courses are registered according to the level of the course, which usually corresponds to the student's class level. Sophomores who enroll for independent study courses will normally be registered at the 291 level, juniors at the 391 level, and seniors at the 491 level. First-year students normally do not enroll in independent study courses. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>In rare cases, students may take a conventional course independently. This should be done only for compelling reasons, and explicit permission must be received in advance from the faculty supervisor and the appropriate department chair. Students enrolling in such a course will be registered according to the normal course number, to which the suffix Z is appended to indicate that the course is taken independently. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>8. </Lbl>

<LBody>All work for independent study courses must be submitted by the last day of classes in the term to give the faculty supervisor sufficient time to evaluate the student's performance and submit the final course grade to the university registrar. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>For additional information regarding independent study policies and procedures, please refer to the registrar's office web page at colgate.edu/registrar. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Registration Restrictions </H2>

<P>A student may not register for a course that is a prerequisite for a course for which he or she has already received credit, unless permission is granted by the department chair/program director and the associate dean of the faculty. A student may not take crosslisted courses and receive credit for both courses. Students may not register for any courses that overlap in any of their scheduled times. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Repeating a Course </H2>

<P>With written permission from the instructor, a student may repeat a course in which a grade of C–, C, or C+ is earned. Any course in which a grade of D+, D, D–, F, or U was received may be repeated in subsequent terms without permission of instructor. A student may not repeat a course in which a grade of B– or higher was earned. Students should declare to the registrar's office prior to registration that the course is being repeated. </P>

<P>A prerequisite course may not be repeated after the successful completion of a subsequent higher level course. Discontinued courses may not be repeated by substituting a similar or comparable course currently in the curriculum. A repeated course must be taken in the same grading mode (i.e., conventional letter grade or S/U) as the original course. Additionally, the course must be taken in the same method (e.g., a conventional course cannot be repeated on an independent basis). Courses taken on a Colgate study group may not be repeated on campus, and courses taken on campus may not be repeated on a Colgate study group, without the permission of the department chair/program director and associate dean of the faculty. A Colgate course may not be repeated by means of transfer credit from another institution, although credit for a course, with no GPA adjustment, may be earned if a student earned a grade of F or U in the equivalent Colgate course. </P>

<P>Only the highest grade of a repeated course will be calculated into the term and cumulative GPAs. Should a student earn the same grade on a second or subsequent attempt, only the first grade earned will be reflected in the student's term and cumulative GPAs. Credit from the repeated course will not be counted toward overall graduation credits. Students who complete a Colgate course that is a repeat of (or equivalent to) a transfer course or Advanced Placement will not receive duplicate credit. All grades earned in courses, including transfer or Advanced Placement, remain on the student's transcript, but will be noted as repeated. When a course is repeated after a grade of F has been assigned as a result of University Student Conduct Board action, both the original grade of F and the subsequent grade will be calculated into the cumulative GPA. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Grading Policies </H2>

<P>The grades used to indicate the quality of the student's performance in a completed course are as follows: A means excellent, B means good, C means satisfactory, D means poor but passing, F means failing. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by dividing the number of quality points by the number of course credits attempted for grades. Colgate grades are assigned the following quality points to full (1.00) credit courses: </P>

Grade changes initiated by the course instructor(s) must follow the &quot;Changes of Grade&quot; policy laid out in the Colgate University Faculty Handbook. Under extraordinary circumstances, grade changes beyond one semester but before graduation may be approved by the associate dean of the faculty. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Option </H2>

<P>The Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grade option is designed to encourage students to explore new areas outside their majors in the spirit of a liberal education. The following conditions apply to this option: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students with junior and senior standing may elect to take one 1.00-credit course (plus any required fractional credit add-on components) or two .5-credit courses per semester, for a maximum of 4 semesters, which are evaluated &quot;satisfactory&quot; (S) or &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; (U) instead of by the conventional letter grades. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>It is expected that students will take a course and any required fractional add-on component with the same grade option (conventional grade or S/U). In these cases, the total credit value of S/U courses may exceed the usual 1.00 credit limit per semester. </LBody>
</LI>

<H2>Withdrawal from a Course </H2>

<P>Students are permitted to withdraw from a course without academic penalty until the mid-term date listed in the academic calendar. For fractional credit courses that meet for the first- or second-half of term students are permitted to withdraw without academic penalty prior to the appropriate date listed in the academic calendar. The required course withdrawal form is available in the registrar's office. Withdrawing from a course after the end of the drop/add period places a W on the transcript for the course. Students are cautioned to avoid a pattern of regularly accumulating W grades on their academic record. </P>

<P>First-year students normally may withdraw from courses only for reasons beyond their ability to predict or control and only after consultation with the course instructor and faculty adviser. Juniors or Seniors may withdraw from courses only after consultation with the course instructor and faculty adviser. </P>

<P>Withdrawals after the deadline are not permitted unless there are extraordinary circumstances (such as severe illness) that merit an exception. In those cases, a petition must be submitted to the administrative dean and approved by the Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS). </P>

<P>Students on academic warning may withdraw from a course only for well-documented reasons and only after consulting with their administrative dean. (See Academic Warning and Suspension below.) </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Incompletes </H2>

<P>The temporary status of &quot;incomplete&quot; in a course is given only when, for compelling reasons, a student is not able to complete the work in the course by the end of the term. It is used rarely and only as a consequence of extenuating circumstances beyond the ability of the student to predict or control. A student's request for an incomplete must be made before the end of the term and must be directed to the administrative dean, who will consult with the instructor in the course (or study group director) before making a decision. Faculty do not grant incompletes. If an incomplete is granted by the administrative dean, he or she then informs the university registrar, the student, and the faculty member electronically. It is the student's responsibility to make arrangements with the instructor to complete the work in the course by the established deadline. </P>

<P>An administrative dean will grant an incomplete for a specific period of time, but in most cases the incomplete work must be completed and submitted to the faculty member not later than 20 days from the last day of the term's final examination period. Extensions beyond the 20-day period will be granted by the administrative dean only as a result of highly unusual circumstances. The instructor will submit the appropriate grade to the Registrar within 10 days after the conclusion of the deadline for completion of work, whether or not the make-up work has been completed. If no grade is submitted, the registrar, after consultation with the instructor and administrative dean, will assign a grade of F. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Class Attendance </H2>

<P>Attendance at all classes is expected and is an important part of one's academic development. Since most faculty at Colgate put a premium on student participation in class, absence is likely to be detrimental to the student's learning in any course. </P>

<P>Attendance practices for each course will be announced by the faculty member at the beginning of each term. Conflicts between curricular and co-curricular activities should be avoided by careful planning and scheduling of activities. The rare but unavoidable conflict should be worked out well in advance by the student with the faculty member's permission. </P>

<P>Students may request that an administrative dean notify faculty members about prolonged absences due to serious health problems. Such problems must be verified by Student Health Services. Students should consult an administrative dean immediately if non-health-related obligations will force them to miss several classes. Single or brief absences should be discussed by the student and faculty member without necessarily contacting the student's administrative dean. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Class Standing </H2>

<P>Progress toward degree typically requires the successful completion of a minimum of 4.00 course credits per semester. Class standing is determined by the number of credits earned. A student's initial class year and expected graduation date may be changed if progression toward degree is interrupted by leaves of absence, course failures, course withdrawals or reduced course loads. </P>

<P>In order to achieve junior class standing, a student must successfully complete 4 semesters and a minimum of 14 course credits. To qualify for senior standing, a student must successfully complete 6 semesters and a minimum of 22 course credits. </P>

<P>Students who receive financial aid should refer to Financial Aid for eligibility for federal programs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Minimum Academic Progress </H2>

<P>Students must earn a minimum GPA of 2.00 each term as well as cumulatively in order to be considered in good academic standing. Students who fail to meet minimum GPA requirements are subject to academic warning or dismissal (see below) and may lose eligibility for federal and/or state aid. See Financial Aid. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Academic Warning and Suspension </H2>

<P>The Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS), chaired by a designated member of the dean of the college staff, reviews the academic performance of all students at the end of each term.

<Sect>
<H2>Colgate Study Groups and Extended Study </H2>

<P>All academic regulations, registration changes, and drop/add deadlines for a term are applicable to students enrolled in a study group. </P>

<P>A normal course load on a Colgate study group is four courses, unless a fifth course is a required part of the program. Any deviation from this norm requires pre–approval first from the director of the study group and the director of the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs, and subsequently from the associate dean of the faculty. </P>

<P>Use of the satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grading option for study group courses is highly discouraged. Requests for the S/U grading option for study group courses must be approved by the director of the study group, the director of the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs, and the associate dean of the faculty. </P>

<P>Any seniors electing to participate in a spring extended study will graduate at the next degree conferral date, but will be eligible to apply for participation in the May commencement ceremony. Please refer to the student handbook for details on commencement participation. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Approved Programs </H2>

<P>Students are bound by the academic regulations and registration requirements of their approved program sponsor and host institution in addition to those of Colgate University. Students are expected to enroll in preapproved courses equivalent to 4 Colgate credits. Any deviation from this norm requires pre-approval from the approved program sponsor, director of off-campus study, and subsequently from the associate dean of the faculty. Students who plan to participate in an approved program must submit a Transfer Credit Application Form, available in the Registrar's Office or online, prior to departure. </P>

<P>Students may participate in one semester-long approved program. Students with a compelling academic reason who wish to study on a single approved program for two consecutive terms must successfully petition the Off-Campus Study Committee. Petitions for two different approved programs will not be allowed. Students who successfully petition to participate in an approved program for two consecutive terms may transfer eight (8.00) credits toward the Colgate degree. This is the maximum transfer credit: students who earn eight credits may not receive other transfer credit, such as Advanced Placement or summer credit. This policy does not alter existing policies set by departments and programs for transferring major or minor credit. </P>

<P>Credit from approved programs counts toward the six-course limit for transfer credit. Credit and grades for approved programs appear on the Colgate transcript but are not counted toward the GPA. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) or other ungraded options are not permitted. </P>

<P>A student is considered in residence while on an approved program, with the proviso that only one such semester may count toward the seven-semester residency requirement for graduation. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Leaves of Absence </H2>

<P>Many Colgate students complete the bachelor's degree by attending Colgate, including participation on a study group or approved program, for eight consecutive semesters, but there are often compelling reasons for students to break this normal attendance pattern. These reasons fall into three categories: academic reasons, personal reasons, and medical reasons. </P>

<P>Academic leaves can be requested when a student wishes to directly enroll for a semester at another U.S. college or university. Unlike participation in an approved program, a semester of academic leave does not count towards the seven-semester residency requirement, nor is Colgate financial aid available. Approval of an academic leave is not automatic. Students must present an academic rationale, including support from their academic adviser and administrative dean, when applying for a leave. </P>

<P>Students approved for an academic leave will be charged an administrative fee of $500 to defray costs incurred by Colgate for maintaining records and providing advising and other services to students while studying away from the university. (See Leave of Absence Fees and Deposits for details on payment of fees.) Students who intend to apply non-Colgate credit toward the Colgate degree must follow the procedures outlined under &quot;Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures,&quot; below. </P>

<P>Students may take courses at another institution during a summer or intersession term without requesting an academic leave of absence. </P>

<P>Personal leaves can be requested for one or more semesters. Students may request such leaves when they desire or need to be away from campus for a variety of reasons. There are two options available depending on when the student requests the leave. For more detailed information regarding the two personal leaves of absence options consult the Colgate Student Handbook. </P>

<P>Medical leaves are arranged in consultation with a student's administrative dean, who authorizes a student, if necessary, to withdraw from courses without academic penalty and monitors the procedures by which students are certified to resume academic work. The administrative dean works with the student and his or her family or guardians to make arrangements to accommodate the individual situation. A student who does not return from an academic, personal or medical leave within four semesters will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for re-admission through the Office of Admission. </P>

<P>For more detailed information regarding medical and personal leaves of absence, consult the Colgate Student Handbook. </P>

<P>If unapproved leaves are taken, students are withdrawn from Colgate and must apply for re-admission through the Office of Admission. In addition, students taking an unauthorized leave of absence must be aware that their eligibility for student aid is jeopardized, and that academic work taken elsewhere is not considered for transfer credit. Any student who is uncertain about attending a future term at Colgate is urged to discuss the matter with the administrative dean prior to the deadline for requesting a leave. (See Residency Requirement and Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures in this section.) </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures </H2>

<P>Matriculated students may receive transfer credit for a maximum of six Colgate course credits. (Maximum credits for transfer students are outlined in &quot;Transfer Student Program,&quot; in this section.) This limit includes all courses taken on an approved program, at other institutions during the summer or intersession, during a leave of absence from Colgate, Advanced Placement,  International Baccalaureate or other international exam credits, and college credits earned prior to entering Colgate as a first-year student. (See &quot;Advanced Placement and Pre-matriculation Transfer Credit&quot; in the following section.) </P>

<P>Students who plan to take courses at another institution and receive transfer credit from Colgate must submit a Transfer Credit Application, which is available on the registrar's office web page or in the registrar's office. All courses taken off campus must be approved in advance by the Office of the Registrar to be eligible to transfer, and in some cases by the appropriate department or program. Please refer to the registrar's office web page (colgate.edu/registrar) for detailed information regarding the types of courses that may be considered for transfer and the process for transferring credits toward the Colgate degree. </P>

<P>Colgate University operates on a course credit system for graduation, not a semester-hour or quarter-hour system. Faculty, students, and administrators should be aware that semester- and quarter-hour values are assigned to courses at the majority of institutions in this country and abroad, and the interpretation and evaluation of transfer credit is, therefore, complex. It must not be assumed that transfer credit is automatic or that courses taken at other institutions can be transferred to a Colgate transcript on a one-for-one basis. The semester hour/quarter hour transfer conversion chart is available on the Transfer Credit Application in the Office of the Registrar or on the registrar's web page (colgate.edu/registrar). The registrar's office will assist students in selecting appropriate courses, determine the amount of Colgate credit to be granted, and refer students to department chairs and program directors for specific course approvals as appropriate. </P>

<P>An official transcript, as well as any supporting documentation (such as department approval), should be submitted to the registrar's office within one academic year following the term in which the coursework was completed. After a transfer course has been recorded on a student's Colgate transcript, it may not be removed. If a student repeats the course at Colgate, the credit weight will be removed from the transfer course, but the transfer course will remain on the transcript. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Advanced Placement and Pre-matriculation Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>Upon receipt of an official college transcript, students may be eligible to earn credit for courses taken at a regionally accredited college/university while a student is in secondary school. The courses may be considered for Colgate credit if satisfactorily completed (letter grade of C or better) and bear a minimum of three semester or five quarter hours. Courses taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory, pass/fail, or other ungraded basis are not acceptable. Courses taught in the high school are not accepted. The course must be taken at the college/university (e.g., with degree seeking candidates and taught by a regular member of faculty). Students may be requested to submit course syllabi or laboratory materials for evaluation purposes. College courses completed prior to matriculation may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement. For required forms and additional information, refer to the registrar's office web page (colgate.edu/registrar). Colgate credit is normally granted to first-year students who achieve a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) tests or a 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations (higher level only), and when a department certifies that the exam score indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific Colgate course. Individual students may petition for credit from A-Levels or other international examinations. The amount of credit, the conditions under which credit is granted, and/or placement appropriate to the academic development of the student are all determined by the appropriate Colgate academic department. Detailed descriptions of the petition process and credit policies applicable to an entering class may be found on the registrar's office web page. Credit from standardized examinations may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement. </P>

<P>All requests for credit for academic work completed prior to entering Colgate must be filed with the registrar's office prior to registration during the fourth semester. Supporting documentation, such as the official transcript(s), official test scores, and/or course syllabi, must be submitted with the pre-matriculation credit application. Students who fail to meet this deadline must submit a written request accompanied by a written statement of support from the academic adviser to the university registrar. </P>

<P>Advanced course placement without academic credit may by granted by departments to first-year students whose performance on the College Level Examination Program (CLEP subject examinations only), CEEB Achievement Tests, or the New York State Education Department's College Proficiency Examinations gives clear evidence of competence in the courses tested. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Student Program </H2>

<P>The maximum number of non-Colgate course credits for which a transfer student receives credit depends upon the number of acceptable liberal arts courses, grades, and credits from all other college(s) attended, as well as the number of acceptable Advanced Placement (AP) course credits. </P>

<P>After enrolling at Colgate, transfer students may subsequently transfer additional coursework from other institutions, with prior approval, up to the maximum indicated: </P>

<P>Any questions relating to the issue of transfer credit should be referred to the registrar's office. </P>

<P>Students who transfer to Colgate from other institutions will be subject to the requirements of the educational programs that are appropriate to their level of entrance (first-year, sophomore, or junior). These requirements include the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, major, foreign language, writing (if stipulated on admission), and physical education requirements. The specific requirements as they apply to transfer students can be found in the transfer, visiting, and special student fact sheet, available from the Office of Admission. </P>

<P>In order to satisfy Colgate's residency requirement, transfer students are required to complete a minimum of four terms in academic residence at Colgate or on a Colgate study group. One term of an approved program may count toward the four semester requirement if the student does not exceed the maximum transfer credit limit indicated at the time of admission. </P>

<P>To count for major credit, a course taken elsewhere must be accepted by the appropriate Colgate department chair or program director. After enrolling at Colgate, transfer students are subject to the rules for transfer of credit under the section &quot;Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures,&quot; above. Transfer students must be enrolled at Colgate for at least six terms in order to be considered eligible for the university honor of valedictorian or salutatorian. </P>

<P>Requests for exceptions to these policies, for academic reasons only, must be supported in writing by the student's faculty adviser and administrative dean and submitted in writing to the Petitions Committee. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Petitions for Exemptions </H2>

<P>Exemptions from graduation requirements are granted only by the Petitions Committee. Exemptions are approved for compelling academic reasons, or when a true hardship exists for the student through no fault of his or her own and when no other solution can be found. A petition for exemption should be developed with written support from the student's faculty adviser and administrative dean. </P>

<P>The Petitions Committee exists to hear petitions concerning all graduation requirements, including residency, the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, and the transfer credit limit. The committee does not review routine administrative requests from students, nor does it hear appeals concerning routine administrative decisions. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Changes to Academic Records </H2>

<P>Academic records are sealed upon graduation, withdrawal, or permanent dismissal from Colgate University. No changes or additions to a student's undergraduate transcript will be permitted after this date. This includes, but is not limited to, grade changes, majors and minors, crosslisted courses, additional transfer credits, or additional courses taken at Colgate following graduation. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Degree Conferral </H2>

<P>Colgate University confers degrees three times each year: at the May Commencement ceremony, on August 31 and on December 31. Degrees are conferred only upon students who have been certified by the university registrar to have met all requirements as described in this catalogue and have met all financial obligations to the university. Students should refer to the &quot;Policy for Participating in the Commencement Ceremony&quot; in the Colgate Student Handbook. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Applying to Colgate </H2>

<Sect>
<H2>The Applicant </H2>

<P>Colgate students are selected from applicants throughout the United States and around the world for the talent and intellect they can contribute to this university community. Academic achievement, reflecting a student's passion for, and engagement with, the learning process is important to the admission decision. Well-developed special interests, talents, and skills of all kinds can be a significant part of an admission application. In addition, Colgate is committed to attracting people who represent a wide range of intellectual perspectives as well as diverse economic, racial, religious, and geographic backgrounds. In the interest of bringing the best possible applicants to the university, Colgate sets no limits on the number of students admitted from a given secondary school. Colgate does not accept transfer, visiting, or special student applications for the undergraduate degree program from individuals who already possess a bachelor's degree. </P>

<P>All admission credentials, from the traditional secondary school record and standardized testing to letters of reference that cite intellectual and creative promise, are important. Personal character and qualities that both reflect and determine the productive use of a student's talent are also important to the admission decision. Teachers, counselors, and all applicants should know that assistance in identifying such subjective characteristics is welcome. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>The Academic Record </H2>

<P>While other considerations are important, the academic record stands at the heart of any admission decision. An academic record is evaluated strictly in terms of course selection and achievement — that is, what a student did with what was available in the school attended. </P>

<P>Academic preparation is usually measured in Carnegie units, with one unit representing a full year's work in a major academic subject. Applicants with fewer than sixteen units are seldom admitted. The number and difficulty of courses chosen each year is an important measure of academic motivation and achievement. While each student's record is evaluated individually, the strongest applicants will have completed five major academic courses per year whenever possible. The senior year program is most important as it is the final preparation for college-level work. It should include at least four to five courses, including honors or advanced-level courses such as AP and IB courses. Colgate encourages students to pursue cumulative subjects, such as foreign languages and mathematics, through senior year. </P>

<P>The typical distribution of courses across disciplines for most accepted students is four years of English (especially composition and literature); four years of mathematics; four years of natural and physical sciences, with a lab; four years of social sciences (particularly advanced courses in history); and at least three years of a foreign language. Colgate encourages elective coursework in the arts and strongly advises students to pursue honors and advanced-level courses in major areas of interest. </P>

<P>All applicants should follow these recommendations to the best of their ability. Scheduling problems or other circumstances that limit course selection should be conveyed in a statement attached to the application. Colgate evaluates applications based on the material available, but further information may be requested. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Recommendations </H2>

<P>Faculty and counselor recommendations are vital to the admission evaluation. Faculty recommendations must be written by teachers from core academic subjects in an applicant's 10th, 11th, or 12th grade year. Additional recommendations may also be useful if they are written by those who know an applicant well and have been in a position to evaluate the student's performance. Good judgment should be used in asking for additional recommendations; too many testimonials can make an application more difficult to interpret and process. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Standardized Testing </H2>

<P>All admission candidates must submit the results of standardized testing according to one of two options: </P>

<P>1. The SAT Reasoning Test (mathematics and critical reading sections from the old SAT and evidence-based reading and writing, and math sections from the new SAT; optional essay not evaluated) </P>

<P>2. The ACT Assessment (writing test not required) Colgate will accept self-reports SAT or ACT scores for the purposes of application assessment. These scores must be verified by an official report prior to enrollment. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Writing Requirement </H2>

<P>The university offers a selection of courses designed to aid students who need more work in English composition. Although the courses are generally available to Colgate students as electives, some matriculating students, identified at the time of admission, may be required to enroll in one or more of these courses. (See &quot;Writing and Rhetoric&quot; in Course Descriptions.) </P>

<H1>Financial Aid </H1>

<P>A domestic candidate requesting institutional need-based financial aid should complete the CSS PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). International students and those who do not qualify for federal financial aid must submit only the CSS PROFILE.These forms are due by November 15 for Early Decision I candidates and by January 15 for Early Decision II and regular decision candidates. Transfer applicants should submit the CSS PROFILE and the FAFSA by the admission deadline of the term for which they are applying.

<P>A candidate can complete and submit an application electronically. Applicants must submit the following required documents: the first-year application, a one-page Colgate writing supplement, the Mid-Year School report, and an Early Decision Agreement form for students applying under the Early Decision program. The first-year application includes a School Report and Teacher Evaluation forms for the guidance counselor and two high school teachers to complete and submit. Applications for first-year admission must be submitted by January 15. Applications submitted online require an electronic signature. More information about the application process can be found at colgate.edu/apply. </P>

<H2>Application Fee </H2>

<P>Colgate requires a non-refundable fee of $60 from all candidates for admission. This fee may be waived upon certification of extreme financial hardship by the guidance counselor or by a school-certified College Board Fee Waiver, or for students who qualify for a fee waiver through the Common Application or Coalition Application. The application fee is also waived for students whose permanent mailing address is outside the United States. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Admission Notification </H2>

<P>Admission is granted only through notification by the Office of Admission. Regular Admission decisions are announced in late March or early April. Financial aid candidates normally receive notice of any aid award with their acceptance letters. All accepted candidates wishing to enroll, other than Early Decision candidates (see below), must pay a non-refundable tuition deposit of $500 by May 1. Envelopes postmarked after May 1 may not be accepted. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Postponed Enrollment </H2>

<P>While most students apply for admission with the intention of entering college the following fall, some accepted applicants may wish to postpone entrance to Colgate for a period of time. </P>

<P>Accepted applicants who do not matriculate at another institution may ask to postpone their enrollment for up to two semesters or one year after the date of initial expected enrollment. Such a request should be made in writing to the Office of Admission by June 1 of the year in which application has been made, and must be accompanied by a non-refundable $1,000 enrollment deposit. This deposit will hold the student's place in the class he or she wishes to enter.

<H2>Visiting Colgate </H2>

<P>Colgate encourages each prospective applicant to arrange a visit to campus, if possible. While interviews at Colgate are non-evaluative, they give applicants insights about Colgate and the admission selection process. </P>

<P>A prospective applicant who is not able to arrange a campus visit may schedule an informational interview with a Colgate graduate near their school or home. Admission staff members recognize that it may not always be possible to visit the campus before applying; still, it is important for the student to see the campus and meet the people who live, study, and work at Colgate before making a final college choice. </P>

<P>The admission staff is happy to assist applicants with arrangements for visits to campus. To ensure that records of campus visitors are as accurate as possible, prospective applicants are encouraged to check in at the Hurwitz Admission Center in the James B. Colgate Administration Building upon arrival. If the office is closed, campus maps (digital version at colgate.edu/campusmap) and forms to request admission materials may be found in the visitor box outside the administration building. Prospective students may choose to explore Colgate in a number of different ways. </P>

<H2>Early Decision </H2>

<P>An Early Decision application indicates that Colgate is a student's first choice and that the student will withdraw all other applications and attend Colgate if admitted. Not to be confused with early action, Early Decision at Colgate is binding; a signed Early Decision Agreement is required to complete an Early Decision application. The form must be signed by the student, a guidance counselor, and a parent or legal guardian. Students may not apply to more than one college as an Early Decision applicant. As Early Decision programs may vary slightly from college to college, please note the following options and requirements specific to Colgate's Early Decision program. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Colgate offers two options for Early Decision: </H2>

<P>Early Decision Option I Candidates who apply by November 15, including completion of the Early Decision Agreement form, will receive decisions in mid-December. All required application documents should be postmarked no later than November 15. </P>

<P>Candidates who initiate and complete Early Decision applications between November 15 and December 15 may be eligible for consideration in the Early Decision Option I review process at the discretion of the dean of admission. Early Decision applications completed too late for Option I consideration will be evaluated according to Option II. </P>

<P>Early Decision Option II Candidates who file applications between December 15 and January 15 may declare their Early Decision first choice interest in Colgate and receive notification on a rolling basis. Notification of admission will occur within two to four weeks after receipt of the application and all supporting documents, including a completed Early Decision Agreement form. </P>

<P>Students who file regular decision applications by January 15 may change their status to Early Decision by filing an Early Decision Agreement form any time before March 1. Notification will occur within two to four weeks of completion of the application. </P>

Option II candidates should complete testing by early December. An application is not complete, and no decision can be made, until all required test results are received. Results of early November testing normally will be available from the testing services in time for Option I review if the scores are sent directly to Colgate, or a student may self report their testing upon receiving the results. Upon written request from the student, a decision may be postponed until the latest test results are received by Colgate. </P>

<P>An Early Decision candidate applying for financial aid should file the CSS PROFILE and FAFSA by the Early Decision deadline. </P>

<H2>Alumni Memorial Scholars </H2>

<P>The Alumni Memorial Scholars (AMS) program promotes academic and personal achievement through service, leadership, and wide-ranging intellectual inquiry. The program was established in 1945 in tribute to Colgate students and alumni who gave their lives during the First and Second World Wars. Today, it attracts students from across the country and around the world, young men and women whose academic credentials, character, creative talent, and community involvement indicate the potential for high-level engagement both inside and outside the classroom. All Colgate applicants are automatically considered for admission to AMS, so there is no program-specific application. Eligible students will be notified of their acceptance into the AMS program alongside an offer of admission to the university. </P>

<P>Each AMS student in good standing will have access to grant funds totaling $6,000. These funds are intended to support independent research projects, internships, academic conference attendance, and other eligible academic programs. In recent years, they have enabled AMS students to visit dozens of countries across six continents. Grant funds may be used all at once or through several smaller requests, as long as the cumulative total does not exceed the maximum. Faculty and staff reviewers must approve all requests. </P>

<P>AMS students benefit from extraordinary access to Colgate's faculty, staff, and campus resources. Curricular requirements include a special AMS orientation prior to first-year orientation and a quarter-credit course on research design during the spring term of the first year. First-years will ordinarily be housed as a cohort, and students in all class years are encouraged to attend group excursions, dinners, lectures, and presentations. </P>

<P>Questions about AMS admissions should be sent directly to the admission office. For more information about the AMS program, please visit colgate.edu/ams. </P>

<H2>Benton Scholars </H2>

<P>The Benton Scholars Program was developed as a model for how a liberal arts education can be shaped to fully prepare students to think, act, and create in a world that is increasingly diverse and global. Colgate has a long and proud history of graduating students who lead in all aspects of their lives. This program is part of a university-wide focus on ensuring that this great tradition endures. </P>

<P>The program has been thoughtfully designed to infuse leadership and global themes into the Colgate experience by providing scholars with activities and selected courses that will enrich and bring new perspectives to their experiences on campus and throughout their lives. Like all Colgate students, Benton Scholars have control of their course of study, as well as choice of major and activities. The program builds upon the Colgate experience rather than creating a separate track within it. </P>

<P>Those invited to participate in the Benton Scholars Program are students who have demonstrated not only the ability to think and lead, but also the passion to make a positive impact on the world. This program will sharpen skills, ignite new passions, and provide a platform to think globally about what it means to be a leader in the 21st century. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) </H2>

<P>The Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) Scholars Program is the second oldest scholars program at Colgate, established in 1967 as the &quot;University Scholars Program.&quot; Candidates chosen to be part of the program are a highly select group of students who have demonstrated creativity and determination in the face of personal, economic, and social challenges; they have systematically sought the most demanding academic paths open to them and dedicated themselves to achieving success. The OUS Scholars Program is a vibrant community of scholars who have a history of making significant and meaningful impacts on campus. </P>

<P>The OUS curricular program begins with the Summer Institute, a rigorous five-week, pre-first-year summer session designed to begin the transition to college. With courses taught by a select group of Colgate's excellent faculty, the Summer Institute fosters close and lasting student-faculty relationships and enhances the academic preparedness of OUS scholars. Each OUS cohort lives and learns together in a supportive family-like environment throughout their first year. This tight-knit community is further developed over four years at Colgate through a series of planned events and experiences, setting the stage for students to take on a wide array of scholarly pursuits, leadership roles, and community engagements. </P>

<P>Eligibility for admission to Colgate through OUS is determined at the time of admission, and no separate application is necessary. Questions about OUS admissions should be sent directly to the admission office. For more information about the OUS program, visit colgate.edu/ous. See Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) for additional information. </P>

<H2>International Student Admission </H2>

<P>International students whose first language is not English should sit for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The most competitive candidates for admission generally receive a TOEFL score of 100 or above on the Internet-based test, or an IELTS equivalent of a seven or greater. Students studying at an English-medium secondary school can request a TOEFL waiver. </P>

<P>All admission documents should be written in English or accompanied by certified translations from a local consulate, embassy, or school official. </P>

<P>While Colgate welcomes international applicants, there is limited financial assistance for students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Canadian nationals are eligible for certain loan and work-study programs. </P>

<H2>Admission by Transfer Application Procedures </H2>

<P>Colgate considers well-qualified candidates from other colleges who seek to enter with advanced standing for transfer admission. Admission may be granted in the fall or spring. The application deadline for fall admission is March 15; for spring, November 1. (Candidates are notified of the admission decision by early May and early December, respectively.) A non-refundable application fee of $60 must accompany each application. This fee may be waived upon certification of extreme financial hardship or if the student has received a waiver from the Common or Coalition Application. The application fee is also waived for students whose permanent mailing address is outside the United States. Colgate does not accept transfer, visiting, or special exemption student applications for the undergraduate program from individuals who already possess a bachelor's degree. </P>

<P>Competition for admission with advanced standing is rigorous. Most successful transfer applicants will have achieved at or above the 3.00 (B) grade level during their previous college experience. Participants in the Visiting Student Program (see below) are eligible to apply for transfer to Colgate but should not expect to receive preferential treatment. </P>

<P>Application requirements: In addition to an application for transfer admission, Colgate reviews a full report of the candidate's secondary school record and the results of either the SAT or the ACT must be submitted. Official transcripts of all completed college studies should be forwarded immediately. The College Official's Report should be completed and submitted by the dean of each college attended, and the Faculty Recommendation should be completed by a faculty member who has taught the student and who can comment on the student's academic potential. Additional information about applications can be found at colgate.edu/apply. </P>

<P>Previous applicants: Students who previously applied for first-year or transfer admission are welcome to apply for transfer admission. The Office of Admission retains application materials from the past two academic years and will refer to previous application data during the transfer review process. Students who previously applied for first-year admission must submit all transfer application materials; it is not necessary to forward standardized test scores if they were submitted with the first-year application. </P>

<P>Transfer credit is generally allowed for courses taken through a strong liberal arts curriculum in which a grade of C or better has been earned. Credit toward graduation may be granted for no more than the equivalent of 16 Colgate course credits. After enrolling at Colgate, transfer students are subject to the rules for transferring of credit which apply to matriculated Colgate students. See Transfer Student Program. </P>

<P>Financial aid: Colgate is able to offer need-based institutional financial aid to transfer students. Institutional aid for transfer students is limited to the number of semesters needed to complete the degree requirements, as determined by the registrar, at the time of admission. </P>

<P>Transfer students entering in the fall and anticipating a need for help with financing their education must submit the CSS PROFILE and the FAFSA by March 15 for the fall term and November 1 for the spring term. Additional information may be obtained in Financial Aid and at colgate.edu/financialaid. </P>

<H2>First-Year versus Transfer Admission for Students with Advanced Standing </H2>

<P>Colgate University defines a transfer applicant as someone who has enrolled in a degree-seeking program at a college or university. A student who possesses an associate's degree must normally apply to Colgate as a transfer student. </P>

<P>Students who have supplemented their high school curriculum with college-level classes in a non-degreeseeking program and students who have enrolled in a high school enrichment program associated with a college may have the option of applying to Colgate as either a first-year student or a transfer student. The benefits and limitations for these options are outlined below: </P>

<H2>Visiting Student Program </H2>

<P>A student who wishes to attend Colgate for a term as a visiting student should complete an application form. Members of the Visiting Student Program are eligible to apply at a later date for transfer, but it must be understood that no preference is given over other transfer applications, and visiting students must meet the same standards as candidates not in attendance. Visiting students are not eligible to receive Colgate financial aid. </P>

<P>For students wishing to enroll, a non-refundable tuition deposit of $500 is required within two weeks of receipt of the official acceptance letter. </P>

<P>Students applying for admission as visiting students should visit the admission web pages: colgate.edu/admission-financial-aid. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Special Exemption Students </H2>

<P>The special exemption student option is almost invariably limited to a few area residents who, for personal reasons, wish to enroll for one term and for less than a full course load. Special exemption student status is an exception; the Colgate campus does not readily lend itself to part-time, non-residential students. Special exemption students must plan to commute, as there is no provision in the residential facilities for those taking less than a full academic program. Students must complete the application and pay a non-refundable application fee of $60. Special exemption students receive no extraordinary consideration or priority at registration. </P>

<P>For students wishing to enroll, a non-refundable tuition deposit of $500 is required within two weeks of receipt of the official acceptance letter. </P>

<H2>Readmission </H2>

Please be aware that to earn a Colgate degree, readmitted students will be subject to certain academic requirements in place at the time of readmission.

<P>Students granted per course billing will be billed at a rate of one-eighth of the annual tuition per course. Such students will also be charged on a pro rata basis for optional add-on fractional credit components as well as stand-alone fractional credit components. No tuition will be charged for required add-on fractional credit components, such as labs. (See Academic Credit) </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Insurance </H2>

<P>Health and Accident Insurance Colgate requires that students have health and accident insurance coverage. Students who enroll at Colgate will be asked each year in June to record their health insurance status. All enrolled students are billed the annual premium for the Colgate Student Group Health Insurance on the fall semester invoice. If a student has private coverage and wishes to decline the university coverage, proof of alternate coverage must be provided. The premium is cancelled only upon timely submission of proof of alternate coverage. If proof of alternative coverage is not submitted on a timely basis the Colgate Student Group Health insurance cannot be cancelled. Students who do not have private coverage must enroll in the university insurance. Students enrolling in the student health plan must activate their coverage each year by recording their enrollment on the insurance web site. Enrollment is also activated by default after the waiver deadline for students that have not filed a waiver or actively enrolled. </P>

<P>Tuition and Fee Insurance A commercial insurance plan is available to safeguard tuition, student activity fee, and on-campus traditional residence hall room charges at 80 percent. Information regarding this plan is provided by the Office of Student Accounts. </P>

<P>Off-Campus Study - International Medical Insurance Coverage Students participating on a Colgate, faculty-led Study Group or an Extended Study Group will be enrolled in an international travel health policy for their time outside the United States. This coverage is expressly for routine and emergency healthcare outside the United States and includes other emergency-related benefits as well. The cost of this insurance is billed to students and that cost can be reviewed on the Colgate cost estimate sheets available on the Off-Campus Study web site (colgate.edu/OCS). Students will be instructed on the use of the insurance abroad prior to departure. </P>

<P>Students studying internationally on a non-Colgate, approved program should receive insurance coverage through that approved program. In the event that the approved program does not offer insurance, or it does not meet Colgate University standards, students may be enrolled in the Colgate international health insurance and billed for that amount. </P>

<P>Colgate recommends that you continue your U.S.-based health insurance coverage (such as the Colgate Student Health Insurance Plan) while abroad so that when you return from your trip, whether as scheduled or early, you can access U.S.-based treatment without issue or interruption. If you waive your Colgate Student Health Insurance Plan, which we do not recommend, it is your responsibility to petition for re-enrollment in the plan by posted deadlines to ensure you do not have a gap in coverage. </P>

<H2>Students Studying Off Campus </H2>

<P>The university adopted a home school tuition policy effective for the Class of 2016 and beyond. Beginning with the 2014–2015 academic year students who study on a Colgate-directed study group or on an approved program will pay Colgate tuition when studying off campus.

<H2>Payment of Bills </H2>

<P>Semester bills are issued to the student on July 1 and December 1 and presented electronically. This bill for tuition, fees, fines, and applicable charges for room and meals (including fraternity/sorority charges) must be paid by the payment date each semester. A student will not be permitted to continue in classes until the semester bill has been satisfied. For more information about billing/payment, please contact the Office of Student Accounts 315-228-7812, or see colgate.edu/studentaccounts. </P>

<P>The university offers two options for payment of tuition, fees, room, and meals: regular semester payments or monthly installments. Payments may be made by cash, check, or bank wire transfer. Payments can also be made online by e-check (no fee to payer). For information on loan programs, please contact the Office of Financial Aid, 315-228-7431, or see colgate.edu/financialaid. </P>

<P>Semester Payments Payment for tuition and fees is due in advance of the beginning of each semester (see Billing Schedule above). Balances not paid by the deadline may be assessed a late fee of a minimum of $100 or a maximum of 1 percent of the outstanding balance per month. </P>

<P>Monthly Payment Plan Through this option, an internal payment plan is administered by Colgate through the billing site hosted by Touchnet. When bills are posted each semester, a payment plan can be established through the bill site to divide semester fees over five months for a small set-up fee. Additionally, an external payment plan is available through Tuition Management Systems (TMS). Two semesters of tuition and fees may be paid in 10 monthly installments (June through March) after the payment of a small processing fee. Monthly payments not received by the first of the month may be subject to late charges and account termination. For more information, please contact the Office of Student Accounts, 315-228-7812, or see colgate.edu/studentaccounts. </P>

<P>Multiyear Prepayment The Tuition Prepayment Plan protects students from probable future tuition increases by offering the opportunity to prepay tuition for two, three, or four years at the current rate of annual tuition set for the first year of participation in the plan. For more information, please contact the Office of Student Accounts, 315-228-7812, or see colgate.edu/studentaccounts. </P>

<P>Financial Aid Credits Colgate University must receive notification of expected grants and loans that students or parents wish to use as a payment resource. Anticipated earnings from campus employment may not be claimed as credit on the bill. Students or parents who anticipate difficulty in making payment should consult with the Office of Financial Aid well in advance of the scheduled date of payment.

<P>Nonpayment Penalties In any semester, students who fail to make satisfactory financial arrangements and enter courses without paying their semester bill will be required to leave the university and forfeit all deposits and any academic credit for that semester. </P>

<P>The university reserves the right to deny a student with an unpaid balance the opportunity to register for subsequent enrollment and to withhold the academic records from any student who has not satisfied, or made provisions to satisfy, accounts due to the university. Unpaid balances will, in due course, be turned over to an external collection agency. </P>

<P>Collections costs may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 33 percent of the debt. All costs and expenses, including attorney's fees Colgate University incurs in such collection efforts, are added to the debt, and Colgate must be reimbursed for these costs by the debtor. </P>

<H2>Withdrawal and Refund Policy </H2>

<Sect>
<H2>On Campus </H2>

<P>Students must notify and receive permission from an administrative dean to withdraw officially or to take a leave of absence from Colgate. The official date of withdrawal is determined by the student's administrative dean. A student who officially withdraws or is granted a leave of absence from Colgate before 60 percent of the enrollment period has expired will receive adjusted charges for tuition, fees, room, and meals based on the percentage of time enrolled. Federal aid is refunded according to the Federal Title IV refund formula. State grants are refunded based on individual state regulations. After 60 percent of the enrollment period has passed, no adjustments will be made. This policy applies only to tuition, fees, room, and meal charges set by Colgate University. External scholarships will be adjusted based on the host program's regulations. A sample of this refund policy is available by contacting the Office of Financial Aid, 315-228-7431 or finaid@colgate.edu. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Off-Campus Study </H2>

<P>Written notification of withdrawal must be dated and delivered to the director of off-campus study. E-mail notification from a Colgate e-mail address is acceptable. The postmark or date of e-mail will serve as the basis for any refund. </P>

<P>A student who withdraws from a Colgate study group, extended study or approved program after confirming their participation with the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs will be charged a $1000 withdrawal fee to defray the administrative costs incurred by the university. Refunds of Colgate tuition charged for off-campus study are governed by the university's refund policy. Students will also be charged for any non-recoverable expenses including, but not limited to, non-refundable deposits, approved program charges, housing, transportation, visas, and/or shared group expenses. The extent of non-recoverable expenses vary by program and the date of withdrawal. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Leave of Absence Fees and Deposits </H2>

<P>Normally students attend Colgate for four consecutive years, fall and spring semesters. If it is necessary to interrupt this pattern, a student may request an academic or personal leave of absence. </P>

<P>Students must request an academic leave of absence from their administrative dean. Students approved for academic leaves will be charged a $500 administrative fee. This fee defrays costs incurred by Colgate for maintaining records and providing advising and other services to students while studying away from the university. </P>

<P>Students approved for personal leaves will be required to pay a $300 nonrefundable leave deposit. Provided that a student either returns for the scheduled semester or arranges an extension of the leave through his or her administrative dean, the deposit will be applied to the student's account in the semester of return to Colgate. </P>

<P>For a student who plans to be away on academic or personal leave in the fall semester, the fee or deposit will be due the previous August 1. For a student who plans to be away in the spring semester, the deadline is the prior January 1. </P>

<P>Approved medical leaves do not require a deposit or an administrative fee. For additional information on academic leaves, see Leaves of Absence. For additional information regarding personal and medical leaves, see the Colgate Student Handbook. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Financial Aid </H2>

<P>Colgate provides financial aid to students who are accepted for admission and have demonstrated the need for financial assistance. Colgate is committed to meeting the demonstrated financial need of all admitted students, but the admission process is not need-blind. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Eligibility </H2>

<P>A need-based financial aid package, including Colgate grant assistance, is offered to accepted students who file all required forms and statements on time and demonstrate that they cannot provide the full cost of a Colgate education through their own and their families' resources. A limited number of Colgate grant awards are reserved each year for international students. Believing that students should share responsibility for the cost of their education, the university makes use of available forms of self-help such as work opportunities and loans, as well as grants, in arranging financial assistance. </P>

<P>The amount of aid varies with need, as demonstrated by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the Financial Aid PROFILE of the College Scholarship Service (CSS). If parents are divorced or separated, information must be provided by each parent or by the parent and spouse if the parent has remarried. The custodial parent (and spouse, if married) must complete the FAFSA and the CSS PROFILE; the noncustodial parent must complete the Noncustodial PROFILE. </P>

<H2>Federal Programs </H2>

<P>Standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress for continued Federal Student Aid Eligibility: In order to achieve minimum satisfactory academic progress, students must successfully complete 6 courses in the first year and 14 courses by the end of their second year. Throughout the student's remaining enrollment the student must complete a minimum number of credits as reflected in the &quot;Standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress&quot; chart above. These minimum standards in addition to grade point standards are used to monitor eligibility for federal aid. The financial aid office reviews the academic records of aided students at the end of each year. In addition, the Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS) reviews the academic performance of all students each term. If a student is not making progress according to the standards outlined in Chapter VII, the student is placed on warning or is dismissed. Student on academic warning may lose eligibility for federal student aid. Eligibility may be regained by submitting a waiver and, if approved, federal financial aid will be reinstated and the student will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester. Thereafter, students must achieve the minimum standards in the chart above to regain satisfactory academic progress to remain eligible for federal aid. Note: Federal student aid funds may be suspended for a drug conviction or drug related offense. </P>

<P>Eligibility Requirements for Federal Student Aid: To be eligible for Federal Student Aid, dependent students and their families or independent students, must complete a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) at FAFSA.ed.gov. The student must be a US citizen or an eligible non-citizen and must be an undergraduate/graduate enrolled at least half-time as a matriculated student at an eligible institution. The exception is for a Federal Pell Grant when students can be enrolled less than half time. In addition, students must not be in default or owe a refund for any Federal Title IV aid at any institution and be registered, if applicable, with the Selective Service. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) confirms eligibility and awards, if applicable, and the amount is based on federal regulations in effect for each federal program. </P>

<P>Federal Pell Grants </P>

<P>The Federal Pell Grant is an entitlement program. The award amount is determined by the Federal Expected Family Contribution (EFC), cost of attendance, and enrollment status i.e. full time, part time. An Institutional Student Information Report (ISIR) will be sent to each applicant based on the information provided in the application. Once the ISIR is received by the Office of Financial Aid (OFA), the award is calculated based on a payment schedule approved annually by Congress. </P>

<P>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) </P>

<P>Awards are made to students with the lowest EFC (Expected Family Contribution). </P>

<P>Federal Direct Loan (subsidized) </P>

<P>A student who receives this loan for the first time will be given application instructions at the time of the award. A student may borrow up to $3500 the first year, $4500 the second year, and $5500 per year for the last two years. Interest rates can be found at studentaid.ed.gov. Interest does not accrue until the borrower enters repayment. Repayment is deferred as long as the student remains enrolled at least half-time and for a six month grace period after he/she ceases to be enrolled at least a half-time. Payment of principal may also be deferred for certain categories of borrowers: (1) rehabilitation training; (2) unemployment; (3) economic hardship including the Peace Corps, and (4) during a period of active military service. After ceasing to be at least a half-time student, the borrower must make formal arrangements with the Department of Education's servicer to begin repayment. Depending on the amount of the loan, the minimum monthly payment will be $50 plus interest. Under unusual and extenuating circumstances the servicer, on request, may permit reduced payments. Repayment in whole or part may be made at any time without penalty. </P>

<P>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan </P>

<P>This loan is virtually identical to Federal Direct Loans except the borrower, not the federal government, is responsible for the interest that accrues during the in-school, grace and deferment periods. Loan limits are the same as for the Direct Loan minus any amounts received under the Direct Loan for the academic year. The interest rate is established annually on July 1 and is a fixed rate for the life of the loan. Interest accrues on Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans during the in-school, grace, and deferment periods and must be paid either monthly or quarterly by the borrower or else be capitalized. </P>

<P>Federal Direct PLUS Loan </P>

<P>To apply for this loan the borrower, who must be the parent of a dependent undergraduate student, begins the application at studentloans.gov. PLUS loans require a simple credit check. The maximum loan that can be borrowed is the cost of attendance, minus other aid. Interest rates can be found at studentaid.ed.gov. An origination fee is deducted upon disbursement by the Department of Education. Repayment begins 60 days after the full amount of the loan is disbursed. </P>

<P>Federal Work-Study Program </P>

<P>An institution must make employment reasonably available to eligible students at the institution who are in need of financial aid. </P>

<P>United States Bureau of Indian Affairs Aid to Native Americans </P>

<P>Higher Education Grants: The grant application is available from the education office of the tribe in which you are affiliated or possess membership. As the majority of federally recognized tribes are administering the grant program for their tribal members, call your tribe first. A tribal directory is located on the Department of the Interior's website. If your tribe is not administering the grant program, they can direct you to the nearest Office of Indian Education Programs Education Line Officer for the application (OMB No. 10760101), with instructions for completing and returning the application.

<H2>Student Affairs </H2>

<Sect>
<H2>Office of the Dean of the College </H2>

<P>The Vice President and Dean of the College is the chief student affairs officer of the college and is concerned with the overall personal and educational development of students as well as the integration of Colgate's academic and campus life programs. </P>

<P>The departments within the Office of the Dean of the College provide holistic opportunities for students to develop ways of learning and living that are characteristic of a residential liberal arts education and that are guided by intellectualism, citizenship, accountability, diversity and inclusion, personal growth and wellness, and a lifelong connection to Colgate.  </P>

<P>The Office of Residential Life supports students' formal academic endeavors by providing experiences and supporting residential communities and living and learning communities that support students throughout their college years by fostering a welcoming, enriching, and supportive community. Students' residential experiences begin with New Student Orientation and the residential commons program, a living and learning experience that establishes a strong foundation for scholarship and community. </P>

<P>Opportunities for student engagement and leadership are available through the ALANA Cultural Center, Office of the Chaplains, LGBTQ Initiatives, Office of Fraternity and Sorority Advising, the Center for Leadership and Student Involvement, and the Max Shacknai Center for Outreach, Volunteerism, and Education. These departments benefit from working closely together and with the guidance and leadership of the Dean of Students. </P>

<P>Each student has access to an administrative dean who assists with personal and/or academic matters and provides information about the many support resources available at Colgate. These services include support for first generation students and scholars' programs through the Office of Undergraduate Scholars Programs and the First Generation Initiative. The Office of International Student Services provides immigration and cultural adjustment support. The Office of Student Conduct is responsible for educating students about the expectations of living within a scholar community and that members of the community are held accountable and responsible for the choices they make. </P>

<P>Health, wellness and safety services are offered to students to help with a variety of psychological and physical health concerns and their overall health and well-being through Counseling and Psychological Services, Haven, Student Health Services, and the Shaw Wellness Institute. Student safety on campus is supported through 24/7 services through the Office of Campus Safety. More specialized campus safety and preparedness is the responsibility of the Emergency Management and Environmental Health and Safety programs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Administrative Deans </H2>

<P>Although Colgate is a relatively small institution, it is nevertheless quite complex because of the wide range of educational opportunities available to students. Because of this complexity, the university has established the administrative dean structure to help students in making decisions concerning their undergraduate careers. </P>

<P>Within this structure, every student at Colgate is assigned an administrative dean to whom he or she may turn for advice and assistance. Working collaboratively with academic advisers to address the needs of students holistically, administrative deans assist students with interpretation of the university's policies and procedures, as well as with questions pertaining to: graduation requirements, attendance patterns, personal or academic leaves of absence, withdrawal from the university, disciplinary matters, or emergencies or problems that may affect the quality of a student's academic work. Administrative deans are also available to assist students with personal issues and may, at the request of the student, contact others in the Colgate community or elsewhere who may be better positioned to assist depending on the situation. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Administration of Student Activities </H2>

<P>The Center for Leadership and Student Involvement (CLSI) supports Colgate's commitment to extending liberal arts learning beyond the classroom. Its mission is to foster student-centered programming that creates a healthy and vibrant campus culture where all can find their place. The professional staff encourages and assists students in their efforts to organize around issues of interest as individuals, scholars, and active citizens. Theses staff members also advise and support the experiential learning opportunities that comes from membership and participation in student organizations, where leadership, scholarship, and service are fostered. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to take on responsibility in student organizations, and their initiatives are supported through coaching and mentoring in leadership and management. Leadership development programs challenge and support Colgate students in the development of important competencies. The function of the office is not only to host events, but also to provide the resources and support that enable students to pursue their interests and accomplish their goals. </P>

<P>The CLSI partners with students to enrich the social, cultural, physical, and intellectual experience of life at Colgate. Emphasis is placed on understanding and appreciating and engaging the rich diversity of interests and experiences in the Colgate community. The staff is committed to promoting and supporting educational efforts related to physical and emotional health as well as to issues affecting the world beyond the university. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Student Government Association </H2>

<P>The Student Government Association (SGA) is the primary organization on campus that represents the will of the student body. Among other rights listed in Article II of the SGA constitution, every student on campus has the right to vote, run for a position, and join recognized organizations. The elected officials of SGA are charged with improving campus life by promoting student concerns. </P>

<P>The SGA executive group is composed of the president, vice president, elections commission, communications director, recording secretary, and senate-approved ad hoc positions. The president and vice president are the primary figures representing the SGA and its members to administrators, faculty, trustees, alumni, and outside parties. Additionally, the president chairs SGA executive meetings that provide the forum for collaboration between the branches of government and set the agenda for Senate meetings. </P>

<P>The SGA legislature is composed of the senate, parliamentarian, treasurer, and liaison to student organizations. The senate consists of a total of 40 senators. Each class year is represented by 10 elected senators. The senate is chaired by the speaker of the senate, who assigns senators into committees fulfilling the following roles: student affairs, academic affairs, government affairs, student organizations, class affairs, and external affairs. The treasurer chairs the Budget Allocations Committee (BAC), which distributes the revenue from the student activities fee. The BAC meets weekly to hear funding requests from student organizations. </P>

<P>The senate holds weekly meetings to consider matters concerning the entire university community. All meetings are open to the student body and all students are encouraged to attend. Students interested in working with the SGA to improve campus life should contact any SGA official or stop by the SGA office in the O'Connor Campus Center. </P>

<H2>Student Organizations </H2>

<P>Many types of organizations and activities are available to students at Colgate. Some are strictly co-curricular; others are related to specific aspects of the academic program. All organizations are open to any student, although some are honorary. If students have an interest that is not represented among the existing student organizations, they can create new organizations. The Center for Leadership and Student Involvement, the ALANA Cultural Center, Center for Outreach Volunteerism and Education, Shaw Wellness Institute and the Office of the Chaplains are the coordinating departments for the majority of student organizations. Fraternities and Sororities are listed later in the chapter. Athletic club sports are listed under &quot;Athletics and Recreation&quot; later in this chapter. </P>

<H2>Fraternity and Sorority Affairs </H2>

<P>There is a long history of the existence of Greek letter organizations at Colgate, dating back to 1856. Today, Colgate currently recognizes five national fraternities and three national sororities. Affiliation with Greek-letter organizations may occur after the sophomore year. These residential communities emphasize shared community values and responsibilities, provide leadership opportunities, and allow students to live with peers who embody the values of the organization. The chapter houses that house the eight recognized fraternity and sorority members are owned by the university and are held to the same high standards as all residence halls. Greek-letter organizations at Colgate are advised by professional staff and receive guidance and support from their national chapter as well as from their organizations alumni advisors. </P>

<P>Colgate students have the opportunity to join more than 150 recognized student organizations, including among the eight recognized fraternities and sororities. Greek-letter affiliation represents just one of the many ways students are involved at Colgate. Indeed, of the 30 percent of students who choose to affiliate with a Greek letter organization, nearly all of them are also involved in many other curricular and co-curricular activities, undergraduate research, or athletic commitments. Not every member of a Greek letter organization lives in the chapter house (only juniors and seniors are eligible), although each chapter house is comprised solely of members of that organization. </P>

<P>Colgate is committed to an environment that is free of discrimination and as such, there shall be no discrimination based on race, creed, religion, color, national origin, or sexual orientation in the selection of fraternity and sorority members. Members are selected solely on the basis of personal merit and the potential for positive contributions to the chapter's values and objectives. Chapters who demonstrate actions against this principle will forfeit recognition by the university and lose their chapter house. Greek letter organizations are responsible for following the policies of their international and national headquarters; Colgate works cooperatively with these national organizations to ensure consistent standards. </P>

<P>No Colgate student may rush, pledge, join, recruit for, perpetuate, or otherwise engage in activities as an actual or prospective member of an undergraduate fraternal or similarly selective membership organization not recognized by the University. Anyone who engages in such activities, as an actual or prospective member, will be subject to disciplinary activities that may include suspension or expulsion from the university. </P>

<H2>ROTC Program </H2>

<P>Students attending Colgate can participate in the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) through a program administered at Syracuse University. ROTC offers two- to four-year programs with the opportunity for merit-based scholarships. (See Financial Aid.) For more information, call the Syracuse University ROTC program at 315-443-2462, or view information online at armyrotc.syr.edu. </P>

<H2>Student Services </H2>

<Sect>
<H2>Student Health Services </H2>

<P>Student Health Services promotes a healthy lifestyle through education and preventative medical care and provides diagnostic services and treatment of illness and medical conditions. Services include general medical treatment, including treatment for minor injuries or surgery, contraceptive counseling, testicular exams, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy option counseling, immunizations and travel counseling. </P>

<P>Student Health Services is located adjacent to Colgate's athletic facilities. Staffed by a full-time physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and team of nurses, Student Health Services is open weekdays and Saturdays while Colgate is in session. The staff is also on call after hours and emergency cases may be processed through the emergency room of Community Memorial Hospital. </P>

<P>Student Health Services adheres to New York State health regulations and all services. Medical information is strictly confidential and may be released only with the written permission of the student.

<H2>Religious Life and Organizations </H2>

<P>The college years are often a time when people shape and refine their fundamental life commitments. The Office of the Chaplains serves the Colgate community by providing a dynamic, friendly, and supportive place in which students can seek answers to life's biggest questions. Students are encouraged to become the best versions of themselves, growing as people of integrity and commitment. To do this, strong, active faith communities are cultivated. It is the hope that, through participation in Colgate's religious communities, students are brought to a greater understanding of and fidelity toward their own traditions. </P>

<P>Interfaith partnership is a strongly held value at Colgate. The interfaith dynamic recognizes substantive differences while also promoting respect and friendship across religious lines. Since college provides a great opportunity to explore the ways in which others make sense of the world, our program promotes interfaith understanding and cooperation. </P>

<P>In embracing Colgate's motto, &quot;For God and Truth,&quot; the Office of the Chaplains works collaboratively with Colgate's faculty and staff to provide students with intellectually robust ways to integrate their religious and ethical commitments with their academic pursuits. </P>

<P>The Colgate Buddhist Community (CBC), founded in 2003, meets regularly for meditation. A student-run organization that is run collaboratively with faculty and staff, the group facilitates discussions on Buddhist thought and how to integrate the teachings into the lives of busy college students. </P>

<P>Colgate Christian Fellowship (CCF) is the student-led chapter of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF). It maintains close relationships with churches in the area as well as the chaplains at Colgate. The CCF sponsors weekly large group meetings, regular small group bible studies, speakers, social events, and service projects. </P>

<P>The Colgate Newman Community is the Catholic group at Colgate. The Newman Community has four primary concerns: (1) the worship of Jesus Christ (2) service and hospitality to the needy (3) education and spiritual formation and, (4) building community through social activities. The Newman Community is centered in the celebration of the Eucharist and seeks to create a faithful Catholic community on campus. </P>

<P>The Hindu Student Association (HSA) gives Hindu students an opportunity to observe their religion and also provides the community a chance to learn more about Hinduism. Besides regular prayer meetings, the HSA organizes an annual Diwali festival with prayers and festivities. The HSA also celebrates other holidays. </P>

<P>The Colgate Jewish Union/Hillel is a student-led organization that promotes Jewish religious, intellectual, and cultural life. The Saperstein Jewish Center houses kosher kitchens, a library of Judaica, and a lounge space. It is also home to a sanctuary where students lead services and prepare Shabbat dinner weekly. </P>

<P>The Muslim Student Association (MSA) provides an opportunity for Muslim students to worship, to socialize, and to educate themselves and others about Islam. The student-led group holds regular Friday Jummah prayers, Quranic study, Eid celebrations and iftar meals, halal dinners, film screenings, discussions, and excursions </P>

<P>University Church (UC) is Colgate's Protestant community. UC is committed to embodying the diversity of the Body of Christ by celebrating a range of worship styles and ministry emphases. Worship is at 6:30pm on Sundays, followed by a catered dinner. Music is rich and varied, preaching is biblically centered and the Lord's Supper is celebrated each week. University Church life is led by the Protestant Campus Minister and a student board of deacons. It includes Bible study lunches, speakers, social events, and service projects. </P>

<P>The Secular Association of Skeptical Students (SASS) is a student organization for those who share secular beliefs. Through philosophical discussion and scintillating guest speakers, students of non-religious views have an opportunity to add their voice to the interfaith discussion. SASS seeks to alleviate the stigma against non-theists by promoting education, cooperation, community service, and active involvement in the interfaith movement at Colgate. </P>

<P>Colgate Christian Athletes supports students of Colgate, athletes or not, in their Christian knowledge as they strive to live a Christian lifestyle at Colgate. The Colgate Christian Athletes meet weekly and meetings are led by the Protestant Campus Minister. </P>

<P>Heretics Club is a lunch discussion series that was created to elevate the conversation on campus about life's &quot;big questions.&quot; Through lectures and conversations with a diverse group of faculty, staff, and students, the series demonstrates that people of different religious convictions and worldviews can have meaningful and productive conversation about ultimate ideas.  </P>

<P>Area congregations Students are welcome in local congregations including Cornerstone Baptist Church, First Baptist Church, Park United Methodist Church, St. Thomas' Episcopal Church, St. Mary's Catholic Church, Hamilton Bible Fellowship, Randallsville New Life Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and a nearby Quaker meeting. </P>

<H2>Residential Life </H2>

<P>A residential liberal arts education furthers intellectualism, civic engagement, understanding, and respect for all aspects of diversity and inclusion, personal wellness and accountability, and the development of lifelong connections. </P>

<P>Colgate's residential environment supports students' formal education and, through extracurricular life, provides experiences and responsibilities of being a contributing member of a respectful and just community. This residential experience extends learning throughout the entirety of campus life. </P>

<P>The communities within student living areas offer a variety of experiences. These experiences include the Residential Commons program for all first-year students and many sophomores, sophomore residential seminars with an international travel component, interest communities where students learn skills of community building and civic engagement, and residences offering junior and senior students a more independent experience. A limited portion of the senior class is granted approval to live off-campus. </P>

<P>The university provides vibrant and diverse options for campus living, including traditional residence halls, thematic communities, townhouses, and apartment complexes. The university housing agreement is for a period of one academic year. </P>

<P>The Office of Residential Life is committed to student learning and growth in our residential community and to promoting a purposeful and inclusive environment through shared expectations. This is accomplished by promoting healthy, safe, and inclusive communities where individual members are valued and respected; fostering personal growth and success through a purposeful residential experience; and challenging and supporting students in making meaningful and responsible contributions to society. The department is managed by the director of residential life and is staffed by residential life professionals who provide guidance and support to all students. </P>

<P>Each living community on campus is overseen by an assistant director for residential life, who is responsible for the overall operation of the area. Each assistant director manages the staff, resources, community development, and administrative functions of a living community. The student staff of community leaders (CLs) serves as mentors and sources of information to assist students in making their Colgate experience as fulfilling as possible. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Residential Commons </H2>

<P>The Residential Commons at Colgate is designed to provide a strong sense of community for students in their first years on campus, connecting them to faculty members and easing their transition to collegiate life. Beginning in the fall of 2017, every first- -year students, as well as many sophomores, will live in a traditional residence hall as a member of one of four faculty-led residential commons on campus. In each of these residential learning communities, faculty co-leaders will be especially engaged with students, holding study groups in the commons' residence halls and organizing cultural and intellectual programming. Through community-service activities, recreational programming, and social outings and events, students will form lasting bonds with faculty, staff members, and their peers. The Ciccone Commons, housed in Curtis and Drake Halls, launched in fall 2015. Hancock Commons opened in fall of 2016 in the Bryan Complex. In the fall of 2017, Commons Three will open in Andrews, East, and Gate House, and Commons Four will open in Stillman and West. </P>

<P>Additional housing options for sophomores include the townhouses, commons social houses on Broad Street, 113 Broad Street, 100 Hamilton Street, and 76 Broad Street. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Interest Communities </H2>

<P>One of the attractive features of residential life at Colgate is the opportunity to live in small, self-governed communities in which students learn skills of community building and civic engagement. Some of these communities have strong links to academic departments and faculty mentors. The university also offers residential communities without themes for small groups of students interested in living together. All provide students with opportunities for self-governance, leadership, and personal responsibility. </P>

<P>The interest communities offer diverse housing alternatives including fraternity and sorority houses, the Loj, Creative Arts House, Philanthropists at Colgate, Interfaith, Bunche House, La Casa, and Asia Interest House. These, and other house communities, complement the residential vision for the university and actively participate in the Broad Street Association, an inclusive board of students who provide funding for social events along Broad Street. </P>

<H2>University Apartments and Townhouses </H2>

<P>The university manages and maintains three apartment complexes (Newell, Parker, and University Court) and a townhouse complex that accommodate sophomores, juniors, and seniors. The units are furnished and have complete kitchens. While sophomores are required to be on a Colgate meal plan, junior and senior residents typically do their own cooking, but they are also welcome to purchase dining hall meal plans. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Meal Plans </H2>

<P>First-year and sophomore students, as well as any upper-level student living in a traditional residence hall, are required to be on the most comprehensive meal plan offered. Juniors and seniors not living in traditional residence halls may choose from a variety of meal plan options, or can opt out of a meal plan altogether. All meal plans provide flexibility for use in any of the dining facilities, at a wide variety of times. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Off-Campus Housing </H2>

<P>Consistent with Colgate's four-year approach to residential education, the university allows a small number of seniors to live off campus in apartments and other housing units. The option to live independently off campus is intended to provide students with the opportunity to develop the skills needed to manage a household and live as part of a broader community, and to accept the responsibilities attendant to this privilege. The experiences that students gather through negotiating a lease, paying rent, managing routine expenses, cooking for themselves, and living among neighbors of varied ages and backgrounds can be invaluable in preparing them for life after college. </P>

<P>For a variety of reasons, living off campus is not the right choice for all students. For many, the opportunity to live in interest houses or to develop on-campus communities in Colgate-owned apartments or townhouses will better meet their interests. Moreover, Colgate is acutely aware of the impact that off-campus students can have on the local residential community. As such, Colgate limits the number of students allowed to live off campus. Seniors who wish to live off campus must apply to the Office of Residential Life for permission to do so. Permission is granted, on a group basis, through a lottery process conducted in the fall semester of junior year. </P>

<H2>University Code of Student Conduct </H2>

<P>Students at Colgate University accept membership in an academic community dedicated to the pursuit of intellectual and personal growth.

<P>Colgate expects its students to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the institutional community's pursuit of its educational objectives. The integrity of the Colgate community depends upon each member's acceptance of individual responsibility and respect for the rights of others. Colgate expects that its students will not lie, steal, cheat, or engage in dishonest or unlawful behavior or any other behavior intended to inflict physical or emotional harm on oneself, another person, or the community. Colgate students must abide by university policies and comply with directions of university officials acting in performance of their duties. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>MAT Curriculum and Degree Requirements </H2>

<P>The MAT program provides advanced coursework in a selected discipline and in education, leading to secondary school teaching certification. In keeping with the character of our educational studies department, this program emphasizes that what and how we teach in public schools is connected with the struggle for global peace and social and environmental sustainability and justice. Subject areas in which certification is offered include English, mathematics, history, and natural science (biology, chemistry, earth science, or physics). The program is based on the premise that a prospective teacher should have a liberal education, thorough knowledge of his or her chosen discipline, a mastery of educational theory and practice, and a complex understanding of social institutions. A prospective teacher also needs habits of mind that include a willingness to move beyond personal comfort, and a desire to be challenged in all aspects of learning. MAT students work closely with departments to integrate increased knowledge in their disciplines with field experience in education which includes significant observation time and a full term of student teaching. </P>

<P>To receive the MAT degree, students complete between four and eight courses in educational studies, and at least three courses in their major depending on previous experience and coursework, a special project or thesis, and workshops on child abuse and violence prevention. Fingerprinting is also required by the State of New York. Students who are already certified at the secondary level may substitute two other education courses. </P>

<P>MAT students should enroll in educational studies courses at the 500 level. (See Educational Studies.) Courses taken by MAT students for degree credit in their disciplines of specialization will be assigned 500level numbers consecutively beginning with 591. </P>

<P>For each undergraduate course taken toward the MAT degree, a student must submit a Graduate Credit Agreement form prior to registration. This form is available online or from the registrar's office. </P>

<P>To be admitted to the program, a student must have a strong academic background in at least one area of certification, usually the equivalent of an undergraduate major. A background in the social, cultural, and developmental foundations of education is also desirable, but this background can be acquired in the program. In addition, two semesters of a foreign language or the equivalent is required. These courses may be transferred from another institution and must be approved by the educational studies department. Alternatively, the prerequisite courses may be part of the degree program. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Academic Standards </H2>

<P>Students must maintain a grade point average of B– to continue in good standing as master's degree candidates. To qualify for a degree, a student must earn an overall B– average in courses. In the various teaching degree programs, one-half of the work is typically done in an area of specialization, and a student must receive a grade of B– or higher in the courses in the area of specialization and in education courses. </P>

<P>Degrees &quot;with distinction&quot; are awarded to students who maintain an A– average in both the areas of specialization and education courses, and whose special projects or theses are considered by the thesis and special project supervisor to be of high quality. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>MAT Requirements in Academic Fields </H2>

<P>Each MAT candidate is normally required to take a minimum of three classes in his or her chosen academic field, consulting with his or her advisers both in the educational studies department and in the field of specialization to select appropriate courses that meet State of New York certification requirements. </P>

<H2>Liberal Arts Core Curriculum </H2>

<P>Director Ries </P>

<P>Colgate's Core program is a defining feature of its liberal arts curriculum. The Core Curriculum at Colgate takes seriously the faculty's mission to engage students in the fullness of a liberal arts education: to learn, reflect, and live with an expanding awareness of one's responsibility to self, community, and the larger world. As such, Colgate's Core Curriculum aims to prepare students for rich and fulfilling lives in a context of rapid change here and around the globe. </P>

<H2>CORE 151 Legacies of the Ancient World </H2>

<P>Director Marlowe </P>

<P>This course explores ancient texts that articulate perennial issues, such as the nature of the human and the divine; virtue and the good life; the true, the just, and the beautiful; the difference between subjective opinion and objective knowledge. These texts exemplify basic modes of speech, literary forms, and patterns of thinking that establish the terminology of academic and intellectual discourse and critical thought across many different societies: epic, rhetoric, tragedy, poetry, epistemology, science, democracy, rationality, the soul, spirit, law, grace. Such terms have shaped the patterns of life, norms, and prejudices that human communities have continually challenged, criticized, and refashioned throughout history. To highlight both the dialogue and conflicts between the texts and the traditions they embody, this course, taught by a multidisciplinary staff and in an interdisciplinary manner, focuses on both the historical contexts of these texts and the ongoing retellings and reinterpretations of them through time. The course includes texts from the ancient Mediterranean world that have given rise to some of the philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions associated with &quot;The West,&quot; emphasizing that Western traditions were not formed in a vacuum but developed in dialogue and conflict with other traditions. Common to all sections of this component are classic works such as Homer, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, Plato, and a Roman text. Complementary texts or visual materials from the ancient period, in and beyond the Western world, and/or response texts from the medieval or contemporary periods are added by faculty in individual sections. </P>

<P>CORE 152 Challenges of Modernity </P>

<P>Director Bouk </P>

<P>Modernity is a crucial element of the intellectual legacy to which we are heirs. A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course. This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Communities and Identities </H2>

<P>Director Kaimal </P>

<P>Courses in the Communities and Identities (CI) component are designed to provide a textured understanding of identities, cultures, and human experiences in particular communities and regions of the world. They seek to examine critically the multiple forms of social life that contribute to the world's cultural diversity, and to analyze the ways in which any one society functions as a unified whole and yet encompasses multiple, sometimes conflicting identities (based, for example, on gender, race, status, class, sexual identities, religion, and language). As investigations into a particular place and its extensions, they consider cultures and communities in their own right, with their own practices, histories, beliefs, and values, their own instantiations of modernity, and lastly, with their own capacities to produce and shape complex identities. Furthermore, because many of the societies that are the subject of study have had significant and enduring encounters with imperial powers or other forms of domination, these courses examine the tensions and permutations, asymmetries and alliances that such relationships have produced. Multidisciplinary in focus and materials, these courses explore the complex identities of persons through study of their geography, history, politics, and economics as well as their languages, literature, film, art, music, and religions. Students develop a comparative, historical frame of reference between the community being studied and the communities to which they belong. </P>

<H2>Scientific Perspectives on the World </H2>

<P>Director Meyers </P>

<P>All people routinely face important decisions about their own lives and about issues of broader social significance that require scientific literacy. In order to make thoughtful decisions about such matters, it is necessary to have a solid understanding of how scientific knowledge is obtained and an appreciation for the complexities of applying scientific findings to broader issues. The courses in the Scientific Perspectives (SP) program are designed to address both of these needs, and are unified by two common purposes. First, these courses deepen students' understanding of the methods used in scientific fields to acquire knowledge about the world. Each of the SP courses focuses on an area of scientific research to give students grounding in the interplay of scientific analysis, verification, and explanation. Second, the SP courses broaden students' understanding of the relevance of scientific methods by helping students to apply scientific methods and findings to a broad range of issues. Specifically, these courses help students to connect their growing understanding of scientific methods either to a topic relevant to society and the human experience or to an area of knowledge or mode of inquiry outside the natural sciences and mathematics. In this way, SP courses are multi-disciplinary in focus. Because empirical methods and quantitative reasoning are used in a variety of disciplines, the topics of the SP courses span the study of the physical world, biological processes, human behavior, mathematical methods, and technological innovations. SP courses provide an illustration of the application of the scientific method through an active learning, problem-oriented experience for students. </P>

<P>Courses that may be crosslisted with Scientific Perspectives (e.g., COSC 100/CORE 126S, and COSC 150/CORE 142S) may not be used to satisfy both the Areas of Inquiry and Core SP requirements. Check the course offerings posted online each term for additional Scientific Perspectives offerings as well as selected first-year seminars that may fulfill this requirement. </P>

<H2>Global Engagements </H2>

<P>Director Frey </P>

<P>Living thoughtfully in the multicultural, globalized world of the 21st century requires critical engagement with complex phenomena and varied perspectives. Courses in this component provide the opportunity to analyze the conditions and consequences of human diversity in its local and transnational forms. To satisfy this requirement, each student will successfully complete a designated course that inquires into the ways that people seek to make sense of a diverse and increasingly interconnected world. Global Engagements (GE) courses come from departments and programs throughout the university. A number of Colgate study group directors' courses have also been approved to satisfy this requirement. GE courses take a variety of forms. For instance, a course in this component might ask students to do one of the following: </P>

<P> examine the consequences of globalization in one or more of its many forms, </P>

<P> investigate issues or processes that have an impact that can be fully understood only by using a global perspective,  experience the cross-cultural understanding that comes from intensive language learning or study group participation,  cross boundaries by examining how diversity finds expression in human culture, or </P>

<P> consider human diversity in dimensions such as race, class, and gender. Ultimately, the GE requirement seeks to empower students to live responsibly in contexts that require an understanding of the complexity of human beings and their impact, whether in the United States or in the broader world. </P>

<P>A Global Engagements course may count toward a student's major or minor; it may also fulfill an Areas of Inquiry requirement. Students are expected to take at least one CI or GE course that is not focused exclusively on the United States. </P>

<P>Global Engagements courses will be identified in the registration materials available each semester. </P>

<H2>Distinction Seminar in the Liberal Arts Core </H2>

<P>Director Frey </P>

<P>The goal of the distinction seminar is to complement honors work in departments and programs by giving select students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their honors projects. Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper relevant to the student's departmental honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways: </P>

<P> by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project; </P>

<P> by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or  by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students' departmental projects. To enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A- or better in the distinction seminar, earn departmental </P>

<P>honors with the completion of the department honors project, and achieve an overall GPA of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation. </P>

<P>The Department of Art and Art History offers courses of study in the history, theory, and practice of the visual arts for the general liberal arts student as well as the art history or studio art major. </P>

<P>Art History The department offers more than 20 courses that trace the visual arts from antiquity to the present day. Classroom lectures are supplemented by visits to museums in the area and in New York City, as well as Colgate's Clifford Gallery, Picker Art Gallery, and Longyear Museum. In this way, students increase their understanding of the visual arts as expressions of fundamental cultural values. </P>

<P>Studio Art Courses explore creative modes of expression and problem solving while gaining familiarity with contemporary issues in visual art. The curriculum supports a variety of mediums including digital art, drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video art at the introductory and advanced levels. Studio arts courses are enriched by an ongoing series of visiting artists' lectures, exhibitions, and screenings as well as regular visits to New York City galleries, museums, and artists' studios. </P>

<P>The Clifford Gallery is a teaching gallery featuring four to six exhibitions a year. Exhibitions are selected by the art and art history faculty to explore issues originating in the academic curriculum. The primary focus is the display of professional work by contemporary artists. These artists are often featured in the weekly public lecture series described below. The Clifford Gallery is open to the entire community and contributes to the cultural life of the central New York area. </P>

<P>The Department of Art and Art History Lecture Series Lectures take place every other week in Little Hall's Golden Auditorium. The series features presentations by studio artists, art historians, and critics, and serves as an arena for discussion of a wide range of subjects relevant to the study of the visual arts. Recent participants have included art historians and practicing sculptors, painters, film and video makers, printmakers, photographers, architects, and artists working in digital art and performance. The series is required as part of the curriculum and is open to the community. It also serves as a venue for welcoming Colgate graduates back to discuss their work in the visual arts. </P>

<P>The Alternative Cinema Series takes place weekly on Tuesday evenings. This is a series of films and videos ranging from &quot;classic&quot; cinema to the current avant-garde. Each semester several film/video makers, historians, or curators visit campus and present work in person for the series. </P>

<P>The Picker Art Gallery This professional gallery maintains the Colgate University collections, including some 11,000 works from a wide range of cultures and historical periods. Although it is not part of the Department of Art and Art History, the Picker Art Gallery provides an important resource to students, faculty, alumni, and friends of Colgate through exhibitions and sponsorship of the Friends of the Visual Arts. </P>

<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>After completing ARTS 475 Senior Project: Art History (AH) in the fall semester, students have the opportunity to apply to continue their work with an honors-eligible project in the spring semester. The award of honors in art and art history is dependent on departmental evaluation. </P>

<P>Art History: The honors-eligible project could be a substantial reworking of the senior project completed in the fall semester of senior year, or a discrete project that meaningfully engages ideas raised in ARTS 475.The thesis adviser and the coordinator of senior projects will decide together on the student's application to continue on to honors-eligible work. Students pursuing honors-eligible work in the spring enroll in an independent study (ARTS 491) with their senior project adviser. Honors presentations take place at the end of the term and faculty decide whether the project is worthy of honors. Honors will be conferred only on work of outstanding quality. </P>

<P>Studio Art:  The students work closely with a faculty member to develop and realize a coherent body of studio work that serves as a capstone for the concentration. It is the culmination of previous coursework that has required conceptualization and understanding of artistic theoretical frameworks and technical knowledge. Class meetings serve as an opportunity to share ideas and work in progress; regular critiques incorporate the critical language acquired in ARTS 375. Work from the project is shown as part of a senior exhibition at the end of the term. All students with a studio arts emphasis are required to take and complete this course in fall of the senior year. </P>

<H3>Graduate Study Recommendations </H3>

<P>Students anticipating graduate work in architecture should be aware that liberal arts experience is highly valued by the best graduate schools. To prepare for graduate work in architecture, students should take PHYS 105 or PHYS 111 and one semester of calculus. Experience in studio courses, especially drawing (ARTS 211), sculpture (ARTS 263 or ARTS 264), is extremely valuable in the preparation of a graduate portfolio. The study of historical architecture and the ways in which architecture connects to society is promoted in many art courses such as ARTS 207, ARTS 216, ARTS 220, ARTS 226, ARTS 275, ARTS 277, ARTS 344, ARTS 360, and ARTS 372. Students interested in careers in architecture should contact the architecture adviser. </P>

<H2>Museum Studies Minor </H2>

<P>The Department of Art &amp; Art History also offers an interdisciplinary minor in Museum Studies, overseen by an Advisory Board that includes members from Art and Art History, Sociology and Anthropology, History and the University Museums. Courses in Museum Studies may address a range of topics, including actual museums (their histories, architecture, operations, politics, ethics, etc.), collective memory, institutional critique, cultural heritage and/or property, or public history. Courses may also count toward the program if a substantial part of their pedagogy is object-based. </P>

<P>The minor program consists of 5 courses and a practicum (see below). All 5 courses may come from the core course list, or 4 from the core course list and 1 from the elective list. One of the core courses must be at the 300-level. The five courses must include selections from at least two of the core Museum Studies departments (Art &amp; Art History, Sociology &amp; Anthropology, and History). If a student majors in Art &amp; Art History, Anthropology, or History and minors in Museum Studies, only one course may count toward their major and the Museum Studies minor. A student minoring in Museum Studies may petition the Advisory Board to have a course not included on the list below count toward the degree if the course addresses one or more of the themes noted above. </P>

<H3>Practicum </H3>

<P>The Practicum in Museum Studies is an opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience in a non-profit museum, gallery, cultural center, or historical society. This may take the form of paid or volunteer work or an internship, and must be at least 140 hours in duration. It is expected that the practicum will deepen the student's understanding of a substantive aspect or aspects of the institution's operations through work in a department such as Curatorial, Development, Education, Collections Management, Communications, or Archives. </P>

<P>The practicum requirement can be satisfied by an internship at the Picker Art Gallery or Longyear Museum of Anthropology during the academic year or over the summer, or at any other suitable museum. Students who wish to fulfill this requirement at an off-campus institution are required to submit a Practicum Pre-Approval Form in the semester prior to starting that work. Financial support for internships is available through Colgate's Summer Funding, but students should be aware of the competitive nature of these grants and of their early deadlines (usually in late February; for more information and specific deadlines, visit summer funding. </P>

<P>Colgate's Upstate Institute can help students identify ways to fulfill the Museum Studies practicum requirement in central New York. The Upstate Institute supports community-based research through the Summer Field School, and can help place students as full-time paid research Fellows with institutions in the region such as the Munson Williams Proctor Institute, Everson Museum of Art, Oneida County Historical Society, Oneida Community Mansion House, Adirondack Museum, Iroquois Indian Museum, Fenimore Art Museum, the Shako:wi Cultural Center, the Corning Museum of Glass, and the National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro. For more information visit the Upstate Institute website for more information on these opportunities. </P>

<P>Students should also consult with their Museum Studies minor adviser about the various ways this requirement can be fulfilled, and about opportunities that best meet the individual needs and interests of the student. </P>

<P>The Department of the Classics embraces a multifaceted approach to the ancient Greek and Roman world, studying not only language and literature but also history, art, archaeology, religion, politics, philosophy, and anthropology. Students may choose to pursue a major in Latin, Greek, the Classics, or Classical Studies. Majors in Latin, Greek, or the Classics make language and literature their main focus; majors in Classical Studies give less emphasis to the languages but acquire a broad understanding of different aspects of ancient civilization. Many of the Department's courses — such as Greek Art, Classical Mythology, Sexuality and Gender in Ancient Greece and Rome, The Tragic and Comic Muse, and Greek Religion — also complement offerings in a range of subject areas across the curriculum. Recent graduates from the Department of the Classics are pursuing diverse careers in fields such as law, medicine, advertising, computer science, and education. Many, too, have gone on to do graduate work in Classics or related disciplines. </P>

<P>CLAS 221, CLAS 222, CLAS 224, CLAS 225, CLAS 230, CLAS 231, CLAS 232, CLAS 233, CLAS 234, CLAS 235, CLAS 236, and CLAS 237 require no knowledge of Greek or Latin language. These courses are open to all students, but are subject to limitations in enrollment set by the instructor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Major Programs in the Classics </H2>

<P>There are four possible majors in the classics: Greek, Latin, the classics, and classical studies. All majors require a minimum of eight courses within the department but vary in the amount and level of language study required. In addition, all majors are required to take the senior seminar (CLAS 401) in the fall of their senior year. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Awards </H2>

<P>The Newton Lloyd Andrews Prize — established in memory of Newton Lloyd Andrews, a member of the class of 1862, to support the study of the art and monuments of ancient Greece and Italy, Gothic architecture, or Renaissance painting. </P>

<P>The J. Curtiss Austin Latin Prize — established as a memorial to Dr. J. Curtiss Austin in honor of his 40 years on the Colgate faculty, and awarded by the Department of the Classics to the student whose performance in Latin has been the most outstanding. </P>

<P>The Award for Excellence — awarded annually to that first-year or sophomore student who shows the best promise in a course in Latin or Greek and who achieves the best record among his/her peers in Latin or Greek. </P>

<P>The Baldwin Greek Prize — established for the sophomore class for the examination in writing upon some author, or work of an author, read by the class. No student may compete unless his/her standing in all departments averages at least B (3.00). The award is made by a committee not associated with the university. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>To evaluate a student's qualifications for advanced placement, the department requires the submission of an Advanced Placement Examination in Latin. Students who submit a grade of 4 or 5 and completes LATN 201 or a higher-level course in Latin will receive one credit for LATN 122 for the AP examination that may count toward a major in the department. </P>

<P>Transfer credit for a major is granted for courses comparable to those required for the classics major at Colgate on an individual basis. Evidence of course content may be required. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>The minimum departmental GPA required for honors in the classics, classical studies, Greek, or Latin is 3.50; for high honors 3.80. In addition, successful completion of an honors thesis and an oral examination is required. Honors candidates usually take CLAS 490, GREK 490 or LATN 490 in the fall of their senior year while writing their theses. Proposals for theses should be prepared in the spring of the junior year in consultation with the thesis adviser. Theses are then revised during the first half of the spring semester of the senior year and defended in April. </P>

<P>The Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures offers courses in the languages and cultures of China and Japan. Because each language teaches so much about the people and the culture it represents, the department offers credit toward graduation for a single semester of study. Students who continue through the four-year sequences of rigorous classroom language training, combined with study abroad experiences, acquire the proficiency they need to pursue graduate study or a variety of careers related to East Asia. Courses taught in English include literature and film, East Asian Thought, Topics in Japanese Studies and in Linguistics, the Japanese Village, the Chinese City, China in Transition, and Topics in Chinese Culture. Qualified students may arrange independent study beyond the courses offered. </P>

<P>The Department of English offers courses in two programs of study, one in literature written in the English language and the second in English with an emphasis in creative writing. Students may pursue majors and minors in both these areas. </P>

<P>An English major develops students' ability to use language effectively and enhances their critical and analytical skills by making them aware of the social and historical context in which writing, in any of its forms, is produced. English study provides an excellent basis for professional programs in law, journalism, publishing, and business as well as for graduate study in literature, the theater, or creative writing. </P>

<P>Students pursuing one of the majors in the department take courses in specified categories described in detail below. There is considerable choice from among the courses that fulfill these requirements, and students should discuss their programs with an adviser in planning a major. English courses also serve as electives for students in other programs. Normally 200-level courses are for first-year and sophomore students; 300-level courses, for sophomores, juniors, and seniors; and 400-level courses for juniors and seniors. There are a few specified prerequisites for individual courses. Non-majoring students considering 400-level English courses as electives, however, should consult catalogue descriptions and may wish to speak with instructors to determine their readiness for particular courses. </P>

<P>Continued study of a foreign language or work in the literature of other languages in translation is particularly recommended as complementary to an English major and is especially important for students interested in further literary studies. Writing is an important component of coursework. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>Because transferred courses must conform in content and rigor to Colgate's curriculum, students intending to take a course in English literature at another institution must meet with the department's transfer-credit adviser before enrolling in a course at another institution. Transfer credit for an English course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The transfer-credit adviser grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300- or 400level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors and High Honors in English </H2>

<P>The privilege to work toward honors is granted at the discretion of the faculty. Seniors with an average of 3.5 in ENGL courses are eligible to apply to pursue an honors project. Interested students should begin discussing their projects with potential directors in their junior year. </P>

<P>Candidates in literary criticism must enroll in ENGL 489, a 0.25-credit course offered in the fall semester. In consultation with a member of the faculty, the student selects a topic and submits a formal prospectus, which must be approved by two faculty supervisors, the director of the honors program, and the department as a whole. The deadline for submission of the prospectus normally falls in October, while the deadline for an annotated bibliography normally falls in December. </P>

<P>Candidates in creative writing must enroll in ENGL 477 - Advanced Workshop in the fall of their senior year. They should also speak with a creative writing professor(s) in the spring of their junior year. Permission to pursue a creative writing honors the next spring will be granted on the basis of the quality of work in ENGL </P>

<P>477. </P>

<P>Students pursuing an honors project are enrolled in ENGL 490 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates, during the spring term of their senior year. ENGL 490 must be taken in addition to the required 400-level seminar and in addition to the minimum number of courses required for the major. Students must successfully complete the honors seminar and submit a final version of the thesis on a date specified by the department. If the thesis is provisionally approved by the faculty supervisors and the director of the honors program, the student then discusses the project at an oral presentation scheduled during finals week. </P>

<P>A student who completes a project judged worthy of honors by the department and maintains at least a 3.5 average in all ENGL courses, including ENGL 490, is awarded a degree in English with honors. Students are awarded high honors on the basis of the quality of the thesis and the oral presentation. If a student withdraws from the program, or if the thesis is not approved for honors, ENGL 490 is converted to ENGL 491 - Independent Study, and a grade is assigned by the faculty member who supervises the completion of the work. </P>

<P>Students with further questions should contact the director of honors in the Department of English. </P>

<P>Associate Professors Baldwin, Miller, Swensen (Chair) Max Kade Fellow  Ruckdeschel </P>

<P>The study of German lays the groundwork for academic inquiry into the fascinating creative and intellectual cultures of central Europe. Serving as a gateway to rich literary and artistic traditions as well as the discourses of philosophy and critical theory, German also enables students to access Germanophone Europe's many contributions to the social and natural sciences. The department's academic program is structured to enable students to pursue their interests in German as well as related fields: the beginning and intermediate language courses emphasize cultural knowledge about contemporary German-speaking societies and provide a strong foundation in the skills of speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing German. German 351 fosters students' capacities for advanced study of German language, literature, and cultural history, while enabling them to conduct related academic work in German. Additional courses at the 300 level feature diverse topics in German literary and cultural studies, while seminars at the 400 level undertake intensive and focused investigations of seminal periods and genres of the German literary and cultural imagination. </P>

<P>The study of German can be integral to students' academic pursuits as whole. The department encourages students to enroll in related courses in other disciplines such as philosophy, history, music, international relations, linguistics, and art history. A major in German is an excellent preparation for graduate studies in these fields as well as in literature and German studies, and can also give students a competitive edge in such fields as economics, politics, law, business, journalism, consulting, and publishing. German not only provides students with the necessary basis for a rigorous or sophisticated understanding of central European culture, but also develops in them a more profound understanding of their native language and of the relationship between language and knowledge: to speak with Goethe, &quot;Wer fremde Sprachen nicht kennt, weiß nichts von seiner eignen&quot; (those who don't know foreign languages know nothing of their own). </P>

<P>Both university and major credits are normally granted to students who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement examinations in German language and literature or a score of 6 or 7 on the higher level International Baccalaureate German exam. Transfer credit for courses taken at other institutions may be granted with the approval of the department chair. </P>

<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>An honors project allows students to build on their knowledge to pursue independent research on a topic of their interest in close consultation with one or several faculty members. Students with a GPA of 3.30 in courses included in the major and with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 are eligible for honors in German. Students who have attained that average may apply to pursue honors by the early fall of the senior year. Each candidate must complete a thesis or its equivalent under the guidance of a faculty adviser and must discuss the thesis at an oral presentation normally scheduled in April. Research on this project begins in the fall semester of the senior year. In the spring semester candidates register for GERM 490. This course must be taken in addition to the minimum of eight courses required for the major. The quality of the project resulting from this course, as judged by the adviser and one other faculty member, determines whether the student receives honors or a grade in GERM 491 - Independent Study. </P>

<P>Successful honors students whose departmental average is 3.50 or higher are eligible for high honors. For this distinction the student must fulfill all regular honors requirements and must also pass an additional oral examination based on his or her cumulative work in German courses. </P>

<P>Acceptance in Delta Phi Alpha (national German honor society) is possible for all students who have at least two years of college German, a minimum GPA of 3.30 in all German courses, and an overall GPA of 3.00, and who show a continued interest in the study of German language and literature. </P>

<H2>Study Group </H2>

<P>Every spring the department conducts a study group at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität in Freiburg, Germany. Majors in German are normally expected to avail themselves of this opportunity. The study group is also open to non-majors who have sufficient German language skills. For more information, see Off-Campus Study. </P>

<H2>Facilities </H2>

<P>The Max Kade German Center in Lawrence Hall serves the department both as a seminar room and as a common room. It offers audiovisual facilities, German television broadcasts, Internet connections, a German reference library, and current German periodicals. The center is also the site of lectures, film screenings, and a weekly coffee hour. </P>

<P>Each year there are native speakers from the University of Freiburg in residence to assist students. In addition, the German department shares the Keck Humanities Resource Center with other arts and humanities departments. Here German audio, video, and computer resources are available for laboratory work in connection with language classes as well as for independent studies. </P>

<P>Many students come to Colgate with significant musical experience behind them, won through arduous and focused study. The fundamental aim of the curriculum in music is to develop that experience to its utmost potential. Performance ensembles and private instruction build directly on that experience, while classroom instruction introduces student musicians to important ideas, histories, and various cultures that inform and broaden that experience. Qualified students can choose to develop in ways that most interest them. Those who choose to major in music will find their development guided by a balanced program of performance and classroom studies. Graduating majors have gone on to graduate study in every area of music or have immediately entered careers in arts management, mathematics, medicine, law, business, sound engineering, and many other fields. </P>

<P>Another fundamental aim of the curriculum is to introduce students with little or no musical background into the world of music as part of Colgate's liberal arts program. These students should begin with MUSI 103, MUSI 111, MUSI 151, MUSI 161, or MUSI 221. </P>

<P>Upper-level courses divide into three groups: history, theory, and performance. The history courses are designed to give students an understanding of music through a study of composers and historical periods. The theory sequence teaches how music is put together and how to write it. The performance courses offer opportunities for students to engage in the art of performance and to gain credit in department-sponsored ensembles and private instruction. </P>

<P>Students with some musical background are encouraged to take MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 or MUSI 203 first. MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 can be taken in any order. </P>

<P>The music department offers extensive performing opportunities open to all qualified students regardless of major. The Colgate University Orchestra and Colgate University Choral Ensembles are the large performing organizations (auditions required). Performance opportunities are also offered in the Colgate Chamber Players (chamber music) and Colgate University Concert Jazz Ensemble. Private instruction in most instruments and in voice is available to students at an additional fee. All of these programs (except private instruction) may be elected on a credit or non-credit basis, and they are open to all Colgate students regardless of major. </P>

<P>The department recommends that students planning graduate work in musicology acquire background in foreign languages. </P>

Grants are awarded based on the merit of the written proposal, demonstrated musical talent, and participation in music department programs. </P>

<P>The Felix Eyle Memorial Prize in Music — awarded annually to an outstanding violin student at Colgate. The recipient is chosen by the faculty of the music department solely on the basis of talent, not financial need. The student will be featured during a normally scheduled concert. </P>

<P>The Robert G. Ingraham Memorial Music Prize — established as an annual award to the graduating senior who, in the judgment of the president, dean, chair of the Department of Music, and director of CSLI, did the most to promote and stimulate good music as an undergraduate by voluntary activity, leadership, performance, or participation in the band, orchestra, choir, glee club, or any other musical endeavor, individual or group. </P>

<P>The Lorey Family Senior Music Prize — established in 2012 by Evan Lorey and Paul Schupf, in memory of Wilhemine and Fred Lorey, and awarded annually to one or more senior majors in music. This award will benefit talented students who excel in the history, theory, and composition of music. </P>

<P>Professors Dudrick, Kawall, McCabe, Meyer (Chair) Associate Professors J. Klein, Tumulty, Witherspoon Assistant Professors Blackman, Lennertz, Nisenbaum Visiting Assistant Professor Bulthuis Lecturer Pendleton </P>

<P>Philosophy is a central component of a liberal arts education. It raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the place of human beings within it. What is the nature of morality? What is free will and are human beings free? What is the relation between mind and body? What, if anything, can we know about the material world? Does God exist? What makes a state just? What makes for a good life? </P>

<P>In attempting to answer such questions, students of philosophy reflect on both their own responses to these questions and the ways in which past thinkers have defended their answers to them. The process of formulating and testing these answers requires education in logical analysis, reasoned argument, and analytic thinking. In acquiring such education within the philosophy curriculum, students develop their ability to solve problems and to think, read, and write critically — skills that are in high demand in a number of different professions. Philosophy majors go on to successful careers in law, consulting, finance, and medicine. Many have also embarked on academic careers. </P>

<P>But philosophy is about more than reflection and finding answers. As the love of wisdom, it is also a practice and a way of life, one characterized by openness to viewpoints other than one's own, a willingness to question both received opinions and one's own opinions, and a passionate concern to integrate thought and practice into a meaningful life. </P>

<P>The department offers a number of courses that serve as gateways to the practice of philosophy. These gateway courses are PHIL 101 - Introduction to Philosophical Problems; PHIL 111 - Ethics; and PHIL 121 - Political Philosophy. Prospective philosophy majors are especially encouraged to take PHIL 101 early in their course of study. Other courses at the 200 and 300 level are either courses in the history of philosophy or courses that focus on problems in specific areas of philosophy. Many of these courses do not have specific prerequisites and are open to all interested students. </P>

<P>There are two distinct major programs: philosophy and the joint major in philosophy and religion. The department does not offer a minor in philosophy and religion. </P>

<P>Awards </P>

<P>The Balmuth Award for Philosophical Engagement — established an as award in honor of Jerome Balmuth for the student who, in the judgment of the department, best exemplifies Jerry's love of philosophy and cultivation of philosophical community at Colgate. </P>

<P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Awards for Excellence — established as an award for students who, in the judgment of the department, have performed exceptional work in philosophy and/or religion. </P>

<P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Award for Postgraduate Study in Philosophy and/or Religion — established as an award for a graduating senior, for achievement in the study of philosophy and/or religion and, depending on financial need, to assist the recipient with postgraduate study in philosophy, religion, or philosophy and religion at a recognized graduate or divinity school. </P>

<P>The Raphael Lemkin Prize — established to honor the memory of Raphael Lemkin (1901–1959), survivor of the Holocaust and professor on international law, who first coined the word &quot;genocide&quot; and who inspired the United Nations' Convention on Genocide. Awarded for the best essay dealing with an issue, principle, or concept related to Dr. Lemkin's concerns and reflecting his ideals, as determined by the chair of the department and/or the chair's appointed committee of three faculty members. All prize participants must read the biography of Raphael Lemkin provided to them by the department. </P>

<P>The Robinson Essay Prize —awarded on the basis of an essay written for a 200- or 300-level course in the department during the previous spring or fall semesters. </P>

</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>Transfer credit for graduation requirements may be awarded by the registrar on the basis of course syllabi and requirements and advice from the department. To assess transfer credit for major requirements, however, the same documents plus the student's written work in the course (i.e., exams, papers) must be submitted to the faculty adviser for evaluation. The department chair receives a recommendation and is responsible for deciding whether to award major credit. Normally no more than two transfer credits may count toward major or minor requirements. Seminar credit is not transferable. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors </H2>

<P>Philosophy </P>

<P>A student who wishes to become a candidate for honors in philosophy or who wishes to become a candidate for honors in philosophy and religion by writing on a philosophical theme must seek the approval of a faculty adviser by presenting him or her with a substantial essay that could serve as the basis for an honors project. Normally this will be an essay written for a 300- or 400-level philosophy course, together with a plan for developing the original essay into an honors thesis. If the faculty member and the department's honors supervisor agree that the submitted essay shows promise of becoming a high-quality thesis, the student may register for PHIL 490 with a view to qualifying for honors. </P>

<P>The independent study should result in a senior thesis. Students writing a senior thesis will give an informal presentation of their work to students and faculty of the department. Students seeking honors must submit their theses to their advisers by the deadline set by the department. If a student's adviser judges the thesis to be of sufficient quality, the student will be invited to stand for honors. (Independent study students who are not invited to stand for honors will still be able to complete their senior theses.) Honors candidates will undergo an oral exam (the honors defense) conducted by the adviser and two additional faculty members during exam week. Ideally the honors defense becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. In addition an honors candidate must have a GPA of at least 3.40 in his or her major. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Philosophy and Religion </H2>

<P>Candidates for honors in Philosophy and Religion normally take an independent study (PHIL 490 or RELG 490) with their honors adviser during spring term of senior year. The honors thesis - a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique -  is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser and two other faculty readers decide that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets with their adviser and the two other faculty readers - a committee consisting of Philosophy and Religion faculty - and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in the Philosophy and Religion major. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Study Group </H2>

<P>During the spring semester the Department of Philosophy, in conjunction with the Department of Religion, offers a study group at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland's first university, founded in 1410. Other than the director's course, which is offered by a department member, students take courses of their choice from among those offered by the University of St. Andrews, at which they are enrolled for the semester. St. Andrews has a very fine philosophy department and it is a great advantage for majors in both philosophy and philosophy and religion to study there for a semester. The study group is also open to majors from other departments. See Off-Campus Study and Extended Study. </P>

<H3>Major Requirements </H3>

<P>A major in philosophy requires nine courses in philosophy, or ten if the philosophy major is a candidate for honors. </P>

<P>Though students may take as many 100- and 200-level courses as they wish, no more than three such courses will count towards the completion of the major. The lone exception is PHIL 225 Logic I, which can count towards the major in addition to three other 100- or 200-level courses. Though not strictly required of all majors, PHIL 225, is nevertheless strongly recommended for all majors — especially for students contemplating graduate work in philosophy. Only one of the total number of courses may be an independent study. </P>

<P>The Department of Religion at Colgate offers a program of study that challenges students to explore the role of religion across cultures and historical periods, and to think critically about the nature and expression of religiousness. Religion courses offer training in a unique combination of skills, including close textual analysis, direct observation, critical thinking, and cross-cultural understanding. </P>

<P>The department offers a variety of courses regarding diverse African, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish, and Native American traditions and scriptures. In addition to courses focused on particular traditions, the department also offers courses on the relationship between religion and issues of historic and contemporary importance, such as the environment, terrorism, medicine, gender, and the law. </P>

<P>The study of religion is necessarily interdisciplinary, making reflective use of the full variety of liberal arts methods. In addition, it engages related issues in philosophy, ethics, society, spirituality, science, gender, sexuality, arts, and politics. Thus, a major or minor in religion may serve as a natural complement to other majors. Students in the arts and humanities, for instance, will find that the study of religious texts and worlds affords them greater insight into literature and visual art. Some students may seek to make stronger interdisciplinary connections. In consultation with an adviser, students may elect to create a track through the religion major or minor that brings their work in religion into dialogue with their work in other departments or programs. Possible tracks include: </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Religion, Politics, and Law </H2>

<P>The department offers courses that examine the intersection of religion and politics, past and present, explore the legal frameworks of a variety of religious traditions, and ask students to think about the role of ethics and morality in public life. Students interested in history, international relations, peace and conflict studies, or political science will find that a minor or second major in religion allows them a better understanding of many of the longstanding ideological conflicts that have shaped the contemporary world. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Religion and Health </H2>

<P>Students interested in the natural sciences who intend to enter the fields of medicine and health sciences will find that courses in religion equip them to evaluate the moral complexity of current scientific advances. A host of religion courses probe questions that are central to medicine and health: questions of body and soul, psychic states and mindfulness, sex and sexuality, life and death. These are treated in a variety of religious traditions, offering the pre-med student a comparative approach to health and healing. </P>

<P>The success of our graduates indicates that a major in religion provides excellent preparation for a number of careers, including education, government, journalism, finance, law, social work, and professional service in non-profit organizations and religious institutions. </P>

<H2>Honors </H2>

<P>Religion </P>

<P>All candidates for honors in religion who wish to write on a religious theme are required to take an advanced course in religion in the fall of the senior year. At the end of the course, the faculty member may recommend that a student's paper be reworked into an honors thesis. </P>

<P>In the spring of the senior year, candidates for honors normally take an independent study (RELG 490) with their honors adviser. The honors thesis — a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique — is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser decides that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets during exam week with his or her adviser and two other faculty readers and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in his or her major. </P>

<P>The aim of this department is to provide students with a solid foundation in the languages, literatures, and cultures of the French-, Italian-, and Spanish-speaking worlds. Language courses work to improve students' abilities in speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing in French, Italian, or Spanish, while providing an introduction to culture. Structured in levels of increasing complexity, literature courses foster the improvement of analytical and critical skills, an enhanced aesthetic appreciation of works of literary art, and a broader understanding of linguistic and cultural diversity. Many of the courses offered in the department may be taken by students who do not plan to major in French or Spanish but who would like to maintain or develop their knowledge of these languages and cultures. Given the multi-cultural nature of the United States today, familiarity with a second language and culture will enhance a student's preparation for a career in any profession. Advanced study of Spanish or French (300 level and higher) makes the student eligible for the intimate contact with a foreign culture available through the department's study groups abroad. A major in French or Spanish can be particularly useful in the fields of law, business, international trade, journalism, education, and public administration. </P>

<P>The department offers majors and minors in both French and Spanish, but not in Italian. Courses counting toward these majors are conducted entirely in the appropriate language. </P>

<H2>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>University credit is automatically granted to entering students who achieve a score of 4 or higher on AP examinations in French language and Spanish language or literature. Major credit is granted for a score of 5. </P>

<P>The following course equivalents are established: In French, language grade of 4 = 202; language grade of 5 = 361. In Spanish, language grade of 4 = 202; language grade of 5 = 361; literature grade of 4 = 202; literature grade of 5 = 202, and exemption from a major credit at the 350 level. </P>

<P>Students with an AP language grade of 3 may take FREN 202 or SPAN 202 or higher. Students with an AP language or literature grade of 4 or higher must register at the 300 level to continue their study of French or Spanish. No more than two AP or transfer credits, or combination of the two, may be counted for a French or Spanish major or minor. </P>

<P>No more than one major or minor credit may be transferred from an approved program. To be accepted, such courses must be comparable in quality and scope to courses offered at Colgate. Students who hope to transfer a credit from an approved program must provide the department chair with documentation about the course for approval prior to enrolling in that program, and may be asked to present their work to the chair for evaluation upon return. </P>

<P>Theater predates recorded history and remains a vital mode of artistic expression in the modern world. The Department of Theater educates students in the interdisciplinary practice of theater through required courses in acting, directing, stagecraft, and stage design, as well as elective courses in playwriting, screenwriting, and dance. Students also study theater as a social and cultural institution through courses in theater history and dramatic literature. Each semester, the department mounts a major production in the University Theater, directed either by a member of the theater faculty or a distinguished guest artist. Theater courses and University Theater productions are open not only to theater majors and minors but to all students on campus. </P>

<P>Theater students at Colgate learn by doing in the intellectually and physically rigorous environment of studio courses, rehearsals, and public performances. The curriculum transcends the artificial split of mind and body, encouraging students to develop skills in both logic and intuition that apply to any field of endeavor. A major or minor in theater fosters students' ability to read closely, think critically, and communicate clearly -- not only through speech and writing, but also through embodied presence. Students of theater are trained to integrate analytical, physical, emotional, and interpersonal intelligence in a way that few other courses of study demand. </P>

<P>By making and studying theater, Colgate students act out a variety of perspectives on the world, learning to problem solve and self-start through immersion in the challenges of the creative process. Students have opportunities both to lead and to collaborate. Graduates regularly pursue successful careers not only in theater but also in communications, media, business, law, and technology. Students interested in majoring or minoring in theater should discuss their plans with an adviser, and consider courses in music, art and art history, film and media studies, English, foreign languages and cultures to complement their theater education. </P>

<H2>Awards </H2>

<P>The Howard W. and Anne T. Pike Memorial Prize —awarded annually to a graduating senior for outstanding achievement and contribution to the University Theater program. </P>

<P>Advanced Placement </P>

<P>The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>Because transferred courses must conform in content and rigor to Colgate's curriculum, students intending to take a course in theater at another institution must meet with the department chair before enrolling in a course at another institution. Transfer credit for a theater course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The department chair grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300- or 400-level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>Seniors with an average GPA of 3.5 or above in courses counted toward the Theater major may apply to pursue an honors project. The application process for honors will be discussed in THEA 495 - Senior Seminar in Theater. Proposals for honors projects should build on the student's previous work in the Theater major. Proposals are normally due in October and must be approved by the Theater faculty. </P>

<P>Students pursuing an honors project are enrolled in THEA 496 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates in Theater, during the spring term of their senior year. This course will ordinarily take the form of an independent study with the supervisor of the student's honors project. THEA 496 must be taken in addition to THEA 495 and to the minimum number of courses required for the Theater major. Students must complete their honors projects by a date specified by the Department of Theater. If the Theater faculty approves a completed project for honors, the student receives a grade in THEA 496. If a student withdraws from the program, or if the final project is not approved for honors, THEA 496 is converted to THEA 491 - Independent Study, and a grade is assigned by the student's faculty supervisor. Students are awarded high honors on the basis of the quality of their chosen artistic project, thesis, and the oral presentation. </P>

<P>Students with further questions should contact the chair of the Department of Theater. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Preparation for Graduate Study </H2>

<P>Students interested in graduate study should consult with their advisers and the department chair early in their programs to be advised about preparation for advanced work. The department also designates special advisers to meet with students interested in graduate work, and informational meetings are held to help juniors and seniors plan their applications for fellowships and graduate admission. </P>

<P>Director E. Nolen </P>

<P>Students may consider a natural science topical major if they wish to focus their studies in disciplinary or interdisciplinary areas not encompassed by approved majors. Students may complete a topical major in marine science — freshwater science or develop their own topical major. Requirements for the marine science — freshwater science topical major appear below under Natural Science. </P>

<P>Students pursing an individualized major must first discuss a possible program of study with an appropriate academic adviser, and then provide the division director with the proposed program and a rationale for this program no later than the student’s fifth term at Colgate. </P>

<P>The major comprises at least 10 courses that closely relate to a common theme and are complementary. Normally, eight courses must be major courses in departments within the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Five or more of these courses must be at the 300 or 400 level, and at least one must be a non-independent study, 400-level course in a science department. An overall GPA of at least 2.00 is required for the courses chosen to meet major requirements. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Major Requirements </H3>

<P>Students who receive Colgate credit, either through advanced placement or through transfer credit, for any courses that would normally count toward the major are allowed to apply that credit toward the major. </P>

<P>Students who place into a higher-level course without receiving credit for the introductory course will be required to take another course in order to bring the total number of courses taken in the major to thirteen. The alternative course need not be in the same department as the one exempted, but it must be at the 200, 300, or 400 level. CHEM 101 and CHEM 102 may be replaced by CHEM 111 without requiring an additional course. </P>

<P>The major consists of thirteen courses divided among the three subjects (chemistry, math, and physics) as follows: </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Required Courses </H3>

<P>Because these eight courses are pre-requisites for the additional courses below, it is recommended that students try to complete these by the end of the sophomore year. </P>

<P>A major in biology is the traditional undergraduate preparation for students planning to pursue career interests in the biological or health-related sciences. Although the majority of majors ultimately pursue careers in the life sciences, a significant number of individuals with other career interests choose the major within the liberal arts context. The department's majors are found today in positions of responsibility in many fields outside the life sciences, including business, theology, law, and the performing arts. Biology majors who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching should refer to Educational Studies. </P>

<P>Students expecting to attend graduate or professional schools are reminded that these schools frequently recommend or require calculus, statistics, computer science, chemistry (typically through organic), and a year of physics as cognates to the biology major. </P>

<P>For more information about the department, honors/high honors, transfer credit, etc., visit the biology department page. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Requirements </H3>

<P>Students must complete for credit a minimum of nine courses in the department, plus CHEM 101-CHEM 102 (or CHEM 111). It is strongly recommended that chemistry requirements be taken in the first year, concurrently with beginning biology courses. A biology major can begin the program either by taking a topic-based course (BIOL 101-BIOL 102) or by enrolling in one of the two 180-level courses required for the major (see below). </P>

<P>All majors are required to take BIOL 181 - Evolution, Ecology, and Diversity; and BIOL 182 - Molecules, Cells, and Genes. BIOL 182 is generally taken during the second semester of the first year or during the sophomore year because it requires CHEM 101. Students must complete BIOL 181 and BIOL 182 and their credit-bearing laboratory components with a minimum grade of C– to proceed with major requirements. </P>

<P>All majors must also take at least one process-oriented course numbered BIOL 201–BIOL 206 and the accompanying lab. These courses immerse students in the process by which biologists ask questions and communicate new information, and completing any one such course serves as a gateway to all courses numbered 330 or higher within the major. The 200-level course requirement is typically completed in the sophomore year. Normally, these 200-level courses require completion of both BIOL 181 and BIOL 182. </P>

<P>Students are also required to complete a one-credit research experience. Normally, this will be satisfied with a research tutorial (a course numbered BIOL 470-490). Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the Colgate Study Group (BIOL 393 and BIOL 493) may also be used to satisfy this requirement. With prior approval by the biology department, a senior-level independent study course or capstone experience in another department may be used to fulfill the research requirement. </P>

<P>The remainder of the nine biology courses required for the major can be selected from any of the elective courses offered in the department (excluding BIOL 291, BIOL 391, and BIOL 491); at least four of these courses must be at the 300 level or above, and two of those must have a required lab component. No more than four courses at the 100 or 200 level may count toward the nine courses required for the major. Only one course numbered BIOL 470 or higher can be counted toward the nine courses. The elective courses are found listed as biology 300- and 400-level courses; GEOL 215 also serves as an elective biology course. </P>

<P>Biology majors are strongly encouraged to attend biology seminars that are held approximately biweekly each semester. Students enrolled in biology courses numbered 470 or higher are expected to attend all biology seminars during the term of enrollment. </P>

</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>Transfer students generally receive credit for satisfactorily completed chemistry courses taken at other colleges that correspond to courses at Colgate. The department considers such transfer credits individually, and students should provide information about the courses (syllabi, catalogue statements, lab notebooks, textbooks, etc.) to the department chair for consideration. These arrangements should be made well before beginning classes at Colgate. </P>

<P>Matriculated Colgate students may receive credit for chemistry courses taken at other colleges/universities. Summer courses must meet several criteria established by the department concerning the course content, the length of the course, and the number and length of class and laboratory meetings. Students considering transferring credit to Colgate for a summer chemistry course should obtain a copy of the department's criteria for an acceptable course, discuss the course with the department chair, and receive approval before taking the summer course. Final acceptance of the transfer credit is contingent upon satisfactory performance on an equivalency exam; the department administers this exam prior to the drop/add period for the fall term immediately following the summer course. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Other International Exam Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>Transfer credit and/or placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., International Baccalaureate, Abitur) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. </P>

<P>Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes and the machines that carry out these processes. Computer science is a mix of theory, application, design, and experiment. Theory addresses questions about the nature and limits of computation, the abstract properties of machine models, the complexity of algorithms, and the formalization of programming languages. Applications include machine and systems design, the design and implementation of programming languages, artificial intelligence, networks, graphics, and simulation. An important aspect of computer science is the development of methods for the systematic design of large systems in hardware and software. Both applications and theoretical issues must be tested experimentally. </P>

<P>The computer science major prepares students either for graduate study in computer science or for a variety of professional careers. The computer science minor and the major in computer science/mathematics prepare students for professions in which computer science overlaps significantly with another discipline. COSC 100, COSC 140, and COSC 150 provide opportunities for non-majors to learn about computer applications in the liberal arts and to survey, at an introductory level, some topics in computer science. </P>

<P>Geology is the study of the Earth through time, from its surface environments to its deep interior. It is a multidisciplinary science that explores the physical and chemical nature of the Earth, the evolution and impact of life on our planet, and how global processes operate both now and in the past. Geology focuses on the scientific study of Earth materials, such as minerals, rocks, and fossils, as well as Earth-observing data derived from satellites, geophysical instruments, and models. The geosciences explain how past and present-day ecosystems and environments have been and are continuing to be shaped by plate tectonics, volcanism, mountain building, climate change, evolution, and human activity through time. </P>

<P>Introductory courses are designed to contribute significantly to a liberal arts education and an understanding of Earth and the environment. Advanced courses are more focused and provide the highest possible level of general and pre-professional training for majors. </P>

<P>Majors in geology or environmental geology provide students with the opportunity to pursue careers in the geological and environmental sciences, business, and education, as well as government and public service. Upon graduation, many geology majors attend graduate school in geology, hydrology, oceanography, environmental sciences, and environmental policy and law. Other graduates go directly into a wide spectrum of employment situations, including business, environmental consulting, teaching, administration in schools and museums, and mineral resources and petroleum-related jobs. </P>

<P>Students considering attending graduate school in geology should note that graduate schools expect applicants to have supplemented their undergraduate geology majors with a year each of introductory calculus, chemistry, and physics or biology. The geology department encourages all majors to take these courses; they are required for honors in geology. Students interested in paleontology are encouraged to take BIOL 304 in addition to, or in place of, one of the 300–level electives. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Teacher Certification </H2>

<P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for majors in geology who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching. Please refer to Educational Studies. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Awards </H2>

<P>The Award for Excellence in Geology — awarded annually by the department to the student who best demonstrates a combination of excellence in the classroom and creativity and perseverance in research. </P>

<P>The Robert M. Linsley Prize for Excellence in Geology — awarded mid-way through the junior year to a rising senior who has demonstrated the promise and potential for leadership and excellence in earth science scholarship and research. The prize is to be given by consensus of the geology department faculty to a student who plans to pursue earth sciences as a career, with preference given to a student with an interest in paleontology, historical geology, and stratigraphy/sedimentation. In selecting the awardee, emphasis is to be placed on a balance of leadership, research, and communication/teaching interests, in Bob's spirit. </P>

<P>The Norma Vergo Prize in Geology — established as an award to a geology major who, as determined by the faculty of the geology department, significantly contributes to the spirit of excellence among fellow students in the department. </P>

<P>The Kevin Williams '10 Endowed Memorial Fellowship Award — established in 2012 in memory of Kevin Williams '10 to provide stipend support for one or more geology and/or geography majors to study abroad. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Advanced Placement </H2>

<P>The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. Placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., A–Levels, International Baccalaureate) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors </H2>

<P>All geology and environmental geology majors are encouraged to consider the advantages and challenges of undertaking honors in geology. A GPA of 3.20 or higher in the four core courses (GEOL 201, GEOL 215, GEOL 225, and GEOL 235), plus the two required 400-level courses are required for a student to become eligible for honors. In addition, at least six full-credit courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics must be taken to become eligible for honors. GEOG 245 can be taken in place of one of these six courses. </P>

<P>In addition, honors candidates must complete a year-long senior thesis, which represents the culmination of a research project that typically begins during the summer before the senior year and continues during the fall and spring terms of the senior year. The written thesis must be completed and orally defended by the end of the spring semester. Following the defense, and with the recommendation of the thesis committee, the geology faculty will vote to award honors. Awarding the distinction of honors is based primarily on the quality of the written thesis but will also include an overall assessment of the student's academic record. Students who may be eligible for honors will be notified in the spring of the junior year by their academic adviser.  </P>

<P>There are many good reasons to study mathematics: preparation for a career, use in another field, or the beauty of the subject itself. Students at Colgate who major in mathematics go on to careers in medicine, law, or business administration as well as areas of industry and education having an orientation in science. Non-majors often require mathematical skills to carry on work in other disciplines, and all students can use the study of mathematics to assist them in forming habits of precise expression, in developing their ability to reason logically, and in learning how to deal with abstract concepts. There are also many people who view mathematics as an art form, to be studied for its own intrinsic beauty. </P>

<P>All mathematics courses are open to qualified students. Entering first-year students who have successfully completed at least three years of secondary school mathematics, including trigonometry, should be adequately prepared for MATH 161. Students who have studied calculus in secondary school are typically ready to enter MATH 162 or MATH 163. </P>

<P>Students who are planning to undertake graduate study in mathematics are advised to take MATH 485 and MATH 487. </P>

<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>For a student to be considered for honors in Mathematics or in Applied Mathematics the student must achieve a 3.3 GPA in the respective major; in order for the student to be considered for high honors, a 3.7 GPA in the major is required. For both honors and high honors, completion of a course numbered 440 or above that is not a research seminar is required. </P>

<P>Honors / High Honors are attained by a student's production and defense of a thesis of distinction. A grade of A- or better is required to be considered for honors. A grade of A or better is required to be considered for high honors. The student's thesis adviser puts forward the thesis for honors consideration. Evaluation of a thesis under consideration is undertaken by a committee appointed by the department. The committee includes the thesis adviser, and the grade awarded requires unanimous agreement of its members. Joint theses are allowed but will not normally be considered for honors. Exceptions may be made with departmental permission. </P>

<H2>Mathematical Systems Biology Minor </H2>

<P>Ingram (Chair of the Department of Biology) Valente (Chair of the Department of Mathematics) </P>

<P>Mathematical systems biology describes a field of inquiry in which mathematical and computational methods are used to examine complex, large scale interactions between components of biological systems and to predict how these interactions influence the properties of those systems. The systems examined may range in scale from molecular through cellular and tissue levels to the scale of organisms and entire ecosystems. The unifying feature of this field is quantitative description of interactions between components of biological systems. </P>

<P>The interface between mathematics and biology is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of research in the sciences. The technological development of methods for generating large amounts of biological data — including genome sequence information, total protein analysis, metabolic information, etc. — demands the development of mathematical and computational methods for analyzing these data and for developing predictive models that use such large data sets. The multidisciplinary field of systems biology requires an understanding of both mathematical and biological concepts, insights into interesting questions in biology, and comprehension of the mathematical methods that can be used to address many of those questions. The mathematical systems biology minor provides students with the coursework in mathematics and biology required to begin to gain insights and experience in this important new field. </P>

<P>A student should select a major in the Department of Physics and Astronomy if he or she is interested in fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the nature of the universe, or in practical questions of engineering, applied physics, or space science. To be successful, a student should also enjoy mathematics and quantitative reasoning. More than half of the graduating seniors in this department go to graduate school in various disciplines, and many earn PhDs in physics, astronomy, and engineering. Approximately 25 percent enter technical careers directly after graduation. The others pursue careers in teaching, business (often technology-based), management, medicine, and other areas. </P>

<P>The department offers several courses of general interest, not intended for majors. These courses are ASTR 101 - Solar System Astronomy; ASTR 102 - Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe; ASTR 230 - Astronomy in Culture; PHYS 105 - Mechanical Physics I; and PHYS 111 - Fundamental Physics I, PHYS 112 - Fundamental Physics II. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>To be Eligible to Graduate </H2>

<P>To be eligible to graduate with a major in any of the programs of this department, a student is expected to achieve a grade of C– or better in each of the courses offered in the department that are required for the major. There are no exceptions to this policy. Additionally, a student's cumulative GPA for all courses counted toward the major must be at least 2.00. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>

Placement out of PHYS 232 or PHYS 233 based on high school courses (including AP) is not normally possible. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors </H2>

<P>To qualify for graduation with honors, physics and astronomy-physics students must be invited by the department chair, in consultation with department faculty, to do an honors thesis. Normally, this invitation is extended only after exceptional performance in the capstone course PHYS 410.  </P>

<P>The following are also required: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>The completion (with a grade of C- or better) of at least two additional 300- or 400-level physics or astronomy courses beyond the minimum needed for the major. PHYS 334, PHYS 336, PHYS 391, PHYS 491, ASTR 312, ASTR 391, and ASTR 491 do not count towards this requirement. With the permission of the chair, a 300- or 400-level course in another NASC department may substitute for one of these courses. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>A cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 in all 300- and 400-level classes taken to satisfy the upper-level course requirements for the major and for honors. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>The completion, defense, and public presentation of an honors thesis. This thesis, to be evaluated by department faculty and an external reviewer, is normally a significant extension of the work completed in PHYS 410. Students normally enroll in PHYS 491 or ASTR 491 during the spring semester of their senior year to complete the work. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The department faculty will subsequently determine whether to award honors or high honors. Neither is guaranteed. High honors will be given only for truly extraordinary work. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>Transfer of credit for physics and astronomy courses from other colleges or universities requires approval by the department. In particular, summer courses taken with the expectation of transfer credit must be preapproved by the department well in advance of enrollment. Students should be aware that few institutions offer summer equivalents for major-sequence courses other than PHYS 232 and PHYS 233, and also that a grade of C or higher is required to transfer coursework for Colgate credit. After matriculation, no more than 2 transferred course credits may count towards the physics or astronomy-physics major. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Pre-requisites and Minimum Grade Requirements </H2>

<P>Prerequisite and minimum grade requirements will be strictly enforced for both majors and non-majors. Students who have not taken PHYS 131, and students who have received less than a C- in the lecture portion of PHYS 131, may take PHYS 232 with the PHYS 232 instructor's permission. Otherwise, students will not be permitted to take any department course that has prerequisites before achieving a grade of C- or better in the lecture portion of each prerequisite.  Exceptions will be made to this policy only in extraordinary circumstances. </P>

<P>International Exam Transfer Credit </P>

<P>Transfer credit and/or placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., A-Levels, International Baccalaureate) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. </P>

<H2>Pre-Engineering Studies </H2>

<P>The department offers two ways to prepare for engineering: major in physics at Colgate and after graduation go to graduate school in engineering, or use one of the combined plans available in the department. To allow a student to combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University and Washington University. A student may spend three years at Colgate and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan) to earn bachelor's degrees from both institutions. The student may be eligible to continue study for a Master of Science (MS) degree, which can sometimes be completed in as little as one additional year after earning the bachelor's degree in engineering. Eligibility for the MS program is determined by the engineering school. </P>

<P>It is imperative for students interested in the 3-2 plan to begin the physics and math curriculum in the fall term of the first year. To be eligible for the 3-2 plan, a student must complete all physics major courses through PHYS 336 and PHYS 431 (or PHYS 451), plus one other upper-level physics course to be chosen in consultation with the pre-engineering adviser. </P>

<P>Prerequisites for admission to engineering schools vary among schools and fields of study; therefore, it is necessary to indicate an interest in pre-engineering to the physics faculty as soon as possible. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Preparation for Graduate School </H2>

<P>Students intending to pursue graduate studies in physics, astronomy, or engineering should discuss their plans with their major advisers as early as possible. Students who wish to prepare for graduate studies in physics or astronomy should complete PHYS 431, PHYS 432, PHYS 433 and PHYS 434. To enrich the program, a student should choose additional physics and astronomy electives at the 300 and 400 levels. Advanced courses in other science departments, especially mathematics, are also encouraged. </P>

<Sect>
<H2>Teacher Certification </H2>

<P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for majors in physics who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching. Please refer to Educational Studies. </P>

<P>Astrogeophysics Major </P>

<P>Director Levine </P>

<P>The astrogeophysics major is a multidisciplinary program for students interested in the study of the solar system and planetary matter. Drawing on astronomical observations, physical models, chemical constraints, and geological interpretations, students consider the Earth in its planetary context, the processes that have shaped Earth and other planets through time, and our place in the Universe. Students learn to appreciate or participate in the ongoing discovery of planets throughout the galaxy, and to reflect critically on their similarities with and differences from our own world. Astrogeophysics majors develop intellectual tools from across the physical sciences to reason qualitatively and quantitatively about global issues, such as the accelerating pace of global change and planetary habitability. Interested students should consult the program director as early as possible to plan an appropriate sequence of courses, since many of the required courses have prerequisites. </P>

<P>The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (PBS) offers two areas of concentration, Psychological Science and Neuroscience. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Psychological Science </H2>

<P>The core of psychological science is the study of human and animal behavior. As a discipline, it is dedicated to identifying and understanding basic and complex processes including sensation and perception, learning and memory, thought and language, motivation and emotion, development, personality, psychopathology, and social interaction. These processes are examined from a variety of levels of analysis; from the genetic and neuronal, to physiological and cognitive systems, and to whole organism responses and group interactions. By its very nature, psychological science has relevance to a wide range of practical, human problems. </P>

<P>Psychological science offers two introductory courses: PSYC 109, a topics course designed for non-majors, and PSYC 150 - Introduction to Psychological Science. For entry into the major, students must pass PSYC 150 and PSYC 200 with a C– or better. Students not meeting these expectations must consult with the department chair and petition the department to request entry into the major. </P>

<P>The department offers a wide range of courses covering topical areas in the field as well as basic (PSYC 200) and advanced research methods (PSYC 498/PSYC 499). In consultation with their departmental advisers, majors are encouraged to select a variety of 200- and 300-level courses in order to acquire breadth of exposure to the broad content and methodologies comprising psychological science. All majors, especially those planning graduate study in psychology, are urged to take more courses in the department than minimally required for the major. </P>

<P>The basic objective of the Department of Economics is the development of students' understanding of economics as the social science that deals with production, consumption, and market exchange activities. All students begin with ECON 151 - Introduction to Economics. Majors advance through a core of analytical courses and choose among a series of options in theoretical and applied economics. Students with an interest in graduate work leading to careers in such fields as economics, law, business, public administration, or the foreign service are asked to discuss these objectives early in their college careers in order to plan an adequate program in economics. While not an undergraduate business or professional school, the department provides essential background for a variety of career interests. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Course Information </H2>

<P>ECON 151 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered above 200. ECON 251 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered between 300 and 349. ECON 251 and ECON 252 are prerequisites for all courses numbered between 350 and 374. ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 375 are prerequisites for all courses above 375. </P>

<P>Courses numbered below ECON 150, including ECON 105, cannot be counted as part of the major program. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Preparation for Graduate School </H2>

<P>For students considering graduate school in business administration, at least two courses in mathematics (preferably MATH 161 and MATH 162) and one computer science course (such as COSC 101) are strongly recommended. Students considering graduate school in economics are strongly encouraged to take these courses, as well as additional courses in mathematics, including MATH 214 and MATH 377. Students with these interests should also consider the mathematical economics major described here and consult with their academic adviser as early as possible. Students considering graduate work in economics leading to a PhD should consider pursuing a double major in economics and mathematics. </P>

<P>The Marshall-Keynes Award for Excellence in Economics — awarded by the department to the senior with the strongest, sustained performance in analytical economics and on the basis of the comprehensive examination. </P>

<P>The J. Melbourne Shortliffe Prizes — established in honor of the late J. Melbourne Shortliffe, chair of the economics department emeritus, and awarded to outstanding graduating seniors who have majored in economics. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credits </H2>

<P>A score of 4 or 5 on both the microeconomics and macroeconomics AP exams will exempt incoming students from ECON 151; no credit is given if only one AP exam is taken or if a score of 3 or lower is received on either exam. No transfer credit is given for ECON 105 - Principles of Accounting. Except for students transferring from another college or university, no transfer credit will be given for ECON 251, ECON 252, or ECON 375, and no more than two courses in economics taken elsewhere can be accepted for major credit. These courses must be comparable to what is offered in a liberal arts economics program. </P>

<P>Students who hope to transfer course credit must consult with the department prior to enrolling elsewhere. Students returning from summer courses or study groups are not entitled to retroactively seek major credit in the department. Students participating in a Colgate approved program are only eligible for major credit when attending programs on the departmental approved list: up to two courses taken on a departmentally approved program may be transferred towards the major and one course may be transferred towards the minor. No major or minor credit is granted for courses taken while participating in an approved program that is not on the economics department list, and no minor credit is given for any other courses, including summer courses. </P>

<P>All transfer courses must have a minimum prerequisite that is equivalent to Colgate's ECON 151 course and the department recommends taking courses that have ECON 251 and/or ECON 252 as prerequisites. Students who transfer to Colgate from other institutions may be granted more than two course credits toward the major at the discretion of the department chair. </P>

<P>Associate Professors Palmer, Stern (Chair) Assistant Professors Bonet, Ríos-Rojas, Taylor, Woolley Visiting Assistant Professors Mitchell, Sanya Senior Lecturer Gardner </P>

<P>The Department of Educational Studies offers two distinct undergraduate programs: (1) a major or minor in educational studies and (2) a preparation program for students intending to teach at either the elementary or secondary level. The department also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program for students preparing to teach at the secondary level. </P>

<P>Given these programs, the department offers a comprehensive study of formal and informal educational institutions and practices, and the ways they are affected by social forces. Interdisciplinary by design, classes draw on diverse methods of inquiry to analyze critically the historical and contemporary ways that people educate and are educated in the United States and societies across the globe. Theory, research, and practice work together to help students become more informed as consumers and producers of knowledge in a variety of educational contexts. Students learn to ask questions about the relationships between knowledge, power, and identity in educational contexts, and to reimagine education and its contribution to a democratic society. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Study Groups </H2>

<P>The South Korea Study Group is a joint program between Educational Studies and Asian Studies. The program offers a dynamic experience for any Colgate University student due in part to its efforts to become a leader in the newly forming globalized world in which we live. South Korea is highly regarded for its rapid modernization, yet the people still hold to its traditional ways in mind and spirit. While the focus is on students' development of educational studies theory and practice from a global perspective, they also gain a fascinating sociocultural experience. </P>

<P>Students enroll in four courses. The Director provides two courses for the students, one of which provides an opportunity to design a research project with a fieldwork component. Students then take two courses from the host university, Yonsei University. Yonsei offers a variety of courses in English. One course must be on the topic of Korea or East Asia. Prerequisites normally include EDUC 101 and at least one course in Asian Studies. </P>

<P>The Philadelphia Study Group offers students who are interested in a wide range of questions in and around education, urban studies, public policy, and social justice a full semester of coursework and experience in one of the most historically iconic and dynamic cities in the world. Lauded as &quot;the birthplace of American democracy,&quot; Philadelphia will be the backdrop through which the program will critically engage in an exploration of contemporary education policy and its relationship to material questions about the changing spatial and demographic topographies of American cities and theoretical questions about changing relationship between the public and the state. In close conversations with students, teachers, families, and community members, this program will provide an experimental platform to gain a more robust understanding about the issues surrounding contemporary education and urban policy and the community-based struggles that have emerged in response. </P>

<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>Students majoring in educational studies will have the option to apply for the EDUC 460 Honors Seminar, which will be offered during the spring term of their senior year. GPA is only one factor in the application, but generally students with an overall GPA of 3.30 and a departmental GPA of 3.50 will be considered for graduation with honors in educational studies. A departmental GPA of 3.70 and overall GPA of 3.30 will be considered for graduation with high honors. </P>

<P>All majors will be notified at the beginning of the fall semester of their senior year of the honors application procedures. The application deadline will normally be in late November and includes current transcripts, letter of recommendation, and a full proposal of the honors project to be conducted in the Honors Seminar. </P>

<P>Students will need to work closely with a department faculty member, ideally the faculty member leading EDUC 450 Senior Seminar Capstone in the fall semester, prior to submitting the proposal. Seniors will normally develop their honors project proposal during the fall term while enrolled in EDUC 450. </P>

<P>Department faculty will review all proposals and will notify students of their standing prior to the end of the fall semester. Once admitted, students will typically enroll in the Honors Seminar during the spring term of their senior year. The student will work with the Honors Seminar professor and one additional faculty adviser assigned by the department to complete and defend the honors project. </P>

<P>Students are required to defend their thesis. The defense will normally take place during the last week of classes in the spring semester. This involves a formal presentation of the thesis. The entire department of educational studies faculty will attend the defense and provide input to the Honors Seminar professor and the faculty adviser.  </P>

<P>The designation of 'honors,&quot; &quot;high honors,&quot; or &quot;neither&quot; will be determined by the Honors Seminar professor and the faculty adviser. </P>

<P>An honors project must bring something new into the world—it must teach us something or consider a particular question in a new light. In order to do this well, students will need to clearly articulate what the field of Educational Studies is and how their project is situated within our modes of inquiry/knowledge production. In order to take on an honors project, students will need to be interested in the topic in a way that they experience passionately, as well as intellectually.   </P>

<H2>The Teacher Preparation Program </H2>

<P>Director Gardner The preparation of teachers is an all-university responsibility, generally directed by the Department of Educational Studies. The program encompasses liberal studies in education as well as studies and experiences designed to develop teaching effectiveness and professional leadership. The emphasis is on developing the student's ability to relate knowledge and theory to skillful teaching in the interest of promoting greater social justice and environmental sustainability. Colgate's undergraduate adolescence and childhood certification programs and the MAT adolescence programs are accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC) for a period of seven years from May 7, 2014 until May 7, 2021. </P>

<P>There are three ways to become a certified school teacher through the Teacher Preparation Program at Colgate. The first is the undergraduate teacher education program, which can be completed in the four-year undergraduate period and certifies successful candidates in childhood education (grades 1–6). The second is the undergraduate teacher education program, which can be completed in the four-year undergraduate period and certifies successful candidates in secondary education (grades 7–12). And the third is through Colgate's MAT program. The MAT program certifies only at the secondary education level. </P>

<P>Successful completion of all requirements in all certification programs leads to recommendation for New York State initial teacher certification. </P>

<P>Students interested in pursuing teacher certification in New York State are strongly encouraged to have taken EDUC 101, one of the Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning classes and one of The Nature of Childhood Education and Development  courses prior to the end of their sophomore year. </P>

<P>Students who wish to enter the program should submit an application to the director of teacher preparation as soon as possible. An overall Colgate GPA of at least 2.50 is required at the time of application. Application materials include a letter of intention by the student and a letter of recommendation by a Colgate faculty member. Acceptance into a teacher certification program does not guarantee acceptance into the student-teaching semester. </P>

<P>Students are tentatively approved for student teaching in the spring of their junior year. Final approval depends on successful completion of all prerequisite courses in their program by the end of the spring term. A decision is made by the department to approve a candidate for student teaching based on previous academic performance at Colgate as well as the apparent suitability of the candidate for the teaching profession. The student must also submit to the program a letter of recommendation written by an individual who has observed the student in some teaching/learning capacity in a school setting. In general, the following GPA requirements will apply: for the secondary teaching programs, students should maintain a </P>

<P>3.00 GPA in education courses, 3.00 in the teaching field, and 3.00 overall; for the elementary teaching program, students will be expected to have a 3.00 GPA in education courses and a 3.00 overall. </P>

<P>Candidates for teacher certification in New York must pass competency examinations prepared by the State Education Department. (For comparative data from Colgate and other teacher education programs within New York State see www.highered.nysed.gov) Initial certification is available to U.S. citizens and to non-citizens who have completed a letter of intent to become a U.S. citizen. Teacher certification students are required to spend a minimum of 100 hours in a variety of field experiences related to coursework prior to student teaching. Please note that completing certification requirements is not the same as majoring in educational studies. </P>

<P>Students who wish to gain New York State teacher certification have the option of completing their professional semester in the fall term following graduation as part of the ninth semester program. To be eligible for this special program, students must have received their Colgate degree in the academic year prior to the professional semester and completed all other certification prerequisites prior to enrolling in the ninth semester. In the ninth semester, students are allowed to enroll only in the professional semester courses, which consist of two or three seminars (depending upon adolescence or childhood certification) and student teaching. Students admitted into the ninth semester program will be charged a small administrative fee (currently waived), must meet the usual requirements for enrollment at Colgate (such as proof of health insurance), and are responsible for locating their own off-campus housing. Students interested in the ninth semester program should meet with an educational studies faculty member to determine if they are eligible and apply to the program in the spring of their senior year. </P>

<H2>Childhood Teacher Certification </H2>

<P>Director Gardner </P>

<P>The elementary certification program is currently offered at the undergraduate level only. The program leads to New York State teacher certification in grades 1–6. It combines program of study with both liberal arts and educational coursework. Students are required to obtain 96 liberal arts credits out of a total of 128 in order to be eligible for state certification. </P>

<P>Students should begin the certification program as early as possible in their academic career at Colgate. Students are required to apply to the teacher preparation program with a suggested deadline of November 1 of their sophomore year. Students will complete student teaching during the fall term of their senior year or in an extended ninth-semester. This professional semester includes two teaching methodology seminars, and an advanced course on the diagnosis and remediation of reading problems. </P>

<H2>Secondary Education Teacher Certification </H2>

<P>Director Gardner </P>

<P>The secondary education certification program is offered at the undergraduate and MAT levels. In both the MAT and undergraduate programs, certification is available in English, history, mathematics, chemistry, biology, earth science, and physics; however, certification in chemistry, biology, and physics is more easily completed in the MAT program. The program combines a major in one of these chosen academic fields with courses in educational theory and practice. Students who complete the program will have a strong background in teacher education and a New York State approved major from a department on campus. </P>

<P>Students should begin the certification program as early as possible, but no later than the beginning of their sophomore year. Students must formally apply to the program by November 1 of their sophomore year, and it is strongly recommended that they apply during their first year at Colgate. Students must reserve the fall term of their senior year for student teaching, teaching seminars, and an advanced course on the diagnosis and remediation of reading problems. </P>

<P>Geography bridges perspectives in the social and natural sciences to study people and the environment. In addition to deepening knowledge of biophysical and social change processes in their own right, diverse methodological approaches uncover the relationships between humans and natural and social environments. </P>

<P>Students use integrative explanatory frameworks to grapple with critical areas of inquiry: the geopolitics of conflict, climate science, biogeographies of endangered species, public health, urban planning, disaster mitigation, international development, environmental and social justice, and natural resource management, among them. </P>

<P>Two 100-level courses--GEOG 105 Climate and Society and GEOG 107 Is the Planet Doomed? - introduce prospective majors and other interested students to the perspectives of the discipline. Two courses required for majors - GEOG 211 Geographies of Nature, Economy, Society and GEOG 231 Geography of the Physical Environment - cover major geographical themes regarding human society and the biophysical environment. </P>

<P>Exposed to the full spectrum of disciplinary subfields — physical, human, and nature-society geography as well as geographical techniques — the major provides a good foundation for graduate work or future employment in both the private and public sectors.

In such cases, the geography faculty will determine whether the completed honors project is of sufficient quality to warrant such an award. Eligible seniors who wish to pursue honors must follow the guidelines for honors in geography. If approved for preliminary honors work, students will register for GEOG 490, a half-credit course in preparation for honors work, during the fall semester. If given final approval for honors work, students will register for GEOG 499, during the spring term. At the end of the spring term, candidates for honors will make oral presentations of their completed honors projects to the members of the department. The decision to award honors will be made by the department in consultation with the faculty advisers based on the quality of the honors project, oral defense, and other evidence of distinction. </P>

<P>Today the study of human history is critical to global survival; the experiences of others serve as guides to present and future conduct. At the same time, exposure to rigorous historical method and clear narrative style develops conceptual skills, research competence, writing fluency, and sensitivity to the uses and abuses of language and historical knowledge. The history department curriculum includes courses on African, Asian, Caribbean, European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and North American subjects, and on contact and interaction among these societies. Majors are encouraged to take courses in related departments and programs. Competence in at least one foreign language is also desirable. </P>

<P>For those interested in world affairs, Colgate offers a major program in international relations (IR). Students may also take IR as a minor. Study in the program begins with POSC 232, which is normally taken in the sophomore year. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors </H2>

<P>A candidate for honors in IR must choose an adviser for an honors paper and fulfill the honors requirements for the department of the faculty adviser. In addition, the honors student must (1) achieve a minimum GPA of </P>

<P>3.50 in the nine IR courses, (2) attain a minimum overall GPA of 3.25, (3) submit a substantial research paper that is judged superior (A– or higher) by two program faculty members. </P>

<P>A student whose adviser is a member of the Department of Political Science must enroll in the year-long honors colloquium (POSC 498 and POSC 499) in which each student writes an honors thesis. POSC 498 will be taken in the fall semester, followed by POSC 499 in the spring semester. A grade will be given in both POSC 498 and POSC 499. Seniors who anticipate graduating with a GPA eligible for honors should speak with their advisers or the IR director in the semester prior to doing honors. POSC 498 and POSC 499 are to be taken in addition to the nine courses counted toward the IR major. </P>

<P>A candidate for high honors in IR must fulfill the following additional requirements: (1) achieve a minimum GPA of 3.60 in IR courses, (2) attain an overall GPA of at least 3.40, (3) gain approval of the paper as superior by a third reader, and (4) pass with distinction an oral examination by the three readers of the submitted paper. As above, the professor supervising the research must give prior approval of the paper. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Study Groups </H2>

<P>Students are encouraged but not required to participate in off-campus study. The IR program cosponsors a study group in Geneva that typically runs once per year. On the Geneva study group, students receive one core subfield credit for POSC 357, and two elective credits: one for an internship course and the other for a course taken at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. IR majors who are pursuing French to complete their foreign language requirement can receive credit at the 100 or 200 level for an intensive course taken at the beginning of the Geneva study group. See Off-Campus Study for more information. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credits </H2>

<P>Students participating in off-campus approved programs can seek transfer credits to satisfy certain IR major and minor requirements—most commonly language courses, IR electives, or History electives. Students wishing to receive the upper-level Economics credit must seek additional approval from Colgate's economics department. In very rare circumstances students may receive credit for a core subfield class. POSC 232 - Fundamentals of International Relations (IR) and the IR seminar must be taken on campus. </P>

<P>Students should seek preapproval for any off-campus courses from the IR director, who will evaluate individual courses with respect to their rigor and substantive appropriateness. Courses whose subject matter is not international cannot receive IR credit; courses with reading and/or writing assignments below Colgate standards can only receive credit on a two-for-one basis—i.e., two off-campus courses count for one IR credit. This two-for-one formula applies to most courses taken on non-Colgate programs. </P>

<P>The department's program is designed to provide students with an understanding and appreciation of politics in the broadest sense and to introduce them to the skills needed for research and analysis. The curriculum includes courses in the principal fields of the discipline, including American and comparative government and politics, international relations, and political theory. Through coursework and independent study projects, students confront some of the enduring questions of politics while studying political institutions, processes, behavior, and theory. Internships in Washington on the D.C. study group combine rigorous analysis of politics and government with direct exposure to Congress, the national executive, political parties, interest groups, think tanks, and media. Similarly, study and internships in Geneva, Switzerland, on the department's other study group, provide students with the opportunity to travel widely in Europe and to become immersed in the world of international organizations. The honors colloquium, in addition, offers students the opportunity to conduct significant research under the supervision of a faculty member. Students who major in political science are likely to be well prepared for future careers or graduate study in such fields as law, public service, international affairs, business management, teaching, journalism, and many others. </P>

<H2>Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>The department will accept for major credit a maximum of two political science courses taken at other institutions. Only one transfer credit will be accepted toward the minor. These courses must have been approved for transfer credit by the Colgate registrar and by the member of the Department of Political Science designated to evaluate them. In all instances, courses accepted for major or minor credit must be comparable in quality, quantity of reading and writing, and scope of coverage to courses offered in the department. Transfer credits will not ordinarily be offered for POSC 100-level courses or POSC 232. Students who anticipate applying for major or minor credit for a course or courses to be taken at another institution should consult with the faculty member evaluating them before enrolling elsewhere. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>Students with outstanding records in political science may pursue honors. To qualify, a student must have, at graduation, an overall GPA of 3.40 and a departmental GPA of 3.50 in the eleven or more courses taken to satisfy the major requirement for honors. A student must enroll in the year-long honors colloquium (POSC 498 and POSC 499). Major credit and grades used in determining departmental GPA will be awarded for both courses. Each student in the fall while enrolled in POSC 498 will complete an in-depth written literature review of his or her subject of interest; then, in the spring while enrolled in POSC 499, students will write a lengthy thesis. Each course is graded separately, but enrollment in POSC 499 is contingent on the successful completion of POSC 498, and the recommendation of the seminar director and the student's primary adviser. Although these courses are designed for and required of those hoping to stand for honors or high honors at graduation, neither is restricted to them; rising seniors with a strong interest in some area of political science and a proven academic record of accomplishment who would like to explore further a chosen area of research in a collaborative environment should also consider enrolling. It is critically important that juniors interested in doing an honors thesis in their senior year, speak both with their advisers and members of the faculty conducting research in an area of common interest while searching for a primary adviser to guide their independent research during their senior year. </P>

<P>All students who have successfully completed the honors sequence will be eligible for honors or high honors. Whether a student receives honors or high honors ultimately depends upon the outcome of their thesis research. To be awarded honors, a thesis must be judged superior both by the faculty member guiding the student's research and the seminar director of POSC 499. A thesis judged by these readers to be potentially worthy of high honors will, with the agreement of the student, be submitted to a third reader. An oral defense will then be scheduled at which time the student is examined both on the content of the thesis and his or her knowledge of the general field of inquiry. The three readers then make the final decision as to whether the student will receive high honors at graduation. </P>

<H2>Geneva, Switzerland </H2>

<P>The Geneva Study Group, conducted in the fall and/or spring terms of each year, provides a rewarding opportunity for a highly select group of Colgate students to study the workings of international organizations, the politics of the European Union and of Western European nations, and other related matters while living and traveling in the heart of Western Europe. Intensive language and cultural immersion in a French homestay, and internship opportunities working in international and non-governmental organizations are important parts of the program. </P>

<P>At least one college-level French course is a prerequisite. Study group directors may specify other prerequisites, but as a general rule students are required to take POSC 232 prior to the start of the program. Students are also strongly encouraged to take at least one other political science or history course in the politics, culture, history, international relations, or economies of Europe. </P>

<H3>Recommendations for Majors and Other Students </H3>

<P>Those interested in studying political science may begin at any course level but are likely to find it most convenient to start with those at the 100 or 200 levels. In consultation with their faculty advisers, students should plan course sequences that fulfill major requirements while allowing them, if so desired, to develop particular interests in some depth while still gaining a well-rounded grounding in the discipline. All majors are encouraged, as well, to take electives in other closely allied social sciences. </P>

<P>The 100-level courses are designed for students likely to major in other fields of study as well as those considering a major or minor in political science. The 200-level courses are intended to serve as gateway courses to the major as well as to particular subfields. Both the 100- and 200-level courses, then, serve as general introductions providing a broad foundation in the discipline and are particularly suitable for first - and second - year students. The 300- and 400-level courses are, in most instances, somewhat more demanding and less general than lower-level courses and allow students to explore a specific topic in greater depth. These courses are generally directed, but not limited, to the needs of juniors and seniors. Majors and others interested in one particular area of the discipline, for example in international relations, can take up to seven courses, seminars, or independent studies in that area of interest, especially in classes at the 300 and 400 level. </P>

<H3>Minor Requirements </H3>

<P>Normally, no more than one independent study course, transfer credit, or political science course taken while participating in a Colgate off-campus study group (except those study groups sponsored by the Department of Political Science) is accepted for credit toward a minor. Requests for exceptions must be approved in advance by the faculty member designated to authorize transfer credits. </P>

<P>No course with a grade below C will count as credit for the minor. </P>

<P>A student may not count courses toward a political science minor, which are being counted toward a major in international relations. </P>

<P>The requirements for a minor in political science are as follows: </P>

<P>The minor consists of five political science courses. Of these five courses, two must be at the 100 or 200 level and three must be at the 300 or 400 level.

<P>Sociology and anthropology study human cultures and societies, past and present, on a comparative basis. These disciplines are concerned with analyzing and understanding the social structures and values that shape our lives, as well as the institutions and social forces of our own and other societies. The major in sociology or anthropology provides an excellent preparation for graduate study and a variety of careers, including law, education, business, public administration, journalism, health, counseling, and social work. Sociology and anthropology graduates also pursue careers in local, national, and international non-profit organizations. The department offers two majors, an Anthropology Major and a Sociology Major. </P>

<P>Anthropology </P>

<P>Majors may qualify for honors in anthropology by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.50 in all departmental courses and an overall GPA of 3.30, or for high honors by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.70 in all departmental courses and an overall GPA of 3.30, and submitting a thesis judged by department faculty to be worthy of honors or high honors. </P>

<P>Any student in the junior year who believes he or she will reach the qualifying GPA is strongly encouraged to discuss potential honors or high honors projects with departmental faculty. All seniors will normally enroll in ANTH 452 Senior Seminar in Anthropology in the fall of their senior year and begin work on a thesis of their own design. Those students pursuing honors or high honors will continue to develop their seminar theses by enrolling in ANTH 495 - Independent Study for Honors and High Honors, in the spring semester (if a substantial number of students are pursuing honors and high honors in a given year, the group may be organized into a formal honors seminar). Working with the seminar professor and at least one other faculty member, the student shall write and defend an extended project before department faculty at a special event at the end of spring semester. Honors and high honors projects should demonstrate the ability to work creatively and independently and to synthesize theoretical, methodological, and substantive materials. Note: </P>

<P>ANTH 495 is an additional requirement for students pursuing honors and high honors and cannot be counted as one of the electives required for the major. </P>

<P>Any student who believes he or she will reach the qualifying GPA is invited to apply for honors or high honors in the spring term of his or her junior year. If accepted, students enroll in SOCI 494 - Honors and High Honors Seminar, in fall of the senior year and SOCI 495 - Honors and High Honors Thesis Workshop, in spring of the senior year. The student, working with the seminar professor and at least one additional adviser, shall write and defend an extended project proposal in the fall and complete a substantial research paper during the spring semester and present it in a special department event. The designation &quot;honors,&quot; &quot;high honors,&quot; or neither, will be determined at the conclusion of the semester by the departmental faculty. Honors and high honors projects should demonstrate the ability to work creatively and independently and to synthesize theoretical, methodological, and substantive materials. Note: Students accepted to take SOCI 494 in the fall term are expected to also enroll in SOCI 495 during the spring term to complete their theses, regardless of whether the student ultimately achieves honors. SOCI 495 is an additional requirement for students pursuing honors or high honors and does not count as an elective toward the sociology major. </P>

<H2>Off-Campus Study </H2>

<P>Students are strongly encouraged to expand the scope of their academic experiences by studying off campus. SOAN faculty help guide each student toward the off-campus study experiences that complement and build on his or her overall course plan; we encourage students not to think of off-campus study as a semester-long break from Colgate but rather as a way to enhance on-campus course work. Students often use off-campus study as a way to collect data for use in senior seminar and honors projects. Since Anthropology majors are required to complete a fieldwork component as part of their coursework, off-campus study can often be a rewarding and useful way to fulfill this requirement. More information on off-campus study can be found on the Sociology and Anthropology web page. </P>

The collections of African art, Canadian First Nations art, Iroquois archaeological materials from central New York, and the central Mexican (Guerrero) stone sculptures are extensive. </P>

<P>Students may take advantage of the resources of the museum in a variety of ways. ANTH 253 - Field Methods and Interpretation in Archaeology (MC, GR, FR) and ANTH 300 - Museum Studies in Native American Cultures (MC, GR, FR) offer students the opportunity to become acquainted with the museum holdings and to carry out research projects on selected collections of artifacts. Students may also arrange independent studies working with the museum collections and receive credit in either the Department of Sociology and Anthropology or in the Native American Studies Program, which is sponsored by the Division of University Studies. Students are encouraged to inquire at the offices of the curators of the Longyear Museum of Anthropology concerning independent studies projects in cultural anthropology or archaeology, as well as for information concerning museum internship programs and opportunities in museum studies and summer programs in archaeological or ethnographic fieldwork. </P>

<H2>Anthropology Major </H2>

<P>Anthropology is the study of human beings in all their complexity. The scope of anthropology is truly global, as it aims to describe and analyze the full diversity of the human experience and cultural creativity across time and space. Anthropology recognizes that human beings are, simultaneously, social actors who create cultures and the products of those cultures. Using a broad array of research methods, including participant-observation and archaeological excavation, anthropologists investigate the historical composition of societies, their transformations, and their contemporary forms. We seek to understand the commonalities and differences in the identities, experiences, discourses, and beliefs of people around the world. We connect the details of people's everyday lives to large-scale social systems and cultural forces and reveal that seemingly innate or natural differences among human groups are the result of historical, social, and political-economic processes. The curriculum integrates classroom and out-of-classroom learning, encouraging students to pursue off-campus study and independent fieldwork or research with collections. </P>

<P>Sociology is the scientific study of the organization and functioning of societies, their major institutions, groups, and values. Sociologists are particularly interested in understanding and explaining social issues and problems, and the sources of stress and change in contemporary and historical societies. Our courses provide students with critical perspectives on a wide range of major social issues, including globalization, immigration, social stratification and inequality, race and ethnic relations, gender and sexuality, age, aging, and ageism, unemployment, crime and deviance, conflict and war, environmental politics, social movements, popular culture, and media and politics. In addition, students take courses on classical and contemporary sociological theory, research design, and qualitative and quantitative research methods.

<P>The Africana and Latin American Studies (ALST) Program is an interdisciplinary program that studies the histories and cultures, both material and expressive, of the peoples of Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America, and of African Americans in the United States. It draws heavily from several disciplines in the arts and humanities (art, language, literature, music) and the social sciences (anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology), as well as educational studies, philosophy, psychology, religion, and writing and rhetoric. The program offers a major and a minor with four different emphasis: African, African American, Caribbean, and Latin American studies. United by a shared historical connection within the Atlantic world, Africans, African Americans (US), Latin Americans, and the peoples of the Caribbean provide rich opportunities for interdisciplinary and comparative studies. The program offers students the opportunity to study one particular group of people in relation to others in the wider Atlantic world. It examines the indigenous civilizations of these regions and studies the impact of migration, imperialism and colonialism, racism, nationalism, and globalization in shaping the lives, ideas, and cultural identities of their inhabitants. </P>

<P>The major in Africana and Latin American studies consists of nine courses. Students concentrate in African studies, African American studies, Caribbean studies, or Latin America studies. Each emphasis has a required introductory course, and all students are also required to take at least one approved course within the program from outside their own emphasis. </P>

<P>Substitution of other appropriate or equivalent courses, independent studies, or special study groups for the requirements for each concentration may be possible, but must be approved by the Africana and Latin American Studies Program director. Transfer courses, field study, and one-time-only courses by visiting professors can be credited toward the major or minor only with approval of the program director. A minimum average GPA of 2.00 in the courses chosen to count toward the major or minor in Africana and Latin American studies is required for graduation. </P>

<P>Majors in the Africana and Latin American Studies Program may not pursue a minor in the program. In the case of a double major, no more than two courses from the department or program of the second major may be counted for the ALST major, with the approval of the ALST director or respective coordinator. The relationship between students and the coordinator of each concentration is a vital one, and it is imperative that each major and minor meet with the appropriate coordinator at least once a semester to assess progress toward meeting graduation requirements. </P>

<P>As with the major, the minor in Africana and Latin American studies allows the student to concentrate in African studies, African American studies, Caribbean studies, or Latin American studies. It consists of six courses, no more than one of which may also be counted toward a student's major. </P>

<P>More than one Core Communities and Identities course may be counted toward the major or minor, but only one Core course used to meet Liberal Arts Core Curriculum requirements may also be counted toward the major or minor. </P>

<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>Majors may graduate with honors or high honors in Africana and Latin American studies. Qualifications for honors include, at graduation, a minimum overall average of 3.00, a major average of 3.30, and a successful defense before a designated faculty committee of an honors paper or project prepared under the direction of a member of the Africana and Latin American studies faculty. The committee that evaluates the final paper will be identified by the program director in consultation with the student and the student's faculty adviser. Prospective honors students should notify the appropriate coordinators of their intentions by the first week of October of the senior year. A student with a double major in Africana and Latin American studies and a second field may apply for honors in both areas by submitting and defending a paper in each. The paper topics may be related, but the focus and/or content of the two papers must differ substantially. Beyond the requirements for honors, high honors requires a major average of 3.7. High honors projects are usually begun in the fall of the senior year. Students who expect to qualify for honors or high honors should register for ALST 499. </P>

<H2>Study Groups and Field Projects </H2>

<P>Study Groups Periodically, the Africana and Latin American Studies Program has sponsored study groups in Africa, Latin America, or the Caribbean under the direction of faculty members associated with the program. Decisions on the awarding of credits are set prior to the consolidation of each study group. See Off-Campus Study for further information about an interdisciplinary study group in Jamaica. </P>

<P>Additionally, the Africana and Latin American Studies Program supports extended study groups to South Africa (ALST 380). For more information, see Extended Study. </P>

<P>Model African Union Project The Africana and Latin American Studies Program participates in the Model African Union, held each spring at Howard University, Washington, D.C. Highlights of the trip include visits to the embassies of the African countries the Colgate team is representing, as well as engaging in debate with student representatives from over thirty colleges and universities across the country. The program is offered as a half-credit course, ALST 290. </P>

<H2>African American &amp; Latin American Studies Major, African American Studies Emphasis </H2>

<P>Coordinator Simmons </P>

<P>The African American experience in the United States has been the result of a complex history spanning almost four hundred years centered on enslavement, racial violence, segregation, and discrimination. This concentration not only focuses on African Americans' resistance to those manifest injustices, but it also examines their significant contributions to the economy, society, and culture of the United States, as well as their achievements in politics, education, art, science, and in the economy. Some of the major themes studied are slavery and abolition; the politics of race and racism; black leadership, the civil rights movement, and the continuing struggle for social justice; as well as social and cultural phenomena like the Harlem Renaissance and the rise of a black middle class. </P>

<P>A student must complete major declaration procedures with the appropriate coordinator no later than the second term of the sophomore year, unless an exception is approved by the program director. </P>

<P>Coordinator Baptiste </P>

<P>The Caribbean forms an important historical and cultural bridge between Africa and Afro-America, and was the birthplace of European settlement and colonization in the Americas. Better known in the United States as a tourist destination, the region has a rich but tragic history intimately connected with Euro-American imperialism and plantation slavery. Nevertheless, by bringing together people of widely diverse ethnicities from all over the world, the plantations became a virtual laboratory of socio-cultural engineering to produce some of the earliest and most complex multiracial societies. In conjunction with a study group that spends a semester at the University of the West Indies, ALST majors within the Caribbean concentration are exposed to a diverse range of issues relating to race relations, cultural identity, political governance, and economic development that are embedded in the history, literature, politics, and economies of the territories of the region. </P>

<P>A student must complete major declaration procedures with the appropriate coordinator no later than the second term of the sophomore year, unless an exception is approved by the program director. </P>

<P>Asia holds a unique and vital place within the globalizing world of the early 21st century. Home to an extraordinary range of linguistic and ethnic groups, this broad and dynamic region is rich in cultural and environmental diversity. Engaging the many changes taking place in Asian societies today requires a similarly diverse set of intellectual skills. To this end, the Asian Studies Program at Colgate integrates scholarly approaches spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences: from literature, art, and religion to history, politics, economics, and geography.

<H2>Honors and High Honors in Asian Studies </H2>

<P>Asian studies majors who have GPAs of 3.30 or better in the major and an overall GPA of 3.00 are encouraged to pursue honors study. A candidate for high honors must have a GPA of 3.70 in the major and an overall GPA of 3.00. Each eligible student undertakes a project, the form of which — a written research paper, an exhibition, a performance — is decided in consultation with the student's honors adviser. To qualify for honors, the project must be judged by a committee of two faculty members to be of at least A quality. For high honors the project must be so judged by three faculty members from at least two different departments, and in addition the candidate must pass with distinction an oral examination conducted by the three-member committee. Often, the project for honors or high honors is begun on a study group, or during the junior year or fall semester of the senior year, in any 300- or 400-level course or any independent study course. The project is continued through the spring term in ASIA 499 - Special Studies for Honors. </P>

<H3>Major Requirements </H3>

<P>Nine courses are required for the major, of which four courses must be at the 300 or 400 level. </P>

<P>The introductory course may count toward the five courses focused on a single subregion of Asia. Three other courses should be chosen from the list of Governed Electives (below) and may address any region of Asia. Other courses may also serve as electives for this major if they are at the 300 or 400 level and if at least 40 percent of the course and of the student's work concerns Asia. Students must gain approval from the director of Asian Studies prior to taking these courses for them to count toward the major. </P>

<P>Majors are strongly encouraged to acquire proficiency in one or more Asian languages, although no more than three language courses at any level may count toward the nine courses required for the major. Normally, the nine courses will include courses from at least two of these three divisions: arts and humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics. </P>

<P>Students completing two majors (i.e. double-majors) may only count two courses toward both of those majors. </P>

<P>Colgate's Environmental Studies Program helps students to understand the complexity of environmental issues and to underscore the consequences and impacts of the human experience on the environment. Students in environmental studies learn to think, speak, and write clearly and articulately about environmental issues from a variety of perspectives. The environmental studies curriculum combines interdisciplinary breadth with depth in a chosen field of study. </P>

<P>The Environmental Studies Program is an interdisciplinary program located within the Division of University Studies and staffed by faculty from a number of departments who apply their knowledge and expertise to teaching and research endeavors that cross disciplinary boundaries. The program administers five majors: environmental studies plus four departmentally affiliated majors including environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology. All five majors include a common set of courses that ensures a common interdisciplinary experience. Each student achieves depth in analytical ability by taking a specified set of courses, usually in a particular discipline, chosen in consultation with her or his adviser. To fulfill environmental studies graduation requirements, students must possess a minimum overall GPA of at least 2.00 in all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>Environmental studies majors wishing to pursue honors should consult with the environmental studies program director and a research sponsor no later than the spring of their junior year. Honors may be awarded to students majoring in environmental studies who accumulate a GPA of 3.30 in courses counted toward the major, and complete a semester-long independent research project under faculty guidance during enrollment in ENST 491 - Independent Study. Students pursuing honors will submit a proposal developed in consultation with an ENST-affiliated faculty member who will serve as research sponsor. The proposal describing the project will be submitted to the environmental studies steering committee in the fall semester of their senior year for approval. The research project should reflect the student's area of focus but must also demonstrate the understanding gained using an interdisciplinary perspective and approach. The Director of the program will normally serve as second reader to the honors project. Alternatively, the director and research sponsor may designate up to three faculty members to evaluate the merit of the work and report to the environmental studies steering committee. Students standing for honors will deliver an oral presentation to faculty and students of the program, and produce a report in a format most appropriate to the project. The environmental studies steering committee and the research sponsor must determine whether the oral presentation and report are of high quality and worthy of honors in the program. Students demonstrating exceptional commitment to research and meeting all the requirements for honors may be awarded high honors if the overall quality of their work is deemed to be outstanding by the environmental studies steering committee and research sponsor. </P>

<P>To qualify for graduation with honors or high honors in environmental biology, environmental economics, or environmental geography, students must take ENST 490 - Seminar in Environmental Studies and also meet the requirements for honors or high honors in the biology, economics, or geography major (depending on the area of specialization). The major GPA is calculated from all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. </P>

<P>Honors and High Honors for Environmental Geology </P>

<P>To be eligible for honors in environmental geology, students must complete the following requirements in addition to the environmental geology major: (1) Complete ENST 490 - Seminar in Environmental Studies, </P>

<P>(2) take four full-credit courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or biology, (3) complete a year-long senior thesis as described in the honors section of the geology major, and (4) achieve a minimum average GPA of 3.0 in the three 200-level core courses and 400-level capstone course. If additional courses are taken in these categories, the highest grades will be used to compute this GPA. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H2>Transfer Credit </H2>

<P>A maximum of two course credits transferred from other institutions may be applied toward the environmental studies major. One course credit transferred from another institution may be applied toward the environmental studies minor. If the requirement for Focus in a Particular Field of Study is waived because of a second major or minor, transfer credits contributing to the second major or minor do not count toward this maximum. Approved courses taken as part of Colgate sponsored study groups, such as the Australia study group affiliated with the Environmental Studies Program, are not considered transfer credits and do not count toward the maximum. In many cases, courses that might be applied toward the environmental studies major or minor will be approved for university credit by another department on campus. For example, an environmental economics course would be reviewed for credit by the economics department. Once approved for university credit, the course must be approved by the director of environmental studies for credit toward the major or minor. In some cases, a course might be approved for university credit as an environmental studies (ENST) course. Students must supply the director with a course description and syllabus to apply for transfer credit in these cases. Limits on the transfer of courses toward environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology majors are determined by the biology, economics, geography, and geology departments, respectively, and are available in the affiliated department section in this chapter. </P>

<P>The film and media studies program engages students in a critical study of film and other media. Through the study of history and theory, formal analysis, and production experiences, the program examines how film and media serve as powerful determinants of ideology, identity, and historical consciousness. Courses offered in a range of departments and programs constitute the major and minor, reflecting the fact that cinema and media-based research cuts across disciplines. </P>

<P>It has been said that the mass media collectively represent the most important and widely shared context for the receipt of information and ideas in our contemporary experience. Courses in Film and Media Studies question the consequences of our passive consumption of mass media as both entertainment and information. Students learn the history and theory of film and media, analytical approaches and strategies; they also come to understand the various ways in which film and media are produced, circulated, and consumed locally, nationally, and globally. </P>

<P>The film and media studies curriculum encompasses history, theory, and practice, with the goal of developing in students the critical skills necessary to analyze representation and experience as they are constructed by new and emerging visual technologies, and to put theoretical and historical knowledge into practice through media production courses and exercises. </P>

<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

<P>The award of honors in film and media studies is dependent on faculty evaluation of work done in the FMST 400 independent research project and the student's GPA. </P>

<P> Independent Research Project: Every major undertakes a senior project (FMST 400) in the fall of the senior year. Upon completion, the project may be nominated for honors. If nominated, the project is prepared by the senior for a public presentation. Following that presentation, faculty decide whether the project is worthy of honors. Honors will be conferred only on work of outstanding quality, while high honors will be awarded only to exceptional work of highest distinction. </P>

<P> GPA Requirements: Film and media studies majors who have a GPA of 3.30 or better in the major and 3.00 overall will be considered for Honors. Film and media studies majors who have a GPA of </P>

<P>3.70 or better in the major and 3.00 overall will be considered for High Honors. </P>

<P>The affiliated minor in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer studies (LGBT) examines the lives and representations of individuals and groups considered sexual minorities, as well as the various forces that have affected them across cultures and throughout time. Sexuality offers a critical lens to analyze communities, cultures, and subcultures; institutions, discourses, and literatures; economic and political movements; the social construction of power, status, and hierarchies; and identity categories configured on the basis of age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. Moreover, sexuality is considered as the subject of biological, medical, and psychological research. LGBT studies is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary minor that emphasizes the application of new theories and methodologies (e.g., queer, feminist, critical race, and multicultural theories) to established disciplines as it promotes the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields. Through the minor, students gain critical understandings of normative categorization, query unspoken assumptions, examine social stratification and distributions of power, and explore the diversity of forms that sexuality has taken historically and in contemporary contexts. </P>

<P>This academic minor focuses on the rigorous study of language from the perspectives of several contributing disciplines: the study of a specific language or language group in its contemporary condition or historical development; classical philology; philosophy; psychology and neuroscience; acoustic analysis; computer science. Students pursuing a minor in linguistics will encounter a wide variety of methodologies: careful data collection and classification, rigorous philosophical analysis, sociological surveys, psychological experiments, ethnographic and ethnolinguistic methodologies, and the writing of computer programs to analyze and interpret language data. The themes addressed by the linguistics minor include the sounds of language; word structure and etymology; styles and dialects; syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of language; language acquisition by children and adults; language in society; language and culture, historical development and language families; language and mind; language and the brain; language processing by computer; psychological perspectives on language. </P>

<P>Linguistics minors will give a presentation in the last semester of their senior year showing how their study of linguistics has informed their understanding of the world and the academic disciplines they have studied.

<P>The Medieval and Renaissance studies (MARS) minor enables students to explore the richness and variety of civilization from the late Roman era through the Renaissance and Reformation. Broadly interdisciplinary, it is intended as a supplement to traditional majors. Spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences, MARS covers history, art, literature, music, philosophy, science, and religion from the 4th to the 17th centuries. </P>

<P>Chronological parameters define the Middle Ages as beginning with the rise of Christianity in the 4th-century Roman Empire. The Renaissance encompasses the humanism of 15th-century Italy, the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, and its aftermath in the 17th-century Counter-Reformation. Because of the difficulty of assigning absolute chronological limits to these diverse periods, some courses necessarily include material that crosses these boundaries; moreover, the emphasis in MARS is on creating interdisciplinary bridges across the curriculum, and the program is structured in a way that encourages students to explore a cross section of traditional fields. To this end, MARS courses can center on a topic area proposed by the student and agreed upon in consultation with a faculty adviser. However, courses in the minor should complement each other. </P>

<P>Students may elect to minor in either the medieval or Renaissance period or in a combination of both. In order to declare a minor, prospective students must write a statement of purpose (at least one page), explaining how the choice of courses in their minor will coalesce. This should normally be submitted to the program director by the spring term of the junior year. In order to take full advantage of course offerings and advising, students are urged to enroll in the program as early as possible in their undergraduate career. </P>

<P>The minor consists of at least five courses selected with the approval of an adviser belonging to the MARS faculty. Courses should be selected from the list below and must include a course in history. At least three different disciplines should be represented. French, Italian, and Spanish are considered to be separate areas of study. Additional courses (notably topical seminars) may be accepted upon petition. It is the responsibility of the student to recognize that certain courses might require departmental prerequisites for which he or she would not necessarily receive credit toward the MARS minor. Only one independent study course and only one non-Colgate course will be counted toward the minor. Courses that are appropriate for the MARS minor are sometimes offered as part of the university's Venice study group program. </P>

<P>At least three courses should be at the intermediate level and at least one should be at the 400 (seminar) level — either an existing seminar or an independent research paper. Senior seminars and honors thesis courses in any department could provide a place for the student's capstone experience. </P>

<P>One year's study of Latin at Colgate is recognized as one course toward the minor. While there is no mandated language requirement, it is strongly recommended that students considering graduate school in a medieval or Renaissance field should study Latin at least through the intermediate level. Students are encouraged to explore early literature in Old and Middle English, as well as early period courses in the foreign language departments. </P>

<P>Professor Frank (Director), Monk Senior Lecturer Abdal-Ghaffar Visiting Assistant Professor Rogers Visiting Lecturer El Saeid Ahmed </P>

<P>Advisory Committee Abdal-Ghaffar, Kaimal, Khan, Monk, Mundy, Murshid, Rutherford, Spadola </P>

<P>This program focuses on the Middle East and North Africa while also studying the wider Islamic world. It provides students with an understanding of the origins and development of the Islamic faith in its heartland, as well as an awareness of the multi-cultural and dynamic character of modern Islam. It also trains students in the history, culture, politics, and political economy of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world. </P>

<P>The area encompassed by this program extends from Morocco to the Philippines. It contains an extraordinary variety of linguistic and ethnic groups such as Arabs, Iranians, Turkic peoples, Kurds, Baluchis, Malays, and others. This region is home to over 1.4 billion Muslims, who constitute more than one-fifth of the world's population. It is the source of a rich religious and intellectual tradition that emerged from the same roots as the Western tradition and evolved over a long history of interaction with the West. It also plays an important role in global peace, security, and prosperity. These demographic, cultural, and strategic considerations will lead to a steady increase in contact between the Islamic world and the United States in the future. The Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Program (MIST) program equips Colgate students with the knowledge and conceptual tools needed to understand and manage this relationship. </P>

<P>The themes addressed by the program include the history and development of the Islamic faith; colonialism and its impact on the cultures, economies, and polities of the region; the rise of nationalism and its relationship to tribal, religious, and ethnic identities; the emergence and impact of political Islam; the Arab-Israeli conflict; the prospects for democratization; and United States foreign policy toward the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world. </P>

<P>The Native American Studies Program offers students the opportunity to undertake a comparative study of the pre-Columbian, colonial, and contemporary cultures of North and Latin America. The required and elective courses are drawn from a wide range of disciplines, representing the various topical and regional interests of Colgate faculty whose specializations include archaeology, art, cultural anthropology, education, ethnomusicology, geography, history, law, literature, and religion. Themes and topics of the major include the integrity, richness, and complexity of Native cultures; the reciprocal impact of contact between Native and non-Native populations in the Western Hemisphere; modes and processes of culture change; cultural disruption, resistance, and vitality; social movements; indigenous ways of knowing; and an understanding of the variety of methodological and theoretical approaches to Native American Studies, including comparisons with other indigenous cultures. A major in Native American Studies provides an excellent foundation for graduate education in the disciplines mentioned, as well as professional work in areas such as contract archaeology, environmental and cultural resource management, government services, non-governmental and non-profit organizations, law, museums, public health, and teaching. </P>

<P>Since its creation in 1970, Colgate's Peace and Conflict Studies Program has been at the forefront of research and instruction in this interdisciplinary field. Founded with a generous gift of the Cooley family, the program presents a challenging course of study that integrates trans-disciplinary academic approaches to war and peace with research into specific regional conflicts and their aftermaths. The curriculum offers students a range of opportunities to explore the complex impacts of violence, the challenges of human security, and human rights issues in global perspective. With its regular film and media series, symposia, lectures, and unique electives, the program is actively involved in promoting the study of peace, conflict, and security at Colgate and beyond. After taking advantage of the distinctive combination of faculty and program resources at Colgate, peace and conflict studies majors have pursued successful careers in various international arenas, including law, government, development, journalism, academe, and the private sector. </P>

Working with a principal adviser and a second reader, the student writes and submits a substantial paper for this course and defends it before the program faculty. The designation &quot;honors,&quot; &quot;high honors,&quot; or neither, is determined at the conclusion of the defense. This paper must be a substantially different, revised, and expanded version of the student's senior seminar paper. Honors and high honors projects should demonstrate the ability to work creatively and independently and to synthesize theoretical, methodological, and substantive materials in peace and conflict studies. Such a project should be planned and begun in the fall term of the senior year (or earlier), with the research and final writing completed in the spring term when the student is enrolled in PCON 499. Majors seeking to qualify for high honors in peace and conflict studies are required to demonstrate competency in a foreign language equivalent to two semesters at the 200 level. A student pursuing a double major and enrolling in the honors seminar may petition to have two courses count for both majors. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Major Requirements </H3>

<P>The major consists of 11 courses and encompasses four clusters: </P>

<P>Cluster 1 – Core Approaches serves as a foundation for the program, introducing students to critical perspectives on the study of peace and conflict. In order to declare a peace and conflict studies major, students must have already completed either PCON 111, PCON 218, or PCON 225 with a grade of C or better. </P>

<P>Cluster 2 – students develop substantive knowledge of issues and methodologies in this interdisciplinary field. </P>

<P>Cluster 3 – students choose a geographic region to study in depth, in order to broaden their knowledge of specific regional conflicts. </P>

<P>Cluster 4 – each student develops a thesis that integrates the knowledge gained in Cluster 1–3. </P>

<P>Major credit will be awarded for no more than two courses taken at another institution, and no more than one independent study course in the program. </P>

<P>A student pursuing a double major or a major and minor may use one course to count for both. </P>

<P>Cluster 1 – Core Approaches </P>

<P>Students are strongly encouraged to take all three core approaches courses during their first and sophomore years. They may be taken concurrently or in any order. PCON 111 and at least one of the other two courses should be taken before students take courses from Cluster 2. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Three Required Courses </H4>

<P> PCON 111 - Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies PCON 218/ANTH 218 - Practices of Peace and Conflict - War in Lived Experience  PCON 225 - Theories of Peace and Conflict: War, State, and Society </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3>Cluster 2 – Topical Areas of Specialization </H3>

<P>To intensify their knowledge of issues and current debates in peace and conflict studies, students take four: Cluster 2 electives  </P>

<P>Such courses develop substantive knowledge of issues in this interdisciplinary field, while at the same time exposing students to a range of methodologies for studying them, frameworks developed to understand them, and critical approaches to theorizing them. Courses in this section deal with war, armed conflict, and genocide, transnational and human security issues, the lived experience of collective violence, and human rights and structural violence in broadly interdisciplinary ways. A student pursuing a double major with another department or program may use one Cluster 2 elective to count for both majors. At least two of these courses must be at or above the 300 level. </P>

<P>Cluster 3 – Geographic Areas of Specialization </P>

<P>Knowledge of specific regional conflicts, and efforts to resolve them, is essential to the study of peace and conflict. To develop this knowledge base, students are required to take three approved courses on the politics, culture, history, geography, or economics of a geographic region chosen from the following: </P>

<P>A. Central America, the Caribbean, and South America </P>

<P>B. North America </P>

<P>C. West, East, Central, and Southern and Sub-Saharan Africa </P>

<P>D. Europe </P>

<P>E. The Middle East and North Africa </P>

<P>F. Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia </P>

<P>G. Asia and the Pacific Rim </P>

<P>H. Transregional Communities Students may take Cluster 3 electives concurrently with Cluster 1 and 2. A student pursuing a double major in peace and conflict studies and an area studies department or program should discuss with the program director which courses may be used to satisfy the requirements for both majors. Other courses, including Liberal Arts Core Curriculum courses, off-campus studies courses, and 300- or 400-level language courses, may count toward the geographic areas requirement, if approved by the program director. Many courses can count for Cluster 3 for each of the regions listed. Students should consult their PCON adviser about specific courses across the curriculum and off campus which may satisfy this requirement. Approved study abroad programs will normally provide two course credits towards this part of the major. The &quot;Transregional Communities&quot; designation applies to a course of study on issues such as displacement, forced migration, or refugee and diaspora communities. </P>

<P>Cluster 4 – Thesis </P>

<P>To complete the thesis requirement, students must enroll in PCON 479 in the fall semester of the senior year. In order to advance to thesis, students must have completed all of the Cluster 1 requirements, taken three of the four courses required for Cluster 2, and two of the three courses required for Cluster 3. Theses developed during the research seminar may be on any topic, but students must demonstrably integrate expertise in their topical and regional areas of specialization in their final submissions. </P>

<P>Russian and Eurasian studies (REST) is a multifaceted discipline that aims to give students an understanding of the history, politics, environment, and culture of Russian, East European and Eurasian places, along with proficiency in the Russian language. Students can choose among courses in literary and cultural studies, art history, anthropology, history, geography, Jewish studies, environmental studies, and political science, taking advantage of Colgate's unusual array of specialists in these diverse areas. Prospective majors, and those with an interest in Russian language, should begin REST 121 as soon as possible. The major requires a minimum of two years of language. Students who continue into advanced Russian are encouraged to spend a semester in Russia on one of Colgate's approved programs. Courses throughout the curriculum are interdisciplinary and culminate in a senior seminar in which majors pursue a thesis or advanced research topics in a collaborative environment. Many of our students choose to combine Russian and Eurasian studies with a second major or minor in history, political science, international relations and other fields. Recent graduates have found work in government, journalism, law, NGOs, education, finance, and many other fields; some have gone to the Peace Corps, and a significant number have pursued graduate study. </P>

<P>The Women's Studies Program is built on the understanding that gender is a crucial category of human knowledge and action. Women's studies recognizes the complexity of human lives as gender interconnects with sexuality, race, class, ability, nationality, ethnicity, religion, and age in the constitution of experience and identities. It thus seeks to provide insights which lead one beyond older and more exclusionary theories and practices. </P>

<P>The program is at its core interdisciplinary, integrating knowledge from different disciplines to encourage critical engagement with all forms of experience from a feminist standpoint. Interdisciplinary study leads students to question frameworks, concepts, and methods, enabling them to understand better both the past and the contemporary world, while envisioning a future beyond traditional roles and inequities. By emphasizing interdisciplinarity, the program seeks to help students acquire the tools to analyze critically the societal, cultural, global, and personal issues that shape their lives and challenge them to look at these issues from multiple perspectives. It also encourages them to reflect on the ways in which knowledge is produced within different and oftentimes unrecognized systems of oppression, and to examine categories that are presented as natural and permanent in their cultural and historical context. Finally, the program strives to help students acquire the skills of critical analysis and imagine alternatives that challenge the naturalizing of inequalities. </P>

<P>Consonant with the goal of promoting new theoretical frameworks, the related and emerging field of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer studies provides the basis for an independent minor affiliated with the Women's Studies Program. </P>

<H2>Honors and High Honors </H2>

Honors in women's studies may be awarded to majors who have a GPA of at least 3.30 in all women's studies courses, who have completed an approved women's studies honors project, and whose projects have been approved by faculty sponsors and by the women's studies director. High honors in women's studies may be awarded to successful honors candidates who have been invited to present the results of their written projects in oral form to the women's studies faculty. A committee of faculty will vote on granting high honors for exceptionally strong intersectional projects that engage feminist theory and communicate across disciplines. </P>

<P>A central part of the liberal arts tradition, rhetoric is the art of effective language use in written, oral, and visual communication. With roots in ancient Greece and branches in the most recent media technologies, rhetoric is simultaneously one of the oldest and newest academic disciplines, fundamentally engaged by dynamic relationships between language, power, and public culture. </P>

<P>As a discipline, rhetoric demonstrates how discourse generates knowledge, mediates power, and enacts social change; as an art, rhetoric enables the speaker/writer to invent arguments by making logical, ethical, and emotional appeals to an audience. The department offers courses in writing, public address, and the history and theory of rhetoric and language. </P>

<P>Courses in writing and rhetoric position students to become critical language users, preparing them to be effective communicators both in their future careers and in civic society, in the US and abroad. </P>

<H2>Writing and Rhetoric Minor </H2>

<P>The minor is designed to enhance students' ability to think and write critically as they explore the connections between the theory and practice of rhetoric. Students in the minor demonstrate proficiency at crafting a suitable message as they deepen their understanding of rhetoric as an art and as a disciplinary subject of study. A minor in writing and rhetoric provides valuable intellectual resources and practical skills for students across the curriculum who are considering careers that call for excellence in speaking and writing. The minor is also ideally suited for students with interest in public life and civic responsibility in the evolving context of a global culture. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Minor Requirements </H3>

<P>With a variety of course options available, students are encouraged to tailor their minor to fit their individual interests, career goals, and majors. Students should seek advice from a member of the department when planning their course selections. The minor requires a minimum of five courses selected from the list below. No more than one course may be at the 100 level, and at least one course must be at the 300 or 400 level. A course taken in fulfillment of the writing requirement may be counted toward the minor. </P>

<P>Where appropriate, one semester of independent study in writing at the junior or senior level (WRIT 391 or WRIT 491) may substitute for another 300-level course. </P>

<P>Normally, no more than one course from another department or program may count toward the minor. This course must focus on either language theory or the specialized expository writing of a particular discipline, and will require the approval of the departmental adviser. Examples of possible courses from outside the Department of Writing and Rhetoric include ENGL 374 - Creative Nonfiction Workshop, HIST 199 - History Workshop, and PSYC 355 - Language and Thought. Other courses may be counted toward the minor depending on their curriculum and focus during a particular semester. </P>

<H5>ALST 201 - Africa </H5>

<P>An introduction to the interdisciplinary study of Africa and to the African Studies major and minor at Colgate. The goal is to introduce students to a major world area with which many, even highly educated, Westerners are unfamiliar. Africa is the original home of the human species, and the intellectual contributions of the continent and its people to the concept of a common humanity are tremendous, including agricultural and industrial technologies, artistic and aesthetic principles, and religious and philosophical ideas. Due to early patterns of globalization and European colonization in the western hemisphere, the Atlantic slave trade, and ultimately colonialism on the continent itself, Africa was configured as &quot;the Dark Continent&quot; in European discourses of the nineteenth century. </P>

<P>Examines the political dynamics of race in American society, focusing primarily on the experience of blacks as a socio-political group and to a lesser degree on that of other racial and ethnic minorities. The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue - racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities. These topics, individually and collectively, represent the essence of racial politics. </P>

<P>ALST 290 - Model African Union </P>

<P>The Model African Union is an annual national student simulation of the workings of a large multilateral organization, the African Union. Composed of 53 member states, the African Union was constituted in 2000 as the successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Its objectives are to achieve continental integration, similar to that of the European Union, in balance with recognizing the national sovereignty of its member states. The Model African Union is in session for four days in late February, hosted by Howard University in Washington D.C., and students from more than 20 colleges and universities around the country participate. The on-campus portion of the course meets weekly for the five weeks prior to the trip and one week after, for debriefing. Students are assigned to specific country delegations and committees, research and prepare position papers, draft resolutions, debate and vote on action items, and generally take on the roles of African diplomats. The trip includes a visit to the embassy of the country each delegation is representing. May be taken more than once, with different country and committee assignments each year. </P>

<P>ALST 309 - Latin America: Critical Landscapes of Development </P>

<P>Explores the development experience of Latin America through examination of pressing environmental, economic, political, and social issues that currently face the region as a whole and play out differently across the region. The focus is guided by a critical reading of development theory, paying particular attention to Latin American theorizations and empirical experiences, and concern for the subjects, places, and scales that have been excluded from the presumed benefits of development. Mindful that Latin America's development experience is historically embedded, students examine the transformation of Latin American societies and environments through legacies of conquest and colonialism, processes of globalization and neo-liberalization, dynamics of rural and urban change, changes in gender and race relations, and transformations of political and civil society dynamics. These issues are grounded in case studies drawn from Central America, the Caribbean, and Andean countries, and Southern Cone, and Brazil. The course's point of entry is contemporary environmental crises and the role of natural and human resources in shaping the development experience of the region. </P>

<P>ALST 326 - Jamaican Culture (Study Group) </P>

<P>Examines the historical growth and fluorescence of Jamaican culture from the English conquest to the present. This culture is drawn from indigenous Taino, European, African, Jewish, Lebanese, Indian, and Chinese heritages, leading to the emergence of a unique Jamaican creole culture. The process of creolization over historical time forms the central and uniting theme of the course. In that context, various aspects of Jamaica's culture as well as the social forces that helped to shape it are explored. The examination of Jamaican culture includes religion and belief systems; marriage and family; art, music, and dance; literature; folkways; festivals; language; material cultures (food, dress, architecture, etc.); and sport. </P>

<P>ALST 332 - The Philosophy of Race and Racism </P>

<P>Serves as a sustained investigation into the concepts of race and racism through an examination of metaphysical, psychological, ethical, linguistic, and political problems associated with race. Topics to be discussed include the nature of race (are races real and if so what are they?), the formation of racial identities, individual and institutional racism, and notions of distributive and compensatory justice and how they are used to address issues of racial injustice. Readings include Appiah, Boxill, DuBois, Fanon, Garcia, Hacking, Lycan, Taylor, and others. </P>

<P>ALST 340 - Art and Culture in Contemporary Jamaica (Study Group) </P>

<P>Introduces students to ways of reading and interpreting Jamaican culture using a broad interdisciplinary approach. In keeping with a cultural studies framework, students examine literature, theatre, music, dance, and film as expressions of Jamaican subjectivities and identities. The contexts and conversations out of which these artistic representations have emerged are considered through historical, sociological, and political texts that help to map the larger cultural matrix. Textual explorations are accompanied by field trips and guest lectures (from experts in the various disciplines) with the understanding that Jamaican culture is not fixed but evolving and dynamic, multifarious, and heterogeneous. </P>

<P>ALST 345 - Topics in African American Philosophy </P>

<P>An introduction to issues in African-American philosophy. In particular, it explores the political and ideological goals of leading intellectuals from the 19th century to the present. From DuBois and Delany to the black power movement of the 1960s, analysis of African-American experiences has produced divergent strategies intended to better the condition of black communities in America. The course investigates nationalist strategies and their roots in notions of black identity as they have been developed through the writings of intellectuals, artists, and political figures. It also addresses challenges as to whether or not nonintegrationist strategies can be used to achieve social equality. Authors include Elizabeth Anderson, Anthony Appiah, Countée Cullen, Martin Delany, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Alain Locke, Claude McKay, Tommie Shelby, Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. </P>

<P>ALST 355 - Rwanda since the 1994 Genocide </P>

<P>Assess the Rwandan experience of post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in context and from the perspective of Rwandans themselves to ask, how sustainable is the country's post-genocide recovery? This course is concerned with understanding how to do field research in post-genocide Rwanda. Using the 'do no harm' framework of doing research with individuals who have lived through mass violence, this course equips students to undertake research in foreign field settings. In particular, students learn to design a 'human subjects' research proposal, rooted in The Belmont Report of ethical research and guidelines for research involving human subjects. The Report identified three core principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Using Rwanda since the 1994 genocide as a case study, these principles will be studied to highlight their shortcomings in the context of research in post-conflict societies. </P>

<P>ALST 357 - Indigenous Politics of Latin America </P>

<P>At the end of the 20th century, different indigenous or native peoples' voices seemed to become more prominent in Latin American social movements. These movements included an uprising to stop the advances of globalization, struggles to control resources, demands for dignity and recognition, and struggles against corporate environmental degradation. The apparent resurgence of Latin American indigenous politics is connected, in part, to global initiatives, like the work on what would become the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous politics in Latin America ultimately pose questions about customary, national, and international legal frameworks. This course works at the intersection of local and global understandings of what it means to be indigenous in different Latin American contexts. The course is taught through the disciplinary lens of anthropology, and readings are selected from case studies in Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. </P>

<P>ALST 363 - Globalization and Social Change in Latin America </P>

<P>Latin America has been globalized since before Napoleon invented the term &quot;Latin America&quot; to describe the Spanish, Portuguese, and French colonies to our south. This course explores the changing reality of what globalization means in Latin America. It examines the legacies of European colonization and African slavery; the struggles against transnational, national, and local forms of inequality; and the different ways that globalization is experienced by people today. Through case studies from South, Central, and North American, students focus on the themes of ethnicity, race, gender, social class, national citizenship, and transnational market production and consumption. The course uses an anthropological lens to analyze pressing social issues affecting Latin America, and Latin Americans, today. </P>

<P>ALST 365 - Andean Lives </P>

<P>While the Andes region may evoke quaint images often seen in tourism advertisements, a focus on the people living in this region reflects globally interconnected dynamics. The course engages with diverse authors who write about the Andes: as a place steeped in highland indigenous traditions; as the place of the Inca Empire; as a place of rural communities in which collective action can take priority over individual interest; as the original source of the coca leaf that has ritual significance through the region and contested political significance in the international sphere; as the birthplace of a Maoist guerrilla movement in the last gasp of the Cold War; and as the place where social movements have challenged global economic systems and brought an indigenous president to power. Through details about the lives of those who reside in the Andes, this course brings together anthropological and historical views of this region with cases primarily from Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. </P>

<P>ALST 367 - Jamaica in the Literary Imagination (Study Group) </P>

<P>An introduction to Jamaican literature from the plantation to the diaspora, spanning a period from 1930 to the present. While this historical framing is central to the organization of the course, the study is not strictly a historical survey, but rather an attempt to read Jamaican literature produced at different historical moments, in rural and urban, global and local spaces, and across perspectives mediated by differences and convergences of race, gender, sexuality, and location. Writers may include Claude McKay, Roger Mais, Erna Brodber, Curdella Forbes, Margaret Cezair-Thompson, among others. Students examine how the historical forces of colonialism, nation building, migration, and the information age have helped to shape how the selected writers from different spaces and identities imagine Jamaica's culture, cultural products, and geopolitical relations in the global world. </P>

<P>ALST 377 - History of Culture in the Caribbean </P>

<P>Examines the historical development of diverse creole cultures in the Caribbean, based on a core of neo-African traditions and Amerindian influences, and shaped by the impact of almost five centuries of European cultural imperialism. It explores the cultures of various ethnic groups that co-habited the Caribbean in the wake of European colonization, their separate struggles for cultural autonomy and self-determination, and the emergence of creole cultures to which all contributed. Specific aspects of Caribbean culture are studied to comprehend the process of creolization. (GL) </P>

<P>ALST 378 - Systems of Forced Labor in the Caribbean </P>

<P>From the moment Europeans invaded the Caribbean under Columbus in 1492, they regarded the region as a zone of economic exploitation from which wealth could be extracted using forced labor. The Spanish enslaved and rapidly decimated the indigenous peoples before turning to Africa for slave labor. Other European nationalities tried white indentured labor before also turning to enslaved African labor. After slavery was abolished, the European colonizers continued the pattern of exploitation through forced labor by indenturing hundreds of thousands of new immigrant workers from India, Africa, and China. Forced labor remained the engine of the Caribbean plantation economy until the end of the First World War. This course examines how these forced labor systems shaped the growth of the economy and society in the Caribbean, as well as the relations among the various subaltern groups that made up the labor force. </P>

<P>ALST 380 - Movements for Social Justice in South Africa (Extended Study) </P>

<P>Considers social movements in the specific context of South Africa, a country which has been transformed by and continues to experience large-scale civil society mobilizations. South Africa's unusual heritage of settler colonialism, enforced racial segregation, and explosive economic growth fueled by resources like gold and diamonds combine to make the country a perfect setting in which to investigate the efforts of diverse groups of citizens to achieve a more just and equitable society. Theoretical models drawn from sociology and anthropology expose how social movements originate, succeed, fail, and transform. These models are then applied to the specific history of South Africa, including the early development of nonviolent protests, multi-racial labor movements, and the rise of the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups. In addition, the ongoing struggles for social justice since the democratic transition in 1994 are addressed, focusing particularly on movements for environmental justice, the rights of indigenous peoples, and access to adequate health care and schooling. New social media, art forms, and networking technologies that have transformed the ability of civil society groups to mobilize are also considered. The on-campus portion of the course is followed by a three-week extended study trip to two South African cities. As a final project, students use their experience to write a proposal for advanced research on a particular social movement. </P>

<P>Introduces students to the research methods that anthropologists use to study human beings in all their complexity: the range of qualitative, in-depth, and participatory techniques that comprise ethnography. Through a series of hands-on active research projects, students will learn how to investigate the complex social world we live in, and analyze what they find. The course covers the research process from asking compelling questions, to collecting qualitative data and critically analyzing it, to choosing how to present it. The course also addresses the ethical implications and responsibilities that accompany learning about human beings by interacting with them, and then representing them to others. The readings, lectures, and discussions will explore how anthropological knowledge is generated and anthropology's relationship to political-economic power, historical experience, and personal identity. Students will also gain valuable research methods skills for career choices. </P>

This course examines the culture and political economy of family life, kinship, and marriage in a broad range of human societies, ranging from small-scale communities to highly industrialized states. In addition to looking at the theories, methods, and data that are relevant to the study of kinship in anthropology and related disciplines, the class analyzes and compares different systems of descent and inheritance; various types of households, marriage patterns, and networks of exchange; and the myriad ways in which systems of kinship and marriage are informed by ideologies of gender and vice versa. The class also evaluates some of the recent classics on kinship in America as well as selected aspects of contemporary theoretical debates bearing on kinship and class, lesbian and gay kinship, and the new reproductive technologies. </P>

<P>ANTH 226 - Critical Global Health </P>

<P>In contemporary American society, Western medicine-or biomedicine-is seen as offering quick, effective, and technologically advanced solutions to pain and suffering. Biomedicine is a medical system that privileges the physiological and biological causes of disease. As a clinical science, biomedicine is usually seen as culture-less, as universally effective on all bodies. But what happens when Western medicine goes &quot;global,&quot; that is, when it encounters cultural values or beliefs that conceptualize illness, healing, or the body in different ways? Is medicine itself &quot;cultural,&quot; and if so, how? This course examines how people experience, use, and critique global health interventions across the globe, and why sociological and anthropological approaches to global health are critical to improving these interventions. </P>

<P>Takes a feminist perspective to the study of gender and identity in prehistoric societies and ancient civilizations. By looking at the variation of gender roles and relations throughout history and cross-culturally, students help to deconstruct many modem-day assumptions about gender and gender roles in the present. The course will provide an overview of how material remains are used for understanding social identities in the past. It will review feminist critiques of archaeology and how feminism has impacted the discipline of archaeology. Students examine archaeological resources for gendering the past (burials, art, artifacts) and explore gender in a range of prehistoric cultural contexts (hunter-gatherers, farmers, states, and empires) using archaeological case studies as examples. Students additionally look at the ways in which historical archaeology has helped to better understand gender relations in historical contexts. Students critically examine how gender and identity have been represented in academic research, museums, and popular media, in order to deconstruct modem-day assumptions about gender. Case studies derive from the earliest human origins, ancient complex civilizations, and recent colonial America. This course is designed for students with little or no background in archaeology or anthropology. </P>

<P>ANTH 242 - The Archaeology of Race and Ethnicity in America (MC, GR) </P>

<P>Explores the history of different ethnic groups in America through the study of their material remains: living quarters, burials, food remains, tools, toys, etc. Students consider how these material remains are used for understanding social identities in the past, specifically race and ethnicity in the United States, as well as the lasting impact of past events on the present day. Students also critically examine how race and ethnicity have been portrayed and ignored in museum displays and popular media. Some of the key questions students seek to address include: What is ethnicity and where does it come from? How has archaeology been used as a social weapon? What was the experience of ethnic and racial minorities in the United States and how can archaeology contribute to that history? How can archaeologists more effectively collaborate with descendant communities and work with museums to create a more inclusive history? (MC, GR) </P>

This course shows how nature and human culture are intertwined, both in terms of how we shape our environment as well as how it shapes us. Through a series of case studies, students explore this relationship, focusing especially on the way that nature and culture are &quot;political&quot;: inequalities, social problems and movements, and power relations all flow from the way that we interact with our environment. The course takes a global, comparative, and historical view of this process, and includes the following special topics: the rise of environmental awareness and environmental social movements; globalization and environmental values; consumption and the environment; environmental inequalities and justice; risk, technology, and environmental politics; and public policy and the environment.

<P>Critically examines techno-science as a transnational social-cultural phenomenon. The term &quot;technoscience&quot; refers to the fusion of science and technology under modern global capitalism. Using the tools of anthropology, this course explores how techno-science is embedded in social-cultural, political and economic systems and processes. Case studies drawn from the Global North and South show how the context in which techno-science is produced and consumed matters. They reveal how critical examination of different sciences and scientists teaches us as much about the social world as it does about the natural one, and challenge the divide between the two. They also demonstrate how techno-science is a transnational phenomenon, in which ideas, objects, methods and practices change as they travel. (MC) </P>

<P>ANTH 322 - Medical Anthropology </P>

<P>Introduces students to medical anthropology—the study of the relationships among cultures, social systems, the environment, and disease and healing. Interpretations of health and illness, and the experience of one's body are often taken for granted. Yet our ideas about and experiences of health, disease, and medicine are profoundly shaped by culture; by transnational flow of people, ideas, and resources; by histories of colonialism and structural inequalities; and by the development of new technologies. This course introduces students to approaches used by medical anthropologists to study the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of the human experience of the body, health, illness, and healing. Topics covered include cultural interpretations of sickness and healing, cultural ideas about the body, social and environmental causes of illness, the effects of poverty on health, the roles of doctors and healers in society, cultural clashes and ethical issues in health care delivery, anthropological critiques of Western biomedicine, and the place of medical anthropology in the study of public health. </P>

The course also considers how authoritative interpretations of &quot;the past&quot; reflect contemporary political and nationalist interests, biases, and knowledge-producing projects. The course asks how some indigenous peoples become enshrined as exemplars of the generalized human past, and how their representation shifts with changing views of human nature.

<P>What does &quot;globalization&quot; mean, and what does it mean for societies and people facing the onslaught of global corporations? This course examines the phenomenon of globalization from a variety of theoretical perspectives, ranging from neo-liberal economics to cultural anthropology. It analyzes how each of these works defines the causes of globalization and its effects on traditional cultures, community relationships, economic wealth and justice, and political institutions. To put these theoretical works in perspective, interspersed with them will be actual case studies of real people and real communities, ranging from Costa Rican farmers to Thai factory workers, interacting with the forces of globalization. These case studies will allow students to test the abstract analyses and see which theories fit reality. </P>

<P>Business corporations are among the most influential institutions on the earth today. This course examines the place of corporations in the contemporary world, focusing on their roles critically in global political-economic and social systems, and in our own lives. It considers how studying business corporations can help to better understand capitalism, globalization, work, consumerism, law, inequality, cultural change and personhood. The course delves into case studies that follow transnational corporations from Silicon Valley, to Papua New Guinea, and back again. In addition, the course includes a research component in which students will conduct and analyze original interviews. </P>

<P>ANTH 350 - Theorizing Contemporary Cultures </P>

<P>Anthropologists are philosophers of the social. With firm roots in classical social theory, anthropologists have always questioned the relationship of materiality and imagination in human culture, the dialectic of individual and social, the structures of power and authority, the pull of kinship and cosmology, and the cultural patterning of time, space, gender, and story. Anthropology trains our attention on big questions of comparative and global import, but seeks answers in concrete things that people do, say, and make. Anthropological theory thus rests on the empiricism of ethnography, archaeology, and material studies, and provides the questions that drive research. This course links contemporary theoretical work in the discipline with essential forerunner texts and projects. It also considers influential texts from theorists outside the discipline proper, recognizing that anthropology takes insights from many theoretical quarters, and in turn informs theoretical endeavors across the social sciences and humanities. </P>

<P>ANTH 355 - Ancient Aztec Civilization </P>

<P>Debate key issues surrounding the Aztecs of Central Mexico using archaeological and written evidence to understand ancient Aztec culture. This course explores the great technological achievements of Aztec civilization, its complex rituals and beliefs, bustling marketplaces and cities, and the everyday lives of ordinary people. Questions addressed include: Who were the Aztecs? Why did the Aztecs practice human sacrifice and cannibalism? How did the Aztecs become the largest empire in ancient Mesoamerica? Did the Aztec Empire promote the well-being of its commoners? Was religion used as a tool of domination? What was the role of women in Aztec society? Why did the Aztec Empire fall to the Spanish? What happened to people following the fall of the Aztec Empire? Students will integrate primary sources, archaeological research, and ethnohistory to uncover the Aztec past. </P>

<P>ANTH 356 - Ethical Issues in Native American Archaeology (MC, GR) </P>

<P>Examines a range of significant ethical issues relating to the archaeology of Native Americans in North America primarily, but also to some extent in Central and South America. Students not only read about and discuss conflicting perspectives leading to ethical dilemmas, but also propose solutions and evaluate existing policies to combat such problems. Some of the key topics covered in the course include the conservation ethic and stewardship; excavation and repatriation of Native American skeletal remains and sacred objects; looting, collecting, and commodification of Native American archaeological sites and artifacts; and public and postgraduate education. In short, the class actively engages in the critical ethical, theoretical, and legal debates surrounding Native American archaeology that have emerged over the past 30 years. (MC, GR) </P>

<P>ANTH 357 - Indigenous Politics of Latin America (GR) </P>

<P>At the end of the 20th century, different indigenous or native peoples' voices seemed to become more prominent in Latin American social movements. These movements included an uprising to stop the advances of globalization, struggles to control resources, demands for dignity and recognition, and struggles against corporate environmental degradation. The apparent resurgence of Latin American indigenous politics is connected, in part, to global initiatives, like the work on what would become the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous politics in Latin America ultimately pose questions about customary, national, and international legal frameworks. This course works at the intersection of local and global understandings of what it means to be indigenous in different Latin American contexts. The course is taught through the disciplinary lens of anthropology, and readings are selected from case studies in Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. (GR) </P>

<P>Concentrates on the description and analysis of cosmological models and world views, primarily as revealed through myth, developed by a variety of ancient and contemporary societies. One goal in formulating a contrast between Western and non-Western aspects of world view is determining which concepts and ideas might emerge as common to all cultures as opposed to being unique in American society: Do all societies believe in a beginning and an end to their universe? To what extent are cosmological ideas reflected in urban planning and particularly in the design of sacred space? In what specific ways do developed world views depend upon cycles of social interaction? (MC) </P>

<P>ANTH 361 - Ancient Environments and Human Legacies (MC) </P>

<P>Many, if not most of today's geopolitical problems can be traced to how people interact with the environment. Warfare, globalization, market economies, food production, ethnic conflicts, and disease are all contingent on the relationship between human beings and their environments. This course focuses on the complexity and nuance of those relationships through both space and time by utilizing an archaeological perspective. While many academic fields now focus on topics relating to environments, archaeology works with a dataset that spans the entirety of human history. Such a dataset allows archaeological researchers to ask powerful and fundamental questions, such as: How do human societies respond to environmental change? Have human beings ever successfully found a balance between themselves and their natural world? What events created today's environmental challenges? What leads to the downfall of a society? This course will consider questions like these through various case-studies across the globe that deal with the diversity of human societies and the specific environments from which they emerged.

<P>Examines human political action in a variety of societies, both within and outside established political structures. Beginning with the attempt to construct truly cross-cultural definitions of power and politics, students look at examples of both centralized and un-centralized systems of authority and management. Topics include the management of cooperation and collective action in the absence of formal leadership roles; the use of informal mechanisms such as gossip, witchcraft, and influence; succession to office and the symbols and ceremonies surrounding the transfer of power; the construction of group identities based on race, ethnicity, and class; gender relations as a domain of political action; ethnicity, nationalism, and ethnic conflict; and the particular perspective anthropology can bring to the study of politics. </P>

<P>Latin America has been globalized since before Napoleon invented the term &quot;Latin America&quot; to describe the Spanish, Portuguese, and French colonies to our south. This course explores the changing reality of what globalization means in Latin America. It examines the legacies of European colonization and African slavery; the struggles against transnational, national, and local forms of inequality; and the different ways that globalization is experience by people today. Through case studies from South, Central, and North America, students focus on the themes of ethnicity, race, gender, social class, national citizenship, and transnational market production and consumption. The course uses an anthropological lens to analyze pressing social issues affecting Latin America, and Latin Americans, today. (GR) </P>

<P>ANTH 365 - Andean Lives (GR) </P>

<P>While the Andes region may evoke quaint images often seen in tourism advertisements, a focus on the people living in this region reflects globally interconnected dynamics. The course engages with diverse authors who write about the Andes: as a place steeped in highland indigenous traditions; as the place of the Inca Empire; as a place of rural communities in which collective action can take priority over individual interest; as the original source of the coca leaf that has ritual significance through the region and contested political significance in the international sphere; as the birthplace of a Maoist guerrilla movement in the last gasp of the Cold War; and as the place where social movements have challenged global economic systems and brought an indigenous president to power. Through details about the lives of those who reside in the Andes, this course brings together anthropological and historical views of this region with cases primarily from Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.

<P>ANTH 372 - Anthropological Theory and Archaeological Praxis (MC) </P>

<P>Examines the interplay between theoretical trends in anthropology and the emergence of a reflexive practice of archaeology. Formal archaeology in the U.S. was a latecomer to anthropology, appearing during the era of Franz Boas. Somewhat later, the field became methodologically standardized as a result of the New Deal. After World War II, Americanist archaeology became a battle ground for competing perspectives in anthropology, fueled in part by the appearance of the National Science Foundation. Today, archaeology in the United States and Europe confronts and integrates numerous new critiques and theoretical perspectives, many of which arrive from recent trends in anthropology and various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Among the topics addressed are cultural evolutionary theory, geoarchaeology, postcolonial critiques, practice theory, embodiment theory, gender archaeology, critical theory, discourse analysis, and indigenous archaeologies. The overarching goal is to assess the state of the art in anthropological approaches to the production of knowledge in archaeology. (MC) </P>

<P>ANTH 375 - Captured by the Lens: Photography in Anthropology and Archaeology </P>

<P>Examines the role that photography has played in the emergence of anthropology and archaeology as disciplines. Beginning in the 1860s, advances in technology turned the camera into a standard piece of fieldwork equipment, and a range of image genres emerged as cameras were taken on-site and into the field. Part of the course is historical and archival in intention, and examines the emergence of these image genres, asking questions about the nature of the gaze, about forms of representation, and about the relationship between the visual imagination and more empirically imagined knowledge projects. Another part of the course examines contemporary photographic practices and the leaking of anthropological image genres like the ethnographic photograph into popular forms. Students take a case-study approach and look at individual sites, photographers, and bodies of work, alongside a close reading of contemporary theory. Students are encouraged to take their own photographs, and the course concludes with an exhibition of student work. </P>

<P>ANTH 376 - Archaeology of the Inkas and their Ancestors (MC, GR) </P>

<P>Explores the many cultures that flourished in the Central Andes of South America, from the Inka Empire to the earliest inhabitants during the Paleolithic. By examining the cities, shrines, and habitations they left behind, archaeology allows for unique glimpses into the Pre-Columbian past in an area of the world with no written records prior to the 16th Century. Students trace the development of long-distance trade, the origins of agriculture, the spread of early religious traditions, and the formation of the first cities and empires in South America. In addition to learning the cultural history of the Central Andes, students engage in contemporary debates including cultural tourism and the popularization of the Andean past; art markets, looting, and ownership of archaeological remains; and the relationship of present-day Andean communities to their material heritage.

<P>ANTH 378 - Social Theory of Everyday Life </P>

<P>Since classical times, philosophers and historians have studied and recorded the details of everyday life with an eye to grasping the meaning of social practice. The past 50 years, however, have seen the bourgeoning of an exciting body of critical theory on the quotidian. Much of this work is concerned with profound questions about how the systems, structures, and practices of modernity shape basic human interactions with things, with places, and with other persons, and how these, in turn, reproduce social structures. This course presents sociological and anthropological texts concerned with everyday domesticity, cuisine, gesture, movement, activity, entertainment, talk, schooling, and bureaucracy, and explores the theoretical paradigms of knowledge, practice, and power to which these texts are ultimately addressed. </P>

<P>ANTH 382 - Nations, Power, Islam: Muslim Identity and Community in the Global Age (GR) </P>

<P>Muslims today belong at once to a global community of the faithful and to particular ethnic and national bodies. This course examines the social significance of these intersections of identity and community: What political, cultural, and religious conflicts and negotiations mark Muslim identity in the global age? Initial readings survey the colonial age, which forced the integration of Muslim communities into the global capitalist and state systems. With this foundation students then address specific conflicts and congruencies of contemporary Muslim identity in both the Muslim world and the West: between Islamic law and national-state laws; between local Islamic norms and transnational flows of media, persons, and products; between popular Islam and political power. How do these issues affect Muslims and their neighbors? How do they affect geopolitics? What is the present and future of the &quot;global village&quot;? (GR) </P>

<P>ARTS 236 - Realism and Impressionism: Global Styles (AH) </P>

<P>From the 1820s to 1880, artists working on traditional media such as painting and sculpture, as well as on new ones such as photography, engaged everyday life in an environment transformed by industrialization, urbanization, and imperialism. In this period, modern art developed some of its characteristic strategies, such as an emphasis on originality, an ambivalent relation with tradition, problematic ties with cultural and economic institutions, and a strained allegiance to radical politics. This course explores the exhibitions, institutions, and art-critical discourses supporting the circulation of art, with particular regard to the impact of nationalism and globalization on the production and dissemination of art objects. </P>

<P>World War II, totalitarian regimes, and revolutions form the backdrop for this global study of art and artists during the middle of the 20th century. Begins with an examination of the challenges to rationalism raised by the Dada and Surrealists groups in the context of World War I and its aftermath. The course also considers the forms of realism that coalesced concurrently in several countries as a reaction to the shifting political landscape of the interwar years. The reemergence of abstract painting at mid-century is considered in relation to the theoretical formation of modernist criticism and the tensions of the Cold War. Through the analysis of case studies — such as iconic exhibitions and the publication of key theoretical interventions — the students will develop close readings of objects and texts and situate them in their geo-political, theoretical, and social contexts. </P>

<P>ARTS 345 - Exhibiting the New: 1960-2000 (AH) </P>

<P>With an eye to geopolitics in the art world, students examines key exhibitions that have displayed new artistic practices. They analyze how new art challenged traditional displays of art, breaking away from the famous &quot;white cube&quot; gallery display to transform the exhibition space into a more fluid environment. It shows how contemporary art practices affected art institutions that, in turn, prompted new exhibition formats and institutional discourses. </P>

<H5>ARTS 348 - Modern Art on Display, 1850-1950 (AH) </H5>

<P>Explores the history of group exhibitions of modern art and related debates on the nature of display. Using visual, historical, and theoretical materials to study select case studies from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries, students will focus on how the history of art display impacts our understanding of modernism today, studying installations of art as creations that manifest ideologies and aesthetics. An important aspect of the course will be thinking about how photography — the primary medium through which we can now know how past exhibitions looked like — operates as a medium of visual representation as well as a force of cultural innovation by circulating modern art. In addition to the study of the history of exhibitions, students will also investigate the changing role of the art critic and the curator. As part of the course, students will study exhibitions on campus, applying to contemporary shows the critical skills learned by studying art displays from the past. </P>

<P>Offers a critical and historical examination of the relation between photography and political conflict. Considering some key international photographic experiments in the context of the social, cultural, and political upheavals of their time, key to the course will be the broader question of how modern visual culture transformed in reaction and response to political change. Among the topics covered will be the history of photography in relation to colonialism, issues of photographic display and exhibitions, and notions of the documentary and the fictional in contemporary photography. Students will develop visual literacy, and become familiar with the complex relations between photography and its context through discussion and analysis of key artistic and photographic movements, practitioners, and techniques. </P>

As students analyze the literary works of people writing within these social and cultural contexts and shifting political views, they are forced to question the nature of oppression. Who does the oppressing? Who are the oppressed? What is the nature of such a relationship? What are the structures of oppression? How does the voice of the oppressed find expression in the language and literary constructs of the dominant culture? What narrative techniques and strategies are employed by oppressors and oppressed in the quest for self-representation? This course allows students to explore the themes of power, self-representation, and language, while developing some important critical reading and analytical writing skills. </P>

<P>BIOL 306 - Medical and Forensic Botany </P>

<P>The great majority of people understand that plants are fundamental to life: they produce life sustaining oxygen, cleanse the air of carbon dioxide, provide material for construction, and more. Yet few people appreciate that modern medicine has its roots in the chemistry of plants. From headaches and malaria to AIDS and hypertension, most modern drug treatments originated from plant extracts. Even in the modern world of sophisticated synthetic chemistry, 25 percent of all prescriptions contain plant extracts or active principles prepared from plants. More than providing pain relief and disease cures, the search of effective medical botany has shaped cultures, created fierce wars, and contributed to the modern issues of bioprospecting, drug wars, and crime scene investigation. This course delves into issues of medical and forensic botany from multiple perspectives. Students develop a greater understanding of basic plant biology and phytochemistry, and learn how many cultures have utilized plants for curative and destructive means. Students also examine how plant-derived drugs have disrupted both ancient and modern cultures, and have shaped the scientific method and modern drug creation. Finally, the class examines how plants play significant roles in early and modern forensics by focusing on major cases whose decisions have hinged on plant evidence. </P>

<P>ECON 380 - Economics of Households in Developing Countries </P>

<P>In 2005, one out of five people on this planet was living on less than $1 per day. Half of the world lives on less than $2 per day. But how actually does one live on less than $1 per day? In this course students learn about the economic lives of the extremely poor: the choices they face, the constraints within which they make decisions, and the challenges they meet. Development economics is, in most part, the field of economics that studies the informal, imaginative institutions that replace the formal constructs we are used to in the developed world. In developing countries people face malfunctioning markets due to incomplete information, a weak legal structure, and constraints that result in economic choices and strategic considerations that are worth separate scrutiny. This is an advanced course in economics. </P>

From sex education to the prom, most schools and educators operate under the ahistorical guise of heteronormativity--a term used to describe ideologies and practices that organize and privilege opposite-sex gender relations and normative gender and sexual identities. Using critical lenses developed by queer and feminist theorists and critical pedagogues, this course seeks both to explore how heteronormativity operates in a variety of educational spaces and how students and educators are confronting these processes by using schools as sites of resistance. </P>

<P>Who is normal? Who is a citizen? What is the meaning of adulthood? The purpose of this course is to understand and situate inclusive and positive learning relationships within broader sociological, philosophical, and cultural meanings and to enact critical practices of inclusion and belonging. Students will use the theoretical lenses and analytic tools developed by scholars of critical disability studies, feminist disability theory, and inclusive education to examine how assumptions and expectations of the able mind and body are built into how educational theorists, educators, and students think about the purposes and practices of education, especially in the context of higher education. In particular, students examine inclusive practice, civic friendship, supported decision-making, self-determination, and self-advocacy. The course requires that students complete a collaborative social action project, designed in partnership with students from Otsego Academy at Pathfinder Village. </P>

<P>An introduction to literary study that explores the tradition of apocalyptic imagination and its relationship to practices of reading and interpretation. Why has the idea of apocalypse been so pervasive in Western literature and civilization? How has apocalypse been variously conceived as the destruction or uncovering of meaning (and sometimes as both at once)? Is apocalypse a full stop, or a transfiguration? Is reading by nature an apocalyptic pursuit? Students consider apocalyptic texts as anticipations of millennial promise, as works of political protest, and as dire prophecies of impending ecological catastrophe. Students also think about the particular character of apocalyptic imagination in contemporary American culture. Writers to be studied include William Blake, William Wordsworth, Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Sigmund Freud, Samuel Beckett, Jorie Graham, and Margaret Atwood. </P>

<P>ENGL 329 - Inventing Ireland: National Identity - Literary Form in the Irish Republic (Extended Study) </P>

<P>A study of Irish writers since the late nineteenth century. Eager to shake off colonial influences, Irish writers have sought to define a distinctly Irish literary tradition. This project characteristically worked by turning to history older than anything English, either to the forgotten writings of Irish antiquity or to elements from Classical antiquity. What these writers made is nothing less than our modern sense of Ireland; and Ireland itself figures as perhaps their most important literary creation of all--an all-encompassing palimpsest of history kept present in the very landscape and its monuments. </P>

<P>ENGL 333 - African/Diaspora Women's Narrative </P>

<P>Narratives by African, African American, and African Caribbean women writers. The focus of this course is the concept of the African diaspora with its broad cultural, social, political, and economic implications. Students explore how these texts represent women's experience cross-culturally. How does the condition of each nation-state, with its attendant hierarchy of race, ethnicity, class, and gender, shape the (dis)continuities in these texts? Ultimately, they question whether these narratives can cohere under the rubric of African/diaspora women's literature. </P>

The gendered nature of colonial, postcolonial, and global processes is an important part of this course. </P>

<P>ENGL 339 - Modernist Poetry </P>

<P>A study of selected British and American poets active between 1900 and 1950. Amidst all the discourse about the &quot;postmodern,&quot; it becomes increasingly clear that there is no consensus on what it is &quot;post.&quot; More recent versions of the &quot;postmodern&quot; argue that it is not a period but a mode - one coeval with Modernism itself. Modernity and postmodernity can thus be understood only in relation to one another. This course pursues that relation by focusing on poets like W.H. Auden, Sterling Brown, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Muriel Rukeyser, Wallace Stevens, Melvin Tolson, or William Carlos Williams. </P>

Text analysis investigates classic and modern plays. The class is a first-hand initiation into the vocabulary and technique of collaboration for the development of original material. </P>

To uncover the racial and political meanings of twentieth-century mobilities in the Americas, we will explore texts in a variety of media - narrative fiction, poetry, literary nonfiction, photography, sound recordings, and film - and theorize these mediums from a range of perspectives. Major figures include John Dos Passos, Dorothea Lange, William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston, Susan Sontag, Toni Morrison, Cormac McCarthy, Ida B. Wells, Sherman Alexie, and Richard Wright. </P>

<P>An introduction to Jamaican literature from the plantation to the diaspora, spanning a period from 1930 to the present. While this historical framing is central to the organization of the course, the study is not strictly a historical survey, but rather an attempt to read Jamaican literature produced at different historical moments, in rural and urban, global and local spaces, and across perspectives mediated by differences and convergences of race, gender, sexuality, and location. Writers may include Claude McKay, Roger Mais, Erna Brodber, Curdella Forbes, Margaret Cezair-Thompson, among others. Students examine how the historical forces of colonialism, nation building, migration, and the information age have helped to shape how the selected writers from different spaces and identities imagine Jamaica's culture, cultural products, and geopolitical relations in the global world. </P>

<P>ENGL 368 - After Genocide: Memory and Representation </P>

<P>An investigation of the impact of genocide on the self and the imagination's representations in literature, film, and art. Primary texts include poetry, memoir, video testimony, film, and visual art. Scholarly methodology involves readings of literary criticism and theoretical work in the study of trauma, literary theory, and testimony. Among the questions the course asks are: How does trauma shape imagination and open up access to the site of disaster that is now carried in fragments which inform memory? How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides. </P>

<P>ENGL 412 - Jane Austen and the Rise of the Woman Novelist </P>

<P>A reconsideration of the history of the novel in the 18th century, using contemporary critical approaches to early women novelists. Jane Austen has held an unchallenged place in a great tradition of 19th-century authors, but has only recently been read in the context of her female predecessors. Reading Maria Edgeworth, Fanny Burney, and Charlotte Lennox gives students a new way to read Austen; reading among the many current critical theories about women as producers and consumers of fiction in the 18th century helps raise more general questions about the literary canon and how it has been formed.

<P>An investigation of the innovative forces of post-World War II American literature. The course will review the tumultuous decade of the 1950s during which time the United States was catapulted into a Cold War with the Soviet Union and a congruent episode of anticommunist hysteria known as McCarthyism. This initiated the new nuclear age created with the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. It was also a decade defined by the struggle with Jim Crow racism and the emergence of a new Civil Rights movement, the birth of the second wave of feminism, and the emergence of a rich range of cultural criticism focused on issues including the social construction of the American family, corporate and suburban conformism, sexual repression, and the destructive capacities of the new military industrial complex. Out of this charged political and cultural situation, writers created some of the most innovative literary works in modern American history. </P>

<P>Helps students navigate fiction's complex relationship with representation and reality. Scans a broad spectrum of texts, beginning with 18th- and 19th-century European novels, and continue onto contemporary writings from the postcolonial world. Students discuss the complex ways in which fiction documents the social world, produces historical archives, bears witness to trauma and violence, and memorializes loss, but also rejects and/or makes readers critically aware of realism's positivist impulses. Also guides students in reading theoretical texts on the topic. Possible authors include Daniel Defoe, Rudyard Kipling, Leonard Woolf, Bertolt Brecht, Chinua Achebe, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Michael Ondaatje, and David Henry Hwang. </P>

<P>ENGL 444 - Modern Wisdom Literature </P>

<P>Developing from the &quot;wisdom literatures&quot; of both Greco-Roman and Hebrew tradition, the modern aphorism is characterized by its brief and often pointed expression of an observation or precept. It differs from, say, maxims, proverbs, or apothegms in that it turns on paradox and antithesis; it differs from earlier forms in the ways it undermines rather than supports certainty. This seminar explores the relations of literary form to convictions about the nature and limits of human knowledge, habits of reading, and its uses in life. The course follows the transformation of the aphorism both as form and as impulse as it is reinvented in the Modern period-chiefly following the example of Friedrich Nietzsche-and explores its character as a lyrical corrective to overly definitive and linear ways of organizing and writing about experience. </P>

<P>Global environmental justice examines both procedural and distributive inequities as well as injustices in political relationships among nation states. Additionally, it places emphasis on a variety of global political issues, which have evolved from environmental concerns that transcend national boundaries. This intermediate course expounds on the concepts and theories of environmental justice from an international perspective. It evaluates the international frame of environmental justice from a human rights perspective and its applicability to different case studies. A close examination of the theoretical North-South relationship, in terms of dependency and exploitation of peripheral (South) countries by core (North) countries, is central to the course. It analyzes a constellation of issues labeled as global environmental justice, such as tribal exterminations, dislocations of marginalized communities, and resource conflicts. Real world examples of environmental justice cases are critically assessed to develop an understanding of the complex relationships among actors that lead to environmental injustices. </P>

<P>ENST 324 - Hunting, Eating, Vegetarianism </P>

<P>Historically, hunting for food has represented one of the most direct ways in which people have engaged with nature. Some scholars even believe that the &quot;hunting instinct&quot; is a fundamental aspect of human identity. People in modern industrialized societies, however, often have little idea about the origins of the flesh they consume, most of which is raised and slaughtered on an industrial-scale. While the majority continue to eat meat, poultry, and/or fish, a minority have chosen to become locavores, vegetarians, or even vegans for ethical, religious, cultural, health-oriented, or environmental reasons. Others continue to hunt and fish but within ecosystems dramatically altered by human intervention and amidst cultural landscapes complicated by commercialized and trophy hunting. Drawing upon a wide range of sources including literature, artistic and documentary films, works of popular culture, autobiographical accounts, online hunting (and anti-hunting) forums, diverse web resources, self-reflective essays, and scholarly approaches ranging from animal studies to humanistic ecocriticism, this course investigates the intertwined themes of hunting, industrial versus family farming and slaughter, eating, vegetarianism, and the ethical and existential choices they present to members of modern industrialized societies. Fishing and fish farming are also considered more briefly. </P>

<P>ENST 344 - Managing Complexity: America's Public Lands </P>

<P>Public land management is inherently complex. Typically there are multiple interested parties and potentially competing goals such as wilderness preservation, recreational accessibility, and resource exploitation. Also, the management of public lands may rest with several agencies. Management decisions made in pursuit of one goal often have implications for other goals, stakeholders, and management agencies. Complexity theory offers a new perspective for understanding the complicated workings of ecosystems, economies, and political systems. Such complex adaptive systems are characterized by feedback loops, chaos, nonlinear dynamics, self-organization, and emergence. The aims of this course are to investigate alternative public land management strategies and apply complexity theory 1) to model qualitatively the intricacies of both natural and human-built systems, 2) to propose and evaluate fresh ecological strategies and management policies for conserving public lands, and 3) to investigate new procedures for mitigating tension among competing interests in the use of public land. The course includes some weekend field trips. </P>

<H5>FMST 200 - Introduction to Film and Media Studies </H5>

<P>From the films we watch to the personal profiles we maintain online, media saturates our lives. Film and mass media can be powerful determinants of ideology, identity, and historical consciousness. This course is a historical survey of media technologies and environments, combining course readings with a required weekly film screening. The theoretical concepts introduced in this course enable students to critically approach the visual culture around them: just how immersed are we in the virtual, and what are the strategies for engaging with or disengaging from virtual worlds? Students learn to respond to film and media as proactive, critical, and articulate viewers. Students also acquire the vocabulary, conceptual strategies, and interpretive skills necessary to closely analyze the form and content of film and media, as well as the ability to set their own relation to the ideologies all representations convey. </P>

<P>Regulating and being regulated by a variety of information flows on a daily basis from SMS texts, snapchats, and tweets, to live news feeds, corporate data transfers, and government communiques. We increasingly experience our private and public lives as a hypermediated encounter with the world at large. What impact do these media flows have on our experiences of the local and the global? Simultaneously, how should we understand contemporary mass media themselves as &quot;global&quot;? Have transformations in print, broadcast, and digital media fundamentally altered how we think of the near and the far, the familiar and the foreign, the national and the transnational, the West and the non-West? This course will address these questions through the two structuring notions of the &quot;flow&quot; and the &quot;counter-flow,&quot; and analyze the role that media play as both a unifying and a divisive agent, consolidating identities and nationalisms in some instances, and deterritorializing the same in others. </P>

<P>To what extent does watching a movie imitate the body's own sensorial encounters with the world? How do filmmakers use color, sound, lighting, movement, editing and space to create embodied experience? This course is an introduction to these and related questions by examining both cinema's bodily representations, and the relationship between the viewer's body and the events on the screen. The approach is organized around weekly film screenings that include silent film, art cinema, experimental cinema, classical Hollywood melodrama, and the horror film. Readings explore phenomenological theories of the body by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Vivian Sobchack, Jennifer Baker, Elena del Rio, Laura Marks, Martine Beugnet, and Steven Shaviro. Students explore related approaches such as affect theory, feminism, and the relationship of bodily representation to painting, especially in the depiction of masochism. </P>

<P>This seminar traces the development of French theater through close readings of major and influential theatrical works from the 17th and 18th centuries. Major dramatic genres such as tragedy, comedy, and Romantic drama and their development are examined in their historical and cultural contexts. Through critical readings of these plays, the course identifies an evolving sensibility concerning the definition of the hero and the contingencies of fate, love, and personal choice. The course considers as well the shifting set of literary conventions through which playwright and audience negotiated these ideas. Authors studied may include Corneille, Racine, Molière, Marivaux, and Beaumarchais. </P>

<P>FREN 425 - Libertine Fiction of the French 18th Century </P>

<P>Beginning in the 17th century under the label libertinage érudit, libertine fiction evolves into a major genre in the Enlightenment. The course follows its development through readings of Prèvost, Crébillon fils, Diderot, Denon, and Sade, and explores the following questions: How do philosophy, fiction, and sexual politics coalesce in libertine literature? How can one reconcile libertinage - a way of living and writing frequently reduced to passion and sensuality - with the broader currents of the most &quot;rational&quot; century in French literary history? An exploration of libertine literature thus entails a focus on cultural history, and serves as a point of departure for a broader reflection on the Enlightenment. </P>

The following questions are discussed: How did these writers see their role in the rapidly changing social and political climate of the period? How did they transform the two dominant literary modes of the end of the 19th century (naturalism and symbolism) to express more modern concerns? How is one to understand the emergence of an introspective hero who so often searches for his or her identity on the margins of society? </P>

<P>GEOG 105 - Climate and Society </P>

<P>Human-induced climate change--global warming--is the defining environmental and social issue of our times. That people are dramatically altering the climate is now the resounding consensus in the scientific community. Potential short- and long-term impacts include biodiversity loss, sea-level rise and coastal flooding, more intense storms, threats to human health, and disruptions of freshwater supplies and food security. But while the global community increasingly understands the basic processes driving climate change, and is starting to appreciate the consequences of a warmer world, the coupled social and biophysical dynamics of global warming are complex and the issue remains controversial. This course explores climate-society relationships in industrial and pre-industrial periods, and considers the multifaceted natural and human dimensions of global warming. It also highlights the integrative natural and social science modes of analysis commonly used in the discipline of geography. </P>

<P>Acquaints students with the approaches and subject matter of human and nature-society geography. It introduces geography's longstanding concerns with spatial location, place, and nature-society interaction, as studied through ways of knowing that are central to the discipline—spatial representation and analysis, cross-scalar comparisons, integrative synthesis, and the social construction of space and environment. Case studies illustrate how geographers use these tools and perspectives to clarify such issues as human well-being and inequality, economic and sociocultural globalization, population patterns and processes, human impact on the environment, and sustainable development in the Anthropocene. </P>

<P>Focuses on the theory, function, and application of geographic information systems (GIS). The analytical powers of GIS are rooted in its ability to manage large volumes of geographically referenced data representing both physical and social characteristics. As such, GIS has become an important analytical approach in most subfields of geography. Students begin with an examination of basic mapping concepts, geographic data issues, symbolism, and generalization. Emphasis then shifts to issues in GIS data structure, collection, and input. Once a solid understanding of these GIS foundation issues is achieved, attention turns to the analytical powers and applications of GIS. These topics are reinforced by a series of exercises dealing with local geographic data. Students make use of the ArcGIS geographic information system and involves map digitization, geographic data collection (using global positioning systems, satellite imagery, and aerial photography), database management, and spatial analysis. </P>

<P>Introduces students to the nature of quantitative research in geography and the spatial sciences through the statistical analysis of social, environmental, and spatial data. This research methods course is thus unique within the department in illustrating the analytic commonalities between human and environmental geography. Students develop a critical perspective on issues of measurement of empirical data collected or available to geographers. Students consider the implications for validity and reliability in measurement of social and environmental geographic concepts using quantitative methods of measurement and data collection. Strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to data collection and sampling of social, environmental, and spatial data are demonstrated. Students actively engage in the statistical analysis of geographic data to both describe frequency distributions of social, physical, and spatial characteristics, and to explain patterns of variation in outcome variable using statistical modeling. Students are challenged to undertake hypothesis testing and multivariate statistical analysis as well as to effective communicate the results of statistical analyses to readers of all subdisciplines of geography. </P>

First emphasizes the key role in research of a clearly formulated question, one that is significant and workable and is grounded in a conceptual framework drawn from the existing literature. Then focuses on the techniques and rationale of a particular method of research, which will vary from semester to semester. Examples of possible foci include statistical analysis, interviews, community-based and participatory research, content analysis, or the interpretation of historical primary sources. In close consultation with the instructor, students design, carry out, and report on a research project employing that method to answer a question of their own design. </P>

<H5>GEOG 251 - Media Frames and Content Analysis </H5>

<P>Mass media is a key set of institutions in modernity that shape our perceptions of the world, with important impacts on what we take to be reality. The media &quot;frames&quot; that structure how media is produced, conveyed, and consumed form the discourses that we use to understand mass politics and culture in our daily lives. This course provides students with the methodological tools to empirically study media frames through content analysis. Content analysis takes the stuff of media, such as music lyrics, news stories, or advertisements, and systematically analyzes the content for the explicit and implicit frames that represent the issues and perspectives conveyed through media. The course provides students hands-on training in content analysis through a series of workshops on content sampling, collection, coding, and analysis that culminate in a final research project. This course meets for the first 7 weeks of the term and may be used to satisfy the 0.50-credit methods requirement for the sociology major. </P>

In order to pay close attention to the systemic effects of events in the Middle East, case studies privilege the moments in between major wars that shook the region. Of necessity, the course focuses extensively on the period known as &quot;The Cold War.&quot; Analyses are organized around the careers of three fluids: oil, water, and blood. The first two are quite &quot;dear&quot; in the Middle East and have organized entire political economies. The evidence would suggest that the third has not been considered as precious, particularly by the great powers and would-be hegemons of the modern era. </P>

<P>GEOG 306 - The Geography of Happiness </P>

<P>Achieving some degree of happiness is a primary goal for most people. Certainly, a huge industry has emerged in recent years to feed the public's desire for ways to improve their happiness. There is also a rapidly growing amount of research on the subject. This course starts with an overview of the diverse, multidisciplinary scholarship on factors that may contribute to happiness. But the main goal of the course is to consider themes central to the discipline of geography: how do environmental changes, efforts to achieve sustainable development, and culture affect the geography of happiness? Do people achieve a greater sense of well-being when interacting with wilderness or by exploring nature in their backyards? Does environmental stewardship improve happiness? What roles do attitudes about food and leisure play in how happy people are? Students explore these questions via out-of-class excursions, films, diverse mix of scholarly and popular press readings, guest speakers, and individual research projects. </P>

<P>GEOG 308 - Authoritarian Capital Cities of Eurasia (Extended Study) </P>

<P>Certain spatial and temporal patterns of urban growth characterize post-socialist Eurasia, due to the distinct mark that authoritarianism has left on past and present capital cities throughout this region. This course focuses on understanding authoritarianism in the past and present capital cities of Russia (St. Petersburg and Moscow) and Kazakhstan (Almaty and Astana). While remnants of the Tsarist and Soviet built environments still strongly shape urban character, new urban development and demographic change, alongside other economic and geopolitical transformations, have transformed them since 1991. Rapid and changing patterns and styles of urbanization create a multitude of perspectives and experiences within post-socialist cities as our globalizing world blurs the boundaries between urban spaces, individual lives, and abstract conceptualizations of the East, West, or even &quot;post-&quot; socialist places. This course uses a phenomenological methodology to examine post-socialist cities as sites of socio-cultural and political-economic transformations. Using this framework, students analyze their experiences in photographs, videos, and journals/blogs related to the encounters with spaces and places in post-socialist cities. </P>

<P>GEOG 309 - Latin America: Critical Landscapes of Development </P>

<P>Explores the development experience of Latin America through examination of pressing environmental, economic, political, and social issues that currently face the region as a whole and play out differently across the region. The focus is guided by a critical reading of development theory, paying particular attention to Latin American theorizations and empirical experiences, and concern for the subjects, places, and scales that have been excluded from the presumed benefits of development. Mindful that Latin America's development experience is historically embedded, students examine the transformation of Latin American societies and environments through legacies of conquest and colonialism, processes of globalization and neo-liberalization, dynamics of rural and urban change, changes in gender and race relations, and transformations of political and civil society dynamics. These issues are grounded in case studies drawn from Central America, the Caribbean, and Andean countries, and Southern Cone, and Brazil. The course's point of entry is contemporary environmental crises and the role of natural and human resources in shaping the development experience of the region. </P>

<P>GEOG 310 - Geopolitics </P>

<P>Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of &quot;the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation.&quot; As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the &quot;closed system&quot; we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified </P>

<P>- various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th century, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time. </P>

<P>GEOG 311 - Global Urban </P>

<P>An exploration of contemporary urban geography and academic writing about the city. It introduces students to the ways in which urban geography has played a role, along with other disciplines that focus on the urban, in understanding cities and the issues that surround them. This includes an examination of how cities are conceived, lived, and represented. The course investigates the following topics: What are the various ways that people create, and attempt to materialize, their geographical imaginations of what they want the city to be? What are the ways in which different social groups make claims on space and place, and how does the scale at which these activities occur have effects? What are the critical questions to ask about urban landscapes today? How would you formulate a research proposal on such topics? The course offers a theoretical and practical framework within which to examine the city as a site of socio-cultural and political-economic transformation. In this framework, students analyze how the state, market, and civil society intersect, and how this has changed over the 20th century in the U.S. and other parts of the world. </P>

<P>GEOG 313 - Geographical Political Economy: Asia in Globalization </P>

<P>Contemporary sociocultural and environmental issues cannot be understood without a good grasp of globalizing, yet place-specific political economic contexts in which these issues are embedded. The course aims to prepare students with conceptual and analytical foundations of economic geography with a particular attention to the roles of states, firms, and workers in the increasingly interconnected world. A strong empirical emphasis is given to Asia, although other world regions are addressed throughout the course for comparative and integrative purposes. Questions asked in this course include: what causes territorial economic growth and decline? How do place-specific economic structures influence policies? How are &quot;the economy&quot; and environment interrelated? Does advanced technology make geography irrelevant? Does economic growth produce socio-spatial inequality? In answering these questions, Asia offers a critical empirical arena to test theories and hypotheses, many of which have been developed primarily in the Euro-American contexts. </P>

Addresses environmental issues from the dual perspective of gender relations and social justice to advance students' understandings of the fundamental relationship between human activities and our physical and social environments. To this end, students work across diverse geographies to explore (1) the social relations underlying environmental problems; (2) the ways in which gender, class, race, and ethnicity intersect in environmental issues; and (3) the social and environmental processes that underlie the construction of gender and the life-worlds of the individuals in those &quot;geographies.&quot; Students bring a global perspective to the issues by drawing out local-global linkages. Case studies are drawn from North America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. </P>

<P>GEOG 322 - Ecologies of the City </P>

<P>With half of the world's population living in and around cities, the needs of urban-based populations and economies dominate non-urban peoples, places, and habitats worldwide. This course begins with an introduction to political ecology, a body of knowledge combining political economy and cultural ecology. Political economy is the study of how different societies are connected globally, and cultural ecology is the study of the relationship between a society and its natural environment. Although political ecology largely focuses on places and cultures of &quot;pristine&quot; or &quot;native&quot; nature in &quot;other&quot; countries, this course turns to urban settings to explore how people understand urban areas and what their relationship to the environment in these areas is. Case studies of specific places (from small cities in upstate New York to global cities in distant countries) are used to learn about urban political ecological issues through readings, assignments, discussion, and interaction with local/regional experts on urban environmental problems. Students apply their knowledge about urban political ecology both collaboratively, in a final project conducted in a workshop-type setting, and individually, in a final term paper. </P>

<H5>GEOG 323 - Arctic Transformations </H5>

<P>The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing regions of the world today, environmentally, culturally, and politically. Rapid biophysical change occurs here today due to climate change, but equally noteworthy are cultural, social, and political transformations experienced by people living and working in the Arctic. People are under increasing pressure to change along with transformation of their biophysical environments, particularly as new actors express interest in the Arctic as space opening up to global transportation, mineral exploration, and trade and ecotourism. Within geography, interest in Arctic phenomena includes grappling with complex issues related to social and biophysical changes in this region, which often originate beyond the region but have specific meaning for the region. Students investigate three vibrant areas of Arctic transformation: cultural transformation occurring among indigenous and local peoples, biological and physical transformation of the environment, and political transformation within and related to the region. </P>

This course emphasizes the role of institutions, technology, and human behavior in hazard creation, as well as ways in which society responds to hazards of multiple origins: case studies center on earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfire (natural hazards); toxic pollution (technological hazards); and malaria and invasive species (biological hazards). A key theme explores ways in which society may mitigate the risk of environmental hazards and manage them more effectively. </P>

<P>The intellectual goal of this extended study is to address issues of both population vulnerabilities and cultural resilience by considering Aborigines in Australia, and specifically engaging the historical geography and the contemporary experience of the Noongar community in Western Australia. Three themes form the curricular program of the extended study. (1) Students study the historical geography of Aborigines in Australia within the context of European colonization and settlement, federation and nation-building. These issues are framed using concepts of population vulnerability, environmental impact, and cultural heritage and identity at the national, regional and local geographic scales. (2) Students study the impacts of national, regional and local policies directed toward indigenous peoples on Aboriginal families and children, given particular focus to programs concerning part-Aboriginal children, Australia's &quot;Stolen Generations.&quot; (3) Students learn the ways in which Aboriginal culture and 'care for country' has remained resilient across time, space, and generations. </P>

<P>GEOG 328 - Sustainability and Natural Resources </P>

<P>Uses social science perspectives on sustainability and sustainable development to analyze the production and consumption of major natural resources. Addresses the following questions: What are natural resources, and how do their geographies combine with those of wealth and poverty, of political power and technological and institutional capacity, to affect the potential for actions towards sustainable development? How is our understanding of sustainable resource development enriched by critical perspectives from the social sciences about the meaning of such contested concepts as sustainability and development, and about issues of equity, power, participation, property rights, and unequal impacts (of both resource depletion and environmental policies)? How can the three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) of sustainability better guide the production and consumption of natural resources, renewable or nonrenewable, in different places and by different actors? The topical and regional focus of the course varies from year to year; it may, for example, focus on oil (or energy more generally), on minerals, or on biological and genetic resources; and on specific geographic areas, such as central New York, Latin America, or the Arctic. </P>

In many ways, greater environmental concern from governments and international organizations over the dramatic environmental changes afoot in the world is a welcome development. But will the &quot;environmental security&quot; framework reinforce global inequalities and maintain the status quo? Or might it mean rethinking the very foundations of what we mean by &quot;security&quot;? </P>

To set the stage for discussing the geography of life, students first examine the earth's physical setting. This leads to consideration of the fundamental processes determining plant and animal distributions. The interactions among these processes are also examined, thereby introducing the concept of the ecosystem. The functions of an ecosystem are discussed with focuses on energy and matter flow, population dynamics, succession, and disturbance. The culmination of these processes is reflected in broad-scale geographic patterns. Thus, the characteristics of the major biomes are examined. Finally, because humans and the environment are inextricably linked, students explore several impacts humans have on the landscape, including fragmentation, extinction, and species introductions. </P>

<P>As an academic discipline, geography focuses on the nature and causes of spatial variation. This focus is wide ranging and includes human and geophysical processes. Although the scope of geography is broad and the interest and expertise among geographers varied, one commonality is the use of maps and/or graphics for spatial analysis and visual communication. This course provides students with a fundamental understanding of cartography, including mapping theory, technique, and application. This objective is accomplished through a blend of lecture and exercises that introduce students to the theory and philosophy of cartography, map and graphic design, and appropriate forms of visual communication. The course begins with an introduction to cartography, including its history, and proceeds through examinations of statistical graphing, map projections, map design, symbology, and thematic mapping. </P>

The first segment explores the evolution of GIS from a set of cartographic and data analytical tools used primarily by geographers to a more encompassing set of ideas and tools used by many disciplines to examine spatial processes. Included in the first segment is a thorough examination of issues associated with mapping and referencing the non-spherical earth, conceptual models for representing spatial phenomena, and data-quality issues. The second segment focuses on a select set of spatial analytical issues that can be addressed using GIS. These issues include analysis of continuous spatial phenomena (e.g., terrain), model building using multiple sources of spatial data, network analysis, and the integration of remotely sensed data in a GIS. </P>

The primary objective is to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. Most typically, image analysis involves generating landcover maps using multi-spectral data collected by satellites. This course begins by focusing on the physical principles upon which image analysis is based, including the principles of acquiring and interpreting electromagnetic data collected by non-photographic sensors. Students then explore the basic tools of digital image processing (e.g., image enhancement, contract manipulation, etc.). This leads to a consideration of the process of image classification. Lastly, students discuss accuracy assessment as it applies to landcover classification, and spend a significant amount of time in the geography department computer lab performing analysis on remote sensing data. </P>

<P>Earth's climate has fluctuated widely in the past, between warm periods and ice ages, and times of great drought versus wetter intervals. The planet currently faces abrupt climate change resulting from human-induced environmental modification. Paleoclimatology, the study of past climates and environments of the Earth, provides a long-term perspective on the nature of global climate variability that is critical for evaluating the sensitivity of the Earth system to past, present, and future changes. This course provides students with an overview of paleoclimatology by examining the use of proxy records such as marine and lake sediment sequences, ice cores, tree rings, corals, and historical data to reconstruct past climatic conditions. Dating methods are introduced, and seminal publications in paleoclimatology are reviewed in tandem with current research papers addressing outstanding questions in paleoclimatology. Throughout, students critically analyze their current understanding of past climates and environments, and identify promising directions for future research. Topics include abrupt climate change, human evolution and climate, biosphere-climate interactions, and paleoclimate modeling. </P>

<P>GERM 325 - Transnationalism in Contemporary German Culture </P>

<P>Demographic changes in Europe's largest country have transformed conceptions of its national culture. The discourse of transnationalism has emerged to address contemporary political and cultural phenomena no longer confined to the stages of nation-states. This course examines the transnational imagination at work in recent German cultural production, with an emphasis on cinematic negotiations of German and European identity. Factors contributing to these negotiations include the tenuous legacy of German unification, the consolidation of the European Union, and the migration of people to Germany, especially those with a non-European background. The course's method of inquiry is multidisciplinary: a focus on contemporary films is supplemented with historical background, contemporary philosophy, and political essays. To address the aesthetic qualities of transnational cinema, students familiarize themselves with the terminology and methodologies of film studies and perform critical visual analyses of the cinematic material. Participation in the accompanying FLAC section is mandatory for students wishing to earn GERM major/minor credit for this course. </P>

<P>GERM 326 - Germany and the Environmental Imagination </P>

<P>Germany is widely recognized as a global leader in environmental policy and green technology. To what extent does Germany's role as a pioneer in the global environmental movement have its roots in German culture? Building on interdisciplinary scholarship in the growing field of environmental humanities, this course offers an introduction to environmental thought in German literature, culture, and the arts from the 18th-century to the present. The goal of the course is to develop an ecocritical model of reading, focusing on the way literature and other artworks stage the encounter between people and nature in a range of different genres: fairy tales, prose, poetry, landscape painting, and film. Tracing the emergence of the German environmental imagination in key texts from German literature, art, and film, the course also examines the emergence of the modern environmental movement in Germany, and explores how literature and the arts contribute to contemporary debates about environmental justice, species extinction, and sustainability. Course taught in English with an optional FLAC section in German. </P>

<P>GERM 330 - Kafka </P>

<P>Kafka may be the most dizzyingly overdetermined proper name in world literature. Not only does it stand for the author, it has come to signify a host of political, institutional, existential, and aesthetic conditions. One refers to &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; experiences, sensibilities, or bureaucracies; situations, movies, the 20th century, and modern life are all regularly dubbed &quot;Kafkan&quot; or &quot;Kafkaish.&quot; The name seems to have a life of its own; but to understand what it means, students must animate Kafka by reading him. Students read, discuss, and think about a range of Kafka's writing, from novels and short stories to diary entries and legal brief, paying close attention not only to the texts and their various obsessions, but to their emergence in his creative process and their afterlives in translation and the works of other artists. Students explore the multicultural Central European milieu that Kafka inhabited and examine the global transmission and remediation of his work in its critical reception, multiple translations, and adaptations; its transmutation into a style; and its metastasis in popular culture. Taught in English. Participation in the accompanying FLAC section is mandatory for students wishing to earn GERM major/minor credit for this course. </P>

<P>Introduces students to a variety of German literary texts from the 18th century to the present, in their cultural and historical contexts. Through its exploration of topics such as revolution and social change; constructions of gender; national identity; migration and minority experience; and modernity and aesthetic innovation, the course considers the versatile powers of literature to interpret and influence personal and collective experience. The course also serves as a workshop in which to develop techniques and vocabulary of literary and cultural analysis. In addition to furthering critical understanding of German literature as part of living culture, this course will help students strengthen and expand German language skills in all four areas: reading, writing, comprehension and speaking. Taught in German. </P>

<P>GERM 465 - Genius and Madness </P>

<P>Since Plato, artists and philosophers have recognized the close connection between genius and madness (Wahnsinn). But how exactly does one distinguish between inspiration and mania? Why is it so many geniuses are also mad? And how do changing definitions of mental illness affect how one perceives the relationship between madness and genius across history? These questions are central to the study of literature, philosophy, and the history of social institutions. In this course, students delve deeper into these questions by examining a series of literary, philosophical, and visual works from the German tradition that foreground the relationship between madness and genius, as well as works by geniuses that may also have been &quot;mad.&quot; Authors may include Plato, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Hlderlin, Immanuel Kant, Heinrich von Kleist, Georg Bchner, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Walser, and Thomas Mann. This course emphasizes reading, speaking, listening, and writing German, as well as discipline-specific research skills. </P>

<P>GERM 475 - Romanticism/Junges Deutschland </P>

<P>German Romanticism and the movement known as Young Germany evolved in the years between the French Revolution to the &quot;March Revolution&quot; of 1848 and circled around the aspirations and disappointments of the revolutionary spirit. The literature of these years follows shifts in the intellectual debates of the times: the proclamation of individual rights, the crumbling of traditional social structures and the rise of new social forms, the plight of the lone individual detached from traditional moorings. Works we will read include folk fairy tales of the Grimm Brothers, the poetry of Novalis and Eichendorff, fantastic tales by E.T.A. Hoffmann, and the socially critical poetry of Heinrich Heine. </P>

<P>GERM 477 - Literature at the Turn of the Century </P>

<P>At the dawn of the 20th-century, central Europeans lived, debated, and created amidst great doubts that their world had any future. At the heart of a conflicted and paradoxical modernity arose a keen sense of the unreality and futility of human affairs. Yet modernity's seemingly unresolvable challenges—including questions about the political arrangements of diverse and multilingual societies, the constitution of the human psyche, the chances of human survival on the eve of World War I, as well as class, inter-ethnic and gender relations—spawned a furor of pioneering responses in the urban centers of Germanophone Europe. Exploring the resources of this rich period (1890-1924), this course investigates the cultural, literary, philosophical, artistic, and musical activity abounding in Vienna, Prague, and other sites of central European modernity. Readings include works by Zweig, Roth, Hofmannsthal, Schnitzler, Freud, Musil, Kraus, and Kafka. Focus is on reading and writing about central Europe will be supplemented by visual works of art, architecture and cinema relevant to the period. </P>

<P>GERM 486 - What is German World Literature? </P>

<P>What is German World Literature? This question highlights the relationship between the idea of a national literary tradition and a broader concept of literature that crosses linguistic, cultural, or national boundaries. This seminar focuses on theories of &quot;world literature/s&quot; and on primary literary texts written in German as examples of works that circulate through and reflect multiple cultural and linguistic contexts. How are the Grimm fairy tales mediated by Disney? What do we understand by the term &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;? Why did Goethe emulate the Persian poet Hafis? Do Senoçak's readers in America contribute to a new idea of German or German-Turkish literature? Topics include the roles of translation, migration, economic and media globalization, nationalisms, and contemporary and historical transnational identities in shaping world literature written originally in German. This course is taught in German, and all written work is to be completed in German. </P>

<P>The events that followed Columbus' accidental arrival in the New World in 1492 shaped the world in which we live today. This course explores the formation of the Atlantic communities as the result of interactions between European, African, and Native American peoples as well as the circulation of diseases, natural products, labor systems, imperial designs, economic policies, and frontier zones in the Atlantic world. Many of the consequences of this process of interaction were unintended. Students explore the configuration of European, African, and Native American societies before contact and the configuration of new communities in the New World; the slave trade and the establishment of the plantation complex from Brazil to South Carolina; the spread of Christianity in the New World; the development of scientific practices in the service of imperial and national states; the establishment of labor systems; and the different strategies of accommodation, resistance, and rebellion of the different actors trying to find/protect their place in the Atlantic world. This course intends to provide a regional framework for the study of colonial societies in the western hemisphere as well as for the study of emerging empires and states in Europe. (LAC) </P>

<P>HIST 219 - Oceanic Histories (TR) </P>

<P>It may seem self-evident that oceans have histories, that far from being timeless, they constantly change. Nonetheless, this is a relatively recent idea. This course takes this idea as its starting point, and in doing so explores oceans and coastal areas as more than simply spaces, but as complex historical entities. Marine environmental history will provide the main framework for the course, although maritime history and oceanic studies concepts--such as Atlantic and Pacific Worlds--will also feature prominently. The course gives particular attention to the period of increasing globalization and drastically intensifying human exploitation of the oceans since roughly the fifteenth century. It also, however, considers pre-modern, pre-industrial relations between humans, oceans, and marine environments, suggesting their mutual influences long before the period usually associated with major human effects on the environment.

Students learn the fundamental methods of historical inquiry through in-depth investigation into the histories of particular commodities while they simultaneously wrestle with important questions in environmental studies and political economy. They ask the questions: what was the nature of power and what was the power of nature in the past? (US) </P>

<H5>HIST 232 - The Crusades (EU) </H5>

<P>In 1099, a crusading army sacked Jerusalem, killing Muslims, Jews, and Christians alike. This act of savagery earned the crusade fame in Christian Europe and infamy in the Islamic world, prompting a crusade movement in the West and a military reaction in the East. The forces stirred up by these events also led Western Europe toward the conquest of Spain, Eastern Europe, Greece, and eventually the Americas and beyond. In this course, students study the causes, progress, and results of the Crusades themselves, as well as the new colonial societies that developed in their wake. Students focus on the transformation of four cultures: western Christendom, Judaism, Byzantium, and Islam. (EU) </P>

<P>HIST 233 - The French Revolution: Old Regime, Revolution, and Napleonic Empire, 1770-1815 (EU) </P>

<P>An overview of one of the most tumultuous periods in modern European history. France experienced a range of different governments, from absolute monarchy, to the Reign of Terror, to the Napoleonic Empire, a progression that was accompanied by an expansion of the existing war (from 1792 on) into a massive European-wide war. There were serious claims for citizenship and equality from working class men, from women of all classes, and from slaves and free people of color in France's colonial empire; there were disturbing acts of violence committed by crowds as well as by the government itself. The course is designed to introduce students to the major events and personalities and the political evolution of the state during this time, as well as to discuss some of the important historiographical arguments.

<P>HIST 241 - Tudor - Stuart Britain (EU) </P>

<P>In 1485, Henry Tudor became king of England. A second-rate power in Europe, his kingdom had been torn apart by dynastic struggles and civil war. By 1714, when the last of the Stuart monarchs died, everything had changed. England was now part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which included Scotland and Wales, and whose king also ruled over the neighboring island of Ireland. The medieval feudal kingship had been replaced by a well-established parliamentary monarchy, with many stops along the way. Britain was now a world power, at the center of a far-flung empire, and competing with France for dominance in Europe and beyond. This course will explore precisely how these monumental changes came about, taking a close look at British history over the long 16th and 17th centuries from a number of different perspectives: political, religious, social, cultural, commercial, and intellectual.

<P>HIST 251 - The Politics of History (TR) </P>

<P>While the discipline of history is often approached as a collection of static, undisputed facts, the past is constantly re-interpreted and re-written to suit the needs of those living in the present. Far from being an apolitical exercise or a straightforward empirical investigation, history is contested and hijacked by individuals and groups who seek to use it to advance their interests and promote their agendas. History is not only subject to intense and divisive public debates, it frequently appears at the center of both latent and active inter-group conflicts. Through close readings of key texts and hands-on engagement with contemporary case studies, this course aims to provide a broad overview of the politics of history. The scope of the course is global, and the methodological approach is multi-disciplinary, spanning such fields as history, political science, public and international affairs, memory studies, museum studies, and peace and conflict studies.

Readings and discussions range from 16th-century Turkish coffeehouses to 21st-century Starbucks, and from the prohibition by King James I of tobacco to contemporary debates on second-hand smoke. Other historical topics include the discovery and diffusion of coffee and tobacco; the establishment and spread of coffeehouses; early prohibitions on tobacco use; the connections between colonialism and consumer goods; and the medical, economic, and political debates surrounding these products in the 20th century.

This course examines the social, political, and economic life of the Ottoman state from its beginnings among nomadic tribesmen to the fall of the &quot;Grand Turk&quot; in World War I. Issues addressed include the organization of structures of control over such a large and heterogeneous population and the maintenance of a relatively high level of integration in society over time. The factors that led to the disintegration of this empire, including nationalism and colonialism, are also examined. (TR) </P>

<H5>HIST 263 - Cities of the Silk Road (TR) </H5>

<P>An overview of the cultural and economic relationships that developed across Eurasia from the 1st to the 14th centuries CE. The course focuses on the fabled &quot;Silk Road,&quot; overlapping of overland trade routes through Central Asia that connected China and Japan with western Europe. The impact of the Silk Road was as often regional and local as it was intercontinental; most travelers did not cover the whole route but remained in areas that were indigenous to them. The course examines a number of very broad themes, such as the interaction of nomadic and sedentary peoples, the spread of religions, cultural confrontation, and syncretism. The course is a challenging one for both instructor and students in that it covers an enormous geographic, cultural, and chronological span. (TR) </P>

First, students look at the internal organization of armies, their place in domestic politics and society, and their role in foreign relations. Second, they examine the impact of war on religion, economics, politics, and the arts. Third, because of its importance, violence was tightly linked to religion, literature, and popular theater.

<H5>HIST 269 - History of Modern India (AS) </H5>

<P>Surveys the history of South Asian from the expansion of the Mughal Empire in the early modern period and the rise of the British colonial power in the 18th and 19th centuries to the emergences of modern nation states. The course also looks at the different political, economic, and cultural trajectories that these nation states, particularly India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, have taken since independence.

<P>HIST 271 - The First World War (TR) </P>

<P>Was the First World War a &quot;tragic and unnecessary conflict,&quot; as one of its leading historians has recently suggested? Why did men continue to fight amid horror and misery? And how did total war rend the fabric of society, politics, and everyday life? To answer these and other questions, this course examines the First World War from a variety of perspectives. Attention will be paid to its origins and outbreak, its conduct by generals and common soldiers, its effect on women and workers, and its wide ranging consequences, both on individuals and empires. The course concludes with a discussion of how the First World War has shaped the world in which we live today. (TR) </P>

<P>HIST 273 - The Century of Camps (TR) </P>

<P>A little more than a hundred years ago, a new kind of structure appeared: the detention camp for civilians. Originally termed a 'concentration camp' (because it 'concentrated' the inhabitants of an area into a small confined space) and intended to be a shortterm expedient, the camp quickly became an archetype of the modern age, a tool relied upon by democratic no less than dictatorial states-and even by humanitarian organizations seeking to deliver aid. This course will examine, from a comparative perspective, the role, structure and meaning of the camp in its extraordinary variety of forms during the past century; its creation of a 'parallel universe' within which new dystopian kinds of social organization become possible; and the human experience of those whose lives it has impacted, distorted or terminated.

<P>HIST 313 - Upstate History (US) </P>

<P>Examines the rich political, social, and cultural history of upstate New York, with a focus on central New York in the 19th century. As the 18th century came to a close, upstate was a borderland between European settlers and Native Americans. In the antebellum era, the region became a center of the anti-slavery and women's rights movements—and an economic powerhouse where canals and railroads encouraged agricultural prosperity, industrialization, and tourism. Before the Civil War, utopian communities, religious experimentation, and new institutional forms flourished; remnants of many of these movements and markets can still be found on the landscape today. Students will complete regular public history labs - conversations and activities with practitioners from around the state engaging the fields of museum studies and public history. In the process, students will examine the theoretical and methodological challenges surrounding the preservation and presentation of local history in museums, historic sites, and public projects.

<H5>HIST 359 - Nationalism and Arab Identity in the 20th Century (ME) </H5>

<P>The concept of nationalism has dominated much of the cultural and political debate in the Arab world since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. For most of the 20th century, nationalism competed with other forms of identity in the Middle East, and many of the tensions between local and larger categories of identity among Arabs remain unresolved. Through this course students are made aware of the many forms of affiliation that have competed for primary loyalty in the Arab cultural and political sphere, and of the multiple definitions of &quot;nation&quot; that have co-existed. The historical reasons for the relative success of some interpretations over others are explored. The course focuses on issues of identity, interpretation, and organization that impact the region - and the world - even now. (ME) </P>

<P>HIST 362 - The Mughal Empire, c. 1500 - 1750 (AS) </P>

<P>The Mughal Empire was one of the most extensive and powerful early modern empires. At its height, the Mughal Empire comprised most of the geographic area of the Indian subcontinent. From the origins of the Mughal dynasty to the consolidation of an imperial order and later its disintegration, this course examines the complex political, ideological, social, and cultural processes that enabled the Mughal Empire to thrive. Students work with a variety of primary source material from the period, including memoirs, court chronicles, European travel accounts, and paintings. (AS) </P>

<P>HIST 363 - History of the Indian Ocean World (AS) </P>

<P>The Indian Ocean has been a zone of human interaction for several millennia. This maritime highway facilitated the circulation of individuals, ideas, commodities, and technologies, connecting the Indian subcontinent to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf regions on the one hand and to Southeast Asia on the other. This course introduces students to the growing historical field of the Indian Ocean world and explores several themes including trade, diplomacy, migration, slavery, piracy, European expansion, and various kinds of cultural exchange across this vast body of water. While the Indian Ocean shaped the history and identity of many cultures and communities, the main focus of the course is on the Indian subcontinent. Organized around themes that highlight change and continuity, the period covered roughly coincides with the emergence of Islam in the 7th century to the entry of various European powers in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the emergence of colonialism in the 19th century.

Begins with the prosperous &quot;high Qing,&quot; and then turns to the tumultuous Taiping rebellion of the mid-19th century and the political, military, and social changes it engendered. Then, the Chinese efforts to meet the challenges of the new world order first through a Confucian revival and later through embracing Western technology and ideas are examined. Students trace the development of the Chinese Communist party and the KMT, warlordism, China's involvement in World War II, and the founding of the People's Republic of China. Concludes with a look at the effects of the economic and political reforms of the past two decades. (AS) </P>

<P>HIST 378 - Systems of Forced Labor in the Caribbean (LAC) </P>

<P>From the moment Europeans invaded the Caribbean under Columbus in 1492, they regarded the region as a zone of economic exploitation from which wealth could be extracted using forced labor. The Spanish enslaved and rapidly decimated the indigenous peoples before turning to Africa for slave labor. Other European nationalities tried white indentured labor before also turning to enslaved African labor. After slavery was abolished, the European colonizers continued the pattern of exploitation through forced labor by indenturing hundreds of thousands of new immigrant workers from India, Africa, and China. Forced labor remained the engine of the Caribbean plantation economy until the end of the First World War. This course examines how these forced labor systems shaped the growth of the economy and society in the Caribbean, as well as the relations among the various subaltern groups that made up the labor force.

<P>HIST 380 - Emancipation, Forced Labor, and Contemporary Bondage in Africa (AF) </P>

<P>Examines the transition from slavery to freedom, forced labor during colonial rule, and contemporary forms of slavery in Africa. One of the moral justifications for the European conquest of Africa was the ending of slavery and slave trade. While colonialism led to the demise of the trade, slavery itself continued to exist well to the end of the colonial era. Finding it difficult to organize labor, the colonial authorities used forced labor with no or little compensation and, since independence modern forms of slavery are still practiced in many parts of the continent. Major themes include: abolition laws and emancipation in practice; colonial rule and the slow attack on slavery; plantation labor in East Africa; slavery as an international issue; forced labor, contemporary human trafficking and migrations.

<P>Focuses on a systematic study of advanced grammar necessary for oral and written communication in Japanese at the native speaker level.

Grammar structures that appear beyond JAPN 402 are covered and extended so that students understand systematic and comprehensive usages. Students concentrate on these kinds of advanced grammar patterns through textbooks and authentic reading materials, and learn to use them actively, accurately, and systematically in context. In addition, the study of kanji characters and vocabulary accompanies the study of grammar in order to reach the native-level fluency. </P>

Discussion centers on a close analysis of the novels, comparing individual and national responses to the Jewish 20thcentury experience. By including fiction written across Europe, North America, and Israel, while limiting the time frame to the years following World War II, the question of whether there exists one or more approaches to fiction that are characteristically Jewish is addressed.

<P>JWST 205 - Yiddish Fiction in Translation </P>

<P>As European Jews began to develop a modern culture in the middle of the 19th century, an important set of writers began using Yiddish for fiction and poetry. All these writers were at least trilingual: They chose Yiddish--always the lowest status of the languages they knew--because they loved it and because it was the language their audience could really read. This course looks at Yiddish fiction and poetry written in both Eastern Europe and the United States. Students study these texts both as singular works of art and as ways of mirroring the Jewish experience for Jewish readers. Students examine both texts and the multiple contexts (historical, cultural, religious, linguistic) that give them shape. </P>

<H5>JWST 208 - The Hebrew Bible in America </H5>

<P>The Bible is not only the best-selling book in America, but is arguably the book that has most profoundly shaped the United States. This course is an introduction to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in its American contexts, particularly American public life. In reading the Hebrew Bible, students ask themselves how these scriptures have shaped American politics, culture, history, and literature. Who has used the Bible and how? To whom does the Bible now speak, and what does it say? In what sense is the Bible understood to be an American text? This course presumes no knowledge of the Christian or Jewish Bibles. </P>

<P>JWST 213 - The Bible as/and Literature </P>

<P>What role does literary art play in the shaping of biblical narrative? How does the construction of the sacred text reflect its theological meaning? The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation. As students read through the canon they establish the boundaries of the texts studied, distinguish the type(s) of literature found in them, examine their prose and poetic qualities, and identify their surface structures. Students also consider the literary legacy of the Bible and the many ways that subsequent writers have revisited its stories. </P>

<P>Comparative scriptural analysis or what is now called &quot;Scriptural Reasoning.&quot; The focus will be on close readings of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Qur'an with an eye to common themes and differences. Students will engage in a comparison of interpretive traditions in Judaism, Christianity and Islam to see how particular scriptural passages are understood in the religious traditions. The course will also spend time studying the ways in which scriptural reasoning has been used as a form of religious conflict resolution and peace-building in situations of conflict in the UK and Middle East. </P>

<P>JWST 228 - Jerusalem: City of Gods </P>

<P>An introduction to the religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In learning about the three Abrahamic religions and their sacred spaces, students are exposed to key themes in the study of religion (scripture and interpretation, feasting and fasting, pilgrimage, sanctuary and sacred space, ritual and worship) and to the particular theme of each religion's conceptions of Jerusalem. The course foregrounds the ways that each tradition understands the city as a symbol--as a holy city, a city of God, a centre of the cosmos. As importantly, it explores how religion is lived within the city's sacred geography, investigating the religious practices and sacred sites of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in Jerusalem. </P>

<P>JWST 251 - Faith after the Holocaust </P>

<P>The death of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis in the Second World War represents a radical challenge to faith in Judaism, in Christianity, and in humanism. The course begins with a historical overview of the Holocaust and uses accounts of Holocaust survivors to articulate the challenge of the Holocaust to faith. It then reviews philosophical and theological responses to this challenge by Jewish and Christian authors. The weak as well as the heroic human figures in the Holocaust are studied. Those Jews who survived with their humanity intact and those non-Jews who helped them are the most important witnesses to the resiliency of the human spirit which we now have. </P>

<P>JWST 283 - Experiencing Judaism </P>

<P>Judaism is a dynamic religious tradition that has developed many forms during a more than 3000-year history that has spanned nearly the entire globe. Students in this course consider how Jewish communities from the biblical period to the present day have shaped their practices and beliefs within their own specific historical circumstances. Students read primary sources such as the Bible, the Talmud, the Zohar, midrashim, prayers, response literature, and philosophical and theological discussions. In an effort to understand the ways in which Jews have lived their lives religiously, students explore how Jewish self-identity, textual traditions, and religious practices combine to define &quot;Judaism.&quot; </P>

<P>JWST 303 - Jewish Fiction before the War </P>

<P>Focused on the great novels and short stories written by European Jews before the Holocaust. All of the writers--even Kafka, whose fictional world is non-Jewish--reflect a Jewish consciousness and a Jewish confrontation with modernity. Modernity in these works takes different and often conflicting forms. In some works it is revolution (the promise of communism as a solution to the Jewish question); in other work, emigration, Zionism, or radical assimilation to the surrounding culture, what that happens to be. Several books--most prominently those of Sholem Aleichem, Agnon, and Kafka--take up the question of God's justice. Several books deal with the loss of identity. A variety of 20th-century themes (political radicalism, bourgeois desires and bourgeois impurity, a desire to uproot and a search for roots) run through the texts, always in different combinations. All readings are in English translation. </P>

Modern reformulations of traditional Jewish ideas and religious practices are discussed as well as contemporary theological exchanges between Jews and Christians. Readings are taken from such figures as Mendelssohn, Buber, Rosenzweig, Heschel, Fackenheim, and Plaskow. </P>

<P>Focused on the creation and conception of gender within Judaism. Students explore the ways in which gender is built into the scriptures, structures, institutions, and ideologies of Judaism, into Jewish religious, cultural and social life. According to Genesis, from the beginning there were male and female. To what degree are these two categories essential? To what degree artificial? How do religion and tradition enforce the gender divide, and in what ways can they be used to blur the distinctions between male and female? </P>

<H5>LGBT 220 - Lives, Communities, and Modes of Critical Inquiry: An Exploration into LGBTQ Studies </H5>

<P>The course explores the lives, experiences, and representations of LGBTQ persons, those who identify or are identified as transgressive in terms of their sexuality and/or gender expression. Particular emphases may vary, but topics typically explore LGBTQ communities and families, cultures, and subcultures; histories, institutions, and literatures; and/or economic and political lives. Selected topics serve to expose complex cultural forces that continue to shape sexuality and regulate its various expressions. The course promotes the examination of new theories and methodologies in relation to established disciplines as it underscores the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields of scholarship. By examining sexualities, students gain an understanding of and respect for other differences in human lives such as age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. </P>

<P>LGBT 227 - Machismo &amp; the Latin Lover </P>

<P>Interrogates the intersection of sexuality and gender in Latin American and Iberian literature and film. Beginning with representations of Don Juan in 16th- through 19th-century Spain, students see how during that period of imperial expansion a particular brand of masculinity spread throughout the new world. The second part of the course focuses on writings and films from artists whose works draw on and questions myths of Hispanic masculinity by looking at non-white, female, and queer versions of the Don Juan archetype in Latin America. Lastly, students examines how the figure of the Latin Lover has been appropriated and critiqued by writers and directors in non-Hispanic contexts. These are analyzed together with critical works on masculinity, gender theory, and cultural studies. </P>

<P>LGBT 241 - Queering Education </P>

<P>LGBTQ youth have traditionally been marginalized in schools. K-12 education offers few curricular and institutional spaces where queer identities are affirmed and queer voices are heard. From sex education to the prom, most schools and educators operate under the ahistorical guise of heteronormativity--a term used to describe ideologies and practices that organize and privilege opposite-sex gender relations and normative gender and sexual identities. Using critical lenses developed by queer and feminist theorists and critical pedagogues, this course seeks both to explore how heteronormativity operates in a variety of educational spaces and how students and educators are confronting these processes by using schools as sites of resistance. </P>

<P>LGBT 303 - Queer Identities and Global Discourses </P>

<P>Queer identities are -- and have long been -- enmeshed within large-scale circuits of exchange engendered by the movement of people, ideologies, markets, and capital. This course considers transnational conceptualizations and circulations associated with gender or sexual nonconformity. In doing so, it emphasizes ways of interrogating queer citizenship that purposefully attend to dynamics exemplifying complex interactions on global and local scales. Rather than assuming a particular narrative, the course examines the way by which queer identities are variously constructed and contested. </P>

<P>LGBT 350 - Sexuality, Gender, and the Law </P>

<P>The course examines the effects of the U.S. legal system on the lives of the LGBTQ communities; the influence of religion, science, and culture on the laws affecting LGBTQ individuals; and the processes by which LGBTQ citizens may advance their legal rights. Constitutional theories such as equal protection, privacy, due process, liberty interests, and states' rights are applied to issues such as consensual sodomy, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ parenting, employment rights, military policy, and freedoms of public school students. The power of the U.S. Supreme Court to shape laws concerning LGBTQ issues not only for the present society but for future generations is also examined. Cases studied are supplemented with secondary works. These works include writings by traditional legal scholars as well as works by feminists, race-based scholars, and queer theorists to create a fuller perspective. Through this exploration into the legal reality of a marginalized group, students see how the U.S. legal system continues to evolve in its struggle to provide equality for all of its citizens. </P>

<P>LGBT 355 - Partners and Crime: Queer Outlaws in Literature and Film </P>

<P>An intersection of sexuality and legality in literature and film. Beginning with topics of LGBTQ activism, homosociality and homonormativity, students will analyze how certain bodies and sexualities come to be on the right or wrong side of the law and how these sexual norms are quite literally policed. Focus will shift to literary writings and films from artists whose queer protagonists choose not to seek acceptance but rather to move outside of the law. Through bank robbery, border crossing, terrorism and homicide, these figures threaten not only the sexual order but also structures of class, race, and national security. Students will inquire into the true nature of these crimes, and determine how their crimes are sexualized and their sexualities criminalized. These will be analyzed together with critical works on queer and dissident genders and sexualities. The course may vary between semesters to focus on different regions or periods. </P>

Students will study how the colonial discourses that shaped the earliest modern Puerto Rican imaginary continues to inform current political discourse. Through the study of a wide-ranging body of Puerto Rican work that includes literature, cinema, history, and politics, students seek answers to how national identity is articulated in a colonial context, how migration to the mainland has altered the cultural landscape and what kinds of collective cultural and political movements have emerged in response to the island's socioeconomic and political problems. Focused on issues of gender and sexuality to understand how these, along with issues of race and class today are linked to the island's colonial legacy, in order to develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships between nation, gender and race on the island and within Puerto Rican communities in the U.S. </P>

<H5>CORE 159C - Maya </H5>

<P>The term &quot;Maya&quot; typically conjures images of ancient pyramids and/or ancient civilizations that are now found in ruins. Some forms of popular media, particularly science fiction, even go as far as describing the Maya people as a civilization that mysteriously disappeared sometime around AD. 900. The Maya currently total over 7 million people in what is today Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. Furthermore, the word &quot;Maya&quot; serves as an umbrella term that refers to a number of diverse populations, each with distinct culture, language, and material culture. This course will focus on both the construction of the pan-Maya identity, and the numerous populations included within the concept, such as the Tzel Tal, Tzotzil, Kaqchikel, K'iche', Chantal, and the Lacandon, just to name a few. Each of these groups has distinct histories, which often demonstrated significant clashes with colonial and modem national hegemonies. This course also highlights how tradition, language, and identity are preserved under the forces of colonial and nationalistic domination and will also delve into the subject of changing traditions, as these Maya movements of resistance have integrated social media, rock music, and hip-hop to engage younger generations. Ultimately, the Maya provide a means of deconstructing the concept of identity itself by demonstrating how shared identities are constructed, contested, and negotiated. </P>

This is not a traditional survey course that gives an overview of the regional mosaic we have come to call &quot;Latin America.&quot; Instead, it illuminates how the very notion of Latin America as a discrete world-region has been conjured and politicized at key historical moments, emphasizing the underlying social inclusions, exclusions, and global relations fueling these multiple (re)inventions. In addition to the central themes of race, nature, and anti-imperialism, the crucial role of the United States as an interventionist foreign power also looms large in this story. </P>

This course studies literature, film, and music of the region to trace a socio-cultural history of the Caribbean. What are the continued effects of slavery and imperialism on the Caribbean? How does African-Creole culture in particular respond to these continued effects? How do tourism, advertising, music, and film inform/construct people's relationship to the Caribbean in the global present? </P>

How has such a diverse region come together, and been held together, as one nation? How have its conflicts and contradictions—of class, caste, ethnicity, language, religion and politics— been managed by its rulers and politicians? How have these conflicts and contradictions been captured in novels and on film?

The diverse settlement patterns, environmental and economic challenge/opportunity, explosion of art forms, and continuous creation of new communities often foreshadowed trends of the entire nation. Readings explore major themes and issues of California history, while literary and personal narratives provide insight into social and political realities, including the struggles of successive waves of immigrants to interact with the established populations. Artistic and architectural expressions that document cultural phenomena offer tangible examples of the creative forces that shaped Californian intellectual and physical communities. Sociological case studies as well as economic, political, and environmental reporting assist students to understand the challenges, failures, and victories of the composite California culture. Underlying all of this is a continuous study of the variegated geography of California, which has both offered and required substantial human choices. </P>

These cultures are studied in terms of their historical and political relationship to Anglo-American society and institutions, attending to Native Americans' resistance to attempted conquest by European or American powers, the creation of reservation systems, and the use of institutions (e.g., the Bureau of Indian Affairs, schools, missions) to change Native American cultures. Students also examine the response of Native Americans to outside pressures. Students explore other issues, such as sovereignty, identity, gambling, repatriation, land claims, and education, and their impact on North American Indians. Videotapes and Native American artifacts are studied throughout the semester. </P>

<H5>CORE 177C - Peru </H5>

<P>The Latin American country Peru evokes dramatic and conflicting images of spectacular natural settings, ancient ruins, cosmopolitan cities, shantytowns, street children, poverty and more. It is a country of extremes. This course offers an interdisciplinary inquiry into this ecologically and culturally diverse land. The course begins by exploring the distinct geography and ecology of the central Andean region (rainforest, mountains, desert, and ocean) in order to understand how these features have shaped the societies that inhabit the region of present-day Peru. This involves analyzing the evolution and organization of Pre-Columbian societies, paying special attention to the Inca civilization. It also examines the ideologies, institutions and practices introduced with the Spanish conquest and era of colonialism in order to understand their impact on indigenous society and their relevance to the state of underdevelopment that characterizes contemporary Peru. Study of present-day Peru juxtaposes rural and urban life, the ties between the two spheres, and the crisis conditions that enveloped both ways of life until recently. Specific issues include the internal armed conflict, the coca culture and cocaine economy, shantytowns and land invasions, oil extraction and indigenous resistance, among other compelling issues. Throughout the term, this course emphasizes the many paradoxes of this intriguing land. </P>

<H5>CORE 178C - Korea </H5>

<P>Designed for students to explore the culture of Korea/Corea. In order to engage in critical learning and dialogue, students look at a wide range of academic and non-academic materials from an interdisciplinary approach. Throughout the semester students delve into issues that have had a deep impact upon post-modern society, which include the cultural-historical and sociocultural foundations of Corea (i.e., social and political history and religious influence), international relations and influences on the economy, the social and political identities, and current cultural structures of North and South Corea. Some of the topics covered may include but are not limited to the Opening of Corea in 1882, Japanese colonial years (1910-1945), division and reunification of Corea (1945-present), the Korean War (1950-1953), North Korea's Juche Policy, South Corea's attempts at democracy and current governmental system, educational reform in South Corea, women's movement in South Corea, and globalization's impact on higher education in South Corea. The main objective is to draw the students' interests towards understanding the world from multiple perspectives, the impacts globalization has upon these multiple systems and institutions, and their individual role in the ever changing world. </P>

Yet Central Asia possesses a unique culture of its own, shared by nomads of the steppes and settled peoples of the oasis cities throughout the region constituted by the modern nation-states of Afghanistan, Kirghizstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan (and, to some extent, Mongolia). This course offers an introduction to this multiethnic, multinational community through the eyes of its participants, from medieval geographers to nomad bards to pan-Turkist revolutionaries and post-Soviet autocrats. </P>

<H5>CORE 180C - French Caribbean </H5>

<P>Martinique, a 400 square-mile island, is an official part of France today despite being 4200 miles away from mainland France. French is the official language but most Martinicans freely express themselves in Creole. The majority of Martinicans will declare that they are, first and foremost, citizens of the French Republic, but will also readily admit that they are Martinican by culture. What is striking about Martinique is the dizzying array of cultural signifiers that seem to coexist in a veritable braided community, in which it can be genuinely difficult to tell where one cultural identity strand ends and another begins. Martinique is thus a fabulous lens through which this process of negotiating and renegotiating of cultures, languages, and identities can be viewed, and can be considered a precursor to modern-day globalization. </P>

In other words, it is a study of the people, religion, history, and culture of the region, and also about the politics of studying that region. One of the presuppositions is that a careful, rigorous, and critical study of cultural studies can help one understand one's own assumptions, presuppositions, etc. Among the topics students examine are the multiple interpretations of religion, including sects within Islam, that exist in the region; a variety of cultural practices and various languages; and the effect of imperialism and colonialism on the area. Readings include what current native commentators are saying on cultural, economic, and social debates. </P>

<P>The Danube is Europe's second largest river: from its beginnings in the German Black Forest to the Romanian and Ukrainian shores where it meets the Black Sea, the Danube flows through and/or borders ten countries, while its watershed covers four more. The river serves as a unifying artery of economic, cultural, and international exchanges in the diverse region of central and southeastern Europe. The course structures its multidisciplinary inquiry around the river to examine the region's longstanding history as a neglected, maligned, and contested multilingual, multicultural, and multinational space. Culturally mapping the region by focusing on the river's peoples, their intertwined histories, and their cultural imaginaries, the course traces the turbulent history of the region from antiquity, with an emphasis on the 19th century up to the present, to explore the Danube as a quintessential site of cross-cultural engagement in the New Europe. </P>

<H5>CORE 185C - The Sahara </H5>

<P>The Sahara has loomed large in the Western imagination yet it has rarely been understood on its own terms. The Sahara's role in world history has been framed as a bridge or a barrier, the dividing line between Arab and African Africa. Such framings obscure the agency of the people in the Sahara and the land itself. This course explores the relationship between imagination and imperialism in the Sahara, problematizing the idea of objective and disinterested knowledge about the Other — other peoples, other places, and other histories. The central themes of this course are power, racism, and imperialism, which are examined through theories of Orientalism; neocolonialism and world systems theory; post-colonialism and subaltern studies; as well as feminist, gendered, and queer studies approaches. </P>

Examining the roots of Russian identity, students consider the images of leaders from Peter the Great to Stalin and Vladimir Putin, as well as the work and legacies of artists, writers, and composers. Another major focus is peoples' everyday lives during political and social upheavals. Students examine what life was like during the Stalinist 1930s, through the traumas of World War II (&quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot;), Perestroika in the 1980s, and the post-Soviet present. Students learn about the dynamic ways that culture, history, politics, and identity intertwine in any society. </P>

<P>An introduction to the interdisciplinary study of Africa and to the African Studies major and minor at Colgate. The goal is to introduce students to a major world area with which many, even highly educated, Westerners are unfamiliar. Africa is the original home of the human species, and the intellectual contributions of the continent and its people to the concept of a common humanity are tremendous, including agricultural and industrial technologies, artistic and aesthetic principles, and religious and philosophical ideas. Due to early patterns of globalization and European colonization in the western hemisphere, the Atlantic slave trade, and ultimately colonialism on the continent itself, Africa was configured as &quot;the Dark Continent&quot; in European discourses of the nineteenth century. </P>

Students and faculty work together to better understand the way in which the country of South Africa came into being, how that national identity has been a site of struggle and contestation, particularly in the case of the struggle to overcome Apartheid, and how South Africans are working to overcome the legacy of racism and oppression that has marked much of the social and cultural experience of South Africa. In doing so, students investigate the changing dynamics of race, gender, and culture in South Africa, with a particular focus on understanding the ways South Africans are actively reshaping and unsettling existing social identities and distinctions. </P>

Drawing on fictional works, art, music, and ethnographic texts, a significant portion of the course examines peoples' everyday lives in contexts of violence, war, and socio-cultural change. In sum, students grapple with an inherent paradox in the study of &quot;Spain&quot;: the failure to create a homogenous national identity and a coherent, commonly shared historical memory. </P>

In this course, students examine how the pre-colonial and colonial histories shaped social identities. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students analyze how people in West Africa express and reinvent their identities through art, music, dance, clothes, and food. The course draws further on film and literature to understand the specific experiences of West African peoples. </P>

<P>CORE 197C - Tibet </P>

<P>Examines the formation of a Tibetan identity. This is largely a recent phenomenon brought about unwittingly by the ethnocentric policies imposed throughout the Tibetan Plateau by the modern Chinese state. However, earlier processes were already under way before the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in the 1950s, which made the transition from a constellation of feudal polities to a nation possible. These included a common written language, common subsistence patterns (farming, pastoralism, and trade), Buddhism, participation in common rituals and festival (especially religious pilgrimage), a certain respect for the authority of the Dalai Lamas, and so on. Students examine these processes as well as the consequences of China's political and economic incorporation of Tibetan areas into its nascent nation-state. Specific topics to be explored include &quot;the Tibet Problem&quot; (i.e. contemporary Sino-Tibetan relations and conflict), the historic colonial and religious ties between China Proper and Tibet, religious life and everyday Tibetans, &quot;nomadism&quot; (or pastoralism), polyandry and women in Tibet, and Tibetans' encounter with modernity and the West. </P>

<H5>CORE 151 - Legacies of the Ancient World </H5>

<P>Explores ancient texts that articulate perennial issues: the nature of the human and the divine; virtue and the good life; the true, the just and the beautiful; the difference between subjective opinion and objective knowledge. These texts exemplify basic modes of speech, literary forms, and patterns of thinking that establish the terminology of academic and intellectual discourse and critical thought across many different societies: epic, rhetoric, tragedy, epistemology, science, democracy, rationality, the soul, spirit, law, grace. Such terms have shaped the patterns of life, norms, and prejudices that have been continually challenged, criticized, and refashioned throughout history. To highlight both the dialogue and conflicts between the texts and the traditions they embody, this course, taught by a multidisciplinary staff and in an interdisciplinary manner, focuses on both the historical contexts of these texts and the ongoing retellings and reinterpretations of them through time. Moreover, the course includes texts from the ancient Mediterranean world that have given rise to some of the philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions associated with &quot;The West,&quot; emphasizing that Western traditions were not formed in a vacuum but developed in dialogue and conflict with other traditions, some of which lie beyond the geographical area of &quot;The West.&quot; Common to all sections of this component are classic works such as Homer, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, Plato, and a Roman text. Complementary texts or visual materials from the ancient period, in and beyond the Western world, and/or response texts from the medieval or contemporary periods are added in individual sections or groups of sections. Thus, some groups of sections may have particular themes. These themes will be identified at registration every term. </P>

<P>CORE 152 - Challenges of Modernity </P>

<P>Modernity is a crucial element of the intellectual legacy to which we are heirs. A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course. This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity. </P>

<P>CORE 400 - Core Distinction Seminar </P>

<P>The goal of the distinction seminar is to complement honors work in departments and programs by giving select students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their honors projects. Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper relevant to the student's departmental honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways: 1) by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project; 2) by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or 3) by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students' departmental projects. To enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A- or better in the distinction seminar, earn departmental honors with the completion of the department honors project, and achieve an overall GPA of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation. </P>

<H5>CORE 100S - Sports and the Scientific Method </H5>

<P>In today's world of sports, how is knowledge obtained? On what principles are strategy determined, personnel decisions made, and honors awarded? The advent of computers and the availability of large statistical databases have moved the source of knowledge away from conventional wisdom to more scientific and testable ideas. Questions of strategy and team decisions can now be addressed in an empirical fashion, causing a major impact in sports. Behind this revolution lies the scientific method of inquiry, including the notion of falsifiability and the relationship between theory and observation. This course explores these ideas using examples in sports to illustrate more general scientific concepts. Students explore the impact of empirical knowledge on the games themselves, and how it has caused changes in strategies and team decisions. Finally, the students ask their own sports questions and answer them in a scientific fashion. </P>

<P>Our current use of energy is unsustainable. Fossil fuels, which were deposited on Earth over hundreds of millions of years, will largely be exhausted over the course of just a few hundred years. Global climate change makes our situation even more unsustainable—we need to stop using fossil fuels long before they run out if we want to avoid catastrophic environmental change. This course takes a quantitative approach to learning about our current energy use, so that students can understand how our personal choices and lifestyles affect energy use. Discussion includes how our energy needs are met in the future through renewable resources: what technologies are available now, what are their costs, and how much energy can they provide. </P>

Unfortunately, many citizens in our society do not understand the fundamentals of these environmental problems. This course -- designed for students without experience in other university-level science courses -- explores the chemistry behind some of our more pressing environmental dilemmas. Topics include some consequences of fossil fuel combustion (the greenhouse effect, acid rain, urban smog), the ozone hole, nuclear energy/wastes, and ground water contamination. The emphasis is on the science behind these problems, what we know about how the problems have come about, and what we can do, if anything, to ease the problems. This course is for the student who has not taken college-level chemistry, but is concerned about our threatened environment. </P>

The remote sensing process involves collection and analysis of data about energy, reflected from or emitted by an object. Remote sensing is used to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. After an introduction to the interplay among science, technology, and remote sensing, students examine the development of remote sensing technology. Students focus on the physical principles upon which remote sensing is based, explore the basic tools of photography and photograph interpretation, and consider the principles of acquiring and interpreting data collected by non-photographic sensors. Throughout the semester, students consider how remote sensing has improved our understanding of biophysical processes using a case-study approach to demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings. Finally, consideration is given to the ethical implications of remote sensing. </P>

<H5>CORE 104S - Fundamental Quests in Science: From Subatomic to Cosmological </H5>

<P>Where are we? What are we made of? How do we know? These are fundamental questions in science. This course explores these questions via several topics of much research in science today. It looks at fundamental questions at the cosmological scale, like the big bang, the structure of the universe, birth and death of stars, and the nature of black holes; and then inward to fundamental questions in the subatomic world, made up of baryons, mesons, leptons, and quarks. The exercise shows that the properties of elementary particles and their interactions are intimately tied to the cosmological questions. The discussion centers on what we know about these topics and how we investigate them. An important component of this course is the discussion of the outstanding puzzles today, like dark matter in the universe, the missing energy fueling its expansion, and whether certain fundamental particles exist or not. In exploring these questions the course provides an introductory coverage of the major physical theories: Newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, and relativity. How do these questions affect society and humanity? The course also examines some of the current controversies and debates. </P>

<H5>CORE 106S - Saving the Appearances: Galileo, the Church, and the Scientific Endeavor </H5>

<P>Four hundred years ago, Galileo Galilei turned his modest telescope skyward. The universe he discovered was a stark contrast to the universe described by the ancient Greek philosophers whose cosmology had held sway for over a millennium. Some 60 years after the publication of Copernicus' treatise &quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres,&quot; Galileo used his newfound insight into the nature of the heavens to support the heliocentric model of the universe. In so doing, Galileo challenged not only the authority of Aristotelian cosmology, but also the religious tradition and interpretation of the scripture by the Holy Fathers of the Catholic Church. This episode in the history of western science and the development of the Church is often cited as one of the original clashes between modern science and religious traditions. The discoveries, writings, and trial of Galileo Galilei will serve as both a focus and backdrop for students to explore the practical development of scientific thought and the near simultaneous invention and re-invention of the Church. In addition to readings, written responses, and classroom discussions, the course requires students to repeat many of the ground-breaking observations Galileo made using a hand-held refracting telescope similar in size and shape to the one he built. </P>

<P>Colors are all around and people tend to take them for granted. Throughout history, humans have employed colors in artistic and creative expression, particularly in jewelry, ceramics, textile and metal art and in paintings. Some colorants occur naturally. Other colorants are manufactured, and thus the result of scientific and industrial development. In this course, students explore the history and material science of colorants. The interplay between artistic expression and science/technological discovery is considered with emphasis on the materials used in textile art and in paintings. In the process, students find out how science can be used to authenticate artwork. Is a work of art an original by a &quot;famous artist,&quot; have parts been reworked by someone else, or is it a forgery? In addition to lectures and discussions, students participate in small group hands-on projects. </P>

<H5>CORE 110S - Discovering Biology </H5>

<P>This course examines the major questions that have informed human understanding of the living world over the past 150 years. Begins with perhaps the oldest biological question of all: why are there so many living things? Shows how Charles Darwin's brilliant answer forms the foundation for much of modern biology. By following the path of discovery leading from Darwin, students learn about a devout monk named Gregor Mendel, a feisty chemist named Louis Pasteur, and two brash young scientists named Watson and Crick. Explores the great diversity of life and how organisms adapt and change. The approach is student-active and hands-on; students work together to unravel a few of the mysteries of life. Intended for those who are interested in biology but probably will not choose to major in the life sciences. </P>

<H5>CORE 111S - The Artful Brain: An Exploration in Neuro-aesthetics </H5>

<P>Consists of an exploration in the aesthetic experience of art as it relates to the sensory and perceptual mechanisms of the brain. Many of the topics discussed are centered on the view that the function of art and the function of the visual brain are one and the same. Students thus consider that the aims of the artist in rendering a particular piece of art essentially constitute an extension of the processes of the visual brain. By taking this point of view (through an introductory understanding of the sensory and perceptual processes of the visual brain) students discuss possible outlines of a theory of aesthetics that is biologically based. Students are required to read chapters from different textbooks devoted to sensory and perceptual processes as they relate to visual art, as well as review articles from professional journals. </P>

<P>Close relationships are central to our lives; friends, parents, siblings, romantic partners, acquaintances, and coworkers have an enormous influence on one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The purpose of this course is to understand the processes that regulate human relationships using a scientific perspective. It will include an overview of social psychology theories of relationships research and an exploration of the current literature. Students will be exposed to a variety of research methods and will have the opportunity to design their own experiment about relationships. Topics include attraction, intimacy, attachment, friendship, interdependence, communication, dissolution and loss, love, and maintaining relationships. </P>

<H5>CORE 113S - How to Build a Baby </H5>

<P>If one were a highly developed, extraterrestrial scientist with advanced technology to engineer organisms from other planets, how would one build a human baby? What kind of brain would one design? What kinds of social, emotional, and cognitive predispositions would be included? What kind of environment would one provide? To answer these questions, one must determine what is innate and what is learned in human development. Although this &quot;nature-nurture&quot; question can be traced back to ancient philosophers (right here on Earth!), modern-day science has made great strides in exploring (and reformulating) this question. In this class, students first explore some pop-culture approaches to this issue. Then, they briefly trace the history of the debate to its foundations in classical and modern philosophy. Finally, students compare these philosophical and pop-culture perspectives to modern-day scientific approaches. This is accomplished through primary and secondary readings, class discussions, and group presentations. In the end, students may discover that the answers to the &quot;nature-nurture&quot; question are not on a planet far, far way - but rather closer to home than they have ever been. </P>

Why do some adults succeed in learning a second language, while others do not? Why are some Japanese unable to tell the difference between rice and lice? When a girl had no contact with a language speaking community, is she able to acquire her first language after puberty? Are bonobo chimpanzees able to learn human language? Students read books and articles that address these issues, watch films and have some direct experience of learning a difficult second language. Physiological, linguistic, psychological, and social factors that determine whether one succeeds or fails to acquire native and foreign languages are discussed. </P>

<P>Gems and precious stones have been the objects of fascination and delight for thousands of years. They have been worn as adornments and amulets to bring their wearer strength and invincibility, good health and luck, love and wisdom. Gems have been portrayed as having magical powers, and the desire to own these crystalline droplets of beauty has led to murder and intrigue, theft and deception, wars and suffering. This course examines the origin, history, myths, and lore of diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, as well as a score of other precious stones. Students study their chemical, physical, crystallographic, and optical properties; how they form; and where they are found. They assess the cost - in environmental degradation and human lives - to extract gems from the Earth's crust, and read about the brutal history and mysterious ways of the diamond business. Finally, students discuss and evaluate New Age claims for crystal healing, crystal balls, and crystals used as amulets and talismans. </P>

<P>For several decades, artists using a variety of media have consciously been using their art to promote environmental activism. There is an even longer history of art reflecting and perhaps affecting people's appreciation of and understanding of the relationships between humans and nature. Using examples from painting, photography, sculpture, music, film, dance, theater, poetry, and other media, including multimedia performances and installations, this course examines two questions about the relationships among environmental activism, science, and the arts. First, how do activist artists use scientific understanding in their environmental arts? Second, does activist environmental art affect environmental attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, and/or behavior? By addressing these questions, the course explores scientific perspectives, connects them to a topic outside the natural sciences and mathematics, and contrasts them with other ways of knowing. </P>

This debate revolves around two related issues: the diminishing supply of some resources and the environmental cost of resource extraction and energy production. This course examines the origin and geologic setting of Earth's resources, and how these factors influence resource exploration, extraction, and use. Environmental and economic aspects of resource extraction are explored. Students examine the public debate about resource management and conservation, as well as the roles of politics and the media in shaping this debate. This course emphasizes student-led discussions of case studies dealing with current resource-related topics. The purpose of this course is to create a framework in which resource issues can be evaluated, integrating the scientific and social issues inherent in resource development. </P>

The increased introduction of greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, and dust through human activities may result in a variety of regional responses, including warming and cooling, changes in precipitation and drought patterns, and rising sea level. Climate change as a force driving human history, however, is not unique to the 20th century. The primary objectives of this course are to present case studies that demonstrate the strong role of climate in driving human evolution, adaptation, and societies; and to assess the relationship between climate forcing and man, with a view toward understanding the potential consequences of modern anthropogenic impacts. </P>

In humans, repeated divisions of this single fertilized egg are responsible for the production of more than 70 trillion cells of greater than 200 different types. In this course students examine how a fertilized egg undergoes division, how the stem cells produced by these divisions become &quot;determined&quot; to form cells of particular types, and how these determined cells finally differentiate into the highly specialized cells that make up most tissues and organs. As this process is examined, students also explore the relationship between cells and developmental patterns, and investigate how genetic and environmental factors can influence (and alter) cell fate. Biological, social, and ethical aspects of the human manipulation of development are also considered, including examination of such topics as cloning by nuclear transfer, reproductive technology, fetal surgery, stem cells, and embryonic gene therapy. </P>

This course introduces students to the recent data on climate change and inferred causes and consequences of that change. Throughout the course, the way in which humans influence these changes and also the ways in which these changes impact humans are explored. The main focus of the course is the carbon cycle, specifically on human energy consumption, food production, and water use, and how they are linked to biodiversity loss. The many sides of issues (e.g., biofuels) are explored and debated throughout the course. The immediate consequences of global change are demonstrated in a required weekend fieldtrip to the Adirondacks in the third week of the classes to learn about the effects of pollution and climate on our local ecosystems. </P>

<H5>CORE 129S - Dangerous Earth: Science of Geologic Disasters </H5>

<P>Geologic disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, serve as dramatic reminders of the power of nature and the catastrophic impact that these disasters have on society. As recent events such as the 2003 tsunami in Sumatra demonstrate, these disasters can exact a terrible cost in both economic terms and loss of life. Society has a clear interest in understanding what causes these disasters and how to reduce their impact on human populations. Geology provides a scientific framework for understanding the potential risks and effects of geologic disasters. This course examines the science behind four disasters that pose major risks to society: floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and meteoric impacts. Students examine significant case studies to understand the types of data collected to study these disasters, ambiguities in the data, and how risk is estimated. Students also examine potential ways to reduce the damage caused by such hazards and the scientific, economic, political, and societal implications of these approaches. </P>

<H5>CORE 137S - Mind, Body, and Health </H5>

<P>The relationship between the mind and the body has been a topic of speculation and controversy through human history. This course explores this relationship by examining how psychological and social factors influence human health. Proponents of Western medicine have frequently dismissed a mind-body link as folklore; others, especially writers for the popular media, have claimed that the mind has miraculous power to cure disease. In recent years, scientists have conducted numerous studies aimed at discovering how thoughts and emotions actually influence physical health, and what mechanisms underlie this influence. Students evaluate this literature, learning about the effects of beliefs, emotional states (depression, anxiety), personality characteristics, and stress on people's susceptibility to and recovery from illnesses. Students also explore literature suggesting that psychological approaches can prevent or treat physical conditions. By doing hands-on experimentation, students learn how to measure stress and even how to control their own physiological responses to it. The course emphasizes the value and limitations of using Western scientific methodology to gain knowledge, and contrasts this approach with ideas from &quot;alternative&quot; and Eastern approaches to medicine. </P>

To answer this question this course explores the interrelation between verbal expression and such cognitive faculties as bodily experience, imagination, memory, categorization, and abstract thought. The study of language as a cognitive phenomenon is a relatively new discipline. It originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since then, cognitive linguistics has been a rapidly growing field that has both benefited from and contributed to its allied disciplines of cognitive psychology, cognitive anthropology, and cognitive neuroscience. The course begins by examining the advantages and shortcomings of the cognitive perspective on the different levels of language (e.g., sounds, words, sentences, texts, etc.). Students explore the connections of cognitive linguistics with the related fields that are broadly referred to as the &quot;cognitive sciences.&quot; No background in linguistics is required, but interest in linguistics is expected. </P>

To the Western mind, this practice of &quot;doing nothing&quot; is full of paradox. In this course students explore the practice, both academically and experientially. They study the effects of meditation on the structure and function of the brain, and on psychological measures of concentration, cognition, consciousness, and wellbeing. The course seeks explanations from research on mind, brain, and behavior, for how &quot;doing nothing&quot; can have such profound effects. Students sit regularly in meditation and use themselves as subjects of their own research on the effects of meditation. This course should give students a better understanding of psychology, scientific research, and meditation, and no previous experience with any of these is necessary to fully participate in the course. </P>

Linguistic activity is all-pervasive and forms the foundation of all other high-level symbolic activities. At the same time, many aspects of this activity remain deeply mysterious. How did the language ability come about? Why is it that children learn their first language with such ease, while most adults have great difficulties learning a second one? How is it possible to learn such a complex set of rules in such a short time, on the basis of a very small corpus of data, much of it grammatically incorrect? These and other questions form the subject matter of the field of linguistics and are explored in this course. </P>

<H5>CORE 153S - Acid Rain: A Persistent Environmental Problem </H5>

<P>Acid rain surfaced as an environmental problem in the 1960's and a multitude of studies were conducted in the Northeastern US, Canada and much of the United Kingdom and Europe that examined the sources and scope of the problem as well as the impacts on terrestrial and aquatic environments. The Adirondack Mountains are particularly sensitive to acid deposition because of their geology and topography. Many different collaborative studies were conducted with geologists, biologists, hydrologists and atmospheric scientists, and their results led legislators to enact the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Twenty five years later, we examine how scientists addressed skeptical concerns about the extent of the acid rain problem, how effective the legislation has been in recovery of lakes, streams and forests as well as efforts to mitigate the effects of acid deposition through lime applications that neutralize acid and restore chemistry to lakes, streams and forests. Students will gain an understanding of linkages between soils, forests, streams and lakes, and we will compare how scientists and legislators addressed the acid rain problem versus our current actions to address climate change. Students compare restoration &quot;success&quot; in the Adirondack Mountains to changes in precipitation chemistry and biota in other parts of the world such as Canada, different European countries, the United Kingdom and Asia. </P>

<H5>CORE 158S - Molecules that Rock Your World </H5>

<P>How could a collection of atoms, tethered together to form molecules, have played such important roles in colonization, health, environment, lifestyle, and so forth? We will look at 13 of the most intriguing molecules in history. As we explore these interesting histories, we will catalogue a few of the relevant scientific observations and molecular structures that give rise to the important characteristics of particular &quot;world rocking&quot; molecules. Molecular modeling, demonstrations, and lab-like exercises will illustrate the connection between structure and function. Students will also suggest and research other molecules that have impacted history or might be projected to have a profound influence in the future. </P>

<P>A mix of interlocking problems is reaching crisis levels on our planet, which is the only home for us and a rich diversity of other life forms. The bad news is the growing evidence that we are depleting the Earth's natural capital at unprecedented and accelerated rates by living in ways that are eventually unsustainable. This course introduces students to a variety of ecological principles that explain the nature of the environment. Topics include human population dynamics, matter and energy resources, ecosystems, and others. The master ecological concepts are applied to current world environmental problems to help explain water pollution, hazardous waste disposal, renewable and nonrenewable resources, etc. Environmental degradation and pollution are approached from an ecological perspective, but students also search environmental ethics and economic and political aspects for potential solutions. </P>

<P>Knowledge and beliefs related to sport and exercise behaviors are based on a variety of approaches, ranging from superstition to the scientific method. This information is also variously transmitted, ranging from verbal folklore, popular media, textbooks, and peer-reviewed science journals. Sport and exercise psychology is the scientific study of human behavior as it relates to sport and exercise. It forms an excellent canvas on which to view, comparatively, the strengths and weaknesses of using the scientific method to address issues of practical importance. This course provides a broad overview of sport and exercise psychology, explicitly addressing the scientific perspective. No prior exposure to psychology and no assumptions regarding prior athletic experiences. </P>

Have you ever wondered why some food tastes as it does or how food preparation can alter the taste of consistency of a dish? What is a balanced diet and why do we strive to have one? In this course students explore how understanding the science of food and cooking enhances our enjoyment of it as well as our benefit from it. Students look at the history and culture of human nourishment, and explore some controversial aspects of food and food technology, such as use of additives, genetically modified organisms, and diets and weight loss programs. If you have an appetite for learning or are just food motivated, this course may appeal to your senses. </P>

<H5>CORE 163S - This Old Earth: Scientific and Cultural Perspectives on the Discovery of Deep Time </H5>

<P>The antiquity of the Earth is geology's most important contribution to science. In the late 18th and 19th centuries new findings about the Earth's history and fossil record came into conflict with religious and cultural understandings of creation, evolution, and the place of man in the universe. These issues have been debated since Darwin first articulated his theory of evolution by natural selection. More recently, controversy over anthropogenic climate change has provoked similar questions: How long has our present climate lasted, and what has been the scale of climate change in the past? Knowledge of the Earth's vast age has reached past scientific debates and influenced all aspects of life, including religion, poetry, art, and architecture. In this course, students explore the changing cultural and scientific views of the age of the Earth and how these longstanding debates influence how science is seen by non-scientists. </P>

<P>For a long time, economics has assumed that individuals are perfectly rational in the sense that they are able to process an unlimited amount of information, make complex decisions, and predict future outcomes. The finding of a significant set of anomalies has prompted economists to seek for explanations outside of the perfect rationality model. The emerging field of behavioral economics is the result of relaxing the assumption of perfect rationality in modeling individual decision making. The course provides students the opportunity to think about their own decision-making process, compare it to what has been found in the literature, and then apply this knowledge to the application of the scientific method to examine a hypothesis of their own. The course provides students the opportunity to think about their own decision-making process, compare it to what has been found in the literature, and then apply this knowledge to the application of the scientific method to examine a hypothesis of their own by running a field experiment on campus.

Now more than ever, life on Earth also affects atmospheric conditions, with vitally important scientific, political, cultural, and ethical implications. Course readings, discussions, and lectures examine the atmosphere from microscopic and macroscopic points of view, exploring the atomic basis for atmospheric properties such as pressure, temperature, and transparency; investigating the physical processes behind weather patterns and disturbances; and examining some of the complexities of global climate change. The course emphasizes interactions between the atmosphere and humans, as well as interactions between science and other human endeavors. Students better their understanding of the atmosphere, weather phenomena, climate change, and the power and limitations of scientific inquiry. A term project allows students to study an atmospheric phenomenon of their choosing and to strengthen their knowledge through written, oral, and visual presentations. </P>

Students examine the nature of stem cells, as well as the limitations and potential for future work with these cells. Students then explore how gene therapy techniques have the potential to repair a wide variety of genetic disorders, but may also bring about the possibility of selective improvement in normally functioning bodies. Finally, students look at how scientists are developing techniques to grow organs in the laboratory to replace damaged or injured organs, and how bionic parts are being investigated increasingly as alternatives to biological replacements. Along the way, students consider the ethical and social concerns that surround each of these approaches, and explore whether current definitions of humanity will apply well to a future where we can increasingly manipulate fundamental aspects of the human body. </P>

This course investigates the historical and environmental construction of gender, the biological aspects of sex, the unique characteristics of female anatomy and reproduction, and the effect of sexually transmitted diseases and cancer on female health. Lectures, discussions, and in-class exercises explore the scientific methods used to acquire our current understanding of hormonal signaling, genetic inheritance, development, microbial pathogenesis, and cell biology that underlie these topics. Social and ethical issues that exist and are raised by the biological differences between males and females are also discussed, including hormonal therapy, in vitro fertilization, prenatal genetic testing, female genital mutilation, and the use of birth control to prevent AIDS transmission. This course is open to both men and women. </P>

<H5>CORE 174S - Applied Natural History </H5>

<P>Perhaps Janine M. Benyus says it best: &quot;For the 99 percent of the time we've been on Earth, we were hunter and gatherers, our lives dependent on knowing the fine, small details of our world. Deep inside, people still have a longing to be reconnected with the nature that shaped our imagination, our language, our song and dance, our sense of the divine.&quot; Yet as our lives become more digital, we become less connected to the natural world. This perilous journey results in an erosion of our sense of place and a disconnect from our deepest roots. This course focuses on connecting students to the natural world. Together students develop the skills to read modern landscapes and use both plant and animal analyses to interpret the history and ecology of forested regions. Students become familiar with Hamilton's local ecosystems and some of the more unusual regional ecosystems of central NY. Whereas students largely focus on plants, the course exposes them to techniques of plant, insect, and animal collection and identification. Students read extensively from the primary and secondary literature and spend considerable time thinking about how humans interact with their natural world. They look to other cultures and how they use plants and animals for spiritual and curative purposes. Finally, students put together conservation strategies for one of Hamilton's most unusual and threatened habitats: the carnivorous plant bog. </P>

<P>Even before the dawn of written history, humans left evidence that they enjoyed alcohol. Despite this long history, though, there is still much to be learned about alcohol and its consumption. For example, why do people drink? When is drinking considered a problem? How can alcohol problems be addressed and treated? While topics like these can often be influenced by media events and political agendas, the goal of this course is to approach drinking from the perspective of scientific inquiry. The course explores recent theories of alcohol use and methods in alcohol research that are aimed at answering these three questions. Students engage in a real, ongoing intervention research project in partnership with the Shaw Wellness Institute. </P>

<P>Social inequality affects us all. This course will explore what the science of social psychology tells us about how social inequality shapes the ways we think, live, and die. Because social inequality is about the relative status of people based on their group memberships, we will begin the course by exploring social psychological theories that help explain the centrality of our group memberships to our identity. As we will see, these group memberships can be based on many different aspects of our identity: race, gender, socioeconomic status, among many others. Next, we will explore what experimental data tell us about the sources of, and consequences of, group-based disparities. In particular, we will examine the roles of limited resources, identity, power, morality, and prejudice in perpetuating inequality. Finally, we will discuss the emerging literature on how to coexist more peacefully in an unequal world. </P>

The deliberate release of energy through different forms of combustion has changed the course of human social- and potentially, biological evolution. But where does the energy in combustion come from? How do humans harness that energy to do work? And how do storytelling and cultural perceptions of fire influence the choices individuals and societies make about what resources to burn, where to burn them, and what to do with the waste products? </P>

<P>MIST 351 - The Israel/Palestine Conflict </P>

<P>Focuses on the longstanding struggle between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as on the history of the way the conflict has been defined (e.g., an Arab-Israeli conflict, a religious war between Jews and Muslims, etc.). The course profiles episodes in the history of the conflict--and of the efforts to resolve it--in light of contemporary developments across the globe. The war of 1948 is analyzed in light of decolonization struggles following WWII, just as the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; of 1967 is studied in light of Cold War politics. In addition to focusing on flashpoints in the history of the conflict, the course also examines international agendas for ending it. Repeated US efforts to broker a peace are analyzed in light of geopolitical developments elsewhere. Students will become well-versed in the historical and social developments of the conflict and study the various treaties, armistice agreements, and memoranda that have guided efforts to bring it to a conclusion. They also study outstanding issues in the contest between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as current peace and armistice proposals. </P>

<P>NAST 313 - Southwest Native Arts and Culture </P>

<P>This course is concerned with the ongoing, and longstanding, debates concerning native art in the American southwest. What &quot;authenticates&quot; &quot;Indian art&quot; and why does it &quot;need&quot; such authentication? How do the older divisions separating &quot;craft&quot; and &quot;art&quot; intersect with the current issues facing individuals whose life work is now linked to the marketing of the arts? Where do definitions of &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;contemporary&quot; compete with each other, and where do they prove complementary? Over the semester, students consider a wide range of media: traditional pottery, contemporary clay sculpture, metalsmithing, drum making, weaving, dance, music, painting, and theater. </P>

<P>NAST 320 - Native Peoples and Modern Law </P>

<P>Explores the role of native peoples in the creation and ongoing development of modern law. It begins with an investigation of the use of native peoples as a representation of human savagery within early modern European political thought — a representation that allowed political theorists to depict law as a solution to such savagery. More recently, and more positively, it explores the important role that indigenous peoples have played in the propagation of religious free exercise rights and international human rights law. Focusing particularly on the legal negotiation of Native religious practices in the US, this course encourages students to think critically about some of the most basic tenets and mechanisms of modern secular law. </P>

<P>Language is a distinctive human ability that distances humans from the rest of the animal kingdom - including chimpanzees, with whom people share 98 percent of the same genetic inheritance. Although language is considered as primarily serving communication in its advanced form, it is also an important vehicle for thought, with the potential to extend, refine, and direct thinking. The interaction of language with other cognitive abilities is the central focus of the course. Students compare the communication systems of other species with human language, examine efforts to teach human language to apes, learn how psycholinguists conceptualize and investigate language-mind relationships, and inquire into the cognitive abilities of various types of language users, such as bilinguals and deaf and hearing signers. Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition. </P>

Practices of contemporary conflict are paired with the interpretive paradigms whose aim is to understand and resolve them. For example, case studies in terror are paired with the field of trauma studies; specific regional conflicts with theories of global networks; and contemporary mass violence with analysis of genocide perpetration. In the process, introduces students to important methodological paradigms from the social sciences, chiefly from anthropology, sociology, and geography, as well as humanities-based approaches from comparative religion, literature, and language studies. </P>

Students consider rationalist, functionalist, and interpretive approaches in the social sciences, as they relate to questions of peace and conflict. Students examine the specific operative theories that have emerged out of these intellectual traditions - theories of state formation, security, international norms, and transnational networks - as they have been incorporated into and further developed in the study of peace and conflict. Students test major theories on case studies linked to major world events. For example, deterrence theory is examined in light of the end of the Cold War. </P>

<P>PCON 240 - Waging Nonviolence: Theory, Practice, and Critique </P>

<P>When people think about the social movements behind struggles for revolutionary change or territorial independence, they often imagine armed insurrections, guerrilla armies, and terrorist organizations. Yet nonviolent movements are far more likely to achieve revolution or independence than violent movements. Nonviolent movements are also more likely to install durable and democratic governments after the conflict is over. These nonviolent victories often take place when movements abandon violence and adopt civil resistance as their leading strategy. To understand these global trends, this course investigates the dynamics of violent and nonviolent conflicts using theories of social movements. This theoretical understanding is tested using comparative case study analysis, student research projects, computer game play, and real-world simulations. </P>

<P>PCON 245 - Organizing War: Military </P>

<P>Governments make war but the military fights them. How modern militaries are built impacts their world – and ours. Concentrating on the US armed forces, this class explores how mission, thought, culture, and politics shape the military and its functions. Part of our challenge is to understand the relationship among these factors. This course discusses major themes in modern military studies, with a focus on military organization. It explores why militaries change and adapt – or fail to – and asks what exactly they are meant to do in the first place. Students gain literacy in major topics and controversies in military studies and major issues in current military policymaking, as well as learn practical career skills through practice creating executive summaries. </P>

<P>PCON 250 - Critical Peace Studies </P>

<P>Examines human conflict and attempts to understand the worldwide decline in warfare since the end of the Cold War. This examination is framed in terms of the original debate within peace studies: the minimalist or negative peace school versus the maximalist or positive peace approach. Whereas the negative peace school focused on techniques to interrupt or preempt specific instances of mass violence (e.g., through mediation, conflict resolution, intervention, and peace-building/peace-enforcement), the positive peace school advanced a more ambitious scientific and political agenda to prevent wars from ever happening again by understanding and addressing violence in all its forms (physical, mental, structural, symbolic, etc.). Students interrogate both approaches vis-à-vis the historical and empirical record of armed conflict. </P>

<P>PCON 260 - Gender in Conflict and Peace </P>

<P>Aims to make a feminist sense of contemporary wars and conflicts. Students trace the gendered processes of defining citizenship, national identity and security, and examine the role of the military in the construction of femininity and masculinity. One of the most prominent social constructions of gender is that of the male provider/warrior and the female caregiver/peacemaker. The making of war depends in large part on the maintenance of this simplistic conceptualization. In addition, the inequalities and power imbalances that lead to situations of conflict, at both macro- and micro-levels, reflect and reinforce the structural and discursive inequality between men and women. The class is interdisciplinary and gives equal weight to theory and practice while drawing on writings by local and global theorist and activists. </P>

<P>PCON 301 - International Human Rights and Advocacy </P>

<P>The gap between the promise of international human rights law and its actual practice is vast. For many advocates and activists, the gap is a source of frustration as international human rights laws and norms rarely translate into basic protections at the level of the individual. This course is designed to make students aware of the contentious nature of human rights, both in theory and in practice. It is premised on the idea that human rights are constantly claimed and developed, if not made anew, by multiple actors--whether as rights-holders, advocates, or otherwise, and that this takes place in the context of intense struggle between state and non-state actors. Students examine both the international human rights regime and the struggle for human rights, and how they interact in practice. The course takes a purposeful right-based and victim-centered approach, with the goal of introducing students to the profession of human rights advocacy. </P>

Drawing from multiple scholarly traditions, it compares the concrete geographical organization of these illicit networks - that is, where and how they become grounded - and asks the following questions: What are the relationships of these illegal activities to legal circuits of power and profit? In what ways are transnational criminal networks redefining the nature of contemporary violence and the meaning of peace? </P>

<P>PCON 310 - Geopolitics </P>

<P>Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of &quot;the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation.&quot; As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the &quot;closed system&quot; we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified </P>

<P>- various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time. </P>

<P>The first purpose of the course is to demonstrate the central importance of media in defining the reality of war, peace, and violence in modern culture. The second goal is to introduce, in a selective manner, film, art, and written works that shaped these definitions. The primary framework is chronological, beginning with a survey of images of war and peace in art, covering in detail World War I and World War II, and ending with current images of war and of preparations for nuclear war. The secondary framework distinguishes types or degrees of war: World War I and World War II, civil wars (Spain) and genocide (the Armenians, the Jews in Europe); struggles of national liberation (Vietnam and Algeria); and prospects of global holocaust, this last creating new imagery - both positive and negative - in art, poetry, fiction, and film. </P>

<P>PCON 322 - Weapons and War: Interdisciplinary Perspectives </P>

<P>Mustard gas, airpower, submarines, A-bombs, Agent Orange, landmines, terror wars, &quot;Star Wars&quot;: weapons technology profoundly shaped the science, politics, and culture of the last century. This course explores the myriad effects of the production, deployment, and use of weapons. Specifically, the course considers how the horizons of science and technology have been shaped by the quest for ever-more-powerful or sophisticated weaponry; how the creation of new weapons changes the nature of war and peace; how new weapons may impact lives and the planet; terror as a weapon, and scientific and social responses to it; the role of media images in the public consciousness of weaponry and war; and impacts of the global arms trade. While critically theorizing the social, environmental, and philosophical impacts of war over the past century, the course also examines the place of global ethics in discussions about weapons and war. </P>

<P>PCON 327 - Australia's Stolen Generations: The Legacies of Carrolup (Extended Study) </P>

<P>The intellectual goal of this extended study course is to address issues of both population vulnerabilities and cultural resilience by considering Aborigines in Australia, and specifically engaging the historical geography and the contemporary experience of the Noongar community in Western Australia. Three themes form the curricular program of the extended study. (1) Students will study the historical geography of Aborigines in Australia within the context of European colonization and settlement, federation and nation-building. These issues will be framed using concepts of population vulnerability, environmental impact, and cultural heritage and identity at the national, regional and local geographic scales. (2) Students study the impacts of national, regional and local policies directed toward indigenous peoples on Aboriginal families and children, given particular focus to programs concerning part-Aboriginal children, Australia's Stolen Generations. (3) Students learn the ways in which Aboriginal culture and &quot;care for country&quot; has remained resilient across time, space, and generations. </P>

<H5>PCON 329 - Environmental Security </H5>

<P>About how the environment poses one of the most important security threats of the 21st century. From an interdisciplinary perspective, introduces students to the different ways that climate change and environmental problems more generally are presenting new kinds of security threats. In many ways, greater environmental concern from governments and international organizations over the dramatic environmental changes afoot in the world is a welcome development. But will the &quot;environmental security&quot; framework reinforce global inequalities and maintain the status quo? Or might it mean rethinking the very foundations of what we mean by &quot;security&quot;? </P>

<P>PCON 333 - Religious Faith and Social Ethics </P>

<P>Social ethics pursues questions about how human societies ought to organize themselves and their relations to other communities in order to realize human values. For many people around the world, religious faith provides the ultimate framework for value decisions. Texts include works by earlier religious leaders of movements for social-political-economic justice (e.g., Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.) as well as very recent works addressing current issues such as ethnic/international/religious conflict, environmental devastation, globalization, and religious terrorism. In addition, one or two texts develop basic models for religious social ethics. </P>

<P>PCON 340 - Terror and Counter - Terror: Histories and Logics of Asymmetric Warfare </P>

<P>For as long as empires and states have been going to war, people have been fighting them with the tactics and technologies now known as terrorism and guerrilla warfare. Asymmetric warfare, however, is no mere historical artifact. It dominates headlines as much as it confounds leaders around the world. Central to this course are several in depth case studies of counter-insurgency and terrorism, including France in Algeria and Indochina; the British in Malaya, East Africa and Northern Ireland; state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War; and the United States in the Philippines, Vietnam, and, after September 11, 2001, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The evolution of non-state terrorism — from the violent acts of Anarchists in the late 19th Century to the potentially apocalyptic terrorism of radical religious groups the early 21st Century — also comes under scrutiny. From Clausewitz to General Petraeus, from Mao Zedong to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, this class explores how asymmetric war is lived and understood by various observers and participants. </P>

<P>PCON 341 - War and the Shaping of American Politics </P>

<P>Examines the impact of warfare, expansion, and national security policy on the development of domestic American institutions and politics since the Revolution. War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the &quot;military-industrial complex;&quot; and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system. Readings will engage such topics from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain ranging over several centuries. </P>

<P>PCON 345 - Transitional and Historical Justice </P>

<P>In what ways and under what conditions do states pursue justice for past wrongs? Is democracy credible without confronting the abuses of previous regimes? This course examines the theories and practices of transitional and historical justice since 1945. It presents a global line-up of case studies, which students evaluate in a comparative framework. Specific topics include Post-WWII Germany, Latin America, South Africa, Rwanda, Eastern Europe after 1989, Cambodia, Australia, and the United States. </P>

<P>PCON 351 - The Israel/Palestine Conflict </P>

<P>Focuses on the longstanding struggle between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as on the history of the way the conflict has been defined (e.g., an Arab-Israeli conflict, a religious war between Jews and Muslims, etc.). The course profiles episodes in the history of the conflict--and of the efforts to resolve it--in light of contemporary developments across the globe. The war of 1948 is analyzed in light of decolonization struggles following WWII, just as the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; of 1967 is studied in light of Cold War politics. In addition to focusing on flashpoints in the history of the conflict, the course also examines international agendas for ending it. Repeated US efforts to broker a peace are analyzed in light of geopolitical developments elsewhere. Students will become well-versed in the historical and social developments of the conflict and study the various treaties, armistice agreements, and memoranda that have guided efforts to bring it to a conclusion. They also study outstanding issues in the contest between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as current peace and armistice proposals. </P>

<P>PCON 355 - Rwanda since the 1994 Genocide </P>

<P>Assesses the Rwandan experience of post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation to ask how sustainable is the country's post-genocide recovery? Principally concerned with understanding how to do field research in difficult settings such as post-genocide Rwanda. Using the 'do no harm' framework of doing research with individuals who have lived through mass violence, students are equipped to undertake research in foreign field settings beyond the Rwandan case. In particular, students learn to design a 'human subjects' research proposal, rooted in The Belmont Report of ethical research and guidelines for research involving human subjects. Using Rwanda since the 1994 genocide as a case study, these principles will be studied to highlight their shortcomings in the context of research in post-conflict societies, while highlighting the importance of ethical research methods. </P>

<P>PCON 358 - Transnational Politics </P>

<P>Examines the segment of world politics that includes interactions and transactions between actors who are not representatives of governments or intergovernmental institutions. Non-state actors as diverse as global social movements, multinational corporations, religious communities, and even terrorist networks are now recognized as playing crucial roles on the world's political stage. This course focuses on a variety of these transnational actors, as we seek to stretch the limits of state-based approaches, and emphasize the rich variety of relationships and interactions that characterizes contemporary world politics. </P>

<P>PCON 368 - After Genocide: Memory and Representation </P>

<P>An investigation of the impact of genocide on the self and the imagination's representations in literature, film, and art. Primary texts include poetry, memoir, video testimony, film, and visual art. Scholarly methodology involves readings of literary criticism and theoretical work in the study of trauma, literary theory, and testimony. Among the questions the course asks are: How does trauma shape imagination and open up access to the site of disaster that is now carried in fragments which inform memory? How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides. </P>

<P>PHIL 214 - Medical Ethics </P>

<P>Addresses urgent moral questions that arise in the field of medicine. Some of these are long standing. Is health strictly a biological concept, or do cultural and social norms in part determine what is good health? Should doctors act solely for the goal of improving their patients' health, or is their central obligation to respect patient autonomy? Other questions are more recent. When exactly is a person dead, such that withdrawing life-saving equipment is appropriate? Should parents and doctors take steps to see that their children are born with more desirable traits and characteristics? Students learn how philosophic argument can help illuminate these and related issues. </P>

<P>PHIL 226 - Philosophy of Religion </P>

<P>Can the existence of God be proven? Can it be disproven? What is the relationship between faith and reason? Does evil provide strong evidence against the existence of God? How should we think about the relationship between creation and evolution -- and about the relationship between science and religion generally? Does the Christian notion of the Trinity make any sense? What about the idea of Original Sin or the Atonement? Students seek reasoned answers to many of these questions by evaluating the work of philosophers who address them. Students encounter both classical and contemporary authors, though the class focuses more on perspicacious presentations of these issues rather than on their historical development. </P>

<P>PHIL 302 - Modern Philosophy (MF) </P>

<P>The rise of modern science together with the Reformation's challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church created an era of intense intellectual and cultural ferment in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The philosophy of this period is called 'modern' because it made a distinct break with older traditions and because the questions it asked remain the central issues for philosophers today. Studying modern philosophy will help students think creatively about what there is, what we are, and what we can know. Readings will be selected from classic works by Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Hume, and Kant. </P>

<P>PHIL 303 - Medieval Philosophy (MF) </P>

<P>Medieval philosophy involved the absorption and transformation of Greek and Hellenistic thought by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers, often in relations of mutual influence. The period is crucial not only for its project of reconciling reason and faith but also for philosophical insights, arguments, and formulations that have remained influential in several of the main areas of philosophy. The course focuses on questions concerning freedom of the will, the nature of moral requirements and obligation, the role of rational considerations in morality, the virtues, and ideals of human excellence. Students read figures from the three faith traditions and explore their interactions and mutual influences, as well as their differences. Coverage of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers is roughly equal, and students look at the Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Aristotelian background to their thought as well as the new directions in which they took philosophy. </P>

<P>German Idealism continues to be one of the most influential movements in philosophy, leaving its mark on many different fields of thought and experience, including epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, politics, and religion. Designed as an overview of the thought of the major representatives of German Idealism: Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Students will examine the problems that motivated the emergence and development of this philosophical tradition, and the new forms of philosophical argument that each of these thinkers employed in order to address these problems. In doing so, students will see that there is a sense in which Kant can be considered the father of Existentialism. The topics discussed include the doctrine of transcendental idealism, the nature and possibility of knowledge, the ground of moral obligation, human freedom, and religious belief. No prior familiarity with these issues or thinkers will be assumed. </P>

<P>Considers philosophical questions about the nature of the social sciences as well as philosophical questions prompted by the results and methods of the social sciences. These questions include: Do the natural sciences offer an appropriate model for the social sciences, or is there something distinctive about human phenomena that requires a fundamentally different mode of inquiry and style of explanation? Are the reasons for which we act also the causes of our actions, or are reason-based and cause-based explanations of human behavior fundamentally distinct? Are economists correct in their assumptions about the rationality of economic agents? Is it possible, or desirable, to conduct social scientific research in a value-neutral fashion? If not, what are the consequences for the objectivity of the social sciences? Are our values and moral attitudes themselves merely the effects of natural selection, as evolutionary psychologists maintain? Readings are drawn not only from philosophy, but also from sociology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociobiology. </P>

<P>Nations increasingly come into contact with one another in a common international arena, and these encounters raise a host of important moral questions: Are there moral standards that apply across all human communities, and if so, how specific are they? Do all human beings have rights, and if they do, what are they? What duties do wealthy countries have to aid poor ones? Are there moral constraints on how war must be conducted, and if so, what are they? In this course students engage with the work of contemporary theorists exploring these and related questions. </P>

<P>PHIL 320 - 20th-Century Analytic Philosophy (M&amp;E) </P>

<P>Employs the tools of analytic philosophy to address the large topic of the mind, the world, and the relation between them; students also explore the closely related topics of how our concepts get their content and how our language gets its meaning. By analyzing both our concepts and our experience, students will try to answer questions like: What is the relation between experience and the world beyond the mind? Do beliefs about the world amount to knowledge? Is the content of experience conceptual – and so fully expressible in language – or does experience have a richness that always surpasses the expressive power of language? Where do concepts come from? What fixes their content, and what fixes the meaning of the words that express them? If the content of language is based in part on experience, can one understand the language of someone whose experience is different? Course readings will include works by Russell, Carnap, Quine, Sellars, Davidson, and McDowell. </P>

<H5>PHIL 335 - Contemporary Epistemology (M&amp;E) </H5>

<P>Examines contemporary theories of how knowledge claims are justified, and also how these theories respond to skeptical challenges. This involves detailing fundamental strategies of epistemic justification such as foundationalism, coherentism, and naturalism. Students also inquire into what makes a body of beliefs a structure of knowledge and consider how the interpretation of rationality is related to these questions of justification. </P>

<H5>PHIL 340 - Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </H5>

<P>A systematic study of central issues involved in theorizing about reality at the most general level. Is the world a world of substances or a world of events? What is the nature of causation? Do concepts and statements refer to the world as it is in itself, or is such a notion idle or incoherent? How are such things as possibility and necessity and laws of nature to be understood? The topics are handled in a way that stresses the historical persistence of the debates over these issues but focuses on recent and contemporary discussions of the topics. </P>

<P>PHIL 341 - Philosophy of Mind (M&amp;E) </P>

<P>Examines the historical and contemporary debates about the nature of the mind. These questions are considered: How do minds (or their states or products) manage to be about things? Are all minds conscious? How serious is the difference between first-person and third-person perspectives on mental activity? What beyond consciousness is required for self-hood? What grounds our concept of mental health? What kind of mind makes individuals responsible for their behavior? </P>

<P>PHIL 342 - Philosophy of Language (M&amp;E) </P>

<P>Examines major topics and insights in the philosophy of language from its modern inception in the late 19th century to the present. Core questions include: How does linguistic meaning relate to how people use language to communicate? What is meaning's relationship to concepts like reference, truth, verification and use? Is there a systematic theory that can generate the meaning of every sentence in a language? In answering the above questions, students master the logical and conceptual tools for analyzing particular parts of language, which may include names, definite descriptions, demonstratives, metaphors, slurs, and other interesting linguistic expressions. Among the thinkers discussed are Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Austin, Grice, Quine, Searle, Davidson, and Kripke. </P>

<P>PHIL 343 - Topics in Moral Theory (VT) </P>

<P>Moral theory concerns what makes acts right or wrong, what makes people good or bad. In addressing these issues, the course also considers the following questions: Do moral standards apply universally, or are they relative to one's culture, religion, or other moral framework? Can we reconcile the impartiality of morality with the partiality we feel toward certain people, such as parents, spouses, or children? Are there ethical principles that apply in all circumstances, or is morality fundamentally a case-by-case affair? This course centers primarily on contemporary approaches to these questions, with the aim of enabling students to address these questions critically and rigorously. </P>

<P>PHIL 345 - Topics in African-American Philosophy (VT) </P>

<P>An introduction to issues in African-American philosophy. In particular, it explores the political and ideological goals of leading intellectuals from the 19th century to the present. From DuBois and Delany to the black power movement of the 1960s, analysis of African-American experiences has produced divergent strategies intended to better the condition of black communities in America. The course investigates nationalist strategies and their roots in notions of black identity as they have been developed through the writings of intellectuals, artists, and political figures. It also addresses challenges as to whether or not nonintegrationist strategies can be used to achieve social equality. Authors include Elizabeth Anderson, Anthony Appiah, Countée Cullen, Martin Delany, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Alain Locke, Claude McKay, Tommie Shelby, Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. </P>

<P>PHIL 360 - Feminist Philosophy </P>

<P>Explores questions at the intersection of feminist philosophy and the theory of knowledge (epistemology). How have gendered assumptions influenced philosophical views about what knowledge is and how knowledge is best pursued?  What roles, if any, should considerations of gender play in our theories of knowledge? In addition to these general questions, students address issues in feminist philosophy of science, specifically issues concerning the scientific study of sexual differences in behavior and brain structure. The role of testimony in the transmission of knowledge is also considered. Feminist epistemologists and philosophers of language have explored ways in which gender affects the assessment of testimony as trustworthy. Patterns of acceptance of testimony matter for how the claims people make—in law courts and elsewhere—are heard (or not) by others. Concludes by considering what this means for the proper philosophical treatment of testimony about personal experience. </P>

<P>PHIL 371 - Scottish Philosophy and the Fact-Value Distinction (Study Group) </P>

<P>The distinctions between fact and value, reason and emotion, and objectivity and subjectivity, have long and varied histories. This course examines the role those distinctions played in two thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment: David Hume and Adam Smith. The motivations for and benefits of these distinctions are explored, with special attention paid to Hume's concerns about religious &quot;enthusiasm.&quot; Rigid versions of these distinctions have, however been criticized for their serious costs in both epistemology and ethics. The course engages recent major criticisms, and then considers whether Hume or Smith might have had a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions they worked with than their many followers did. </P>

<H5>POSC 150 - America as a Democracy (AM) </H5>

<P>While most Americans take it for granted that our political system is a democracy and that it serves as an ideal by which other systems might be measured, the United States is only one of many stable democratic polities in existence today. This course identifies various characteristics of democratic systems that set them apart from others, and compares the operation of our presidential system with the parliamentary model adopted by many industrialized democracies.

<P>POSC 151 - Politics and Moral Vision (TH) </P>

<P>This introduction to political theory addresses the ways in which personal morality and ideas of human flourishing determine one's perceptions and responses to political institutions that shape the life and culture of one's nation. Using a wide variety of texts, the moral underpinnings of different political systems are discussed in terms of fundamental normative concepts such as right, duty, virtue, liberty, and equality. Other essential terms, basic to building a foundational political vocabulary, such as liberalism, conservatism, individualism, communalism, and modernity are also explored. This introduction to normative political theory gives special emphasis to the genesis and development of liberal democracy and the tensions between its component parts, particularly as they relate to visions of a well-lived, moral life. This course is designed to enrich one's perceptions of the evening news and the political discourse of our times. (TH) </P>

<P>POSC 153 - Introduction to Comparative Politics (CO) </P>

<P>Nearly 200 independent states coexist in the world today. Although they are all unique, political scientists study them in systematic ways, comparing them to discover fundamental political patterns that can help produce broadly applicable generalizations across different cultures and geographies. Themes such as democratic or authoritarian regime type, models of economic development, state institutions, civil society, and issues of national and ethnic identity all form important realms of inquiry for researchers engaged in the practice of comparative politics. This course introduces students to the principle themes and basic theories of comparative politics using examples from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including both authoritarian and unstable democratic countries.

<P>Examines the political dynamics of race in American society, focusing primarily on the experience of blacks as a socio-political group and to a lesser degree on that of other racial and ethnic minorities. The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue - racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities. These topics, individually and collectively, represent the essence of racial politics. (AM) </P>

This course tries to answer these questions by examining the historical origins, political evolution, and economic development of Third World countries from Thailand to Tanzania. Using the tools and methods of comparative inquiry, students explore the states, societies, and economies of different regions included under the rubric of the &quot;Third World&quot; such as the Caribbean, South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The role of women, health, population, migration, and democratization issues in these regions are discussed, as well as the theories and methods used by comparativists in order to explain political systems and economic changes in the &quot;Third World.&quot; (CO) </P>

<P>Today Latin America is one of the most democratic regions of the developing world, although it faces problems of inequality, gridlock, and economic growth. Latin America's 20th-century experiences of coups, revolutions, and instability also present important lessons for comparative politics. This course introduces students to the countries of Latin America and the important patterns of similarity and difference that can help them understand political development and elucidate comparative trends. Regime type is one prism through which students examine the region's countries, including democracy, semi-democracy, and various authoritarian regimes, especially bureaucratic authoritarianism. Another important topic is the United States' relationship with the region's polities, on issues like the Cold War, drug wars, and economic policies. In addition to big countries like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, the course also focuses on countries of particular student interest. (CO) </P>

<P>Like it or not, corruption is a significant form of political influence, as much a part of politics as voting or writing a member of Congress. Indeed, in some parts of the world, corruption is not the exception, but the norm. This course examines the limits of privately interested political action in a variety of societies and considers possible explanations for corruption, examines case studies drawn from American politics and from other nations, and identifies the consequences of corruption, both for whole societies and for important groups within them. Reforms are a concern as well. Finally, the class considers the ways people in a variety of cultures judge right and wrong, and how they respond to the wrongdoing they perceive around them. </P>

<P>The course examines the inevitable intrusion of politics into economic policy making, with examples drawn from a variety of policy areas including traditional economic regulation, the new social regulation, energy and environmental policies, and recent trends toward deregulation. The course begins with elementary economic theory: the case for free markets, a review of the various ways unregulated markets break down, and rational prescriptions for remedying market failures. The bulk of the course then examines the factors operating to make these market failures more complex than at first they appear, producing policies that depart from economic ideals. </P>

<P>POSC 322 - The Politics of Privatization </P>

<P>The adoption of neoliberal economic policies has been one of the most significant reforms undertaken around the world in the last two decades. Privatization, in particular, has been so popular and so widespread that one writer has remarked that even the United States, the quintessential free market economy, was &quot;looking for something to sell.&quot; This course examines political and economic explanations for the global adoption of privatization and economic restructuring in the 1980s and 1990s. It looks at the conditions under which governments enacted policies and compares the outcome of privatization measures in selected countries and sectors in East and Central Europe, Latin America, and Africa. It analyzes the claims of critics of privatization and the responses of privatization's winners and losers. Students examine recent changes in the approach to the distribution of public goods and explore innovative public-private partnerships such as that between the development agency, CARE, and the coffee company, Starbucks, to provide water, sanitation, or micro-credit in developing countries. </P>

<P>POSC 323 - American Elections and Party Power </P>

<P>Focuses closely on the US party system and the electoral area in which the parties struggle for power. In order to develop a strong conception of American parties, students combine scrutiny of the day-to-day media representations of political parties with important comparative perspectives to understand how American parties and elections fit into broader political science frameworks, as well as their long-term and global implications. Students compare the current US party system in three directions: back through history (especially the 20th century) to understand the roots of today's parties; out to the rest of the world, comparing party systems in other highly democratic countries; and also down to the state level, where students examine to what degree New York State parties and elections reflect national trends. Important topics covered include the effects of redistricting and campaign finance. Students also investigate the importance of issue-framing with units on contrasting party strategies of presenting a &quot;war on women&quot; and President Obama's &quot;socialism.&quot; </P>

<P>POSC 330 - Post-Mao China and World Development </P>

<P>Examines post-Mao China's socioeconomic development and post-socialist transition in an age of economic globalization. It analyzes the evolution of Chinese economic market reforms and China's uneven integration into the Liberal World Order since 1978. This two-pronged developmental trajectory, however, encounters major challenges such as socioeconomic problems, ecological degradations, political dysfunctions, ideational crises, and international impediments. With varying efficacy, the Chinese government has attempted to redress these daunting problems through administrative reforms, economic rebalancing, anti-corruption campaigns, and international institutions. These major challenges and their attempted ameliorations are analyzed in-depth. The course concludes by examining the practical and discursive ramifications of China's development model for Chinese society, world politics, and the philosophical search for alternative modernities. </P>

<P>POSC 331 - Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa </P>

<P>Provides an understanding of politics in 48 countries that constitute sub-Saharan Africa. Following the independence era of the early 1960s and 1970s, much of the sub-continent exploded into a seemingly endless cycle of violence underscored by military coups d'état and civil wars. Over the last decade, various conflicts subsided enough for some states to institute political and market reforms. Others remained stuck in the throes of economic stagnation, on the verge of disintegration and vulnerable to terrorist groups and drug runners who exploit their vast ungovernable territories. What explains the various transitions that some states have experienced in sub-Saharan Africa? Why did most states disintegrate in violence following the end of colonial rule? Drawing upon pre-colonial accounts and histories of state formation and the theoretical, methodological, and conceptual tools that various Africanists have used to analyze key events, this course offers answers to these and other important questions about political and socio-economic developments on the continent of Africa. </P>

Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's &quot;culture wars&quot; in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S. </P>

<P>POSC 340 - Politics of the American Metropolis </P>

<P>The United States is an urban society: today nearly 80 percent of Americans live in urbanized, metropolitan areas. These urban areas are governed by a dizzying array of local, state, and federal institutions whose policies affect citizens' lives enormously and in myriad ways. This course explores the politics of urban America in the context of the contemporary metropolis. The legal and philosophical origins of local American government are discussed, along with the political economy of the city and classic theories of urban politics. The course traces the history of urbanization and the accompanying growth of government institutions, and addresses issues of suburbanization, regional balkanization, and federalism. Other issues addressed in the course include land use, segregation, housing, economic development, and poverty. </P>

<P>POSC 341 - War and the Shaping of American Politics </P>

<P>Examines the impact of warfare, expansion, and national security policy on the development of domestic American institutions and politics since the Revolution. War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the &quot;military-industrial complex;&quot; and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system. Readings will engage such topics from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain ranging over several centuries. </P>

<P>POSC 345 - The News Media and the Political Process </P>

<P>Politics is a distant and dimly understood process for most people; still, they must somehow come to terms with the threats and reassurances it offers, and reach assessments of personalities and policies about which they often know little. This course is an analysis of politics and the media from the inside out, beginning with the ways people receive, interpret, or ignore the media messages directed at them. News reporting and questions of bias are treated in the context of a group analysis of important stories. The class also considers the evolution and refinement of media campaigning techniques. Those who cannot purchase time or space in the mass media may resort to protest, terror, and violence in order to air their views. The class discusses these cases along with the ethical issues they pose. (PG) </P>

<P>POSC 346 - Beneath the Black Robes: Courts as Political Institutions </P>

<P>Focuses on the causal dynamics of judicial behavior. Introduces students to the study of courts as political institutions and, in doing so, provides some understanding of the political nature of the role of courts in American society. Departs from the view that landmark national decisions such as Roe v. Wade, Baker v. Carr, and Brown v. Bd. of Education, along with their more recent conservative corollaries, are solely the product of adherence to constitutional standards of interpretation. Instead, it posits that these controversial rulings and judicial policy in general can be explained through careful examination of certain political factors. In short, the course is based on the premise that the judiciary is a permeable structure that is responsive to democratic processes and that, in turn, exerts influence upon those processes. Two major theoretical concerns integrate the lectures and materials covered: 1) the dynamic relationship between court decision-making processes and major features of the larger American political arena, and 2) the inherent tensions between judicial independence and democratic politics. </P>

<P>POSC 354 - Capitalism, the State, and Development in Latin America </P>

<P>The developmental trajectories of Latin American countries contain a double conundrum: first, in spite of being a region endowed with a considerable amount of natural resources and having enjoyed privileged access to Western European and North American markets, the overall economic performance of the region during the 20th century lagged considerably behind that of the rest of the Western world. Second, even when these countries all share a past of colonial rule and a &quot;peripheral&quot; location in the international system, the economic differences within the countries of the region are staggering. Seeking to shed light on this puzzle, this course surveys existing theories on the relationship between political institutions and economic outcomes and explores the historical co-evolution of states, regimes, and markets in the region. </P>

The history of South Asia is, thus, one of division and rivalry. This course focuses on the broad developments since colonial times: nationalism, the rise and fall of democratic processes, ethnic strife, communal divisions, secession incentives, power imbalances, and emergence of a nuclear South Asia, and the recent links between Islamic fundamentalist groups and terrorists in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. </P>

<P>POSC 365 - Just War in Comparative Perspective </P>

<P>Introduce students to a wide variety of ways of thinking about justice and warfare, across time, space, and religion. Using political science--rather than theology or philosophy--as the lens for inquiry emphasizes the role played by political power in the creation and transmission of these systems of value. Beginning with an exploration of the roots of Western Just War thinking in the ancient world (Greece, Rome, and Israel), the course explores traditional just war thinking in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Students delve into source texts, examining the evolution of just war thought in a historical and comparative context, and the course illustrates the ways in which concepts of justice may be contingent on both a society's religious/ethnical beliefs and its military capabilities. Finally, the course turns to contemporary scholarship to ask, is just war theory still relevant today? Modern just war responses to weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and counter-insurgency warfare provide students the opportunity to apply these ancient theories to the modern world. </P>

<P>The end of the Cold War and the introduction of a large number of non-traditional issues (environmental, economic, and normative) to the international agenda have raised very serious questions about the discipline of international relations itself. How new or old will the new international relations be? What conceptual framework should be used to explore these issues? What issues should be the focus? The course begins with a reassessment of the grand tradition in international relations and of how the order, upon which it was based, fell. The emerging world order and the agenda of new issues with which it confronts us, the likely new patterns of cooperation and conflict those issues will foster, and the possibilities for a new consensus are considered. </P>

<P>How can one understand human beings when they seem to have such a complicated variety of interests and motives? Not only does behavior vary dramatically across cultures and over time, but so do conceptions of truth, God, religion, morality, justice, and the good. Differences abound. The intent of this course is to look at the controversies that divide social and political theorists in their effort to understand human beings and the human condition. In the process students discover that beneath conflicting theories are recurring themes concerning subjectivity and objectivity, the nature of human beings, theories of self and other, as well as a debate over rationality, irrationality, truth, and knowledge. By better understanding these controversies students gain new insights into human nature, human knowledge, and the human condition. </P>

<P>POSC 389 - Constitutional Law: Structures and Powers </P>

<P>The focus of this course is what Aristotle identified as the central question of political science, the character of regime--the organization of offices and the distribution of power that is designed to achieve an understanding of justice and the human good. More specifically, students focus on the structural characteristics of the American regime, or Constitution--separation of powers, federalism, emergency powers, property rights; but students are equally concerned with the politics of interpretation itself--the complex process by which people determine what is the Constitution, how it is to be understood, and who has authority to interpret it. The responsibility for constitutional interpretation is broadly distributed, but it is also obvious that the preeminent voice for interpreting the Constitution has become the Supreme Court. Accordingly, students spend the greater portion of the course with the analysis of cases, that is, the Court's opinion of what the Constitution means. </P>

Such groups include racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, women, and gays and lesbians. Of particular concern is how well these groups have fared in the American political arena, the sources of and constraints upon their political clout, and the political system's response to their concerns and demands. Students examine both the political process as it pertains to marginalized groups and also the major public policy developments affecting these groups. More specifically, students utilize traditional political science tools and methodologies in an attempt to disentangle the dynamic interplay between American political process, public policy, and the politics of social justice. </P>

<P>POSC 416 - Seminar: Democratic Transitions and Consolidation </P>

<P>What are the chances that the new democracies established around the world in the past century will survive? Most have had relatively free and honest elections; some have even had peaceful transfers of power later on; most are somewhere in the process of changing to market economies. But in many places, the quality of life has deteriorated in important respects, and democratization is stale-mated by economic crises, ethnic and religious conflicts, low levels of political participation, crime, and other problems. This seminar explores democratic transitions - the removal of repressive regimes and the establishment of new democratic institutions - and democratic consolidation - the process of &quot;deepening&quot; democracy and making it sustainable. Major topics include the role of civil society, relationships between wealth and power, ethnic conflicts and national identity, political participation and accountability, building democratic cultures, and models of democracy appropriate for different societies. </P>

<P>POSC 418 - Seminar: Urbanism and Civil Society: Decline and ...? </P>

<P>In this seminar, students consider both the life cycles of American industrial cities and the rise and fall of &quot;urbanism&quot;--informal, interpersonal processes of leadership, problem solving, and street-level self-government that took root as such cities developed and then eroded as they declined. Urbanism is one important variety of &quot;social capital&quot; and &quot;civil society,&quot; and helps students understand such concepts in detail. With strong urbanism in place, an unambitious local government can succeed; without it, even the best ideas backed by generous funding are likely to fail. The class focuses on the city of New Haven, Connecticut, and close reading of several classic texts. Students use the &quot;Sim City 4&quot; urban simulator to explore the processes outlined in the readings, and build and analyze simulated cities of their own. More recent readings on urban trends and styles of development round out the class's consideration of the ways in which cities once governed themselves and of the problems they face in the future. </P>

<P>POSC 420 - Seminar: Street-Level Bureaucracy </P>

<P>We live in an age of bureaucratic organization. Bureaucracies defend us, educate us, collect our taxes, provide us with basic services, protect our health and safety, and occasionally kill us. Effective bureaucratic agencies are necessary for the creation and sustenance of modern, democratic government. At the same time, bureaucratic power can be a threat to democracy. Legislatures may pass laws, executives may issue orders, and courts may judge, but real governance happens when a soldier fires a gun, a teacher grades a paper, an inspector certifies an aircraft, and a police officer writes a speeding ticket. The difference between effective and dysfunctional bureaucracy at the street level--where governments and people interact--can make the difference between flourishing and failing democracy. This seminar offers an introduction to organizational theory and the politics of bureaucracy, with discussions and analysis centered on the HBO series &quot;The Wire.&quot; Students learn classic theories and emerging research on human organization and bureaucratic politics by applying them to the characters and stories of the acclaimed television series. </P>

<P>POSC 434 - Seminar: Immigrants, Refugees, and the Politics of Borders </P>

<P>This seminar examines themes in migration, citizenship, and belonging, in the context of South Asian migration world-wide, with special emphasis on the United States. The liberalization of American immigration law in the 1960s provides the basis for the discussion of push-pull factors of migration of South Asians from various states in the subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal). Today South Asians are deemed to be a model minority, a label that at the same time extols and dehumanizes South Asians depending on their class position and their country of origin. To counter the stereotypical narratives of doctors and engineers on the one hand and cab drivers and convenience-store clerks on the other, students are encouraged to engage with various texts to recognize ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity of South Asian migrants, and to consider the challenges of acculturation and assimilation as immigrants become citizens. </P>

What is the influence of foreign powers on African politics and development? This seminar discusses how Africa has featured in world politics since the advent of colonialism to the present. Topics include: slave trade, European exploration of Africa, and the establishment of the colonial trade. The majority of the course, however, focuses on the post-colonial period. Students examine the phenomenon of neo-colonialism, the involvement of Western and Asian powers in Africa, and the international aid regime. The course also focuses on some of the most important conflicts that took place on the continent, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Ivory Coast, and Mali. </P>

<P>POSC 466 - Seminar: Towards 1789: The Historical Development of American Constitutionalism </P>

<P>In this seminar, the development of constitutional and political thought in the Founding era is explored through two principal foci: the constitutional crisis in the British Empire that led to the issuance of the Declaration of Independence, and the debates in the Philadelphia Convention that framed The Constitution of 1789. The seminar's reading will, therefore, emphasize the Journals of the Continental Congress and the Records of the Federal Convention of 1787. Seminar participants will come to understand, through an intimate familiarity with what was actually written or said in the two most important bodies that shaped American constitutionalism and political institutions, how the Founders themselves actually understood what they hoped to achieve. </P>

<P>POSC 469 - Seminar: Constitutional Theory </P>

<P>Using the Constitution of the United States as its central case, the seminar examines the theory and practice of constitutions and constitutionalism. Students consider such questions as: What is a constitution? Why have one? What does it mean to &quot;have&quot; a constitution (what are the possible relations between the text and practice)? What are the distinct forms of constitutional government and what are their advantages and disadvantages? To what extent should we consider a constitution a cause or effect of political culture? How should one interpret a constitution; to what extent are the terms of American debate—such as originalism v. nonoriginalism—found in other countries? As the form of government to which most countries aspire today (or the form they claim to be), liberal democracy seems to have pride of place, but why? Is it the right answer to the ancient question of the &quot;best regime&quot;? Or perhaps the best practicable regime? Do the forces of history favor its existence, or does this depend more fundamentally on acts of statesmanship? </P>

<P>POSC 472 - Seminar: Post Cold War Conflict Resolution </P>

<P>This seminar aims to better understand the phenomenon of international conflicts and wars as well as of their ending by peaceful means. The course begins with reviewing the theoretical literature explaining the causes of war and the conditions determining the forms and patterns of their management and settlement, with an emphasis on the complex shift from protracted conflict to diplomacy, stabilization of coexistence and peace in domestic, regional and international contexts. This part also includes a critical approach to theories of ripeness, international mediation and incentives; cultural gaps and social and psychological obstacles in the process of conflict settlement. Empirically, the course focuses on the case of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the American involvement in the efforts to bring about its settlement. This part assumes a regional approach which examines the ability of individual Arab and Muslim states to act as autonomously of compelling pan-Arab and pan-Islamic ideologies. </P>

Students also examine the 'higher law' background of constitutions, legal systems, social movements, and international organizations. Readings will be selected from writings of classical Greek and Roman philosophers, medieval scholastics, modern creators of international law, the American founders, and contemporary philosophers of human rights and cultural relativism. </P>

Each of these perspectives provides unique evidence concerning &quot;origins.&quot; Developmental psychology examines the origins of thought within the lifespan of the individual within a particular culture; cross-cultural psychology examines the degree to which ways of thinking originate culturally; comparative psychology studies the evolutionary origins of thinking by making comparisons among species. These different approaches to studying &quot;origins&quot; are applied to a few focused topics in human cognition, such as origins of speech, concepts and categories, perception of objects, and perception of music. </P>

<P>PSYC 355 - Language and Thought </P>

<P>Language is a distinctive human ability that distances humans from the rest of the animal kingdom - including chimpanzees, with whom people share 98 percent of the same genetic inheritance. Although language is considered as primarily serving communication in its advanced form, it is also an important vehicle for thought, with the potential to extend, refine, and direct thinking. The interaction of language with other cognitive abilities is the central focus of the course. Students compare the communication systems of other species with human language, examine efforts to teach human language to apes, learn how psycholinguists conceptualize and investigate language-mind relationships, and inquire into the cognitive abilities of various types of language users, such as bilinguals and deaf and hearing signers. Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition. </P>

<P>PSYC 360 - Bonding across Boundaries: A Service Learning Experience </P>

<P>This course explores relationship and group process among school-aged children with and without disabilities. First, students review normative and atypical social development and examine the ways in which children typically include and exclude one another in their social groups. Students then review interventions that have been used to encourage cooperation and facilitate positive relationships among children from different backgrounds. Finally, the class explores the use of music and drama to facilitate the development of social connection in children. With this background, students participate in an extensive service-learning project where they are directly responsible for the development and implementation of a 6-week drama and music workshop for local children with and without disabilities. The final weeks of the seminar are devoted to evaluating the project both empirically and qualitatively. </P>

<P>To what degree does culture shape and constrain the development of human ability, thought, and behavior? What features of human behavior lie beyond culture's reach? In pursuing these questions, students study how sensorimotor, perceptual, emotional, cognitive, social, and personality development proceed in diverse cultural contexts. Theories of human development and the cross-cultural methodologies used to test them are critiqued in detail. Inquiry is framed by an understanding of cultural and biological evolution and incorporates readings from developmental and cross-cultural psychological science, and from anthropology and sociology. </P>

<P>PSYC 366 - Psychology of Leadership </P>

<P>An exploration of the psychological forces that give root to human dominance, hierarchy, and leadership. Guided by evolutionary, developmental, and cross-cultural perspectives, questions about social power and leadership are addressed using empirical literature: To what degree are motives for social dominance--and social docility--embedded in human nature and traceable through primate evolution? What traits and competencies distinguish leaders from followers, how early do these differences develop, and is the pattern the same for girls and boys, and for men and women, across the globe? How do some leaders and groups cultivate followers so devoted that they adhere to destructive directives? Contemporary problems in leadership provide illustrations. </P>

<P>Perhaps more than anything else, people think about other people- the people with whom they are close, those who shape conceptions of the self, motivate behavior, and produce strong emotional reactions. The field of social psychology is devoted to understanding how people feel about, think about, and interact with others. This advanced social psychology seminar offers a contemporary, in-depth exploration of different topic areas within the field of social psychology. Students investigate primary literature on some of the most vexing, provocative, and important issues of our time. </P>

<P>PSYC 368 - Prejudice and Racism </P>

<P>Provides a survey of the psychology of prejudice and racism, the scientific study of human feeling, thinking, and behavior in situations involving conflict between groups. More broadly, the course examines the psychological factors that contribute to the perpetuation of inequality and discrimination. Students consider both proximate (immediate) influences on behavior, such as the immediate social situation, as well as distal (more remote) influences on behavior, such as human evolution. Both motivational approaches to understanding prejudice (e.g., explaining prejudice as a consequence of the desire for social dominance) as well as cognitive approaches (e.g., explaining prejudice as a byproduct of automatic associations people learn) are examined. </P>

<P>Examines the ethical dimensions of a variety of religious traditions and considers them in light of one another. As a comparative course in the study of religion it aims to give students a better sense of what role religious traditions play in cultivating forms of moral thought and behavior, and how specific traditions might begin to think about ethical issues. That is, students investigate how these traditions envision morality as such but also how they think concretely about violence, gender, poverty, and the value of human life. This comparative approach to the study of religion ultimately hopes to prompt students toward a consideration of what is, as well as what is not, ethical about these traditions. </P>

<P>Provides an introduction to the Chinese worldview, examining Chinese philosophical and religious thought from the Warring States period (453-221 BCE), Neo-Confucian thought from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and later periods. Classical Chinese thought was defined by the violence of the times and was therefore directed toward the question of how social harmony might be established and maintained. Later Confucian thought, under the influence of Buddhism, introduced additional questions about ethics and the human relationship to the cosmos. These intellectual traditions influenced generations of Chinese scholars and officials, and they also give insight into some of the unique aspects of Chinese society today. The course considers attempts by modern-day scholars (&quot;New Confucians&quot;) to apply Chinese thought to contemporary ethical and political problems. </P>

The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation. As students read through the canon they establish the boundaries of the texts studied, distinguish the type(s) of literature found in them, examine their prose and poetic qualities, and identify their surface structures. Students also consider the literary legacy of the Bible and the many ways that subsequent writers have revisited its stories. </P>

Students explore various arguments about the rationality of God as responses to wider intellectual, cultural, and historical contexts in which they are made and to the specific shape and needs of a particular religious tradition (e.g., Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism). Students also explore the &quot;rationality&quot; of religious forms such as scripture, symbol, ritual, and prayer. In different semesters, select themes such as revelation, theodicy (the justification of God in the face of human suffering), providence and free will, or the theism/atheism debate are investigated. </P>

The course foregrounds the ways that each tradition understands the city as a symbol--as a holy city, a city of God, a centre of the cosmos. As importantly, it explores how religion is lived within the city's sacred geography, investigating the religious practices and sacred sites of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in Jerusalem. </P>

<P>RELG 230 - Feasting and Fasting: Religion and Food </P>

<P>Examines a range of religious and cultural attitudes about food. What foods are celebrated? What foods forbidden? Who can eat what and when? Through a comparative approach to food restrictions and injunctions, feasts and fasts, and food-based rituals and liturgies in Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu traditions, students investigate the role food plays in defining religious boundaries and identities. </P>

<P>RELG 232 - Health and Healing in Asian Religions </P>

<P>A look at how illness, health, and healing are understood and experienced in parts of Asia where illness is not defined merely as a physiological problem, but is also seen to have important spiritual, aesthetic, social, and political causes and effects. Similarly, while biomedicine defines health as the absence of disease, in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, health is about achieving balance between different elements in the body, such as wind, water, and fire. Students will develop an appreciation for the culturally and historically patterned ways in which people come to identify and treat bodily, psychological, and social distress. For instance, students will examine spirit possession in a variety of contexts as both a form of affliction and as a mode of healing. Students will look at the role of traditional healers; how cultures vary in what they consider to be the causes of illness; who gets sick; what forms illness takes; and how the social, political, and aesthetic dimensions of health and healing affect treatment outcomes. Readings will be drawn from the fields of ethnomedicine, medical anthropology, and the anthropology of religion, to explore how illness and health are conceptualized and experienced in different cultures and across different sites of healing. </P>

<P>RELG 235 - Religion, War, Peace, and Reconciliation </P>

<P>This is a course on the role and function of religion toward peace and reconciliation. Students examine the scriptural, theological, and ethical teachings of various religions on justice, conflict resolution, peace, and reconciliation. Students also examine the theological writings on justice, war, and peace by Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, and Schleiermacher. Using concrete case studies of conflict and reconciliation, students explore the teachings of African religion, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam on nonviolence, peace making, relationship of peace and justice, as well as evaluate the negative and positive contributions of these religions toward conflict. Students examine religious and interreligious conflicts (Northern Ireland, India/Pakistan), religious language and symbols (Rwanda), current attempts at peace reconciliations (Bosnia, Liberia), and the role of religions and the causes of situations of conflict (the Middle East). Of particular interest is an examination of situations in which the political process was shaped and defined to a greater degree by religious leaders and their communities (South Africa). </P>

<P>RELG 236 - Religion, Science, and the Environment </P>

<P>In the 17th century, religion lost its claim to the cosmos; the religious knowledge of the order of nature ceased to possess any legitimacy in the new paradigm of science that came to dominate the West. Until the 1960s, Christian thinkers considered it the great glory of Christianity that it alone among the world's religions had permitted purely secular science to develop in a civilization in which it was dominant. After several centuries of an ever-increasing eclipse of the religious significance of nature in the West and neglect of the order of nature, humans are now experiencing environmental crisis: global warming; the destruction of the ozone layer; climatic and weather pattern changes; soil erosion; death of animals, birds, and marine life; and the disappearance of some plant species. Today the very fabric of life is threatened and the future of our world hangs in the balance as nature is threatened by destruction caused by an environmental crisis that has gone unchecked for several centuries. What can be learned from religions of the world that will save humanity and nature? What is the relationship between religion, nature, science, and technology? Discussions include views from various religious traditions concerning nature, concept of the human, notions of progress and destiny, faith and science, ecological theology, ecofeminism, justice and sustainability, and spirituality. </P>

<P>RELG 240 - Religion and Terrorism </P>

<P>Terrorists are often driven by extremist beliefs staunchly rooted in religious, racial, and ethical rationales for torture, violence, and genocide. The course provides a theoretical and empirical understanding, and explanation of terrorism. While tracing the history of terrorism to the ancient West, students will also identify various analytical approaches to the study of terrorism, recognize terrorist groups, and review terrorist tactics. Students will examine the ways that states counter terror, and the choices and the tradeoffs states face when confronting terrorism. Students will examine terrorist individuals and groups in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Sikhism such as the Ku Klux Klan, Timothy Mc Veigh, Republican Army in Ireland, Orthodox Rabbi Meir Kahane, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, Osama bin Laden, Boko Haram, Islamic State, and Shoko Asahara in Japan. </P>

<P>RELG 247 - Death and Afterlife </P>

<P>This course examines the many ways humans have attempted to anticipate, accept, deny, defeat, or transcend death. Does one have a soul and does it survive? Is immortality possible? What techniques have people used in efforts to achieve it? Is there a &quot;good&quot; way to die? The focus is on scriptures and rituals of Buddhists, Hindus, ancient Greeks, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and their legacies for contemporary America. Topics include body and soul, heaven and hell, spiritism, ghosts, reincarnation, resurrection, near-death experiences, relics, funerals, cremation, and cemeteries. </P>

<P>RELG 251 - Faith after the Holocaust </P>

<P>The death of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis in the Second World War represents a radical challenge to faith in Judaism, in Christianity, and in humanism. The course begins with a historical overview of the Holocaust and uses accounts of Holocaust survivors to articulate the challenge of the Holocaust to faith. It then reviews philosophical and theological responses to this challenge by Jewish and Christian authors. The weak as well as the heroic human figures in the Holocaust are studied. Those Jews who survived with their humanity intact and those non-Jews who helped them are the most important witnesses to the resiliency of the human spirit which we now have. </P>

<P>RELG 253 - Sex, Love, and God: Religion and Queer Studies </P>

<P>A cross-cultural and multi-disciplinary approach to the questions of how the social and cultural significance of sexuality has been shaped by religious discourse, myth, doctrine, and ritual. How have various forms of sexual expression come to be seen as normal, while others are seen as deviant? How has passionate love served as metaphor for the expression of religious experiences, such as the union of the soul with God? How have people thought to &quot;channel&quot; sexual energy to pursue spiritual projects, as in tantra and religious celibacy? Topics of study may include marriage, different- and same-sex love, virginity, celibacy, sacred prostitution, ecstasy and mysticism, and the role of transvestites, transsexuals, androgynes, and third-gender people in religious myth and ritual in contexts such as Christianity, Hinduism, Native American religion, and Islam. </P>

<P>RELG 255 - Church, State, and Law in America </P>

<P>What do we mean when we talk about &quot;the separation of church and state&quot;? Where does this principle originate? Are there exceptions? This course explores the relationship between religion and law in the United States. Students consider the question of what Americans mean when they speak of the separation of church and state, and explore the ways in which the U.S. Supreme Court has attempted to implement this principle within American law. Students examine a variety of influential theories of church-state separation, and read some of the most important First Amendment cases of the 20th and early 21st centuries. Ultimately, this course familiarizes students with some of the most significant voices within today's church-state debate, and provides them with the tools for an ongoing understanding of religion and law in the United States. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of American religion or American law. </P>

<P>RELG 281 - Experiencing Hinduism </P>

<P>As one of the world's most ancient, complex, and fascinating religious traditions, the study of Hinduism provides an ideal arena for examining central questions in the study of religion. Through close readings of primary texts in translation, this course focuses on the history of Hindu traditions from their origins to the development of devotional movements in medieval and early modern India. Following a chronological order, these texts include the hymns of the ancient Vedas, the investigations into salvific reality in the Upanishads, the religious epics, devotional poems in praise of gods, religious philosophy (Yoga and Advaita Vedanta), and classical mythology. While exploring the variety of forms Hinduism has taken, the class engages broader questions in the study of religions such as the construction of religious authority, the definition of the good life, conceptions of the soul, differences between elite and non-elite styles of religiosity, and the significance of gender in conceptualizations of the divine. </P>

<P>RELG 283 - Experiencing Judaism </P>

<P>As a minority culture, throughout history, Jews and Judaism have always been subject to the influence of the majority cultures in which Jews have found themselves. In response to the shocks of modernity, ruptures, scientific advancements, and philosophical ideas and challenges, Jewish thinkers, culture, and individuals formulated responses—religious and otherwise. In Experiencing Judaism, students will explore how Judaism has responded to modernity, the &quot;age of secularism.&quot; To wit, students will focus on distinctively modern expressions of Judaism: the range of denominations, their historical origins, ideologies, and attitudes to Jewish law and its development, secularism, religious and secular Zionism. Students will explore these developments through primary texts within their historical contexts to better understand contemporary Judaism as it is expressed and practiced, mainly in North America and Israel, as a religion and also as a culture. </P>

<P>RELG 287 - Protestant Traditions: Revolutions and Reformations </P>

<P>Considers the Protestant tradition in Europe and the United States. The great theological doctrines of the Reformation of 16th-century Europe are examined: salvation by grace, the authority of scripture as opposed to ecclesiastical edicts, freedom of conscience, the priesthood of all believers, and separation of church and state. The great themes articulated by Luther, Calvin, and others constituted a challenge to established authority that involved the Church, the monarchies, and the dissenters. The Protestant tradition that emerged gave rise to new conceptions of political order that profoundly impacted the ideological, social, and political foundations of the United States. Protestant vision contributed heavily to biblical metaphors shaping American self-understanding. Protestant vision and Protestant thinkers gave rise to various forms of Christian communities, such as the Society of Shakers, and provided the impetus for reform movements such as abolition of slavery, the Social Gospel, Prohibition, and the Civil Rights movement. </P>

<P>Examines the intrinsically-linked discourses and practices of martyrdom and noble death from the 8th century BCE to modernity. Theorizing the social constructions of martyrdom and noble death requires focused attention to the politics of sociopolitical and religious persecution within discrete historical contexts, and a sustained analysis of those heroic men, women, and children willing to challenge, resist, and face the public or private spectacle of persecution and death with resolute determination and certitude. Close analyses of the developing mythic frameworks, rhetoric, artistic and iconographical representations, and other textual records that coalesced to render suffering redemptive - and even salvific - will receive particular scrutiny (including translations of selected primary and secondary source documents and modern scholarly reconstructions). </P>

What existential and ideological factors give rise to convictions of the world's cataclysmic destruction, or civilization-altering fate? Why do apocalyptic movements forecast the inevitability of such life-threatening catastrophes as national or global revolution and warfare, plagues, ecological catastrophes, or profound existential threats from bioengineering or artificial intelligence menaces gone awry? Particular attention is focused on the sociohistorical factors that fuel and heighten apocalyptic fervor within discrete historical periods, inclusive of contemporary post-apocalyptic reconstructions of new world orders that inspire allegiance, hope, and notions of paradisal tranquility. </P>

Contextual interpretation takes the context or social location of the interpreter (their gender, class, race, nationality, etc.) as the starting point in the hermeneutical (interpretive) process. De-centering the predominantly male, patriarchal, and first-world orientation of more traditional biblical scholarship, the readings for this course foreground the perspectives and commitments of the interpreters as well as issues of identity, ethnicity, gender, class, location, and power. </P>

<P>Explores the role of Native peoples in the creation and ongoing development of modern law. It begins with an investigation of the use of Native peoples as a representation of human savagery within early modern European political thought — a representation that allowed political theorists to depict law as a solution to such savagery. More recently, and more positively, it explores the important role that indigenous peoples have played in the propagation of religious free exercise rights and international human rights law. Focusing particularly on the legal negotiation of Native religious practices in the US, this course encourages students to think critically about some of the most basic tenets and mechanisms of modern secular law. </P>

<P>What does Mahatma Gandhi's reading of the Bhagavad Gita have to do with shamanic healing practices in the Himalayas or statues of Jesus painted blue in South India? They are some examples of the diverse sets of beliefs, practices, institutions, and communities that constitute religious life in modern India and that students will encounter in this course. Rather than view religion as an unchanging, closed, and monolithic assemblage of texts and concepts, students shall focus on how religious traditions are lived, practiced, and reconfigured by individuals and communities across this region. In so doing, we will explore how religion in India continues to engage, in vital ways, changing historical realities since the decline of the Mughal empire through the advent of British colonialism into the postcolonial present. Students will read historical and ethnographic writings not only about Hinduism but also Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Sikhism, and Christianity, while becoming familiar with significant theoretical and methodological currents within the broader academic study of religion. </P>

<P>Twenty-first century genetic technologies present humanity with unprecedented possibilities for re-engineering human life and experience: genetic tailoring to treat and eradicate diseases, the creation of designer children, cyberconsciousness and unlimited physical prowess, radical life-extension technologies, and the development of virtual human beings. Scientific tinkering with food DNA heightens interest in &quot;Frankenfoods,&quot; while genetic tinkering with animals has raised the spectre of &quot;Frankenbeasts.&quot; The course foregrounds issues in the science of genetics and genethics—the social, ethical, legal, and, in this course, the notably religious implications of modern genomic and technological development - with an assessment of the promise and perils of these achievements for the future of humankind. </P>

<P>RELG 336 - Religion and Capitalism </P>

<P>&quot;Christianity is freedom. Freedom is free enterprise; hence capitalism is Christianity in action.&quot; Following contemporary research, students will explore the relation from the high medieval monasteries to the present, highlighting the 17th and 18th-century Christian and Jewish farmers and traders, 19th-century British industrialists, and the 21st-century consumers, financiers and traders in commodities and various financial instruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, equities, derivatives, and securities, etc.). The course will investigate how worldviews and religious teachings order a lifestyle and a value system that inform and influence a particular economic activity. The course includes: what capitalism is (i.e., its elements and types, and the classical theories of capitalism); investigate the religious views, the cultural and social history that gave rise to capitalism, and the intellectual and economic innovations that turned capitalism into a system. Topics of discussions will include: capitalism and the environment, poverty and the Puritan work ethic, culture and global capitalism, capitalism and moral values, and the relation between contemporary spirituality and capitalism. </P>

<H5>RELG 337 - Islamic Mysticism </H5>

<P>Seeks to engage the mystical interpretations of Islam (Sufism) as simultaneously one of the most important historical manifestations of the Islamic experience and one of the most pertinent ones for understanding Islam in the contemporary situation. Themes explored in this class include the tradition of love mysticism embodied by Rumi, the metaphysical formulations of Ibn al-Arabi, the formation of Sufi orders, the various meditative techniques, and Sufi poetry. The class also explores the controversies surrounding Sufism in the contemporary scene, ranging from attacks on Sufism from Muslim fundamentalists to the role of Sufism in the spread of Islam in Europe and North America. </P>

<P>RELG 338 - Sex, Law, and the American Culture Wars </P>

<P>Explores the American church-state debate through the lens of abortion, contraception, and same-sex marriage. These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's &quot;culture wars&quot; in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S. </P>

<P>RELG 339 - Modern Jewish Philosophy </P>

<P>A course on European and American Jewish thought, covering a spectrum of liberal and traditional figures. The course studies the ways in which Jewish thinkers have responded to the challenges of modern philosophy, religious pluralism, and feminism. Modern reformulations of traditional Jewish ideas and religious practices are discussed as well as contemporary theological exchanges between Jews and Christians. Readings are taken from such figures as Mendelssohn, Buber, Rosenzweig, Heschel, Fackenheim, and Plaskow. </P>

<P>RELG 342 - Our Secular Age </P>

<P>Do we live in a secular age? Most of us would assert that we do, but what do we mean when we make this claim? Are we referring to the political separation of church and state, to a decline in religious beliefs and practices, or to something else? These questions have recently come to occupy a central place within the study of religion. This course explores the topic of secularism from a variety of angles, including differing notions of what is meant by the term &quot;secular&quot;; an examination of the historical development of secular ideas and institutions; a comparison of different secular political projects; and a series of important critiques of secularism. This course encourages students to think critically and creatively about the relationship between &quot;the religious&quot; and &quot;the secular,&quot; and it thus enhances students' understanding of religion, secularism, and modernity more broadly. </P>

According to Genesis, from the beginning there were male and female. To what degree are these two categories essential? To what degree artificial? How do religion and tradition enforce the gender divide, and in what ways can they be used to blur the distinctions between male and female? </P>

<P>RELG 346 - Cognitive Science of Religion </P>

<P>Central to much research in the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is the question of how the human brain and its evolved capacities inform and constrain the transmission of religious beliefs and ritual practices. The cognitive science of religion also seeks to answer why it is that certain beliefs and specific practices appear to outperform and outlive others. More generally, the CSR seeks to explain the persistence and pervasiveness of religious beliefs and practices throughout human history by drawing on the theories and methodologies of a range of disciplines, including cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, behavioral ecology, and several others, as well as disciplines more traditionally associated with the study of religion. Scholars in CSR embrace a variety of methods, including textual analysis, quantification of historical and archaeological data, statistical analysis of ethnographic data, controlled laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling. This course is a survey of the most influential of the CSR theories and methods in the field. </P>

What happens when human rights conflict with longstanding religious beliefs and practices? This course explores the complex relationship between religion and human rights from a variety of perspectives: theological, philosophical, sociological, and legal-political. Students will examine some of today's most prominent voices on this topic, and will explore a variety of case studies involving both positive and negative interactions between religion and human rights. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of religion or human rights law. </P>

<P>REST 205 - Yiddish Fiction in Translation </P>

<P>As European Jews began to develop a modern culture in the middle of the 19th century, an important set of writers began using Yiddish for fiction and poetry. All these writers were at least trilingual: They chose Yiddish--always the lowest status of the languages they knew--because they loved it and because it was the language their audience could really read. This course looks at Yiddish fiction and poetry written in both Eastern Europe and the United States. Students study these texts both as singular works of art and as ways of mirroring the Jewish experience for Jewish readers. Students examine both texts and the multiple contexts (historical, cultural, religious, linguistic) that give them shape. </P>

<P>Introduces students to a wide range of science fiction literature and film from the 20th century to the present day, with a strong emphasis on works from Russia, the Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe. This region offers some of the most sophisticated works of science fiction, owing to the radical &quot;otherness&quot; of its philosophical and political traditions and the challenges it offers to dominant Western constructions of self, nature, and society. Focusing on philosophical, ethical, and environmental questions, students will discuss such topics as human-machine interfaces and ethics, life-extension and transhumanism, space travel and colonization, and the prospects and perils of the rationally-planned society. Course readings are in English. No prior experience in Russian studies required. (PO) </P>

<P>REST 253 - Lust, Murder, Redemption (PR) </P>

<P>Written by an educated elite, eerily self-conscious because of czarist censorship and political repression, 19th-century Russian literature nevertheless confronts many of the crucial concerns of human existence. It often focuses upon characters who are at an existential breaking point because of ideological, spiritual, sexual, or economic pressures. Students read a combination of short stories and novels, concentrating upon canonical &quot;greats&quot; (Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov) but also sampling lesser-known writers, including neglected female authors. By examining literary depictions of such social institutions as warfare, dueling and gambling, courtship and marriage, adultery and spousal abuse, work and leisure, the course emphasizes the relationship between literary text and cultural context. Particular attention is paid to the cultural construction of gender, as well as the relationship between humans and nature. A range of theoretical and critical texts informs discussions, as do film adaptations of certain works. All works are read in translation, but a FLAC section of the course may be offered for advanced Russian language students who are interested in trying to read selections in the original Russian.

Beginning with the idealists, nihilists, and terrorists determined to bring the Russian monarchy to an end in the 19th century, the course explores history, politics, and culture through a range of genres and media--from the 19th-century Russian realist novel, the political manifesto, the avant-garde film, revolutionary poetry, to the works of seminal historians who have shaped how we &quot;read&quot; the Russian revolution today. Is the revolution over, so to speak? Are we ever finished with an historical event of such monumental consequence? Course requirements include readings, film screenings, local Colgate events, and an excursion to New York City's Museum of Modern Art. (SO) </P>

<P>REST 308 - Authoritarian Capital Cities of Eurasia (Extended Study) (PO) </P>

<P>Certain spatial and temporal patterns of urban growth characterize post-socialist Eurasia, due to the distinct mark that authoritarianism has left on past and present capital cities throughout this region. This course focuses on understanding authoritarianism in the past and present capital cities of Russia (St. Petersburg and Moscow) and Kazakhstan (Almaty and Astana). While remnants of the Tsarist and Soviet built environments still strongly shape urban character, new urban development and demographic change, alongside other economic and geopolitical transformations, have transformed them since 1991. Rapid and changing patterns and styles of urbanization create a multitude of perspectives and experiences within post-socialist cities as our globalizing world blurs the boundaries between urban spaces, individual lives, and abstract conceptualizations of the East, West, or even &quot;post-&quot; socialist places. This course uses a phenomenological methodology to examine post-socialist cities as sites of socio-cultural and political-economic transformations. Using this framework, students analyze their experiences in photographs, videos, and journals/blogs related to the encounters with spaces and places in post-socialist cities. </P>

<P>REST 314 - Dostoevsky and His World (PR) </P>

<P>Reading Dostoevsky's novels is tiring, exhilarating, exasperating, and unsettling. One of the greatest writers of the 19th century, Dostoevsky was obsessed both with the social injustice he saw in czarist Russia and with humanity's eternal struggle between good and evil, religious faith and atheism, rationality and irrationality, sexual lust and purity. One of the characters in The Brothers Karamazov exclaims, &quot;God and Satan are at war and the battleground is the human soul,&quot; and Dostoevsky seems to have shared this conviction. In this course students read a variety of Dostoevsky's fictional works, as well as selections from his diaries and journalism in a shared quest to unravel his complexity as a man and as a writer. All works will be read in translation, but a FLAC section may be offered for advanced Russian language students with a primary emphasis on the development of advanced language skills. (PR) </P>

<H5>REST 323 - Arctic Transformations (PO) </H5>

<P>The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing regions of the world today, environmentally, culturally, and politically. Rapid biophysical change occurs here today due to climate change, but equally noteworthy are cultural, social, and political transformations experienced by people living and working in the Arctic. People are under increasing pressure to change along with transformation of their biophysical environments, particularly as new actors express interest in the Arctic as space opening up to global transportation, mineral exploration, and trade and ecotourism. Within geography, interest in Arctic phenomena includes grappling with complex issues related to social and biophysical changes in this region, which often originate beyond the region but have specific meaning for the regions. Students investigate three vibrant areas of Arctic transformation: cultural transformation occurring among indigenous and local peoples, biological and physical transformation of the environment, and political transformation within and related to the region.

<P>SOCI 213 - Coming of Age in Unequal World </P>

<P>Critically investigates how power, privilege, and oppression influence the coming of age experiences of young people from diverse backgrounds. Using sociological theories and intergroup dialogue (IGD) techniques, students grapple with the causes and consequences of inequality in early life. IGD blends theory and experiential learning to promote understanding, communication, and alliance building across differences. Culminates with a portfolio assignment that asks students to develop and co-facilitate an IGD workshop with community members. </P>

<P>SOCI 216 - Sociology of War </P>

<P>In the modern world, war has usually been thought of as a clash between rival states. But, especially since WWII, much armed conflict has taken place between states and other kinds of entities — national liberation movements, criminal syndicates, warlords, terrorist groups. In an extreme case such as Somalia, states have totally disintegrated. This course asks what the consequences of this change are for our sociological understanding of the nature of warfare. It examines case studies of armed conflict in the present and recent past — Afghanistan, Kashmir, warlordism in West Africa, Northern Ireland, armed leftist movements in Western Europe during the 1970s; and in late colonial period and its aftermath, the Mau-Mau Rebellion, the Algerian war of independence, the Rhodesian War. A particular focus is on treating war as a cultural phenomenon, and to ask questions about the self-understandings of formal and informal military organizations and their consequences. </P>

<P>SOCI 245 - Nature, Culture, and Politics </P>

<P>The words &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;the environment&quot; conjure up visions of wild animals and open landscapes, but are people part of nature, too? This course shows how nature and human culture are intertwined, both in terms of how we shape our environment as well as how it shapes us. Through a series of case studies, students explore this relationship, focusing especially on the way that nature and culture are &quot;political&quot;: inequalities, social problems and movements, and power relations all flow from the way that we interact with our environment. The course takes a global, comparative, and historical view of this process, and includes the following special topics: the rise of environmental awareness and environmental social movements; globalization and environmental values; consumption and the environment; environmental inequalities and justice; risk, technology, and environmental politics; and public policy and the environment. </P>

<H5>SOCI 251 - Media Frame and Content Analysis </H5>

<P>Mass media is a key set of institutions in modernity that shape our perceptions of the world, with important impacts on what we take to be reality. The media &quot;frames&quot; that structure how media is produced, conveyed, and consumed form the discourses that we use to understand mass politics and culture in our daily lives. This course provides students with the methodological tools to empirically study media frames through content analysis. Content analysis takes the stuff of media, such as music lyrics, news stories, or advertisements, and systematically analyzes the content for the explicit and implicit frames that represent the issues and perspectives conveyed through media. The course provides students hands-on training in content analysis through a series of workshops on content sampling, collection, coding, and analysis that culminate in a final research project. This course meets for the first 7 weeks of the term and may be used to satisfy the 0.50-credit methods requirement for the sociology major. </P>

<P>SOCI 324 - Medical Sociology </P>

<P>Introduces students to the uniqueness of sociological perspectives in understanding health care, and the social factors that influence health care. Students employ several levels of analysis: social history, social interaction, work roles, organizations, organizational relationships, and social policy. The framework for this course is that of social organization to show that the social organization of a society influences, to some degree, the type and distribution of disease, illness, and death found in that society. The social organization of a society also influences, to a significant degree, how the system of medical care responds. The values and assumptions underlying the medical definition of health are not necessarily the same as those underlying the sociological definition of health. A focus of the course is to examine race, class, and gender issues that influence the delivery of healthcare in this country. Attention is given to such topics as social epidemiology, the social demography of health, social stress, and illness behavior. Students also review the sick role, doctor-patient interaction, medical health professionals, hospitals and other health care agencies, and the healthcare delivery system in the United States and other countries. </P>

<P>SOCI 333 - Sociology of the Life Course </P>

<P>Takes the human life span as the primary unit of analysis. Individuals live their lives within contexts supplied by an existing social framework. It is this framework that orders transitions between the various stages of life, constructs the various roles that individuals occupy over the course of their lives, and provides the set of historical conditions, ideas, and institutions by which individuals give meaning to their existence. Human lives are characterized by both continuity and change, and each human must negotiate the path of his or her life through a web of institutional networks. These pre-existing frameworks through which individuals travel are subject to the constraints of the past but are also open to possibilities created by each new generation. Understanding this complex relationship can not only broaden our notion of what it means to be human, but take our humanity to new heights as well. </P>

<P>What does &quot;globalization&quot; mean, and what does it mean for societies and people facing the onslaught of global corporations? This course examines the phenomenon of globalization from a variety of theoretical perspectives, ranging from neo-liberal economics to cultural anthropology. It analyzes how each of these works defines the causes of globalization and its effects on traditional cultures, community relationships, economic wealth and justice, and political institutions. To put these theoretical works in perspective, interspersed with them will be actual case studies of real people and real communities, ranging from Costa Rican farmers to Thai factory workers, interacting with the forces of globalization. These case studies will allow students to test the abstract analyses and see which theories fit reality. </P>

<P>SOCI 350 - The Social World of the Oceans: Ships, Sailors, Ports, Trade, and Environmental Crisis </P>

<P>The course seeks to examine the life of the shipping industry, seafarers, and port cities, all crucial to our social understanding of a world where most global trade still moves in ships, and where there are strong signs of renewed naval competition. The course starts by looking at the rise and fall of British maritime dominance. It then focuses on the &quot;container revolution,&quot; the rise of the supertanker, and the current economics of shipping. There is strong attention to the maritime labor, the cultures of sailors, and the nature of port cities. The continuing importance of naval power and resurgent piracy are examined. Finally, the course addresses the current ecological catastrophe in the oceans. </P>

<P>SOCI 355 - Culture, Class, Politics: Social Theory </P>

<P>The course charts the development of social theory since the classical social theorists, with a particular focus on how critical social thinkers have understood inequality and forms of social power. The course gives special attention to the relationship between social thought and its historical-political context, and notably its relationship to labor and anti-colonial movements and the &quot;new social movements.&quot; Central themes in the course include the problems of the idea of &quot;culture&quot;; how much an understanding of &quot;class&quot; can or cannot explain; and the status of notions of ideology, discourse, and materialism in contemporary social thought. Theorists who work may be covered include Gramsci, Norbert Elias, Karl Polanyi, C. Wright Mills, De Beauvoir, Fanon, Said, Bourdieu, Habermas, Stuart Hall, Anthony Giddens, and others. </P>

<P>SOCI 361 - Power, Politics, and Social Change </P>

<P>Examines the relationship between power, politics, and social change with a special focus on social movements. It considers questions such as: What leads to social movement? What do social movements do? What are the tools they use? The approach of this course is historical and comparative. It will consider what social movements can tell us about society, and apply key sociological concepts to considerations of collective action. The course will consider the building blocks of social movements from the perspective of a social movement participant, exercising the notion of 'sociological competence.' By studying social movements through the perspectives of both scholar and activist, students will gain helpful tools for collective action and social change. </P>

<P>SOCI 367 - Sociology of Gender </P>

<P>Drawing on theoretical and empirical research, as well as visual media and print news reporting, this course explores gender as a primary market of social inequality in our society and a major impetus for social change. Specifically, students analyze how gendered ideologies, practices, and contexts shape social institutions such as work, family, medicine, sport, military, religion, and the beauty industry. They examine how institutions and bodies become contested sites for gender and sexual politics. The class also pays close attention to how gendered ideologies work in tandem with race, class, and sexual expectations, constraining (and sometimes enabling) bodies and lives. The course encourages students to analyze US culture with a gendered lens. </P>

<P>SOCI 378 - Social Theory of Everyday Life </P>

<P>Since classical times, philosophers and historians have studied and recorded the details of everyday life with an eye to grasping the meaning of social practice. The past 50 years, however, have seen the bourgeoning of an exciting body of critical theory on the quotidian. Much of this work is concerned with profound questions about how the systems, structures, and practices of modernity shape basic human interactions with things, with places, and with other persons, and how these, in turn, reproduce social structures. This course presents sociological and anthropological texts concerned with everyday domesticity, cuisine, gesture, movement, activity, entertainment, talk, schooling, and bureaucracy, and explores the theoretical paradigms of knowledge, practice, and power to which these texts are ultimately addressed. </P>

<P>SPAN 476 - Linguistic History of Spain </P>

<P>This seminar provides advanced-level language students with the understanding of the evolution of the Spanish language. It focuses on the external history (i.e., cultural, social, historical, and political factors that contributed to the evolution of Spanish from Latin to early romance, and then to the modern language), as well as the internal linguistic changes (i.e., changes in sounds, word formation, sentence structure, and vocabulary). These external and internal developments are considered within the context of linguistic diversity of pre-modern Iberia. Special attention is paid to historical explanations of &quot;irregularities&quot; found in modern Spanish. Therefore, the course is of interest to students who wish to improve their understanding of the idiosyncrasies of the Spanish language. The class also linguistically analyzes a selection from premodern texts. This analysis is of particular interest to students who plan to take courses in medieval, Golden Age, and colonial Spanish literature. The course does not presuppose knowledge of linguistics or languages other than Spanish. Taught in Spanish. </P>

<P>UNST 313 - Darwin and the Victorian Age of Discovery </P>

<P>Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species precipitated a scientific and philosophical revolution that continues to reverberate in contemporary society. This course is a vehicle for exploring the extent to which Darwin's theory of natural selection - the single most important, unifying scientific idea ever proposed - reflected and transformed the scientific, social, political, economic, religious, as well as literary and artistic, contexts of Britain in the Victorian age of discovery (1830s-1900). An appreciation for Victorian society reveals how Darwin's travels, career choices, scientific activities, domestic life, fragile health, and delayed publication of his evolutionary theory were shaped by the culture of the time. Examining the diverse and intense reactions to Darwin's &quot;dangerous idea&quot; shows how his theory has been extended far beyond biology to a broad range of intellectual disciplines. Seminar discussions are based on multidisciplinary assignments, student presentations, and interactions with invited speakers. These are enhanced by field trips to classic localities of geologic interest and to a natural history museum. </P>

<P>A survey of key themes in the economic and social history of Britain during the classic period of the industrial revolution (c. 1740-1850) and later economic transformation (1851-c. 1939). The aims of the course are to encourage students to reflect upon debates that historians have engaged in relation to these themes, as well as to relate these broad themes to regional perspectives (e.g., emergence of the railway networks vis-a-vis regional specialization of industrial activity, the regional impact of the loss of export markets for British goods following the First World War, etc.). At the end of the course, students are able to identify interactions between the social, economic, and political processes that shape an industrial society, how historians often deal with conflicting evidence about the scope and extent of change, and reflect upon how the study of history can inform our understanding of social and economic change. </P>

<P>Humans have always been concerned with their health and have used various healing methods since ancient times. Focusing on Wales and beginning with an examination of the healing traditions of ancient Celtic people, the impact of successive conquerors and of contact with merchants on medical practices in Wales will be explored. New diseases which arose as human population increased and cities grew and industries developed will be examined. Also numerous scientific discoveries and inventions have changed healing practices. This course will examine changes in the concept of health and in the practice of medicine over time, ending with a consideration of the state of the current health care system in Wales, comparing it to the US health care system, and of future prospects for health care systems. </P>

<P>WRIT 102 - Introduction to Rhetoric in the Liberal Arts Tradition </P>

<P>Artes liberales--the liberal arts--those arts that are proper for a free citizen, according to Cicero. These arts numbered seven in the medieval curriculum, the language arts--grammar, logic, and rhetoric--constituting the first three or trivium. While the trivium has all but disappeared in today's college curriculum, increasingly scholars across the disciplines are discovering the integral role rhetoric plays in equipping citizens for effective participation in a democracy. Drawing upon the liberal arts tradition, the aim is to cultivate students' capacity for eloquence through inquiry. To foster this human impulse to inquire, students will engage in a number of inquiry projects that will ask them to reflect on their personal experiences, to analyze the forces that shaped those experiences, and to look critically at the way that social and cultural identity is formed. In conjunction with the three inquiry projects, students engage in an intense amount of work on rhetorical invention (the discovery of ideas for writing), composing a workable draft, reading and revising the draft, and rereading and editing it for fluency in grammar, punctuation, and style. The course fulfills the writing requirement. </P>

<P>WRIT 105 - Colgate Talk </P>

<P>Consider those who write for Colgate. A number of students, and many more professionals, hold jobs here that require speaking and writing on behalf of Colgate University. This course samples these writings as both theme and organizing principle, forming a textbook of practical rhetoric. It trains students in the analysis of texts through traditional rhetorical questions: What intellectual claims are made? What values are attributed to Colgate? What audiences are addressed? In writing their own texts about Colgate's current issues, students learn important speaking, writing, and reading strategies. In a sequence of expository essays, students develop new powers of persuasion by studying the interaction of language, point of view, and local cultural knowledge. The course meets the writing requirement. </P>

<P>WRIT 110 - Academic Persuasions: An Introduction to Rhetoric, Research, and the Academic Essay </P>

<P>By taking a rhetorical approach to academic writing, this course asks students to cultivate sustained and reasoned understandings of the relations between writer, audience, subject/text, and disciplinary contexts. Students engage in analytic essays and research projects within the discipline of rhetoric, developing facility with analytic habits of mind, discursive moves typical in academic writing, and the construction of clear, complex, and logical arguments about civic discourse. The course focuses on several essential elements of college writing and research: strategies for active analytic reading and effective note taking; compiling and critical reading of research sources; the discovery and development of a strong thesis supported by persuasive evidence; the skills of summary, definition, analysis, interpretation, and synthesis; organization and coherence; revision processes; and editing skills. This course meets the writing requirement. </P>

<P>WRIT 203 - Argumentation </P>

<P>Students in this course learn critical techniques for argumentation by analyzing the arguments of other writers and applying these techniques to their own writing. Both academic and popular sources are analyzed for their use of evidence, the presence of logical appeals, and their use of rhetorical devices. Special attention is paid to problems arising from more complex critical analysis, such as appropriate ways to treat conflicting sources, detecting the biases in both primary and secondary source material, and examining the biases of the student's own arguments. </P>

<P>WRIT 205 - Writers and Readers </P>

<P>Focuses on one of the most important characteristics of a successful writer: the ability to, first, imagine a reader's point of view, and second, to establish an imaginary dialogue with that reader. The more the imagined reader anticipates the response of a real reader, the more power the writer can command. Students consider the following topics in depth: the split in the writer's self - creator and editor; automatic language - the clichéd medium of conscious life; the practice of self-paraphrase to get beyond the automatic; the development of the writer's potential voices; control over real readers; the imagined reader in the writer's head; and alienation and authority in college-level writing. To accomplish the goal of developing awareness and control of the relationship between writer and reader, students establish a writing community that works primarily with rough drafts in a workshop format. Principles of helpful feedback/response are taught explicitly, and learning to be a supportive but critical reader improves the students' editing skills at the same time that it models the realities of a reader's difficulties in the hands of an unskilled but developing writer. </P>

<P>WRIT 210 - The Rhetoric of Style </P>

<P>In ancient Greece and Rome, teachers of rhetoric taught style (elocutio) as one of five essential canons, or rules, for effective and persuasive communication. By this rule, an effective communicator reaches an audience not just through the content of speech, but also through its artful expression. This course studies how writers' stylistic choices can profoundly influence the reception and interpretation of texts. With the goal of practicing new stylistic techniques in their own writing, students closely analyze published authors' diction, sentence structure, punctuation, and figures of speech. Readings for the course include short sample pieces from a variety of genres, written by a variety of authors, as models. Because an understanding of prescriptive English grammar is essential to experiments in style, students review the parts of speech and study the parts of sentences, principles of syntax, and punctuation conventions. This course does not meet the writing requirement. </P>

<P>WRIT 215 - Public Speaking </P>

<P>Since the origins of western democracy, rhetoricians have taught the study and practice of public speaking as an essential art of public life and civic responsibility. This course fuses theory to praxis in introducing students to basic public speaking skills, including researching, organization, and writing effective oral presentations; developing skills of critical listening and audience analysis; surveying key examples of public address; and providing students the opportunity to work in different speech situations. Students develop poise and self-confidence in public speaking as they deepen their understanding of the evolving aesthetics of public discourse in the context of new media and global cultures.

<P>WRIT 225 - Visual Rhetorics </P>

<P>Approaches the study of rhetoric by foregrounding the dynamic relationship of text and image. How does a writer's combination of verbal and visual elements communicate different arguments when circulated among different audiences? How do verbal/visual texts imitate, represent, and/or constitute cultural identities, norms, values, or practices? With the goal of becoming effective rhetorical critics, as well as incisive consumers and producers of visual culture, students in this course study a variety of visual texts in print and electronic form and examine these texts' complex powers of persuasion. The primary work is to develop and strengthen fluency in rhetorical discourse and visual literacy, as students work to perceive and analyze, as well as design and create, verbal-visual texts. </P>

<P>WRIT 231 - Ethos and the Personal Essay </P>

<P>By exploring the boundary between private and public writing, students examine how personal reflection intersects with critical analysis to develop a disciplined expository essay. Drawing on examples from a variety of publications, it develops skills in autobiographical and biographical essay writing, journal writing, and expository writing, and then shows how these skills can enrich the expository essay without sacrificing its academic tone and structure. </P>

<P>WRIT 242 - Stand and Speak: Feminist Rhetorics and Social Change </P>

<P>As an introduction to rhetoric, rhetorical history and criticism, and feminist rhetorics, this course fore-grounds the study of how 19th-century women used both pen and voice with rhetorical precision to &quot;stand and speak&quot; to issues that marked their personal lives and their times. By studying women who composed and embodied what is now understood as the early years of the first wave of U.S. feminism, students access a genealogy of women rhectors who serve as exemplars - and cautions - for later waves and for their own contemporary visions of social change. By positioning the study of rhetoric as the study of language as it constitutes social relations, power, and knowledge, students become more acutely aware of and fluent in the composition, circulation, and criticism of private and public discourses, the verbal material through which they construct social worlds. The work for this course requires close reading and active discussion of course texts through a rhetorical lens and through the category of gender. This course does not meet the writing requirement. </P>

<P>WRIT 250 - Kairos: The Art of Rhetoric from Ancient to Modern Times </P>

<P>Rhetoric--the effective use of language to persuade a given audience--is as old as human speech itself. Yet attuned as they were to &quot;kairos,&quot; the opportune time of a fledgling democracy in Athens, the ancient Greeks were perhaps the first to codify rhetorical practice as an art. This is a course about time, about the art of rhetoric as a most effective medium of change at the right time. Students see this when rhetoric served as a vehicle for change in 5th-century Greece, when it equipped individuals to write and preach to effect change in the so-called dark ages, and when it gave women and former slaves the voice to change attitudes and institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students survey the entire history of western rhetoric from the earliest treatises to the most recent theories. In addition to examining this history through a close reading of canonical texts, students come to know the rhetorical tradition through experience, by engaging in the very practices (e.g., medieval preaching and letter writing, and 18th-century exercises in elocution) associated with rhetoric in a particular historical period. The many rhetorical terms, concepts, principles, and practices covered in the course provide students the proper background for further study in the more specialized areas of rhetoric. </P>

Many of the works that call on the Bible for inspiration are not of a religious nature at all, raising questions about the nature of biblical style. Readings range from the Venerable Bede and Queen Elizabeth I to Bob Marley and Douglas Rushkoff, in addition to source material from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.

<P>WRIT 280 - Rhetorical &quot;Borderlands&quot;: Introduction to Comparative Intercultural Rhetoric </P>

<P>By taking a transnational comparative perspective, this course introduces students to several key questions in comparative and intercultural rhetoric, from the most basic question of &quot;How does culture shape language, and how does language, in turn, shape culture?&quot; to more complicated questions: How do cross-border and cross-cultural engagements constrain and influence rhetorical practices and interactions? How do cultural logics, values, and assumptions hierarchically govern different geo-political spaces? In what ways have individuals and groups both conformed to and resisted discursive structures of power and privilege? And finally, in what ways can comparative and intercultural study sharpen our own critical insights about and rhetorical agency within such dominant structures? This course will address these questions and others as students work to develop and strengthen skills in critical analysis, research, and reflective practices through the lens of transnational comparative intercultural rhetoric. </P>

This course focuses on the visual presentation of numerical information - everything from box-andwhisker plots to flashy infographics - and specifically how such information can effectively persuade its readers. Emphasis will be on both analyzing and making visualizations; there will be no attention to data collection or analysis. Students can expect to improve their visual literacy skills; no facility with statistics or software packages is required. </P>

<P>WRIT 315 - Public Address </P>

<P>The study of public address has long been considered the cornerstone of a liberal arts education - meant to prepare graduates for success in public life as citizens, community members, and professionals. Students will examine public discourse on a relevant theme while familiarizing themselves with key debates regarding the theory and criticism of public address. Following that, students will engage in their own rhetorical criticism, as well as participating in speech and dialogue exercises that draw on rhetorical principles. As students immerse themselves in the history, criticism, and performance of public address, they will also consider how rhetorical dynamics inform issues of democracy and citizenship, especially as those issues relate to differences of ethnicity, race, class, and gender. </P>

<P>Students will explore the ways in which innovations in media have changed the shape of narrative and textuality. People often assume that new media is a 20th-century development, but this course will be a more historicized view; the printing press, after all, changed media more fundamentally than anything since. Starting with a foundation of media theory and narrative theory, the course will then work through the ages: printing; newspapers; color printing; radio; television; electronic fiction; fan fiction; hypertext; remix aesthetics; and videogames. </P>

<P>WRIT 342 - Rhetoric in Black and White: Communication and Culture in Conflict </P>

<P>In the nearly 400-year history of social relations between Blacks and Whites in America, rhetoric has often failed. Civil war, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, and Black Power were all actions or movements that ensued largely because words fell short of persuading persons of good will to submit to reasoned arguments. Arguably a pillar of American democracy (as in the freedom to speak and to dissent), why has rhetoric been so seemingly ineffective in securing mutual respect and understanding between America's Black and White citizens? This course seeks to answer this question by closely examining the styles of communication that historically have shaped the cultural identities and public personas of the two groups. From slave speech to the languages of protest in the 1960s to verbal expression in rap music and social media today, the course considers why communication or dialogue involving race is often doomed to fail. </P>

<P>WRIT 345 - Crafting Bodies: Movement, Gender, and Performance </P>

<P>The primary focus will be the body as viewed through the rhetorical lens of techné, defined by Aristotle as crafted knowledge and application. It engages with recent developments in the field of rhetoric, which has expanded to consider how persuasion and meaning making are impacted by movement, gender, and performance. To this end, the course will center on theories for studying bodies, introducing students to the dominant conversations within rhetoric and related fields. Students will apply these frameworks to texts from popular, political, and artistic performances to better understand how dominant narratives about the body constrain or enable certain types of behavior and what they signify. Through this theoretical and practical study, students will become critically aware of the intersections of bodies and their representations and how these intersections influence our capacity for engaged deliberation and social action. </P>

<P>Examines the ways in which language has reinforced racial and ethnic identities and divisions in post-civil rights America. It explores the conceptual origins of race, ethnicity, and other categories of difference, particularly those produced through legal, political, socioeconomic, and humanistic discourses. Recognizing that the United States is not just a multicultural society but a multilingual one, the course investigates how urban American youth have &quot;talked back&quot; to power and seized the power to name. It focuses in particular on uses of the Hip Hop vernacular by urban Latin Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and white Americans to give voice to their reality and the urban struggle. The course also traces the causes and consequences of historical silences, as suggested by Martin Luther King's dictum: &quot;A riot is the language of the unheard.&quot; </P>

<H5>WRIT 347 - Language and Gender </H5>

<P>Explores the intersection of linguistic theory and feminist theory, defining gender as essentially cultural, but without assuming beforehand that women and men do, in fact, use different language. Students consider the following questions in depth: To what extent does English have a sexist, or patriarchal bias? Do women and men speak differently in our culture? Do they think differently? What is the difference between gender and sexuality in language use? To what extent should writing avoid gender-specific forms, and to what extent should classrooms honor gender differences in language use? What is &quot;political correctness&quot; in language and what is its value? Students look at English from theoretical, political, and social viewpoints, with readings taken from a wide range of fields, but with a particular focus on linguistics and feminist theory. </P>

<P>WRIT 348 - Discourses of Whiteness </P>

<P>Claims that whiteness--white racial identity--is more about language than biology. Whiteness is a rhetorical construct that exists only in discourse, yet its concrete effects impact societies all over the globe. Drawing on texts from around the world, students trace the evolution of this construct from its inception up to the present day, examining the rhetorical strategies whereby whiteness is both hidden and revealed in a variety of genres: personal memoirs, philosophical essays, scientific investigations, political writings, legal documents, critical analyses, historical essays, and such mass media as television, film, newspapers, and magazines. By engaging in the rhetorical analysis of these texts, students examine how the discourses of whiteness continue to frame reality and mediate power relations. A required evening film series accompanying the class has students viewing, discussing, and analyzing feature films, documentary films, and television shows. </P>

<P>WRIT 354 - Dialogue and Deliberation in Democratic Life </P>

<P>Public communication is a vital part of democratic life. It is through the circulation and exchange of public speech that citizens shape the contours of public life, build community, and determine their core civic values. More importantly, it is through the work of democratic dialogue that citizens struggle with their inevitable differences and seek to find ways of working together despite those differences. The purpose of this class is to examine both the theory and practice of deliberative democracy, with the aim of better understanding how communities might use dialogue and deliberation to effectively engage across different perspectives. Students are asked to think critically about the possibilities and challenges of democratic dialogue. Students are also trained in facilitation techniques, with the major project for this class providing students an opportunity to facilitate an open forum on a campus-related issue. </P>
