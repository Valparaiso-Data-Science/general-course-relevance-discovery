<H1>How to Get to Smith </H1>

<Sect>
<P>By Car: Northampton is on Route I-91. Take Exit 18, and follow Route 5 north into the center of town. Turn left onto Route 9. Go straight through four sets of traffic lights, turning left into College Lane shortly after the third set. The Office of Admission is on your right, overlooking Paradise Pond. Parking is available next to the office and along Route 9. </P>

<P>By Air: Bradley International, located about 35 miles south of Northampton in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, is the nearest airport and is served by all major airlines. Limousines, buses and rental cars are available at the airport. Flying into Bradley rather than into Boston’s Logan Airport gives you a shorter drive to Northampton and spares you city traffic congestion. </P>
</Sect>

<P>By Train: Amtrak provides north-south train service to Northampton once a day. East-west service runs through Springfield, Massachusetts, which is 20 miles south of Northampton. From the Springfield train station, you can reach Northampton by changing trains, or by taxi, rental car or bus. The Springfield bus station is a short walk from the train station. </P>

<P>By Bus: Greyhound and Peter Pan bus lines serve the area. Most routes go to the main bus terminal in Springfield, where you can catch another bus to Northampton. Buses run almost hourly between Springfield and Northampton. Smith is a 10-minute walk or a short taxi ride from the bus station. </P>

<P>History of Smith College </P>

<P>Smith College is a distinguished liberal arts college committed to providing the highest quality undergraduate education for women to enable them to develop their intellects and talents and to participate effectively and fully in society. </P>

<P>Smith began in the 19th century in the mind and conscience of a New England woman. In her will, Sophia Smith articulated her vision of a liberal arts college for women, with the purpose that “women’s ‘wrongs’ will be redressed, their wages adjusted, their weight of influence in reforming the evils of society will be greatly increased as teachers, as writers, as mothers, as members of society, their power for good will be incalculably enlarged.” Through its commitment to academic excellence and its active engagement with the issues of our time, Smith remains faithful to its founder’s ideals. </P>

<P>The college envisioned by Sophia Smith and her minister, John M. Greene, resembled many other old New England colleges in its religious orientation, with all education at the college “pervaded by the Spirit of Evangelical Christian Religion” but “without giving preference to any sect or denomination.” </P>

<P>Smith has changed much since its founding in 1871. But throughout its history there have been certain enduring constants: an uncompromising defense of academic and intellectual freedom, an attention to the relation between college education and the larger public issues of world order and human dignity, and a concern for the rights and privileges of women. </P>

<P>Indeed, at a time when most people had narrow views of women’s abilities and their proper role in society, Sophia Smith showed not only concern with the particular needs of young women but also faith in their still underdeveloped powers. After enumerating the subjects that continue to be a vital part of the college’s curriculum, she added: </P>

<P>And in such other studies as coming times may develop or demand </P>

<P>for the education of women and the progress of the race, I would </P>

<P>have the education suited to the mental and physical wants of wom</P>

<P>en. It is not my design to render my sex any the less feminine, but to </P>

<P>develop as fully as may be the powers of womanhood, and furnish </P>

<P>women with the means of usefulness, happiness and honor now </P>

<P>withheld from them. In the fall of 1875, Smith College opened with 14 students and six faculty members under the presidency of Laurenus Clark Seelye. Its small campus was planned to make the college part of what John M. Greene called “the real practical life” of a New England town, rather than a sequestered academic preserve. College Hall, the Victorian Gothic administrative and classroom building, dominated the head of Northampton’s Main Street. For study and worship, students used the town’s well-endowed public library and various churches. Instead of a dormitory, students lived in a “cottage,” where life was more familial than institutional. Thus began the “house” system that, with some modifications, the college still employs today. The main lines of Smith’s founding educational policy, laid down in President Seelye’s inaugural address, remain valid today: then as now, the standards for admission were as high as those of the best colleges for men; then as now, a truly liberal education was fostered by a broad curriculum of the humanities, the fine arts and the natural and social sciences. </P>
</Sect>

<P>During the 35 years of President Seelye’s administration, the college prospered mightily. Its assets grew from Sophia Smith’s original bequest of about $400,000 to more than $3,000,000; its faculty to 122; its student body to 1,635; its buildings to 35. These buildings included Alumnae Gymnasium, site of the first women’s basketball game, which now houses the College Archives and is connected to the William Allan Neilson Library, one of the best-resourced undergraduate libraries in the country. </P>

<P>Smith’s second president, Marion LeRoy Burton, took office in 1910. President Burton, a graduate of Yale Divinity School, was a gifted public speaker with an especially acute business sense. He used these talents to help the college raise the amazing sum of $1,000,000—a huge endowment campaign for any college at that time. With the college’s increased endowment, President Burton was able to boost faculty salaries substantially and improve the faculty-to-student ratio. President Burton’s fund drive also invigorated the alumnae, bringing them closer to the college than ever before and increasing their representation on the board of trustees. </P>

<P>Along with improving the financial state and business methods of the college, President Burton contributed to a revision of the curriculum and initiated college honors programs to recognize outstanding students. He also helped to organize a cooperative admission system among Smith, Mount Holyoke, Wellesley and Vassar, the finest women’s colleges of the day. President Burton’s accomplishments are commemorated today by Burton Hall, the science building that his fund drive helped to finance. </P>

<P>When William Allan Neilson became president in 1917, Smith was already one of the largest women’s colleges in the world. President Neilson shrewdly developed the advantages of large academic institutions while maintaining the benefits of a small one. Under his leadership, the size of the faculty continued to increase while the number of students remained at about 2,000. The curriculum was revised to provide a pattern still followed in many American colleges-a broad foundation in various fields of knowledge, later complemented by the more intensive study of a major subject. The college expanded honors programs and initiated interdepartmental majors in science, landscape architecture and theatre. The School for Social Work, a coeducational graduate program, was founded. And more college houses were built, mainly in the Georgian complex called “the Quad,” so that every student could live on campus. </P>

<P>Not only did President Neilson help make Smith College one of the leading colleges in the United States, whether for men or women, but he also developed it into an institution of international distinction and concerns. President Neilson, himself a Scotsman, married to a well-educated German woman, transformed the college from a high-minded but provincial community in the hinterland of Massachusetts into a cosmopolitan center constantly animated by ideas from abroad. Between the two world wars, he brought many important exiled or endangered foreign teachers, scholars, lecturers and artists to the college. Meanwhile, as long as peace lasted, Smith students went to study in France, Italy and Spain on the Junior Year Abroad Program instituted by the college in 1924. </P>

<P>President Neilson retired in 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, and for one year Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, an alumna trustee, served as acting president. Herbert Davis took office as Smith’s fourth president in 1940 and reaffirmed the contributions that a liberal arts college could make to a troubled world. Already during World War I a group of Smith alumnae had gone to France to do relief work in the town of Grécourt; a replica of Grécourt’s chateau gates is now emblematic of the college. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Soon after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor, the college agreed to provide facilities on its campus for the first Officers’ Training Unit of the Women’s Reserve, or WAVES. The college added a summer term from 1942 to 1945 so some students could graduate more quickly and go on to government, hospital or military service. Though physically isolated by travel restrictions, the college retained its cosmopolitan character as refugees came to lecture, teach and study. And foreign films were shown regularly in Sage Hall-a practice that would give generations of students their sensitivity both to other cultures and to an important, relatively new art. President Davis’ administration was marked by intensified academic life, reflecting his belief that serious study was a way of confronting the global threat to civilization. </P>

<P>Benjamin Fletcher Wright came from Harvard to become Smith’s fifth president in 1949. The college had by then resumed its regular calendar and completed several much-needed building projects, including a new heating plant and a student recreation center named for retiring President Davis. The most memorable achievements of President Wright’s administration were the strengthening of Smith’s financial position and the defense of academic freedom during the 1950s. </P>

<P>In 1950, the $7 Million Fund Drive was triumphantly completed, enabling the college to improve facilities and increase faculty salaries. In 1955, the Helen Hills Hills Chapel was completed, giving Smith its own place of worship. The early 1950s were not, though, easy years for colleges; McCarthyism bred a widespread suspicion of any writing or teaching that might seem left of center. In defending his faculty members’ right to political and intellectual independence, President Wright showed great courage and statesmanship. Complementing his achievements was the financial and moral support of Smith’s Alumnae Association, by now the most devoted and active group of its kind in the country. Before President Wright’s term ended, the college received a large gift for constructing a new faculty office and classroom building to be named for him. </P>

<P>When Thomas Corwin Mendenhall came from Yale in 1959 to become Smith’s sixth president, both the college and the country at large were enjoying peace and prosperity. During the 1960s, social and cultural changes stirred the college profoundly, and a series of powerful movements influenced the larger society and the academic world alike. In response to the needs of increasingly independent and ambitious students, the curriculum was thoroughly revised. Collegewide requirements were set aside and independent study encouraged. The college made more varied educational experiences available to Smith undergraduates by extending cooperation with its neighbors—Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts. And Smith joined other private colleges in the Northeast to develop the Twelve College Exchange Program. The college added buildings with the most modern facilities for the study of the natural sciences, performing arts and fine arts. The new fine arts center included the Smith College Museum of Art, now one of the most distinguished college museums in the country. To promote women’s fitness, the college began plans to build Ainsworth gymnasium. </P>

<P>The 1960s saw the civil rights, the students’ rights and the anti-war movements take root and grow at many of the country’s universities and colleges, including Smith. Thanks to these movements and to the wisdom, tact and humor of President Mendenhall, the college emerged from the 1960s with a more precise awareness of student needs and an active, practical sense of social responsibility. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, life in the college houses was changing. The old rules governing late evenings out and male visitors were relaxed, then abandoned. Not surprisingly, when Vassar began to admit men, and Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth to admit women as candidates for degrees, some members of the college community wondered whether Smith should also become coeducational. In 1971, a committee of trustees, faculty, administration, students and alumnae studied the question in detail. The committee concluded that admitting men as candidates for the Smith degree would detract from the founding purpose of the college-to provide the best possible education for women. </P>
</Sect>

<P>In the late 1960s and early 1970s another important movement—the women’s movement—was gathering momentum. This was to have a profound effect on American society and to confirm the original purpose of Smith College. The college began its second century in 1975 by inaugurating its first woman president, Jill Ker Conway, who came to Smith from Australia by way of Harvard and the University of Toronto. She was a charismatic and energetic leader with a vision for women’s education, and her administration was marked by three major accomplishments: a large-scale renovation and expansion of Neilson Library, evidence of Smith’s undiminished concern for the heart of the liberal arts; the rapid growth of the Ada Comstock Scholars Program, through which women beyond the traditional college age could earn a Smith degree; and exceptionally successful fund-raising efforts. Also during President Conway’s administration, the Career Development Office was expanded to better counsel Smith students and alumnae about career opportunities and graduate training for women. Recognizing the rapidly growing emphasis on fitness and athletics for women, Smith completed the Ainsworth Gymnasium and broke ground for new indoor and outdoor track and tennis facilities. President Conway’s contributions underscored her commitment to women’s colleges and a liberal arts education in today’s society. </P>

<P>When Mary Maples Dunn came to Smith in 1985 after many years as a professor of history and then as dean of Bryn Mawr College, Smith’s student body had diversified. During its early decades the student body had been overwhelmingly Protestant, but by the 1970s, Roman Catholic and Jewish college chaplains served alongside the Protestant chaplain. All racial, ethnic and religious groups are now well represented on campus, evidence of Smith’s continuing moral and intellectual commitment to diversity. </P>

<P>In Dunn’s decade as president, the college raised more than $300 million, constructed two major buildings and renovated many more, enhanced communication on and off campus, attracted record numbers of applicants (while upholding the same academic standards) and doubled the value of its endowment. Computer technology transformed the way Smith conducted its business. And the curriculum became broader in scope, with five new majors and increased course offerings in non-Western and neglected American cultures. </P>

<P>In 1995 Ruth Simmons became Smith’s ninth president, the first African-American woman to head any top-ranked American college or university. Simmons galvanized the campus through an ambitious campuswide self-study process that resulted in a number of landmark initiatives, including Praxis, a program that allows every Smith student the opportunity to elect an internship funded by the college; an engineering program, the first at a women’s college; programs in the humanities that include a poetry center and a peer-reviewed journal devoted to publishing scholarly works by and about women of color; and curricular innovations that include intensive seminars for first-year students and programs to encourage students’ speaking and writing skills. </P>

<P>A number of building projects were launched during Simmons’ administration; most significant was a $35-million expansion and renovation of the Smith College Museum of Art, art department and art library. Construction of the Campus Center began, and the Lyman Conservatory was renovated. Simmons left Smith in June 2001, assuming the presidency of Brown University. John M. Connolly, Smith’s first provost, served as acting president for one year, skillfully guiding the college through the national trauma of September 11, 2001, and its aftermath. </P>

<P>A widely respected scholar of Victorian literature, Carol T. Christ took up her duties as Smith’s 10th president in that year, leading the institution through the economic downturn of that year and the global financial crisis of 2008. Christ’s administration was characterized by an energetic program of outreach, innovation and long-range planning—including financial and capital planning—to position Smith for optimal success in a changing higher education landscape. She launched a review, conducted by members of the Smith faculty and outside scholars, to determine the distinctive intellectual traditions of the Smith curriculum and areas on which to build. Issued in 2007, The Smith Design for Learning: A Plan to Reimagine a Liberal Arts Education builds upon Smith’s history of pedagogical innovation, identifying priority areas—among them, global studies, environmental sustainability, and community engagement—for significant investment over the coming decade. </P>

<Sect>
<P>In the area of capital planning, a number of major building projects came to fruition during Christ’s tenure: the renovation and expansion of the Brown Fine Arts Center; a dramatic new Campus Center; a renovated Lyman Conservatory; the impressive Olin Fitness Center; new homes for the Poetry Center and the Mwangi Cultural Center; the renovation of Lilly Hall, home of the college’s School for Social Work; and the construction of Conway House, an apartment building for Ada Comstock Scholars with children. Ford Hall, a state-of-the-art, sustainably designed classroom and laboratory facility named in recognition of its lead donor, the Ford Motor Company Fund, opened in 2009; it serves as home to the college’s pioneering Picker Engineering Program as well as the departments of molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry and computer science. Under Christ’s leadership, Smith made significant commitments to environmental sustainability in its curriculum and campus operations, including the construction of a cogeneration facility for power and heat and the dedication of the MacLeish Field Station, a 200-acre woodland tract in Whately, Mass., for environmental education and research. </P>

<P>Over the decade of Christ’s leadership, the student body became notably more diverse and international, reflecting a commitment to educating students who are prepared to assume leadership roles around the world. Christ extended Smith’s global ties, through partnerships such as Women’s Education Worldwide, an organization of women’s colleges in 20 countries, and the Women in Public Service Project, a founding partnership of the Department of State and the five leading U.S. women’s colleges to train a new generation of women to enter the public sector with the skills and passion to address global challenges. </P>

<P>Smith’s 11th president, Kathleen McCartney, took office in 2013. McCartney, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), is an internationally recognized authority on child development and early education. The first in her family to go to college, she graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University with a bachelor of science in psychology, and later earned a doctorate in psychology from Yale University. A signature accomplishment of her tenure at HGSE was the creation of a three-year doctorate in educational leadership developed in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government. </P>

<P>Since assuming the presidency, McCartney has led a strategic planning effort that is resulting in important new academic and co-curricular programs that expand opportunities for women. She has forged partnerships with leading organizations, including the Harvard/MIT online education platform known as edX; the MassMutual Life Insurance Company, a supporter of data science initiatives; and the Posse Foundation. Under her leadership, Smith has engaged noted architectural designer Maya Lin to re-envision its historic Neilson Library in the context of its renowned Frederick Law Olmsted–designed campus. The $100 million project is scheduled for completion in 2020. Women for the World: The Campaign for Smith, which McCartney led to its culmination in 2016, raised $486 million, setting a record for the largest and most successful campaign ever undertaken by a women’s college. Notably, the campaign raised close to $130 million for financial aid, including 103 new endowed scholarships. </P>

<P>In one of her first addresses to the Smith community, McCartney celebrated the college’s long tradition of providing access to a Smith education to any talented and ambitious young woman who seeks it. “We must remain committed to recruiting and supporting students regardless of the resources their secondary schools could offer, regardless of their family’s circumstances and regardless of society’s low expectations for some,” she said. “Education for women and girls is the human rights issue of our time.” </P>
</Sect>

<P>Smith continues to benefit from a dynamic relationship between innovation and tradition. The college is very much a part of Northampton, a vibrant cultural center. Students still live in college houses, each with its own common rooms, in accord with the original “cottage” plan. And while Smith’s curriculum of the humanities, arts and sciences still flourishes, the college continues to respond to emerging intellectual developments, offering majors or interdepartmental programs in such fields as engineering, environmental science and policy, data sciences, the study of women and gender, Global South development, neuroscience, Latin American and Latino/a studies, and Jewish studies, as well as concentrations—programs combining intellectual and practical experience—in such areas as archives, museum studies and global financial institutions. A vigorous culture of student-faculty research and scholarship continues to characterize the Smith experience, evidenced in part by the receipt of record-setting funding from the National Science Foundation over the last decade. Were Sophia Smith to visit the campus today she would no doubt find her vision realized, as students at her college, young women of extraordinary promise and ambition, prepare themselves for lives of leadership and distinction. </P>

<H2>Smith: A Liberal Arts College </H2>

<P>The tradition of the liberal arts reaches back into classical antiquity. Training the mind through the study of languages, literature, history, culture, society, mathematics, science, the arts and philosophy has for centuries been the favored approach in Europe and America for educating leaders. It is a general training, not intended as a preparation for any one profession. In the 19th century the liberal arts were characterized as providing “the discipline and furniture of the mind: expanding its powers, and storing it with knowledge,” to which was added, “The former of these is, perhaps, the more important of the two.” At many liberal arts colleges today this ideal is understood as implying both breadth and depth in each student’s course of studies, as well as the acquisition of crucial skills in writing, public speaking and quantitative reasoning. </P>

<P>From its foundation in 1871 Smith has taken a progressive, expansive and student-oriented view of its role as a liberal arts college. To the studies of the humanities and sciences the college early added courses in art and music, a substantial innovation for its time. In the same spirit the faculty has continued to integrate the new and the old, respecting all the while the individual needs of, and differences among, its students. As an early dean of the faculty wrote, it “is always the problem of education, to secure the proper amount of system and the due proportion of individual liberty, to give discipline to the impulsive and wayward and largeness of opportunity to those who will make good use of it.” </P>

<P>In the spirit of “individual liberty [and] largeness of opportunity” Smith College has since 1970 had no distribution requirements for graduation. In the interest of “discipline” each student must complete a major, to give depth to her studies, while to guarantee breadth she must take at least 64 credits outside the department or program of her major. As for “system,” the college assigns each beginning student a faculty member as academic adviser; each student later chooses a major adviser. Students, in consultation with their advisers, are expected to select a curriculum that has both breadth and depth, engages with cultures other than their own, and develops critical skills in writing, public speaking, and quantitative reasoning. </P>

<P>The Smith faculty strongly recommends that students “pursue studies in the seven major fields of knowledge” listed below. Completion of a course in each of these areas is a condition for Latin Honors at graduation: to be eligible each student must take at least one course in each of the seven areas. Students who complete a course in each area will receive Liberal Arts Commendation and this will be noted on their transcripts. </P>

<H1>The Curriculum </H1>

<P>Each discipline within the liberal arts framework offers students a valid perspective on the world’s past, present and future. Therefore, we recommend that students pursue studies in the following seven major fields of knowledge: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Literature, either in English or in some other language, because it is a crucial form of expression, contributes to our understanding of human experience and plays a central role in the development of culture; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Historical studies, either in history or in historically oriented courses in art, music, religion, philosophy and theatre, because they provide a perspective on the development of human society and culture and free us from the parochialism of the present; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Social science, because it offers a systematic and critical inquiry into human nature, social institutions and human relationships; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Natural science, because of its methods, its contribution to our understanding of the world around us and its significance in modern culture; </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</Sect>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Mathematics and analytic philosophy, because they foster an understanding of the nature and use of formal, rational thought; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>The arts, because they constitute the media through which people have sought, through the ages, to express their deepest feelings and values; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>A foreign language, because it frees one from the limits of one’s own tongue, provides access to another culture and makes possible communication outside one’s own society. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>We further recommend that students take performance courses offered in exercise and sport studies, because they provide opportunities for recreation, health and the development of skills for the complete person. </P>

<P>Curricular Expectations and Requirements </P>

<P>In the course of their educations, Smith students are expected to become acquainted with—to master, as far as they are able—certain bodies of knowledge, but they are also expected to integrate that knowledge with their experience outside the classroom. The list below summarizes those curricular and co-curricular expectations. While acknowledging that education can never be defined by a listing of skills, the faculty believes that such a listing may usefully contribute to the planning of an education, and it offers the list below in that spirit, as an aid to students as they choose their courses and assess their individual progress, and to advisers as they assist in that process. The college’s student learning goals, or the essential capacities, are the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Ability to engage across difference in place, culture and time </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Creativity, curiosity and innovation </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Critical and analytical thinking </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Resilience and resourcefulness </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Self-awareness as a learner </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The Writing Requirement </P>

<P>Each first-year student is required, during her first or second semester at Smith, to complete with a grade of C- or higher at least one writing-intensive course. Based on their level of proficiency, students will be directed toward appropriate intensive writing courses. Ada Comstock Scholars and transfer students are also required to complete at least one writing-intensive course, with a grade of C- or higher, during their first two semesters at Smith. The WI requirement can be satisfied before matriculation based on transcript review by the registrar, in conjunction with the writing committee. Writing intensive courses devote a significant amount of class time to teaching students to write with precision, clarity, economy and some degree of elegance. That is to say, </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>to articulate a thesis or central argument, or to create a description or report, with an orderly sequence of ideas, apt transitions and a purpose clear to the intended audience; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>to support an argument and to enrich an explanation with evidence; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>when appropriate, to identify and to evaluate suitable primary and secondary sources for scholarly work, demonstrating awareness of library catalogues and databases and of the values and limitations of Internet resources; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>to incorporate the work of others (by quotation, summary or paraphrase) concisely, effectively and with attention to the models of citation of the various disciplines and with respect for academic integrity; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>to compose paragraphs that are unified and coherent; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>to edit work until it is orderly, clear and free of violations of the conventions of standard written English (grammar, usage, punctuation, diction, syntax). </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Sect>
<P>For the bachelor of arts degree, there are no further required courses outside the student’s field of concentration. The college does, however, make two demands of the student: that she complete a major and that she take at least 64 credits outside the department or program of her major. The curricular requirements for the bachelor of science degree in engineering are listed in the courses of study section under Engineering. Furthermore, students who wish to become eligible for Latin Honors at graduation or who wish to have Liberal Arts Commendation indicated on their transcripts must elect at least one course (normally four credits) in each of the seven major fields of knowledge listed previously. Each student has the freedom and responsibility to choose, with the help of her academic advisers, a course of studies to fit her individual needs and interests. The curricular expectations and requirements for the degree therefore allow great flexibility in the design of a course of study leading to the degree. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H1>The Major </H1>

<P>A student’s program requires a minimum of 36 credits in a departmental or interdepartmental major. For the bachelor of arts degree, one-half of a student’s total program, or at least 64 credits, shall be taken outside the department or program of the major. Any course (including prerequisites) which is explicitly listed in the catalogue as required for, or counting toward, fulfilling the requirements of the major shall be considered to be inside the major for the purposes of this rule. The sole exception to the 64-credit rule is that in the case of a major requiring study of two foreign languages taught within a single department or program, no fewer than 56 credits shall be taken outside the department or program of the major. The requirements for each major are described at the end of the course listings for each major department and program. Normally, cross-listed and dual-prefixed courses are also considered to be inside the major. Students should refer to the semester’s schedule of classes for the most current information on cross-listed and dual-prefix courses. </P>

<P>Students declare their majors no later than the registration period during the second semester of the sophomore year but may declare them earlier. Once the major is declared, a member of the faculty in the major department, either chosen or assigned, serves as the student’s adviser. </P>

<P>Major programs are offered in the following areas: </P>

<P>Africana Studies German Studies American Studies Government Anthropology History Art Italian Studies Astronomy Jewish Studies Biochemistry Latin American and Latino/a Studies Biological Sciences Mathematics Chemistry Medieval Studies Classical Languages and Literatures Middle East Studies Comparative Literature Music Computer Science Neuroscience Dance Philosophy East Asian Languages Physics East Asian Studies Psychology Economics Religion Education and Child Study Russian, East European and Engineering Eurasian Studies English Language and Literature Sociology Environmental Science and Policy Spanish and Portuguese Film and Media Studies Statistical and Data Sciences French Studies Study of Women and Gender Geosciences Theatre If the educational needs of the individual student cannot be met by a course of study in any of the specified majors, a student may design and undertake an interdepartmental major sponsored by advisers from at least two departments, subject to the approval of the Committee on Academic Priorities. Information on student-designed interdepartmental majors may be found below. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Students in departmental majors or in student-designed interdepartmental majors may enter the honors program. </P>

<P>On its official transcripts, the college will recognize the completion of no more than two majors, or one major and one minor, or one major and one Five College Certificate for each student, even if the student chooses to complete the requirements for additional majors, minors or certificates. In addition, the college will recognize the completion of no more than one concentration for each student. Normally, only three courses from any one major may count toward both the student’s major and the concentration. No minor or second major may be in the same department or program as the first major. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Departmental Honors </H1>

<P>The Departmental Honors Program is for qualified students who want to study a particular topic or undertake research that results in a significant thesis or project within their major department or program during the senior year. Interested students should consult the director of honors in the major department or program about application criteria, procedures and deadlines. Students must have permission of the major department or program to enter the Departmental Honors Program. Information regarding the Departmental Honors Program may also be obtained from the dean of the senior class. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>The Minor </H1>

<P>Students may consider the option of a minor in addition to a major. A minor consists of a sequence, designated by the faculty, of 20 to 24 credits from one or more departments. The minor may not be in the same department or program as the student’s major. No more than two courses may be counted for both the major and the minor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Concentrations </H1>

<P>A concentration gives students a way to organize a combination of intellectual and practical experiences, such as internships and service learning, around an area of interest. Students apply to concentrations and when selected they receive focused advising to help them design a program in their area of interest. </P>

<P>The concentration allows for more flexibility than is possible within an academic minor, and students can pursue a concentration alongside a minor or a second major. </P>

<P>The college currently offers the following concentrations: the archives concentration connects students with the Sophia Smith Collection, the College Archives and other archives and is designed to make our histories public through research projects and professional training; book studies connects students with the exceptional resources of the Mortimer Rare Book Room and the wealth of area book artists and craftspeople; the community engagement and social change concentration connects students to the Jandon Center for Community Engagement and helps students expand their understanding of local, national and global issues that affect communities and to develop the skills and values necessary to collaborate with communities as citizens and leaders; global financial institutions connects students to the Center for Women and Financial Independence and provides a course of study that combines academic courses, research, and fieldwork to deepen knowledge of global financial markets; the museums concentration connects students to the Smith College Museum of Art and other museums and gives students a foundation in the history of museums and the critical issues they engage; the poetry concentration connects students to the Smith College Poetry Center and provides a course of study designed to allow students to pursue work on and about poetry through a range of experiences and courses; the South Asia concentration brings together areas of study to develop a sustained curricular and co-curricular focus on the region of South Asia; the sustainable food and climate change concentrations connect students to the Center for the Environment, Ecological Design and Sustainability (CEEDS) and integrate knowledge in support of environmental decisions and actions. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Other academic concentrations are under development. </P>

<P>Each concentration offers: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>one or more gateway courses to introduce students to the major questions or methods that define the topic. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>

<H1>Majors and Minors </H1>

<P>This course of study must differ significantly from an established major or minor and must include concentrated work in more than one department. For majors, at least one of the departments or programs must itself offer a major. Majors are expected to include 36 to 48 credits in related courses in more than one department. Normally, a minimum of 24 credits are at the 200 level or higher and a minimum of eight are at the 300 level. One of the 300-level courses may be the integrating project. Examples of self-designed majors include linguistics, exercise science and logic. </P>

<P>Minors are expected to include 20 to 24 credits in related courses in more than one department, of which no more than eight credits should be at the 100 level and at least four should be at the 300 level. </P>

<P>Proposals for majors may be submitted no earlier than the first semester of the sophomore year and no later than the end of advising week of the second semester of the junior year. The deadlines for submission of proposals are October 15, February 1 and March 15. Proposals for minors may be submitted to the Subcommittee on Honors and Independent Programs at any time after the major has been declared but no later than the end of the first semester of the senior year. </P>

<P>The major or minor proposal must include a statement explicitly defining the subject matter and method of approach underlying the design of the major or minor; course lists; and, for the major, a clearly formulated integrating course or piece of work. Proposals must include letters of support from all advisers representing the areas of study central to the major and written recommendations signed by the chairs indicating approval of the departments or programs in the major. </P>

<P>Information about student-designed interdepartmental majors and minors is available from the dean of the senior class. </P>

<H1>Five College Certificate Programs </H1>

<P>Five College Certificate Programs provide a directed course of study in various interdisciplinary fields through the resources available at the five area colleges. Certificate programs are offered in addition to or in conjunction with the student’s major. Certificates are awarded upon successful completion of a program by the appropriate Five College faculty councils on the recommendation of designated faculty advisers from the student’s home institution. Current certificate programs require that the student earn a grade of B or above in all courses counting for the certificate and many require students to demonstrate competence in a language other than English. Each institution determines the method by which competence will be measured. </P>

<Sect>
<H1>Advising </H1>

<P>Liberal Arts and Major Advisers </P>

<P>Each student has a faculty adviser who helps her select and register for courses that will satisfy the broad expectations of the college and will further her personal goals and aspirations. The dean of the first-year class assigns a liberal arts adviser to each first-year student. This faculty member will continue to advise her until she chooses a major. The names of major advisers appear after each department’s course listings. </P>

<P>Together the adviser and student devise a balanced academic program, making full use of the courses and programs available. The adviser approves all registration decisions, including changes made to the course program after the beginning of a semester. An adviser can help a student find academic and personal resources and can help her select and pursue various optional programs. It is the joint responsibility of both student and adviser to plan a course program that will lead to successful completion of all degree requirements. </P>

<P>In addition to aiding in the selection of courses, major advisers often counsel students about preparation for graduate schools or careers. The more clearly a student can articulate her own vision and goals, the more productive will be her relationship with her adviser. </P>

<P>Minor Advisers </P>

<P>A student electing a minor will have the guidance of a faculty adviser who represents the discipline, in addition to the help of her major adviser. She normally must consult with her minor adviser at the time she initially elects the minor, and again when she needs to certify that the minor has been completed. </P>

<P>Engineering Advising </P>

<P>Students who are interested in engineering should consult the faculty listed in the online course catalog under the Engineering “About” section. </P>

<P>Prebusiness Advising </P>

<P>Students who are interested in pursuing a graduate program in business should consult with the Lazarus Center for Career Development, which provides information and advice about all career fields and graduate training. Juniors and seniors who wish further advice on admissions criteria may consult a member of the Prebusiness Advisory Group. Please contact the Lazarus Center for Career Development for the names of faculty and staff members who are members of this group. </P>

<P>Premedical and Prehealth Professions Advising </P>

<P>Students who wish to prepare for careers in the health professions have special advising needs. They may major in any subject, provided their program includes courses that will satisfy the minimum entrance requirements for health professions schools. </P>

<P>Students interested in a premedical or other health-related program should consult “Prehealth Professional Programs” in the Biochemistry section online at www.smith.edu/prehealth for important information. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Prelaw Advising </P>

<P>Law schools accept students from any major; there is no prelaw curriculum. Students interested in pursuing a law degree are encouraged to pick up or print off a copy of the Lazarus Center for Career Development handout on “Law School,” and bring their questions to the prelaw adviser (Daryl Gehman, in Drew Hall). </P>

<H1>Academic Honor System </H1>

<P>In 1944, the students of Smith College voted to establish the Academic Honor System in the belief that each member of the Smith community has an obligation to uphold the academic standards of the college. The basic premise on which the code is based is that the learning process is a product of individual effort and commitment accompanied by moral and intellectual integrity. The Academic Honor Code is the institutional expression of these beliefs. The code requires that each individual be honest and respect and respond to the demands of living responsibly in an academic community. </P>

<H1>Special Programs </H1>

<P>Accelerated Course Program </P>

<P>With permission of the administrative board, students having a cumulative average of at least B (3.0) may complete the requirements for the degree in six or seven semesters. Four semesters, including two of these in the junior or senior year, must be completed in residence at Smith College in Northampton. A student may not accelerate until the record for the first year is complete and a major has been declared; acceleration petitions should be submitted no sooner than the beginning of the fall semester of the sophomore year. </P>

<P>A maximum of 32 credits can be accumulated toward the degree through a combination of Advanced Placement (or similar), pre-matriculation, Interterm and summer school credits. Consult the Academic Rules and Procedures section for maximum credit limits in each category. Students whose acceleration plans include courses to be taken during interterm should be aware that these courses are limited both in number and in enrollment and cannot be guaranteed as part of the acceleration plan. Requests for permission to accelerate should be filed with the student’s class dean at least two full semesters before the proposed date of graduation. A student who intends to study away from campus during the junior year should file her acceleration proposal at the beginning of the sophomore year. </P>

<P>The Ada Comstock Scholars Program </P>

<P>The Ada Comstock Scholars Program at Smith combines the rigorous academic challenges of the undergraduate program with flexibility for women beyond traditional college age. </P>

<P>Many women choose to work or raise a family rather than complete an education, but later wish to return to earn a degree. Established in 1975, the Ada Comstock Scholars Program allows nontraditional students to complete a bachelor’s degree either part-time or full-time. Each Ada Comstock student attends the same classes and fulfills the same requirements as do all other Smith students. The program provides academic advising, orientation programs, peer advising, a center for the exclusive use of participants in the program and some housing. Career counseling and academic assistance are provided through specialized offices available on campus. Financial aid is available to all admitted students based on demonstrated need. </P>

<P>Reasons for becoming an Ada Comstock Scholar differ as widely as each woman’s history, age, marital status, parenting circumstances and socioeconomic level. Each Ada Comstock Scholar has a high level of ability, strong motivation and at least a year of transferable liberal arts credit. This widely disparate group of women contributes vigor, diversity of perspective, intellectual ability and enthusiasm to all aspects of Smith life. Their achievements confirm the academic standard of the college. </P>
</Sect>

<P>A student admitted as a traditional first-year or transfer student normally will not be permitted to change her class status to Ada Comstock Scholar. A candidate’s status as an Ada Comstock Scholar must be designated at the time of application. </P>

<P>For more information about the Ada Comstock Scholars Program, contact the Office of Admission at 413-585-2523; email, admission@smith.edu; or fax 413-585-2527. </P>

<P>Community Auditing: Nonmatriculated Students </P>

<P>Members of the local community who have earned a high school diploma are eligible to audit a lecture course at Smith on a space-available basis with the permission of the instructor and the registrar. Forms for the faculty member’s signature and more information about auditing are available at the Office of the Registrar. A fee is charged and is determined by the type of course. Normally studio art courses are not open to nonmatriculated students. Auditors are invited to attend classes, but they do not participate in other aspects of college life. Official records of audits are not maintained. </P>

<P>Five College Interchange </P>

<P>A student in good standing may take a course without additional cost during a regular semester at Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts, if the course is appropriate to the educational plan of the student and approved by Smith College. A first-semester first-year student must obtain the permission of the class dean before enrolling in a Five College course. Consult the “Academic Rules and Procedures” section for additional information and restrictions. A list of Five College courses approved for Smith College degree credit is available at the registrar’s office. Requests for approval of courses not on the list may be submitted to the registrar’s office. However, Smith College does not accept all Five College courses for credit toward the Smith degree. </P>

<P>Smith Scholars Program </P>

<P>The Smith Scholars Program is designed for highly motivated and talented students who want to spend two to four semesters  working on projects of their own devising, freed (in varying degrees) from normal college requirements. A student may apply at any time after the first semester of her sophomore year and must submit a detailed statement of her program, an evaluation of her proposal and her capacity to complete it from those faculty who will advise her and two supporting recommendations from instructors who have taught her in class. The deadlines for submission of proposals for the Smith Scholars Program are November 15 and April 15 of the student’s junior year. The proportion of work to be done in normal courses will be decided jointly by the student, her adviser(s) and the Subcommittee on Honors and Independent Programs. Work done in the program may result in a group of related papers, an original piece of work, such as a play, or some combination of these. </P>

<P>A Smith Scholar may or may not complete a regular departmental major. Further details, guidelines and applications are available from the dean of the senior class. </P>

<Sect>
<H1>Study Abroad Programs </H1>

<P>Smith College offers a wide variety of study abroad opportunities, from Smith’s own programs in Western Europe to Smith consortial and other approved programs all over the world. For the Smith programs in Florence, Hamburg, Geneva and Paris, an online program application must be filed by early February with the Office for International Study. Students interested in all other study abroad programs file an online study abroad credit application in addition to separate program applications. The deadline for fall, spring and full-year programs is mid-February of each year, with a few exceptions for some spring semester options. Students should contact the Office for International Study for information on deadlines and procedures. </P>

<Sect>
<P>For all study abroad programs, the Smith College comprehensive fee is charged. The comprehensive fee, covering tuition, room and board when classes are in session, is the same as the comprehensive fee for a year’s study in Northampton. Smith pays tuition, room and board on behalf of the student to the study abroad program or the host institution. </P>

<P>Students are responsible for all expenses and all travel during program breaks or vacations. Incidental expenses vary according to individual tastes and plans, and funds for such expenses are not covered by the comprehensive fee. </P>

<P>All students who wish to study abroad must obtain approval from the Office for International Study. Students must be in good standing in academic and student conduct matters with a minimum GPA of 3.0, have a declared major and have no shortage of credit at the time of application to be approved for study abroad. All prospective candidates are urged to seek advice, beginning in their first year, concerning the best sequence of courses in the language of the country in which they wish to study. Students who spend all or part of the junior year abroad may apply for admission to the departmental honors program at the beginning of the senior year. Any student wishing to spend any part of the senior year abroad must petition the Administrative Board through the class dean. Students should note that a year or semester abroad does not count toward the required two years in residence at Smith College. </P>

<P>Students attending programs with yearlong courses receive credit only if they have taken the final exams and final grades have been issued by the host institution. </P>

<P>In all instances, Smith reserves the right to approve, retract or deny a student’s participation on study abroad. Normally, students who withdraw from a Study Abroad Program are withdrawn from Smith and may not return to the college the following semester. Please refer to the Institutional Refund Policy for additional information regarding institutional charges and financial aid adjustments. </P>

<P>Smith Programs Abroad </P>

<P>The Smith Programs Abroad provide students in a variety of disciplines the opportunity for study in foreign countries. Smith faculty direct or advise the four programs in Europe: France (Paris), Germany (Hamburg), Italy (Florence) and Switzerland (Geneva). During the academic year students either board with local families (Paris and Florence) or live in student residence halls (Geneva and Hamburg). During vacations the college assumes no responsibility for participants in the Smith programs, and students are free to travel, although by special arrangements in some programs they may stay in residence if they prefer. </P>

<P>Students in Florence, Geneva and Hamburg have single semester and yearlong options of study. The Smith in Paris program is a full-year academic program only. On all Smith Programs Abroad, students normally receive 16–18 credits per semester or a total of 34 credits for the academic year. </P>

<P>Florence </P>

<P>The fall semester and full-year Smith in Florence program begins with two weeks of intensive study in Italian language and culture, history and art history. In the fall, students take courses offered especially for Smith by university professors at the Smith Center. Yearlong and spring semester students enroll in one or two courses at the Università di Firenze in the humanities, natural sciences, political science, and education in addition to courses at the Smith Center. Limited university course options are also available in other subjects. Students live in private homes selected by the college. Classes in Florence are conducted entirely in Italian: students are expected to have an excellent command of the language and maintain a language pledge. </P>

<P>Students have the option of participating on the Smith in Florence program for either the fall or spring semester, or the full year. The minimum language requirement is two years of college-level Italian or the equivalent for all options. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Geneva </P>

<P>Geneva program offers opportunities for enrollment in the Université de Genève and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, as well as an internship track in an international organization. Students are fully matriculated at the Université de Genève and may take courses at its associated institutes including the L’École de Traduction et d’Interprétation. </P>

<P>The program begins with a three-week orientation including intensive French language study, Swiss culture and history courses and excursions. The academic year in Geneva begins in mid-September and continues until early June. During the semester, students study in French and/or English, and follow one of three tracks: </P>

<P>A. Geneva International Internship Program Intern at an international organization for three or four days per week, study French, take the core Humanitarianism course at the Smith Center and enroll in one university course. At least one semester of college-level French is required prior to the start of the program. </P>

<P>B. University Studies Program Enroll in four or five Smith Center and university courses each semester, including French language. Available spring or academic year. Requires 3.0 GPA. Two years of college-level French required for the full year. One year of college-level French required for spring. </P>

<P>C. International Relations Program Enroll in at least two courses at the Graduate Institute and two additional courses at the Smith Center, including French language. Most academic courses are taught in English; students with advanced French language may enroll in courses taught in French. At least one semester of college-level French is required. </P>

<P>Hamburg </P>

<P>The academic year in Germany consists of two semesters (winter semester from mid-October to mid-February and summer semester from the beginning of April to mid-July) separated by a four-week vacation during which students are free to travel. The yearlong program begins with a four-week cultural orientation program in Hamburg providing language review, an introduction to current affairs and to the city of Hamburg, and excursions to other places of interest in Germany. During the academic year, the students are fully matriculated at the Universität Hamburg. They attend regular courses offered by the university, special courses arranged by Smith and tutorials to support their university course work. The program is open to students in every major field of study, and a wide variety of courses is available, including art (studio and history), biology, economics, environmental science, history, history of science and technology, literature, mathematics, music history, philosophy, physics, psychology, religion and sociology. </P>

<P>Two years of college-level German are required for the full-year program. The program offers a one-semester study option in the spring semester for students with three semesters of college-level German or equivalent. </P>

<P>Paris </P>

<P>The Smith in Paris program begins with a two-week orientation devoted to intensive language study, supplemented by courses, lectures and excursions. In mid-September, each student selects a program of courses suited to her particular major. A wide variety of disciplines can be pursued at the Université de Paris; for example, art history at the Institut d’Art et d’Archéologie; history, literature, philosophy, religion and many other subjects at the Sorbonne (Paris IV); natural sciences at Paris VII; political science at Institut d’Études Politiques; and architecture at L’École Normal Superiore d’Architecture–Val de Seine.

The exchange is open to a limited number of students with a minimum 3.0 average and is intended primarily for the junior year. Normally, students participating in the program may not transfer to the host institution at the end of their stay there. Students who wish to attend Dartmouth must do so for the entire academic year (three of Dartmouth’s four quarters) and may not be enrolled at Smith during the same academic year. Students should be aware that the member colleges may limit or eliminate their participation in the exchange in any particular year due to space constraints. </P>

<P>A limited pool of financial aid is available for students studying in the Twelve College Exchange. </P>

<P>Students accepted into the program are expected to pay the fees set by the host institution and to comply with the financial, social and academic regulations of that institution. The course of study to be followed at the host institution must be approved in advance by the student’s major adviser at Smith College. All grades earned through exchange programs are recorded on the Smith transcript but are not included in the Smith GPA and therefore are not included in the calculation of honors. </P>

<P>Additional information about eligibility requirements and application procedures are available in the class deans’ office and on the class deans’ website, www.smith.edu/about-smith/class-deans/12-college-exchange. </P>

<H1>The Campus and Campus Life </H1>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H1>Introduction </H1>

<P>Smith’s 147-acre campus is a place of physical beauty and interesting people, ideas and events. Students enjoy fine facilities and services in a stimulating environment. The college continually improves its library and museum holdings, which are already among the finest in the country, and upgrades its equipment to give students here every technological advantage. </P>

<P>Smith attracts faculty members and students who are intellectually energetic and highly motivated. Together, we form a community with a variety of talents and interests, skills and training, and from diverse religious, cultural, political, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Many groups, activities and events arise from our broad range of interests. Members of the Five College community are welcome in classes and at most campus events. Their participation expands even further the perspectives and experiences represented. </P>

<P>All undergraduate students at Smith are part of the Student Government Association, which supports approximately 130 student organizations and their projects and programs. These organizations enrich the lives of their participants and of the general community through a wealth of concerts, presentations, lectures, readings, movies, workshops, symposia, exhibits and plays that enhance the rhythm of campus life. Academic and administrative departments and committees, resource centers, individual faculty members and alumnae also contribute to the already full schedule. </P>

<P>The pace and style of campus life vary greatly, as each woman creates the academic and social lifestyle best suited to her taste. Daily campus life includes periods both of great activity and movement and of quiet and intense concentration. There is time for hard work, for listening and speaking, for learning and teaching and for friends, fun and relaxation. The extracurricular social, athletic and cultural events on campus, in Northampton, and in the Five College area keep this an exciting center of activity. Each student learns through the overwhelming choices open to her how to develop and sustain a pace of life that is balanced and fulfilling. </P>

<P>Smith College Libraries </P>

<P>The Smith College libraries are committed to providing students with firsthand research opportunities through our extensive general and special collections, exceptional services, and digital experiences. The collections comprise more than 1.7 million books, journals, maps, scores, recordings, rare books, archives, manuscripts, and online databases. The libraries maintain open stacks and can obtain materials from other libraries worldwide through our interlibrary loan service. Students can use our Discover tool to access materials from the Five College libraries—Amherst, Mount Holyoke and Hampshire colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Librarians, archivists and curators provide one-on-one research consultations and collaborate with faculty in teaching classes on research tools and techniques. The libraries’ website www.smith. edu/libraries is the digital gateway to subject databases, eBooks and eJournals, research tools, and digital scholarship. For assistance, use the Ask a Librarian service: http://smith.libanswers.com/ask. </P>

<P>The William Allan Neilson Library, the main library, is temporarily closed while undergoing a major renovation and will reopen in the fall of 2020. During the renovation, the main campus library is Young Library in Bass Hall. </P>

<P>The focus of the recreation program is on regular, noncredit fitness activities (Get Fit Smith program) as well as one-day special event competitions and house intramural competition. The fitness activities may include Zumba, P90x, Insanity, pilates, awesome abs, spinning and many different yoga classes. GFS offers about 26 classes weekly and many are taught by students. The 37 houses vie with friendly rivalry in special events such as soccer and basketball. The club sports are a group of independent clubs under the guidance of the associate athletic director, Bonnie May. Dues, fundraiser, SGA activities, and fee allocations support them. Open to Smith students of any ability level, club sports provide a resource to learn a new sport or practice a familiar one. Presently, there are 13 clubs: Equestrian, Archery, Badminton, Cycling, Fencing, Futsal, Ice Hockey, Quidditch, Rugby, Spirit Squad, Squash, Synchronized Swimming and Ultimate Frisbee. </P>

<P>Smith Outdoors </P>

<P>Smith Outdoors is the outdoor adventure program offered through Smith’s athletics department. Based out of the Paradise Pond boathouse, Smith Outdoors offers a variety of clinics, presentations and off-campus trips throughout the year. The focus is on providing an outdoor setting for recreation, socialization, self-empowerment and education. Activities vary from foliage hikes and ice-skating to more adventurous trips like rock climbing, backpacking and whitewater rafting. Also included are open hours for recreational paddling on Paradise Pond and rock climbing at the indoor climbing wall located in Ainsworth Gym. For more information, send email to smithoutdoors@smith.edu or visit www. smith.edu/athletics/clubsports/smithoutdoors.html. </P>

<H1>Career Development </H1>

<P>The Lazarus Center for Career Development provides and prepares students for careers in a changing economic and technical climate. Staff work with Smith women to help them develop the skills, knowledge, and global and personal foresights needed to navigate their professional careers, even when economic and personal circumstances change. </P>

<P>The professional staff offers advising, both individually and in groups; and services are available throughout the academic year and summer months. The center sponsors seminars, workshops and industry discussions that cover internships; non-Fulbright fellowships; career field exploration; résumé writing; effective interviewing and job search strategies; networking; and applying to graduate, medical, dental, and professional schools. They help students assess their individual interests, strengths and weaknesses; establish priorities and make decisions; and present themselves and their backgrounds effectively. The extensive career resource library and website support students in their research and exploration. </P>

<P>Praxis Summer Internship Funding Program </P>

<P>“Praxis: The Liberal Arts at Work,” administered through the Lazarus Center for Career Development, funds students to work at substantive, unpaid summer internships related to their academic and/or career interests. By offering financial support, the college acknowledges the importance of internships in helping students explore careers, observe the practical applications of their academic studies and gain work experience that enhances their marketability to employers and graduate schools. Since the majority of internships are unpaid, Praxis stipends are intended to make it financially possible for students to work at substantive summer internships. Praxis funding is a one-time opportunity of up to $4,000. A student may use a Praxis stipend for an approved internship in the summer following her sophomore or junior year. Lazarus Center staff and resources offer guidance and assistance to students in locating opportunities that meet their individual interests. Each year approximately 400 students work at summer internships funded through Praxis. </P>

<H1>Health Services </H1>

<P>www.smith.edu/health </P>

<P>Health Services provides medical and psychological services for all Smith students. Through outpatient services located in the Nancy and Henry Schacht Center for Health and Wellness, students see physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses for medical problems and questions, just as they would see their own providers at home. For psychological issues, students see social workers  and graduate social work interns. A psychiatrist is also available. Health education is provided on topics relevant to students’ emotional and physical health and safety. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Medical Services </P>

<P>The same standards of confidentiality apply to the doctor-patient relationship at Smith as to all other medical practitioners. Medical Services offers a full array of exams and testing; nutrition counseling; routine physicals for summer employment and graduate school; immunizations for travel, flu and allergies; and on-site laboratory services. </P>

<P>In case of unusual or serious illness, specialists in the Northampton and Springfield areas are available for consultation in addition to service provided at a nearby hospital. </P>

<P>Counseling Service </P>

<P>The Counseling Service provides consultation, individual and group psychotherapy and psychiatric evaluation and medication. These services are strictly confidential. The Counseling Service is available to all students, free of charge. It is staffed by licensed mental health professionals and supervised graduate interns. </P>

<P>Health Education </P>

<P>The wellness education program integrates innovative wellness initiatives into students’ academic, residential and extracurricular activities. The program provides opportunities for students to take leadership roles in health education on campus. </P>

<P>College Health Insurance </P>

<P>The college offers its own insurance policy, underwritten by an insurance company, that covers a student in the special circumstances of a residential college. It extends coverage for in- and outpatient services not covered by many other insurance plans. However, this policy does have some distinct limitations. Therefore, we strongly urge that students consider continuing their precollege health insurance. Failure to waive the college health plan will result in automatic enrollment in it. </P>

<P>The college maintains certain regulations in the interest of community health as outlined in the college handbook and expects all students to comply. Before arriving at the college, each student must complete her Health Pre-Admission Information Form and send it to the Health Services. It is important to note that Massachusetts law now mandates that students must get the required immunizations before registration. Students accepted for a Study Abroad Program or who plan to participate in intercollegiate sports or certain exercise and sport programs may be required to have a physical exam by a college practitioner first. </P>

<Sect>
<H1>Religious Expression </H1>

<P>The college encourages student spiritual development and many expressions of religious faith on campus. The Center of Religious and Spiritual Life (CRSL) is housed in the Helen Hills Hills Chapel. The director of the center is responsible for overseeing the program, advising student religious organizations and promoting a spirit of mutual understanding, respect, and interfaith collaboration. </P>

<P>The college has relationships with local religious liaisons who serve as advisers to student religious organizations and provide opportunities for students to engage with the larger Northampton community. An interfaith advisory group of students meet weekly to discuss the spiritual needs of students, plan joint activities and foster dialogue. The center prioritizes contemplative practice, religious literacy, social justice and spiritual care, and also provides regular hospitality programming through its kitchen and lounge, offering meals and spaces for gathering in times of stress or need. The CSRL strives to meet the special needs of all students not just those who affiliate with an organized religious path. Center staff work with local clergy and faith leaders who help nurture the spiritual lives of students and provide opportunities to worship and observe. All students are welcome regardless of belief system or religious affiliation. Information about events can be found at www.smith.edu/religiouslife. </P>

<Sect>
<P>The Helen Hills Hills Chapel is home to a robust arts program as well. The Center for Religious and Spiritual Life sponsors concerts, lectures, films and exhibits by student and faculty musicians, and visiting artists. The college organist directs Handbell Choir rehearsals in the chapel and uses the Aolian-Skinner organ for teaching and performances. </P>

<P>The CRSL collaborates with dining to respect dietary needs relating to religious observance. Kosher and halal meals are available to students in the Cutter-Ziskind dining room during the week. In addition, students prepare and host a kosher Shabbat meal and community gathering each Friday evening. A Jummah lunch is offered at noon every Friday for the Muslim community with the location rotating between the Helen Hills Hills Chapel and the prayer area in the basement of Wright Hall. Religious holidays such as Christmas, Ramadan, Passover, and Diwali are observed in collaboration with student and community groups. </P>

<P>College policy states that any student who is unable because of religious observance to attend classes, participate in an examination, study, or work on a particular day will be excused from such activities without prejudice and will be given an opportunity to make them up, provided such make-up work does not create an unreasonable burden on the college. No fees will be charged for rescheduling an examination. It is each student’s responsibility to request an excused absence from a faculty member well in advance of a religious holiday. In certain instances the CRSL will consult with students, faculty and staff when a religious consideration is in question. Students can also speak with the director of religious life/college chaplain when a religious consideration is raised with respect to housing needs. </P>

<H1>Recognition for Academic Achievement </H1>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H1>Academic Achievements </H1>

<P>Smith College encourages students to strive for excellence in their chosen fields of academic endeavor and honors those who achieve distinction in their academic performance. Each year approximately 25 percent of the graduating class is awarded the bachelor of arts degree with Latin Honors and/or departmental honors. </P>

<P>Latin Honors </P>

<P>Latin Honors are awarded to eligible graduating seniors on the basis of the cumulative grade point average for a minimum of 48 graded credits earned during the sophomore, junior and senior years. Only grades from Smith College courses and courses taken on the Five College Interchange are counted; Smith Study Abroad grades are considered Smith grades. No grades from exchange programs in this country or abroad are counted. Pluses and minuses are taken into account; grades of P/F (Pass or Fail) or S/U (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory) do not enter into the calculations. </P>

<P>If a student spends one of her sophomore through senior years away from Smith (with the exception of the Smith Programs Abroad), the grades from the remaining two years will be used. Grades from the first year are never counted. The minimum grade point average for Latin Honors varies each year depending on the overall grade distribution in the senior class and is not published. The degree may be awarded cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude on the basis of meeting eligibility requirements and of a very high level of academic achievement.</P>

<P>    Students who wish to become eligible for Latin Honors at graduation must elect at least one course (normally four credits) in each of the seven major fields of knowledge (literature, historical studies, social science, natural science, mathematics and analytical philosophy, the arts, and foreign language). Course listings in this catalog indicate in curly brackets which area(s) of knowledge a given course covers. </P>

<P>Please note that one year of an introductory language course or one course at a higher level satisfies the foreign language Latin Honors requirement. Students who are non-native speakers of English may, with the permission of a class dean, offer any two courses in the English department at the 100 level (or one course at a higher level in the English department, the comparative literature program or in classics in translation) to satisfy the “foreign language” part of the Latin Honors requirement. The class dean will notify the registrar that such an arrangement has been approved. Any appeals should be sent to the dean of the faculty. Nonnative speakers of English are considered to be those who indicated on their advising form that English was not their first language, have had several years of education in a school where the language of instruction was other than English, and can read, write and speak this language. Eligibility for Latin Honors may be affected by the decisions of the Honor Board. </P>

<P>Departmental Honors </P>

<P>A departmental honors program allows a student with a strong academic background to do independent and original work in her major. The program provides recognition for students who do work of high quality in the preparation of a thesis and in courses and seminars. Departmental honors students must also fulfill all college and departmental requirements. </P>

<P>Successful completion of work in the honors program (an honors thesis and at least one honors examination) leads to the awarding of the bachelor of arts degree with the added notation “Honors,” “High Honors” or “Highest Honors” in the student’s major subject. </P>

<P>The Dean’s List </P>

<P>The Dean’s List is made up of students who represent the top 25 percent of the student body based on the total records for the previous academic year. Students must be enrolled full-time at Smith for the full year to be named to the Dean’s List. </P>

<P>Phi Beta Kappa </P>

<P>Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely recognized undergraduate honor society in the United States. The Greek initials stand for the society’s motto “Love of learning is the guide of life.” Since 1776, the mission of the society has been to foster and recognize excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The Zeta of Massachusetts Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society was established at Smith College in 1905. The rules of eligibility are set by the chapter in accordance with the national society; election is made on the breadth and excellence of overall academic achievement. </P>

<P>To be eligible for election, a student must have satisfied the Latin Honors distribution requirements and completed 58 graded credits of Smith course work, not counting the first year. Study abroad programs count for Smith credit only if they are Smith programs. Courses taken in the Five College consortium count as Smith credits. All other courses including those taken S/U may count for distribution requirements, but not as credits in the calculation of the GPA nor as part of the total credit requirement. </P>

<P>Elections are held twice a year. In late fall of their senior year, “junior” Phi Beta Kappa members are elected on the basis of their academic records through the junior year. At the end of the spring semester, more seniors are elected based on their complete academic record. For questions about election criteria, students and faculty are urged to consult with the president or secretary of the chapter. More information about the Phi Beta Kappa Society, its history, publications and activities can be found at www.pbk.org. </P>

<P>Society of the Sigma Xi </P>

<P>In 1935 Smith College became the first women’s college to be granted a charter for the establishment of a chapter of the Society of the Sigma Xi. Each year the Smith College Chapter elects to membership promising graduate students and seniors who excel in science. </P>

<H1>Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid </H1>

<Sect>
<P>A Smith College education is a lifetime investment. It is also a financial challenge for many families. At Smith, we encourage all qualified students to apply for admission, regardless of family financial resources. Our students come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. The Office of Student Financial Services has an experienced staff to assist students and parents in both the individual financial aid application process and the educational financing process in general. We work with families to help them manage the financial challenge in a variety of ways, through financial aid, loans and payment plan options. </P>

<P>Many Smith students receive financial assistance to pay for college expenses. Smith College participates in all the major federal and state student aid programs while funding a substantial institutional grant and scholarship program from its endowment. </P>

<P>We realize that financing a college education is a complex process, and we encourage applicants and their families to communicate directly with us. Our experienced educational financing staff in the Office of Student Financial Services is available to work with you. Inquiries may be made by calling 413-5852530 between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Wednesdays (Eastern time).

<H1>Your Student Account </H1>

<P>Smith College considers the student to be responsible for ensuring that pay-ments—whether from loans, grants, parents, or other third parties—are received in a timely manner. All student accounts are managed by the Office of Student Financial Services. Initial statements detailing semester fees are available online on or about July 15 and December 15. Email notifications will be sent to all students on or about the 15th of each month in which there is activity on the account. Students who wish to designate a parent or other third party to be notified of bills and to have the ability to make payments on their student account must set the designee up as an “authorized user” through their online account. Important: no paper bills are mailed. </P>

<P>The college’s comprehensive fees associated with the beginning of the semester are due and payable in full by specific deadline dates, well in advance of the beginning of classes. The payment deadline for fall is August 10. For spring, the payment deadline is January 10. Payment must be received by these dates to avoid late payment fees being assessed. Checks should be made payable to Smith College and include the student’s name and ID number on the front. </P>

<P>After any payment is due, monthly late payment fees, which are based on the outstanding balance remaining after any payment due date, will be assessed at the rate of $1.25 on every $100 (1.25 percent) that remains unpaid until the payment is received in full, on or before the next billing month in which the student is invoiced. If you have questions regarding any charges or credits on your bill, contact the Office of Student Financial Services. </P>

<P>In cases where students default on financial obligations, the student is responsible for paying the outstanding balance including all late payment fees, collection costs and any legal fees incurred by the college during the collection process. Transcripts and other academic records will not be released until all financial obligations to the college have been met. </P>

<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Payments for each month’s bill must be received by the Office of Student Financial Services by the payment due date. If paying by mail, please allow at least five to seven business days for mail and processing time. If paying in person, payment should be made before 4 p.m. on the payment due date. Electronic ACH payments made through our online billing service are credited immediately. </P>
</Sect>

<P>The college expects the student to fulfill her financial responsibility and reserves the right to place limitations on the student for failure to do so. The consequences of nonpayment include possible loss of housing assignment, and prevention of: a) registration for future semester courses, b) receipt of academic transcripts, c) receipt of diploma at commencement, d) approval for a leave of absence or study-abroad program, and e) participation in leadership training opportunities. The college also reserves the right to have the student administratively withdrawn and may refer such account for collection in her name. Students and parents are welcome to contact the Office of Student Financial Services for assistance in meeting payment responsibilities. </P>

<P>Most credit balance refunds are issued on request, by direct deposit into the account the student has on file with the payroll office. Credit balances that result from a PLUS loan are generally issued to the parent borrower, unless that parent has authorized that refunds go to the student. With the student’s written release, credit balance refunds may be issued to the parent or the designee of the student. </P>

<H1>2018–19 Optional Fees </H1>

<P>Student Medical Insurance–$2,368 The $2,368 Student Medical Insurance fee is split between the two semesters and covers the student from August 15 through the following August 14. January graduates are covered only through January 14 in their senior year. Massachusetts law requires that each student have comprehensive health insurance; Smith College offers a medical insurance plan through Gallagher Koster Insurance (www.gallagherstudent.com) for those students not otherwise insured. Details about the insurance are mailed during the summer. Students are automatically billed for this insurance unless they follow the waiver process outlined in the insurance mailing. Students must waive the insurance coverage by August 10 in order to avoid purchasing the annual Smith Plan. If a student is on leave on a Smith-approved program that is billed at home-school fees, a reduced charge may apply. For students who are admitted for spring semester, the charge will be $1,375  for 2018–19. </P>

<H1>Institutional Refund Policy </H1>

<P>A refund will be calculated if a student withdraws on or after the first day of classes but before the point when the college is considered to have earned all the tuition, room, board and mandatory fees (hereinafter called institutional charges) for which the student was charged. Credit balances remaining on any account will be refunded to the appropriate person or agency. </P>

<P>Adjustment of Institutional Charges and Institutional Aid </P>

<P>Any student who withdraws prior to the first day of classes will receive a 100 percent adjustment of institutional charges and insurance. All disbursed Title IV aid, institutional aid, state and other aid will be returned to the appropriate account by the college. </P>

<P>A student who withdraws after the first day of classes, but before the time when she will have completed 60 percent of the period of enrollment, will have her institutional charges and institutional aid adjusted based on the percentage of class attendance. </P>

<P>If a student should withdraw from an off-campus program, which is billed by Smith (for example: Study Abroad, Picker and Smithsonian Programs), the normal college refund policies apply as long as all payments can be recovered by the college. If payments made on behalf of the student to other entities cannot be recovered by the college, the student is responsible for unrecoverable costs. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Students who withdraw from study-abroad programs that are approved, but not administered by Smith College will have a proration of charges and aid based on the enrollment dates of the program, rather than those of Smith College. After the 60 percent point of the program term, the student is not entitled to a refund of charges and is also responsible for unrecoverable costs. </P>

<P>Students Receiving Title IV Federal Aid </P>

<P>Per federal regulations, a student earns her aid based on the period of time she remains enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than Federal Work Study, must be returned to the appropriate federal agency. During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time she remains enrolled. A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60 percent point earns all the aid for the payment period. For example, if the period of enrollment is 100 days and the student completes 25 days, then she has earned 25 percent of her aid. The remainder of the aid must be returned to the appropriate federal agency. </P>

<P>Other Charges </P>

<P>If a student has not waived, or has accepted the medical insurance and withdraws from the college during the first 31 days of the period for which coverage is purchased, and she has not used the insurance, she will not be covered under the plan and a full credit of the premium will be made. Insured students withdrawing at or after 31 days will remain covered under the plan for the full period for which the premium has been paid and no refund will be made available. </P>

<P>Other charges, such as library fines, parking fines and infirmary charges are not adjusted upon the student’s withdrawal. </P>

<H1>Financial Aid </H1>

<P>We welcome women from all economic backgrounds. No woman should hesitate to apply to Smith because of an inability to pay the entire cost of her education. We meet the full documented financial need of all admitted undergraduates who have met the published admission and financial aid deadlines. Awards are offered to applicants on the basis of need, and calculated according to established college and federal policies. An award is usually a combination of a grant, a loan and a campus job. </P>

<P>Smith College is committed to a financial aid policy that guarantees to meet the full financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students who meet published deadlines. The college does operate under a need-sensitive admission policy that typically affects less than 6 percent of our applicant pool. Each applicant for admission is evaluated on the basis of her academic and personal qualities. However, the college may choose to consider a student’s level of financial need when making the final admission decision. Applicants are advised to complete the financial aid process if they will need financial help to attend Smith. Entering first-year students who fail to apply for financial aid by the published deadlines will be ineligible to receive college-funded assistance until they have completed 64 credits earned at Smith. Transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars who do not apply for financial aid by the published deadlines are eligible to apply after completing 32 credits earned at Smith. Students may apply for federal aid at any point during the academic year. International students (not U.S. citizens or permanent residents) who do not apply for aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid at any time during their tenure at Smith. </P>
</Sect>

<P>To enable the college to determine a student’s need, a family completes both the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service PROFILE form, requesting that data be sent to Smith. Both forms are completed on-line. The FAFSA can be accessed at www.fafsa.ed.gov (Smith College code is 002209) and the PROFILE can be accessed at www.collegeboard. com (Smith College code is 3762). </P>

<P>Students must also complete the Smith Aid Application, available at www. smith.edu/sfs/portal. </P>

<P>We also require a signed copy of the family’s most recent federal tax returns, including all schedules and W-2’s. Other forms and documents may be required, based on each family’s circumstances. Once we receive a completed application, we review each student’s file individually. We take into consideration the number of dependents, the number of family members in college, divorced parents and other special circumstances. For international applicants, the CSS Profile and an official income statement or income tax return are required to determine financial and eligibility. </P>

<P>Smith College recognizes the diversity of the modern family, and requires the submission of information regarding both legal or biological or adoptive parents, as well as spouses and domestic partners of each parent. Exceptions to this policy are made on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the Office of Student Financial Services for more information. </P>

<P>The college makes the final decision on the level of need and awards. Financial aid decisions to entering students are announced simultaneously with admission notifications. College policy limits the awards of Smith funds to the level of billed fees. </P>

<P>A student who is awarded aid at admission will have it renewed each year she attends according to her need, as calculated by the college, if she is in good academic standing. She and her family apply for aid annually with Smith College forms, FAFSA and PROFILE forms, and tax returns. The amount of aid may vary from year to year depending on changes in college fees and in the family’s financial circumstances. The balance of loan, work and grant also changes, based on federal loan limits and college policy. Instructions for renewing aid are made available to all students in December. Traditional students (not Ada Com-stock Scholars) are expected to complete their undergraduate studies in eight semesters, and grant aid is limited to that period, except for special programs or in circumstances involving medical withdrawal. </P>

<P>Ada Comstock Scholars receiving financial aid are required to make satisfactory progress toward the degree in order to continue receiving aid—that is, completion of at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic year. Progress is evaluated on a semester basis. Students not meeting this criterion are put on financial aid warning. Students may be required to appeal in writing to continue to receive federal financial aid and may become ineligible for aid if the probationary period exceeds one year. </P>

<P>Unless the administrative board decides that mitigating circumstances warrant an exception, no financial aid will be available to a student who is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree. </P>

<Sect>
<P>First-Year Applicants (U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents,and Undocumented U.S. Residents) </P>

<P>Any student who needs or may need help in financing her education should apply for financial aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission. Students must not wait until they have been accepted for admission to apply for aid. Each student’s file is carefully reviewed to determine eligibility for need-based aid. Since this is a detailed process, the college expects students to follow published application guidelines and to meet the appropriate application deadlines. Students and parents are encouraged to contact Student Financial Services via email at sfs@smith.edu or by phone (413-585-2530) with questions. Detailed information on the application process and deadlines is available on our website at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal. </P>

<P>The consequences of not applying for aid prior to being accepted for admission include a 64-credit waiting period before becoming eligible to receive college grant aid. This means that only federal, state and private assistance would be available for the first two years of undergraduate enrollment at Smith. The college will consider exceptions to this policy only if you experience and can document an unexpected family emergency. Please note that this policy does not pertain to students who, prior to admission to Smith, applied for but were not granted need-based financial aid. </P>

<P>If an entering student applied for but did not qualify for need-based aid in her first year, that student may reapply for aid in subsequent years. This is particularly important for families that experience changes in family circumstances such as a sibling entering college, reductions in parent income, divorce or separation, or unanticipated medical expenses. Students who want to apply for federal aid only have a modified application process. If there are major changes to the financial resources of the family, Student Financial Services will consider a new request for aid or a review of a previous denial at any time. </P>

<P>The college cannot assume responsibility for family unwillingness to contribute to college expenses. There are limited circumstances that qualify a student for consideration as an independent aid applicant. Women over the age of 24, orphans and wards of the court are always considered self-supporting for federal financial aid purposes. Students who meet the federal definition of independent status are not automatically considered independent by the college. Please contact SFS to discuss questions regarding this situation. </P>

<P>Transfer Students </P>

<P>Transfer students should follow the application procedures detailed on their specific financial aid applications. Transfer students who do not apply for aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission, cannot apply for college aid until they reach junior standing and complete at least 32 credits at Smith. </P>

<P>Ada Comstock Scholars </P>

<P>Women of nontraditional college age can apply to the Ada Comstock Scholars Program. Applicants for aid should complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the Ada Comstock Scholars program Application for Financial Aid and send us a signed copy of their most recent federal tax return, complete with all schedules and W-2’s as well as their spouse or partner’s complete tax return and W-2’s. </P>

<P>An Ada Comstock Scholar who does not apply for aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission, cannot apply for institutional grant aid until she has completed 32 credits at Smith, although she may qualify for federal and state grants and loans before she has completed 32 credits. This policy does not apply to women who applied for, but were not granted, aid at the time of admission. </P>

<P>International Applicants </P>

<P>Smith College awards need-based aid to international non-U.S. citizens, both first-year and transfer applicants. There is a great deal of competition for these funds, and the level of support provided from the college ranges widely, depending on particular family circumstances. Aid is determined based on the information provided by the family on the CSS Profile, along with translated tax or income statements. International students not awarded financial aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid from the college at any time. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>The application deadline is January 25. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Non-U.S. citizens eligible for aid have a family contribution calculated prior to admission. This family contribution will remain the same throughout the student’s tenure at Smith. Any increases in tuition and fees not covered by the annual increased loan or work will be covered by an increase in the grant so that the calculated family contribution will remain the same each year. (Loan and campus job amounts, which are part of the total aid package, increase each year as part of standard college policy. For application deadlines and details, please check www.smith.edu/sfs.) </P>

<P>U.S. Citizens Living Outside the U.S. </P>

<P>Follow procedures for applicants residing in the United States. If your parents are living and earning income outside the United States and do not file U.S. tax returns, you should submit translated tax or income statements. </P>

<Sect>
<P>U.S. citizens and permanent residents must reapply for aid each year. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Policy for Review and Appeal of Need-Based Financial AidAwards </P>

<P>A student has the right to request a review of her financial aid award. Domestic students must reapply for financial aid each year, and thus are automatically reviewed on an annual basis. International students are given a family contribution determination at the time of admission for their entire Smith career and thus are only eligible for a review at the time of admission. </P>

<P>Domestic Students </P>

<P>Domestic students may request a review of their financial aid awards at any time during their Smith careers if there has been a significant change in family circumstances since filing the application for financial aid or if the information on the original application was inaccurate. </P>

<P>International Students </P>

<P>International students seeking a financial aid adjustment after they have accepted an offer of admission must consult with Student Financial Services (SFS) to review the situation and discuss available options. The financial aid budget for international students is fully allocated each year as of the time of admission, therefore only very limited additional resources are made available to meet extraordinary circumstances. Serious consideration is only given when there has been a significant life-changing event. A life-changing event would include, but is not limited to, the death of a parent or enrollment of a sibling in a U.S. college or university. If you wish to appeal your financial aid award, please begin by contacting Student Financial Services. </P>

<P>Process </P>

<P>When a review is requested it is conducted by the SFS Review Committee. In most cases, their decision is final. When the issue under review would require an exception to policy, a student may request it be reviewed by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. Instructions for submitting an appeal will be provided by the SFS staff to the student if a policy is at issue. All reviews from international students for increased grant or loan assistance are considered exceptions to policy and will be brought to the attention of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. </P>

<P>The Financial Aid Appeals Committee is chaired by the dean of enrollment and includes one member of the faculty, the dean of students and a member of the finance office. The director of SFS is a nonvoting member of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. The student must present her appeal in writing. The committee will consider the appeal as soon as possible. It normally takes one to two weeks for this committee to convene and review the appeal(s) in question. A decision will be given in writing to the student within 48 hours after the appeal is heard. The decision of the Appeals Committee is final in all cases. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Need-Based Financial Aid Awards </P>

<P>Financial aid awards are made up of loans, campus jobs and grants. A loan and job, both considered self-help, are usually the first components of an aid package, with any remaining need being met with grant aid. </P>

<P>Loans </P>

<P>Most students borrow through the Federal Direct Ford Loan Program. Some awards may also include a Smith College loan. Most parents are eligible to borrow under the Federal Parent Loan Program. Students who receive aid of any sort from federal funds are subject to the statutes governing such aid. </P>

<P>Campus Jobs </P>

<P>Student Financial Services administers campus jobs. All students may apply, but priority is given to those students (about one-half of our student body) who received campus job offers as part of their aid packages. First-year students may work an average of eight hours a week for 32 weeks. Students in other classes may hold regular jobs averaging ten hours a week for 32 weeks. These monies are paid directly to each student as she earns them. They are intended primarily to cover personal expenses, but some students use part or all of their earnings toward required fees. Short-term jobs are open to all students. Additionally, a term-time internship program is administered by the Career Development Office. The college participates in the federally funded Work-Study Program, which funds a portion of the earnings of eligible students, some of them in nonprofit, community service positions and in the America Reads tutorial program. Smith College also provides a need-based employment program for those students eligible for need-based work, but not eligible for the federally subsidized Federal Work-Study Program. </P>

<P>No student, whether on federal work-study or not, is permitted to work more than the maximum 10-hours a week or one “full-time” position. First-year students may work a maximum of eight hours per week. Students receiving a stipend for such positions as STRIDE or HCA  are not eligible for a second job. This policy attempts to offer all students an equal opportunity to work. </P>

<P>Grants </P>

<P>Grants are funds given to students with no requirement of repayment or work time in exchange. Most Smith College grants come from funds given for this purpose by alumnae and friends of the college and by foundations and corporations. Federal and state governments also provide assistance through need-based grants such as the Federal Pell Grant and state scholarships. Smith receives an allocation each year for Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and for state-funded Gilbert Grants for Massachusetts residents. </P>

<P>Outside Aid </P>

<P>Outside Aid Awarded on the Basis of Student Merit or Parent Employment </P>

<P>Smith College recognizes your achievement in being awarded merit-based aid. Outside aid based on student merit or parent employment will first reduce or replace the self-help portion of your award (work-study and federal subsidized loan). If the outside aid exceeds the total self-help portion of your award, the aid can go toward a one-time computer purchase or toward the cost of the on-campus health insurance plan. If you do not purchase or have already purchased a computer, and if you do not accept the on-campus health insurance plan, or if your merit aid exceeds these costs, outside aid will replace Smith Grant on a dollar-for-dollar basis. </P>

<P>Note: GEARUP scholarships are considered within this category as outside scholarships. </P>

<P>Student Financial Services must be notified of all outside awards. If you notify SFS by June 1, the aid will be reflected in your official award and on your first bill. If you notify SFS after September 1, the outside aid may be used to reduce Smith Grant dollar for dollar. </P>
</Sect>

<P>State and Federal Grant Assistance </P>

<P>These awards reduce Smith Grant eligibility dollar for dollar. Educational benefits from state and federal agencies will reduce the self-help components of the award (loan and work). Need-based loans from state or outside agencies can be used to replace dollar for dollar either the suggested federal loan or the work study award. Amounts in excess of the self-help award will replace Smith Grant dollar for dollar. </P>

<P>Music Grants </P>

<P>Students who receive need-based aid will receive a $200 grant per semester toward the cost of performance lessons. In addition, all students registered for performance lessons can submit an application to the music department for scholarship aid (for those receiving need-based aid, these funds are in addition to the aforementioned $200 grant). </P>

<P>ROTC </P>

<P>Air Force ROTC is available at most colleges and universities in western Massachusetts, including Smith College. Air Force ROTC offers two-, three- and four-year enlistment scholarships to qualified new and continuing college students.

<H1>Admission </H1>

<Sect>
<P>From the college’s beginning, students at Smith have been challenged by rigorous academic standards and supported by rich resources and facilities to develop to their fullest potential and define their own terms of success. Admitting students who will thrive in the Smith environment remains the goal of our admission efforts. We seek students who will be productive members of the Smith community, who will be challenged by all that is offered here and who will challenge their faculty members and peers to sharpen their ideas and perspectives of the world. </P>

<P>Each year we enroll a first-year class of approximately 600 able, motivated, diverse students whose records show academic achievement, intellectual curiosity and potential for growth. Because our students come from 48 states and 73 countries, their educational and personal experiences and opportunities vary tremendously. In selecting a class, the Board of Admission, which is made up of faculty members as well as members of the admission staff, considers each student in the light of the opportunities available to her. Included in the board’s review are her secondary school record, the recommendations from her school, her essay and any other available information. </P>

<P>Smith College meets fully the documented financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students. About 60 percent of our students receive some form of financial assistance through grants, loans and/or campus jobs. Further information about financial planning for a Smith education and about financial aid is available in the section on Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid. </P>

<Sect>
<H1>Secondary School Preparation </H1>

<P>There is no typical applicant to Smith and no typical academic program, but we strongly recommend that a student prepare for Smith by taking the strongest courses offered by her high school. Specifically this should include the following, at a minimum where possible: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>four years of English </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>three years of a foreign language (or two years in each of two languages) </LBody>
</LI>

<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>three years of mathematics </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>three years of lab science </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>two years of history Beyond meeting the normal minimum requirements, we expect each candidate to pursue in greater depth academic interests of special importance to her. Candidates who are interested in our engineering major should pursue coursework in calculus, biology, chemistry and physics. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Smith College will accept college-level work completed prior to matriculation as a degree student, provided that the relevant courses were completed at an accredited college or university and were not applied to the requirements for high school graduation. We also give credit for excellent performance in Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and equivalent foreign examinations. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for further information regarding eligibility for and use of such credit. </P>

<H1>Entrance Tests </H1>

<P>SAT I or ACT scores are optional for U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. Standardized tests (SAT I, ACT, TOEFL, IELTS or PTE as appropriate) are required for international citizens. SAT II subject tests are not required for any applicant. If a student wishes to submit a score or is required to do so, she should take the exams in her junior year to keep open the possibility of Early Decision. All examinations taken through December of the senior year are acceptable. The results of examinations taken after December arrive too late for us to include them in the decision-making process. </P>

<H1>Applying for Admission </H1>

<P>A student interested in Smith has three options for applying—Early Decision I, Early Decision II and Regular Decision. Visit www.smith.edu/admission for information about requirements and deadlines. </P>

<P>Early Decision </P>

<P>Early Decision I and II Plans are designed for students with strong qualifications who have selected Smith as their first choice. The plans differ from each other only in application deadline, recognizing that students may decide on their college preference at different times. In making an application to her first choice college, a candidate eliminates much of the anxiety, effort and cost of preparing several college applications. Candidates under this plan may initiate applications to other colleges, but may make an Early Decision application to one college only. It is important to note that if accepted under Early Decision, a candidate must withdraw all other college applications and may not make any further applications. </P>

<P>Applicants deferred in either Early Decision plan will be reconsidered in the spring, together with applicants in the Regular Decision Plan. Offers of admission are made with the understanding that the high school record continues to be of high quality through the senior year. If they have applied for financial aid by the published deadlines, candidates will be notified of financial aid decisions at the same time as the admission decision. </P>

<P>Regular Decision </P>

<P>The Regular Decision Plan is designed for students who wish to keep open several college options during the application process. Candidates may submit applications anytime before the January 15 deadline. </P>

<P>A student interested in Smith should apply using either the Common Application or the Coalition Application. Smith does not have a preference for one application over the other; both of these application types will receive equal consideration in our admission process. Please visit www.commonapp.org or www. coalitionforcollegeaccess.org for all required forms and instructions. </P>

<P>We realize that applying to college involves a lot of time-consuming paperwork for the applicant. It is work that we review carefully and thoroughly, and we suggest that applicants do not leave it to the last moment. </P>

<Sect>
<H1>Advanced Placement </H1>

<P>Smith College participates in the Advanced Placement Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for information governing eligibility for and use of Advanced Placement credit. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>International Baccalaureate </H1>

<P>The amount of credit will be determined as soon as an official copy of results has been sent to the registrar’s office. Guidelines for use are comparable to those for Advanced Placement. </P>

<H1>Interview </H1>

<P>We recommend an interview for all candidates. For those who live or attend school within 200 miles of the college an on-campus interview is encouraged. Others should visit our website to obtain the name of an alumna interviewer in their area. The interview allows each candidate to become better acquainted with Smith and to exchange information with a member of the staff of the Office of Admission or a trained alumna volunteer. </P>

<H1>Deferred Entrance </H1>

<P>An admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith’s offer and paid the required deposit may defer her entrance to work, travel or pursue a special interest if she makes this request in writing by June 1 to the dean of admission, who will review the request and notify the student within two weeks. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Deferred Entrance for Medical Reasons </H1>

<P>An admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith’s offer and paid the required deposit may request to postpone her entrance due to medical reasons if she makes this request in writing, explaining the nature of the medical problem, to the dean of admission prior to the first day of classes. At that time, the college will outline expectations for progress over the course of the year. A Board of Admission subcommittee will meet the following March to review the student’s case. Readmission is not guaranteed. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Transfer Admission </H1>

<P>A student may apply for transfer to Smith College in January or September after the completion of one or more semesters at another institution. </P>

<P>For January entrance, she must submit her application and send all credentials by November 15. The suggested filing date for September entrance is February 1, especially for students applying for financial aid. The application deadline is May 15. Letters from the financial aid office are mailed at the same time as admission letters. </P>

<P>We expect a transfer student to have a strong academic record and to be in good standing at the institution she is attending. We look particularly for evidence of achievement in college, although we also consider her secondary school record. Her program should correlate with the general Smith College requirements. </P>

<P>We require a candidate for the degree of bachelor of arts to spend at least two years in residence at Smith College in Northampton, during which time she normally completes 64 credits. A student may not transfer to the junior class and spend any part of the junior or senior year studying in off-campus programs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>International Students </H1>

<P>We welcome applications from qualified international students and advise applicants to communicate with the Office of Admission at least one year in advance of their proposed entrance. The initial email or letter should include information about the student’s complete academic background. If financial aid is needed, this fact should be made clear in the initial correspondence. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Visiting Year Programs </H1>

<P>Smith College welcomes a number of guest students for a semester or a year of study. In the Visiting Student Program, students enrolled in accredited, four-year liberal arts colleges or universities in the United States may apply to spend all or part of their sophomore, junior or senior year at Smith. </P>

<P>International students may apply to spend one semester or a year at Smith under the International Visiting Program. Applicants must be in their final year of studies leading to university entrance in their own country or currently enrolled in a university program abroad. If accepted, candidates will be expected to present examination results—Baccalaureate, Abitur or GCSE, for example— before enrolling. Evidence of English fluency will be required of applicants whose first language is not English. </P>

<P>Applicants for visiting programs should complete the Common Application for Transfer students. All required forms and instructions for completing the application are available on the Common Application website. Applications must be completed by July 1 for September entrance and by November 15 for January entrance. Financial aid is not available for these programs. </P>

<P>Information and application material may be obtained by visiting www. smith.edu/admission-aid or sending email to admission@smith.edu. </P>

<H1>Ada Comstock Scholars Program </H1>

<P>The admission process for Ada Comstock Scholars is competitive. Particular emphasis is placed on academic achievement, an autobiographical essay and an exchange of information in the required interview. A candidate should schedule her interview appointment before submitting her application prior to the appropriate deadline, November 15 for January admission or February 1 for September admission. Interviews are usually conducted in person. Phone interviews can be arranged if distance is an issue. It is recommended that an applicant bring unofficial copies of her college transcripts to her interview appointment. </P>

<P>Ada Comstock Scholars are expected to have completed approximately 48 transferable liberal arts credits before matriculation at Smith. The average number of transfer credits for an admitted student is 52. Those students who offer little or no college-level work are advised to enroll elsewhere to fulfill this requirement before initiating the application process. </P>

<P>A candidate’s status as an Ada Comstock Scholar must be designated at the time of application. Normally, an applicant admitted as a student of traditional age will not be permitted to change her class status to Ada Comstock Scholar until five years after she withdraws as a student of traditional age. A woman who meets the transfer credit guideline must apply as an Ada Comstock Scholar if she also meets the federal government’s guidelines defining independent students: </P>

<H1>Academic Rules and Procedures </H1>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H1>Requirements for the Degree </H1>

<P>The requirements for the degree from Smith College are completion of 128 credits of academic work and satisfactory completion of a major. For graduation the minimum standard of performance is a cumulative average of 2.0 in all academic work and satisfactory completion (grade of C- or higher) of a writing intensive course in the first two semesters of enrollment. </P>

<P>Students earning a bachelor of arts degree must complete at least 64 credits outside the department or program of the major (56 credits for majors requiring the study of two foreign languages taught within a single department or program). Consult the “Academic Program” section for additional detail. The requirements for the bachelor of science degree in engineering are listed in the courses of study section under Engineering. </P>

<P>Candidates for the degree must complete at least four semesters of academic work, a minimum of 64 credits, in academic residence at Smith College in Northampton; two of these semesters must be completed during the junior or senior year. Courses taken through the Five College Interchange count toward the 64-credit academic residence requirement. A student on a Smith Study Abroad Program, the Jean Picker Semester-in-Washington Program or the Internship Program at the Smithsonian Institution is not in academic residence in Northampton. </P>

<P>Each student is responsible for knowing all regulations governing the curriculum and course registration and is responsible for planning a course of study in accordance with those regulations and the requirements for the degree. </P>

<P>Course Program </P>

<P>The normal course program for traditional-aged undergraduates consists of 16 credits taken in each of eight semesters at Smith. Only with the approval of the administrative board may a student complete her degree requirements in fewer or more than eight semesters. The minimum course program for a traditional-aged undergraduate in any semester is 12 credits. A traditional-aged student who is enrolled in fewer than 12 credits in any semester is required to withdraw at the end of that semester. The student must remain away from the college for at least one semester and then may request readmission for the following semester. </P>

<P>Approved summer session or interterm credit may be used to supplement a minimum 12-credit program or to make up a shortage of credits. Smith students may accrue a maximum of 12 summer session credits and 12 interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree. An overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits may be applied toward the degree. </P>

<P>A student enters her senior year after completing a maximum of six semesters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter the senior year with fewer than 96 credits: exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student’s return to campus for her final two semesters. A student in residence may carry no more than 24 credits per semester unless approved by the administrative board. </P>

<P>Admission to Courses </P>

<P>Instructors are not required to hold spaces for students who do not attend the first class meeting and may refuse admittance to students seeking to add courses who have not attended the first class meetings. </P>

<P>Permissions </P>

<P>Some courses require written permission of the instructor and/or chair of the department concerned before the course is elected. </P>
</Sect>

<P>A student who does not have the prerequisites for a course may elect it only with the permission of the instructor and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. </P>

<P>A student must petition the administrative board for permission to enter or drop a yearlong course with credit at midyear. The petition must be signed by the instructor of the course, the student’s adviser and the chair of the department concerned before it is submitted to the class dean. </P>

<P>Seminars </P>

<P>Seminars are limited to 12 students and are open, by permission of the instructor, to juniors, seniors and graduate students only. At the discretion of the instructor and with the approval of the department chair or the program director, 15 students may enroll. If enrollment exceeds this number, the instructor will select the best-qualified candidates. </P>

<P>Special Studies </P>

<P>Permission of the instructor, the department chair and in some cases the department is required for the election of special studies. Special studies are open only to qualified sophomores, juniors and seniors. A maximum of 16 credits of special studies may be counted toward the degree. </P>

<P>The deadline for submission of the special studies application is the fifth day of classes in the semester. Normally students may not change the designated number of credits for a variable-credit special studies. </P>

<P>Auditing </P>

<P>A degree student at Smith or at the Five Colleges may audit a course on a regular basis if space is available and the permission of the instructor is obtained. An audit is not recorded on the transcript. </P>

<P>Auditing by Nonmatriculated Students </P>

<P>A nonmatriculated student who has earned a high school diploma and who wishes to audit a course may do so with the permission of the instructor and the registrar. An auditor must submit a completed registration form to the registrar’s office by the end of the second week of classes. A fee will be charged and is determined by the type of course. Studio classes may not be audited except by permission of the art faculty following a written request to the department. Official records of audits are not maintained. </P>

<P>Course Registration </P>

<P>Early Registration </P>

<P>Eligible students are expected to participate in the early registration periods, normally scheduled in November and April. During the two-week early registration period, students may register for no more than 19 credits. </P>

<P>Adding and Dropping Courses </P>

<P>During the first 10 class days of a semester, a student may add or drop a course with the approval of the adviser and after consultation with the instructor. During this period, a student may register for up to 24 credits. Courses may be added online through BannerWeb during the first five class days only. From the 6th to the 10th day students may add courses with the permission of the instructor and adviser; from the 11th through the 15th day of class, a student may add a course with the permission of the instructor, the adviser and the class dean. </P>

<P>After the 10th day of classes a student may drop a course up to the end of the fifth week of the semester under the following conditions. </P>

<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>if, after dropping the course, she is enrolled in at least 12 credits. (This provi</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>sion does not apply to Ada Comstock Scholars.) After the end of the fifth week of the semester a student may not drop a course. However, on two and only two occasions during her years at the college—once during her first year; once during any subsequent year—a student may “free drop” a course at any time up to the end of the ninth week of classes, for any reason, without penalty. The drop form requires the signatures of the instructor, adviser and class dean. </P>

<P>All add and drop deadlines for half-semester courses are prorated according to the above schedule and are published online each semester at the registrar’s office website. </P>

<P>A student should carefully consider the work load entailed in a seminar or course with limited enrollment before she enrolls. A student who wishes to drop a class of this nature should do so at the earliest possible moment so that another student may take advantage of the opening. Because the organization and operation of such courses are often critically dependent on the students enrolled, the instructor may refuse permission to drop the course after the first 10 class days. </P>

<P>A course dropped for reasons of health after the fifth week of classes will be recorded on the transcript with a grade of “W,” unless the student has the option of a free drop. </P>

<P>A student registers for an interterm course in November, with the approval of her adviser. In January, a student may drop or add an interterm course within the published add/drop period. (Please see the registrar’s office website for registration and add/drop deadlines.) Otherwise, the student who registers but does not attend will receive a “U” (unsatisfactory) for the course. </P>

<P>Regulations governing changes in enrollment for courses in the Five College Interchange may be more restrictive than the above. Instructions and deadlines for registration in Five College courses are published online by the registrar’s office. </P>

<P>Fine for Late Registration </P>

<P>A student who has not registered for courses by the end of the first 10 days of classes will be fined $35, payable at the time of registration. In addition, a fine of $35 will be assessed for each approved petition to add or drop a course after the deadline. A student who has not registered by the end of the first four weeks of the semester will be administratively withdrawn. </P>

<P>Course Work and Class Attendance </P>

<P>Students are expected to attend all their scheduled classes. Any student who is unable, because of religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from such activities without prejudice and shall be given an opportunity to make them up. </P>

<P>Students are asked to introduce guests to the instructor of a class before the beginning of the class if there is an opportunity and at the end if there is not. </P>

<P>Absence does not relieve the student from responsibility for work required while she was absent. The instructor may require her to give evidence that she has done the work assigned. In courses in which the written examinations can test only a part of the work, the instructor may rule that a student who does not attend class with reasonable regularity has not presented evidence that she has done the work. </P>

<P>The due date for final papers in each semester can be no later than the end of the examination period. Instructors must specify the acceptable format, exact deadline and place of delivery for final papers. If a paper or other course work is mailed to an instructor, it must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the student must keep a paper copy. It is the student’s responsibility to check that work submitted by email or fax has been received by the professor. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Deadlines and Extensions </P>

<P>Only the class dean may authorize an extension for any reason beyond the end of the final examination period. Such extensions, granted for reasons of illness, emergency or extenuating personal circumstances, will always be confirmed in writing with the faculty member, the registrar and the student. An individual faculty member, without authorization by the class dean, may grant extensions on work due during the semester through the last day of final exams. </P>

<P>Pre-Examination Period </P>

<P>The pre-examination study period, between the end of classes and the beginning of final examinations, is set aside for students to prepare for examinations. Therefore, the college does not schedule social, academic or cultural activities during this time. Deadlines for papers, take-home exams or other course work cannot be during the pre-examination study period. </P>

<P>Final Examinations </P>

<P>Most final exams at Smith are self-scheduled and administered by the registrar during predetermined periods. A student may choose in which period she wants to take each exam. Exams are picked up at distribution centers after showing a picture ID and must be returned to the same center no more than two hours and 20 minutes from the time they are received by the student. Extra time taken to write an exam is considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. A student who is late for an exam may write for the remaining time in the examination period but may not have additional time. Exams that involve slides, dictation or listening comprehension are scheduled by the registrar. Such examinations may be taken only at the scheduled time. </P>

<P>For information regarding illness during the examination period, call Health Services at extension 2800 for instructions. Students who become ill during an examination must report directly to Health Services. </P>

<P>Further details of the Academic Honor Code as they apply to examinations and class work are given in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/ handbook). Regulations of the faculty and the registrar regarding final examination procedures are published online at the registrar’s office website prior to the final examination period. </P>

<P>No scheduled or self-scheduled examination may be taken outside the regular examination period without prior permission of the administrative board. Written requests must be made to the administrative board through the class dean (not to individual faculty members). Requests to take final examinations early will not be considered; therefore, travel plans must be made accordingly. </P>

<P>Five College Course Enrollments </P>

<P>Students planning to enroll in a course at Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts may submit their requests online through BannerWeb. Five College course requests should be submitted during the period for advising and registration of courses for the coming semester. Course information is available online through the Five College online course guide or at the individual websites of the other four institutions. Free bus transportation to and from the institution is available for Five College students. Students in good standing are eligible to take a course at one of the other institutions: first-semester first-year students must obtain the permission of the class dean. Second-semester first-year students may take a course within the Five College system provided the student has earned a GPA of 3.0 or better in the first semester. A second-semester firstyear who wishes to enroll in two Five College courses needs permission from the first-year class dean. A traditional student must enroll in a minimum of 8 credits at Smith in any semester; an Ada Comstock scholar may take no more than half of her course program off campus. A student must register for an approved course at one of the other four institutions by the end of the interchange deadline (the first two weeks of the semester). Students must adhere to the registration procedures and deadlines of their home institution. </P>

<Sect>
<P>A list of Five College courses approved for Smith College degree credit is available at the registrar’s office. Requests for approval of courses not on the list may be submitted to the registrar’s office for review; however, Smith College does not accept all Five College courses for credit toward the Smith degree. Courses offered through their continuing education, extension or other nondegree programs are not part of the Five College Interchange. Students may not receive transfer credit for such courses completed while in residence at Smith College, but may receive transfer credit for those offered during interterm and summer. </P>

<P>Students taking a course at one of the other institutions are, in that course, subject to the academic regulations, including the calendar, grading option deadlines and academic honor system, of the host institution. Students taking Five College interchange courses will be awarded the credit value assigned by the host institution. It is the responsibility of the student to be familiar with the pertinent regulations of the host institution, including those for attendance, academic honesty, grading options and deadlines for completing coursework and taking examinations. Students follow the registration add/drop deadlines of their home institution. Regulations governing changes in enrollment in Five College courses are published online at the beginning of each semester at the registrar’s office website. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H1>Academic Credit </H1>

<P>Smith College complies with federal regulations defining a credit hour. Normally, a four-credit course involves 12 hours per week of academically engaged time over the course of the semester. Academically engaged time is generally three class or contact hours per week plus nine additional hours of academic work for the course per week. For courses carrying more or fewer than four credits, the Smith College expectation is three hours per week of academically engaged time per credit over the course of the semester. </P>

<P>Grading System </P>

<P>Grades are recorded by the registrar at the end of each semester. Grade reports are made available online through BannerWeb at that time. </P>

<P>Grades at Smith indicate the following: A (4.0) C-(1.7) A-(3.7) D+ (1.4) B+ (3.3) D (1.0) B (3.0) D-(0.7) B-(2.7) E (0.0) C+ (2.3) S satisfactory(C- or better) C (2.0) U unsatisfactory </P>

<P>X official extension authorized by the class dean </P>

<P>M unreported grade calculated as a failure </P>

<P>Grades earned in Five College courses are recorded as submitted by the host institution. A Five College incomplete grade is equivalent to a failing grade and is calculated as such until a final grade is submitted. An incomplete grade will be converted to a failing grade on the student’s official record if coursework is not completed by the end of the following semester. </P>

<P>Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Option </P>

<P>Coursework in any one semester may be taken for a satisfactory (C- or better)/ unsatisfactory grade, providing that: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>the instructor approves the option; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>the student declares the grading option for Smith courses by the end of the ninth week of classes. Students enrolled in Five College courses must declare the option at the host campus and follow the deadlines of that institution. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The fall deadline also applies to yearlong courses designated by a “D” in the </P>

<P>course number. In yearlong courses designated by a “Y” students may elect a </P>

<P>separate grading option for each semester. Students electing the satisfactory/ </P>

<P>unsatisfactory (S/U) option for both semesters of a yearlong course must do </P>

<P>so each semester. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Within the 128 credits required for the degree, a maximum of 16 credits (Smith or other Five College) may be taken for the S/U grading option, regardless of how many graded credits students are enrolled in per semester. Some departments will not approve the S/U grading option for courses counting toward the major. Credits earned in courses with a mandatory S/U grading option are not counted toward the 16-credit limit. </P>

<Sect>
<P>S/U grades do not count in the grade point average. </P>
</Sect>

<P>An Ada Comstock Scholar or a transfer student may elect the S/U grading option for four credits out of every 32 that she takes at Smith College. </P>

<P>Repeating Courses </P>

<P>Effective in the fall 2017 semester, students may repeat for credit a course taken at Smith in which a grade of C or lower was earned. A maximum of two courses may be repeated during the student’s period of enrollment. Permission of the student’s liberal arts or major faculty adviser and the course instructor is required. A Smith course may be repeated at Smith only, not at another institution (including those in the Five College Interchange). A student repeating a course that was passed (a grade of D- or higher) and for which credit was earned will receive no additional course credit toward graduation. All grades earned in courses, including any repeated courses, will appear and remain on the student’s transcript. Only the higher grade of a repeated course will be calculated into the term and cumulative GPAs, however. </P>

<P>It is the student’s responsibility to register a repeated course properly with the registrar’s office at the time of registration by submitting a completed course repeat authorization form. Topics and other courses that are noted as repeatable for credit in the course description or department/program catalog section are not subject to this policy, unless the student receives permission to repeat the same topic and meets all criteria above. Students should refer to the registrar’s office website (www.smith.edu/about-smith/registrar/policies-guidelines) for the complete course repeat policy. </P>

<P>Performance Credits </P>

<P>Students are allowed to count a limited number of performance credits toward the Smith degree. The maximum number allowed is indicated in the Courses of Study section under the appropriate departments (dance, exercise and sport science, and music). Excess performance credits are included on the transcript but do not count toward the degree. </P>

<P>Shortage of Credits </P>

<P>A shortage of credits incurred by failing or dropping a course may be made up by an equivalent amount of work carried above the normal 16-credit program, or with approved summer session or interterm courses accepted for credit toward the Smith College degree. In the case of failure in a course or dropping a course for reasons of health, a shortage may be filled with a student’s available Advanced Placement or other pre-matriculation credits. Any student with more than a two-credit shortage may be required to complete the shortage before returning for classes in a subsequent semester. </P>

<P>A student enters the senior year after completing a maximum of six semesters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter her senior year with fewer than 96 credits; exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student’s return to campus for her final two semesters. A student may not participate in a Smith-sponsored or affiliated Study Abroad or exchange program with a shortage of credit. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Transfer Credit </P>

<P>A student who attends another accredited college or university and requests credit toward a Smith College degree for the work done there: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>should make her plans in accordance with the regulations concerning off-campus study and, in the case of seniors, in accordance with the regulations concerning academic residence; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>should obtain, from the registrar’s office, the guidelines for transferring credit. Official transcripts should be sent directly to the registrar from the other institution; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>must, if approved to study abroad, have her program approved in advance by </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>the Committee on Study Abroad. Final evaluation of credit is made after receipt of the official transcript showing satisfactory completion of the program. </P>

<P>A student may not receive credit for work completed at another institution while in residence at Smith College, except for interterm courses and courses taken on the Five College interchange. Credit is not normally granted for online courses. </P>

<P>Transfer credit policies and guidelines are published online at the registrar’s office website and are available in the office. Students may not transfer credit for academic work completed at an international institution while withdrawn from the college. </P>

<P>Summer Session Credit </P>

<P>Students may accrue a maximum of 12 approved summer session credits toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and pre-matriculation credits. With the prior approval of the registrar, summer credit may be used to allow students to make up a shortage of credits or to undertake an accelerated course program. For transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars, summer session credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum. </P>

<P>Interterm Credit </P>

<P>The college may offer courses for credit during the interterm period. Such courses will carry one to four credits and will count toward the degree. The college will consider for-credit academic interterm courses taken at other institutions for transfer credit. The number of credits accepted for each interterm course (normally up to 3) will be determined by the registrar upon review of the credits assigned by the host institution. Any interterm course designated as 4 credits by a host institution must be reviewed by the class deans and the registrar to determine whether it merits an exception to the 3-credit limit. Students may accrue a maximum of 12 approved interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits. Normally, students may not take more than 4 credits during any one interterm at Smith or elsewhere. For transfer students, interterm credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum. </P>

<P>The interterm may also be a period of reading, research or concentrated study for both students and faculty. Faculty, students or staff may offer noncredit instruction or experimental projects in this period. Special conferences may be scheduled and field trips may be arranged at the discretion of individual members of the faculty. Libraries, the Center for Foreign Languages and Cultures, practice rooms and physical education facilities will remain open at the discretion of the departments concerned. This period also provides time for work in libraries, museums and laboratories at locations other than Smith College. </P>

<P>Students returning from a fall leave of absence or study elsewhere may participate in interterm, but are not guaranteed housing. </P>
</Sect>

<P>College Credit Earned Before Matriculation </P>

<P>Smith College will accept college credit with a grade of B- or better earned at an accredited college or university before matriculation as a first-year student. Such credit must be approved according to Smith College guidelines for transfer credit and submitted on an official college or university transcript. Such credits must be taken on the college or university campus with matriculated degree students and must be taught by a college or university professor. The course may not be listed on the high school transcript as counting toward high school graduation. Note that the restriction of 32 credits applied toward the Smith degree holds for any combination of Advanced Placement (AP) and/or college credit earned before matriculation. Prematriculation credits may be used in the same manner as AP credits toward the Smith degree and may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors. Summer credits earned before matriculation will be counted in the 12-credit limit of summer credit applicable to the Smith degree. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, International Baccalaureate (IB), other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted towards the degree. </P>

<P>Advanced Placement </P>

<P>Smith College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP) administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. AP credit may be used with the approval of the administrative board only (1) to make up a shortage of credits incurred through failure; (2) to make up a shortage of credit incurred as a result of dropping a course for reasons of health; or (3) to undertake an accelerated course program. AP credit may not be added to a student’s record to make up for a failing grade received as a result of an Honor Board sanction. </P>

<P>Credits are recorded for scores of 4 or 5 on most AP examinations. The credits to be recorded for each examination are determined by the individual department. For students entering the college in September 2012 and later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP and other prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree. </P>

<P>Students who complete courses that cover substantially the same material as those for which AP credit is recorded may not then apply that AP credit toward the degree requirements. The individual departments will determine what courses cover the same material. </P>

<P>The individual departments will determine placement in or exemption from Smith courses and the use of Advanced Placement credit to fulfill major requirements. No more than 8 credits will be granted toward the major in any one department. </P>

<P>AP credit may be used to count toward the 64 credits outside the major department or program but may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors. </P>

<P>International Baccalaureate and Other Diploma Programs </P>

<P>Credit may be awarded for the International Baccalaureate (IB) and some 13thyear programs outside the United States. The amount of credit is determined by the registrar upon review of the final results. Such credits may be used toward the Smith degree in the same manner as AP credits and may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, IB, other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Academic Standing </H1>

<P>A student is in good academic standing as long as she is matriculated at Smith and is considered by the administrative board to be making satisfactory progress toward the degree. The academic standing of all students is reviewed at the end of each semester. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Academic Probation </P>

<P>A student whose academic record is below 2.0, either cumulatively or in a given semester, will be placed on academic probation for the subsequent semester. Probationary status is a warning. Notification of probationary status is made in writing to the student, her family and her academic adviser. Instructors of a student on probation may be asked to make academic reports to the class deans’ offices during the period of probation. The administrative board will review a student’s record at the end of the following semester to determine what action is appropriate. The administrative board may require such a student to change her course program, to complete summer study or to withdraw from the college. Any student on academic probation who is required by the Administrative Board to earn credit at another institution must earn a B- or better in each course in order for the course to transfer for credit at Smith. </P>

<P>In general, a student on probation is advised to take no more than 16 credits. She may not enroll in courses through the Five College interchange, and may not run for or hold elected or selected office, either campus wide or within her house. A student on probation is not considered to be in good academic standing, is not eligible to study abroad, and may not compete in intercollegiate athletics or club sports. </P>

<P>Standards for Satisfactory Progress </P>

<P>A student is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree if she remains on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters. In addition (1) for students of traditional age, the record cannot have more than an eight-credit shortage for more than two consecutive semesters (2) for Ada Comstock Scholars, at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic semester must be completed satisfactorily. Students not meeting this criterion may be placed on academic probation or required to withdraw; if students are receiving financial aid, they will be placed on financial aid warning and may become ineligible for financial aid if the probationary period exceeds one year. Further information is available from the class deans’ office and the Office of Student Financial Services. </P>

<P>Absence from Classes </P>

<P>A student who is absent from classes for more than four weeks in any semester will not receive credit for the work of that semester and will be administratively withdrawn from the college. </P>

<P>Separation from the College </P>

<P>A student whose college work or conduct is deemed unsatisfactory is subject to separation from the college by action of the administrative board, the honor board, the college judicial board or the dean of the college. There will be no refund for tuition or room fees. </P>

<P>Administrative Board </P>

<P>The administrative board administers the academic requirements defined by faculty legislation. In general, academic matters affecting students are referred to this board for action or recommendation. The board consists of the dean of the college (chair), the class deans, the dean of the Ada Comstock Scholars, the registrar and three faculty members appointed by the president. </P>

<P>Petitions for exceptions to academic regulations are submitted in writing to the administrative board through the class dean, with appropriate faculty approvals. The administrative board will reconsider a decision only on the basis of gross error in procedure, new information that was not available at the time the original decision was made or extreme bias on the part of the Administrative Board. Appeals based on disagreement of the decision will not be considered. </P>

<P>The board has the authority to take action with respect to the academic performance of individual students, including the requirement that a student must leave the college. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Student Academic Grievances </P>

<P>The Smith College community has always been dedicated to the advancement of learning and the pursuit of truth under conditions of freedom, trust, mutual respect and individual integrity. The learning experience at Smith is rooted in the free exchange of ideas and concerns between faculty members and students. Students have the right to expect fair treatment and to be protected against any inappropriate exercise of faculty authority. Similarly, instructors have the right to expect that their rights and judgments will be respected by students and other faculty members. </P>

<P>When differences of opinion or misunderstanding about what constitutes fairness in requirements or procedures leads to conflict, it is hoped that these differences will be resolved directly by the individuals involved. When disputes cannot be resolved informally by the parties involved, procedures have been established to achieve formal resolution. These procedures are explained in detail in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/handbook). </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Privacy and the Age of Majority </H1>

<P>Under Massachusetts law, the age of majority is 18 and carries full adult rights and responsibilities. The college normally communicates directly with students in matters concerning grades, academic credit and standing. </P>

<P>In communications with parents concerning most matters, it is normally college policy to respect the privacy of the student and not to disclose information from student educational records without the prior consent of the student, consistent with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA).  At the request of the student, such information will be provided to parents and guardians. Students may authorize the release of information from their education records to their parents by completing the appropriate form at the registrar’s office. </P>

<P>However, FERPA makes clear that information from the educational records of students who are dependents of their parents for Internal Revenue Service purposes may be disclosed to the parents without the student’s prior consent. It is the policy of the college to notify both the dependent student and her parents in writing of probationary status, dismissal and certain academic warnings. Any student who is not a dependent of her parents, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, must notify the registrar of the college in writing, with supporting evidence satisfactory to the college, by October 1 of each academic year. </P>

<Sect>
<H1>Introduction Residence Requirements </H1>

<Sect>
<P>Smith College offers men and women graduate work leading to the degrees of master of arts in teaching, master of fine arts and master of science. The one-year post-baccalaureate program in mathematics is designed for women who need additional preparation before applying to graduate programs in mathematics. In special one-year programs, international students may qualify for a certificate of graduate studies or a diploma in American studies. In addition, master of arts and doctoral programs are offered in the School for Social Work Each year more than 100 men and women pursue such advanced work. </P>

<P>Smith College is noted for its superb facilities, bucolic setting and distinguished faculty who are recognized for their scholarship and interest in teaching. Moreover, graduate students can expect to participate in small classes and receive personalized attention from instructors. </P>

<P>Most graduate courses, which are designated as 500-level courses in the course listings, are planned for graduate students who are degree candidates. The departments offering this work present a limited number of graduate seminars, advanced experimental work or special studies designed for graduate students. Graduate students may take advanced undergraduate courses, subject to availability and according to the provisions stated in the paragraphs describing the requirements for the graduate degrees. Departmental graduate advisers help graduate students individually to devise appropriate programs of study. </P>

<Sect>
<H1>Admission </H1>

<P>To enter a graduate degree program, a student must have a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent, an undergraduate record of high caliber, and acceptance by the department concerned. Applicants who wish to be considered for financial aid must submit all required application materials by the deadline date for their programs of interest. (Refer also to the Financial Assistance section.) The deadline for fall entry for most programs is January 15 and spring entry November </P>

<P>1. If no financial aid is needed, most master’s degree programs will accept late applications for fall until April 1. Exceptions: master of fine arts in dance, January 5, with no late applications and no spring admission; master of science in biological sciences, no late applications and no spring admission; master of arts in teaching, rolling admission beginning December 1 and ending May 1; and post-baccalaureate/mathematics, March 15 for fall, October 15 for spring. </P>

<P>Applicants must submit the materials listed on the application for admission, including the formal application form, the $60 application fee, the official transcript of the undergraduate record, letters of recommendation from instructors at the undergraduate institution, and (in some cases) the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). Applicants from non-English-speaking countries must submit official results from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). International applicants from English-speaking countries must submit results from the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). All candidates must also submit a paper written in an advanced undergraduate course, except for MFA/playwriting candidates, who must submit one or more full-length scripts or their equivalent. Direct correspondence and questions to the Office of Graduate and Special Programs. </P>

<P>Smith College is committed to maintaining a diverse community in an atmosphere of mutual respect and appreciation of differences. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Students who are registered for a graduate degree program at Smith College are considered to be in residence. A full-time graduate student takes a minimum course program of 12 credits per semester. A half-time student takes a minimum course program of eight credits per semester. With the approval of his or her academic adviser and the director of graduate and special programs, a student may take a maximum of 12 credits for degree credit at Amherst, Hampshire or Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts. No more than two courses (eight credits) will be accepted in transfer from outside of the Five Colleges. We strongly recommend that work for advanced degrees be continuous; if it is interrupted or undertaken on a part-time basis, an extended period is permitted, but all work for a master’s degree normally must be completed within a period of four years. Exceptions to this policy will be considered by petition to the Administrative Board. During this period, a continuation fee of $60 will be charged each semester during which a student is not enrolled at Smith College in course work toward the degree. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Leaves of Absence </H1>

<P>A student who wishes to be away from the college for a semester or academic year for personal reasons may request a leave of absence. The request must be filed with the director of graduate and special programs by May 1 for a fall semester or academic-year leave; by December 1 for a second-semester leave. No leaves of absence will be approved after May 1 for the following fall semester or academic year and December 1 for the spring semester, and the student must withdraw from the college. </P>

<P>A leave of absence may not be extended beyond one full academic year, and a student who wants to be away from the college for more than one year must withdraw. </P>

<P>A student on a leave of absence is expected to adhere to the policies regarding such leaves. A student’s tuition account must be in good standing or the leave of absence will be canceled. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>Degree Programs </H1>

<P>Grade requirements vary, depending on the program. The master of science in biological sciences, master of fine arts in dance, and master of fine arts in theater require that all work to be counted toward the degree (including the thesis) must receive grades of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. Students in the master of science in exercise and sport studies are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or higher throughout the program, and the master of arts in teaching requires a student to have at least a 3.0 grade point average at the time of graduation in order to have earned the degree. Courses for graduate credit may not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. The requirements described below are minimal. Any department may set additional or special requirements and thereby increase the total number of courses involved. </P>

<P>Master of Science in Biological Sciences </P>

<P>The Department of Biological Sciences maintains an active graduate program leading to the master of science in biological sciences. The program of study emphasizes independent research supported by advanced course work. Candidates are expected to demonstrate a strong background in the life sciences and a clear commitment to independent laboratory, field and/or theoretical research. The department offers opportunities for original work in a wide variety of fields, including animal behavior, biochemistry, cell and developmental biology, ecology, environmental science, evolutionary biology, genetics, marine biology, microbiology, molecular biology, neurobiology, plant sciences and physiology. Students pursuing the M.S. degree are required to participate in the Graduate Seminar (BIO 507) and are expected to undertake a course of study, designed in conjunction with their adviser, that will include appropriate courses both within and outside the department. </P>

<Sect>
<P>A thesis is also required of each candidate for this degree. It may be limited in scope but must demonstrate scholarly competence; it is equivalent to a two-semester, eight-credit course. A copy must be presented to the committee for deposit in the library. The thesis may be completed in absentia only by special permission of the department and of the director of graduate and special programs. </P>

<P>Master of Science in Exercise and Sport Studies </P>

<P>The graduate program in exercise and sport studies focuses on preparing coaches for women’s intercollegiate teams. The curriculum blends theory courses in exercise and sport studies with hands-on coaching experience at the college level. By design, the program is a small one, with only 15 to 20 candidates in residence. This makes it possible for students to work independently with faculty and coaches. Smith has a history of excellence in academics and a wide-ranging intercollegiate program composed of 14 varsity sports. Entrance into the two-year program requires a strong undergraduate record and playing and/or coaching experience in the sport that a student will be coaching. Individuals who do not have undergraduate courses in exercise physiology and kinesiology should anticipate work beyond the normal 51 credits. For more information, contact the Department of Exercise and Sport Studies, Smith College, Northampton, MA 01063, 413-585-3971. </P>

<P>Master of Arts in Teaching </P>

<P>The program leading to the degree of master of arts in teaching is designed for students who are planning to teach in elementary, middle or high schools and those wishing to do advanced study in the field of education. The M.A.T. program combines study in the field of the student’s academic interest; the specific teaching field for students preparing to teach at the secondary or middle school levels, broader liberal arts and sciences subjects for students preparing to teach at the elementary level; with experience in teaching and the study of education theory. The departments of biological sciences, chemistry, English, geosciences, government, history, mathematics and physics actively cooperate with the Department of Education and Child Study in administering the various graduate programs. </P>

<P>The Department of Education and Child Study uses a variety of schools and settings to provide opportunities for observation, service learning and classroom teaching experiences. These include the laboratory elementary school operated by the college, the public schools of Northampton and other area communities, as well as several private schools. </P>

<P>Students who follow the Master of Arts in Teaching program will, in the course of an intensive five-week summer session and a full-time academic year, be able to complete the state-approved program in teacher education enabling them to meet requirements for licensure in various states. </P>

<P>Admission prerequisites and course requirements vary depending upon the specific program; more detailed information may be obtained from the director of graduate and special programs. </P>

<P>Prospective candidates should have a superior undergraduate record and should present evidence of personal qualifications for effective teaching. Those interested in the M.A.T. in secondary or middle school teaching should also possess an appropriate concentration—normally a major—in the subject of the teaching field. Along with a resume, all applicants should submit a paper or other piece of work that is illustrative of their writing. Applicants with teaching experience should include a letter of recommendation concerning their teaching. We invite interested students to visit www.smith.edu/educ/ to learn more about our program and to find application materials. </P>
</Sect>

<P>To qualify for a degree, the candidate must have at least a 3.0 grade average at the time of graduation. Courses for graduate credit may not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. </P>

<P>Master of Fine Arts in Dance </P>

<P>Master of Fine Arts in Playwriting </P>

<P>This program, offered by the Department of Theatre, provides specialized training to candidates who have given evidence of professional promise in playwriting. The Department of Theatre places great emphasis on collaborative work among designers, performers, directors and writers, thus offering a unique opportunity for playwrights to have their work nurtured and supported by others who work with it at various levels. </P>

<P>Sixty-four credit hours, including a thesis, and two years of residence are required. In a two-year sequence, a student would have eight required courses in directing, advanced playwriting and dramatic literature and a total of eight electives at the 300 level or above, with the recommendation that half be in dramatic literature. Electives may be chosen from acting, directing and design/tech courses and from courses outside the department and within the Five Colleges. To count toward the degree, all work must receive a grade of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. </P>

<H1>The Minor </H1>

<P>The African studies minor at Smith allows students to complement their major with a program that provides a systematic introduction to the complex historical, political and social issues of the African continent. The minor is structured to give the student interdisciplinary training within key fields of knowledge: literature and the arts, social science and historical studies. </P>

<P>Requirements: Six semester courses on Africa are required. One course must be drawn from each of the following three fields: </P>

<P>Arts, Literature and Humanities; Historical Studies; Social Sciences </P>

<P>No more than two courses from a student’s major may be counted toward the minor. At the discretion of the adviser, equivalent courses at other colleges may be substituted for Five College courses. </P>

<P>Language. Students interested in African studies are encouraged to study French, Portuguese or an African language. In addition, a student who has achieved inter-mediate-level competence in an African language may petition for this to count as one of the required courses in the field of arts, literature and humanities. </P>

<P>Students with required language proficiency may apply for the Five College African Studies Certificate. </P>

<P>Study Abroad. Students are encouraged to spend a semester or more in Africa. Information on current programs may be obtained from the African studies director and should be discussed with the minor adviser. </P>

<P>Arts, Literature and Humanities </P>

<P>CLT 100 Introduction to Comparative Literature: The Pleasures of Reading </P>

<P>Topics course. May be repeated once with a different topic. </P>

<P>Cannibals, Witches and Virgins </P>

<P>An examination of the rewritings and adaptations of the three iconic figures of Shakespeare’s The Tempest—Caliban the demi-devil savage other, Sycorax the devil-whore, and Miranda the virgin-goddess—by writers from different geographies, time periods and ideological persuasions. Using texts such as Aimé Césaire’s A Tempest, Rachel Ingalls’ Mrs. Caliban, Lemuel Johnson’s Highlife for Caliban, Gloria Naylor’s Mama Day and Michelle Cliff’s No Telephone to Heaven, we seek to understand how postcolonial, feminist and postmodern rewritings of The Tempest transpose its language and characters into critiques of colonialism, nationhood, race, gender and difference. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Normally offered each academic year </P>
</Sect>

<P>A study of the major writers and diverse literary traditions of modern Africa with emphasis on the historical, political and cultural contexts of the emergence of writing, reception and consumption. We pay particular attention to several questions: in what contexts did modern African literature emerge? Is the term “African literature” a useful category? How do African writers challenge Western representations of Africa? How do they articulate the crisis of independence and postcoloniality? How do women writers reshape our understanding of gender and the politics of resistance? Writers include Chinua Achebe, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiong’o, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele and Ama Ata Aidoo. We also watch and critique films such as Blood Diamond, District 9, Tsotsi and The Constant Gardener. </P>

<P>CLT 266 Studies in South African Literature and Film </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>Modern South African Literature and Cinema </P>

<P>A study of South African literature and film with a particular focus on adaptation of literary texts to the screen. We pay particular attention to texts and films in which violence—political, economic, psychical, xenophobic, homophobic etc.—is the main focus. For what purposes do South African filmmakers adapt canonical and contemporary texts, biographies and memoirs to the screen? How do these adaptations help us visualize the relationship between power and violence in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa? How do race, class, gender, sexuality and ethnicity complicate how we define, conceptualize and critique racial, political and gender-based violence in South Africa? Texts and films may include Njabulo Ndebele’s The Cry of Winnie Mandela, Alan Paton’s Cry the Beloved Country, André Brink’s A Dry White Season, Mahamo’s The Last Grave at Dimbaza, John Wood’s Biko (Cry Freedom), Anne Mare du Preez Bezdrob’s Winnie Mandela: A Life (Winnie) and Athol Fugard’s Tsotsi. We also study film classics such as The Voortrekkers, Zulu/Zulu Dawn and Sarafina as well as transcripts and footages of testimonies from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings.

<P>FRN 230 Colloquium in French Studies </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>A gateway to more advanced courses. These colloquia develop skills in expository writing and critical thinking in French. Materials include novels, films, essays and cultural documents. Students may receive credit for only one section of 230. Enrollment limited to 18. Basis for the major. Prerequisite: 220, or permission of the instructor. </P>

<P>Women Writers of Africa and the Caribbean </P>

<P>An introduction to works by contemporary women writers from Francophone Africa and the Caribbean. Topics studied include colonialism, exile, motherhood and intersections between class and gender. Our study of these works and of the French language is informed by attention to the historical, political and cultural circumstances of writing as a woman in a former French colony. Texts include works by Mariama Bâ, Maryse Condé, Yamina Benguigui and Marie-Célie Agnant. {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>An introduction to the study of French and Francophone film. Readings in film criticism. Papers and attendance at weekly screenings required. Course taught in French. Prerequisite: 230, or permission of the instructor. Course may be repeated for credit with a different topic. </P>

<P>Cities of Light: Urban Spaces in Francophone Film </P>

<P>From Paris to Fort-de-France, Montreal to Dakar, we study how various filmmakers from the Francophone world present urban spaces as sites of conflict, solidarity, alienation and self-discovery. How do these portraits confirm or challenge the distinction between urban and non-urban? How does the image of the city shift for “insiders” and “outsiders”? Other topics to be discussed include immigration, colonialism and globalization. Works by Sembène Ousmane, Denys Arcand, Mweze Ngangura and Euzhan Palcy. {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FRN 262 After Algeria: Revolution, Republic and Race in Modern France </P>

<P>From the colonial conquest in the early 19th century through independence in 1962, Algeria has evoked passions on both sides of the Mediterranean Sea, passions frequently resulting in violence that has not entirely subsided. Through a variety of perspectives and readings, we explore a post-Algerian French society that appears to be permanently marked by its Algerian experience. To what extent has the experience in and of Algeria transformed contemporary French culture? In what ways can one speak of the Algerian experience in revolutionary terms? Prerequisite: 230, or permission of the instructor. {F} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>French Travel Writing and Self-Discovery </P>

<P>A survey of Francophone travel writing from the 16th to the 21st centuries. Students are exposed to a literary form that achieved popularity and cultural prestige early on, was then significantly challenged and diversified, and is presently enjoying a resurgence. We consider fictional and nonfictional accounts reflecting various geographies of travel and migration. While early voyagers tended to assert the relative superiority of French culture, subsequent generations of travelers abandoned discovery for self-discovery, and critiqued colonialism instead of indigenous cultures.

<P>FYS 165 Childhood in African Literature </P>

<P>A study of childhood as an experience in the present and as a transition into adulthood, and of the ways in which it is intimately tied to social, political and cultural histories, and to questions of self and national identity. How does the violence of colonialism and decolonization reframe our understanding of childhood innocence? How do African childhood narratives represent such crises as cultural alienation, loss of language, exile and memory? How do competing national and cultural ideologies shape narratives of childhood? Texts include Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions, Zoë Wicomb’s You Can’t Get Lost in Cape Town, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiongo’s Weep Not Child and Tahar Ben Jelloun’s The Sand Child. This course counts toward the comparative literature major. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Master Musicians of Africa I: West Africa </P>

<P>This course concentrates on the lives and music of selected West African musicians. Departing from ethnographic approaches that mask the identity of individual musicians and treat African societies as collectives, this course emphasizes the contributions of individual West African musicians whose stature as master musicians is undisputed within their respective communities. It examines the contributions of individual musicians in the ever continuous process of negotiating the boundaries and identities of African musical practice. Musicians covered this semester include Akan female professional singers in Ghana; Yous-sou N'Dour (Senegalese musician) and Babatunde Olatunji, the late Nigerian drummer. The variety of artistic expressions of selected musicians also provides a basis for examining the interrelatedness of different African musical idioms, and the receptivity of African music to non-African styles. {A} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<H1>Mission </H1>

<P>The Department of Africana Studies investigates the social, historical, cultural and aesthetic works and practices of populations of African descent throughout the diaspora. A multidisciplinary endeavor, our interrogations begin not with race as an assumed concept but as a site of profound social formation that must be considered in relation to gender, class, nation, ethnicity, religion and sexuality. We understand our mandate to be two-fold: to provide a coherent, grounded body of knowledge for our majors and minors as well as to serve the broader academic and cocurricular needs of the college. In all of these endeavors, we emphasize the need for students to develop their analytic capacities. </P>

<P>A student in our department is first a critical thinker, one who learns to ask questions, seek connections, unpack what is invisible or ignored. Our courses emphasize close reading, research and writing, and our curriculum expects students to think about the Caribbean, Africa and diaspora communities in Europe and elsewhere. In support of this expectation, we encourage students to travel abroad. </P>

<P>This course is designed to introduce students to the many methods of inquiry used for research in interdisciplinary fields such as Africana studies. Guided by a general research topic or theme, students are exposed to different methods for asking questions and gathering evidence. </P>

<P>Soul and Post-Soul </P>

<P>Beginning with Nelson George in 1992 scholars have invoked “post-soul” to describe black culture and politics after the civil-rights era.  Scholars use &quot;post-soul&quot; to frame discussions of the socioeconomic and political changes arising after the 1960s; conceptualize cultural identity by differentiating it from black arts/soul era arts and politics; and theorize black aesthetic productions of the period (e.g. literature, performance, visual arts, music). Using soul and post-soul as organizing conceits, this course will give students an introduction to, and practice in, the tools of intellectual investigation in the study of African-American history and culture/ racial formations. Students will read, attend lectures and learn from scholars whose work is based in particular disciplines (especially history, literature, cultural studies and the social sciences). You will also learn the challenges and opportunities made possible by doing interdisciplinary research. Through the multi- and interdisciplinary approach to a single topic or text (in the case of this semester, soul and post-soul), students will learn how scholars in each discipline ask certain kinds of research questions, take certain kinds of research approaches; and how to put these various methods in conversation with each other. Finally, students will also have an opportunity to develop their own research project related to the focus of this course (race, ethnicity, and the social construction of identity) by means of library and media-based research. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

These autobiographical accounts provide rich portraits of individual experience at a specific time and place as well as insights into the larger socio-historical context in which the authors lived. This course focuses on the autobiographies of activist women. In addition to analyzing texts and their contexts, we reflect on and document how our own life history is shaped by race.

The course’s primary focus is on literary depictions of transnational identities and communities and questions of citizenship and belonging, in fiction by and about “inbetweeners” who inhabit cultural and national borderlands. Our investigation draws primarily from novels, but may also include examples from other genres, including poetry, short stories and memoir.

Beginning with the 19th century slave narrative tradition, and moving through the 20th and 21st centuries, we will explore how African Americans use written, sonic and visual languages to resist Eurocentric projections of otherness onto black bodies. Using theoretical frames—such as fugitive and unmoored subjectivity, demonic grounds, and the black interior—students will critically engage representational works that mediate on “blackness” not only in terms of nonbeing, but also in terms of becoming. In other words, we will treat the black imagination as a critical site of inquiry because of its construction of racialized subjectivity as varied, complex, and evolving. Examples from sonic and visual culture will be drawn from multiple sources. Readings may include Douglass, Jacobs, Hurston, Morrison and Whitehead, among others. {H} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Seminar: Anthropology of Blackness in the Americas </P>

<P>In this course we investigate and build a critical working vocabulary about 20th-century black migrant communities. Central to our work is exploring the tension between how these communities have been defined (via notions of pathology, disease and death) and how they have defined themselves through their spatial and environmental practices around belonging, collectivity and place. These are queer or non-normative modes of urbanism, and they challenge dominant idioms of territoriality. We glean these practices by interrogating planner documents; reading critically anti-racist texts; and analyzing music, poetry and vernacular architectural practices.  {H} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Seminar: The Politics of Grief </P>

<P>What role has grief played in the black freedom struggle? How have conceptions of race and gender been articulated, expanded, and politicized through public performances of collective mourning? This seminar explores the ways in which post-emancipation black politics developed through efforts, often led by women, to not only challenge but to also embody and inhabit trauma. We will consider a range of theoretical texts alongside historical documents from the late nineteenth century to today. {H} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>CLT 205 20th-Century Literatures of Africa </P>

<P>A study of the major writers and diverse literary traditions of modern Africa with emphasis on the historical, political and cultural contexts of the emergence of writing, reception and consumption. We pay particular attention to several questions: in what contexts did modern African literature emerge? Is the term “African literature” a useful category? How do African writers challenge Western representations of Africa? How do they articulate the crisis of independence and postcoloniality? How do women writers reshape our understanding of gender and the politics of resistance? Writers include Chinua Achebe, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiong’o, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele and Ama Ata Aidoo. We also watch and critique films such as Blood Diamond, District 9, Tsotsi and The Constant Gardener. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>Modern South African Literature and Cinema </P>

<P>A study of South African literature and film with a particular focus on adaptation of literary texts to the screen. We pay particular attention to texts and films in which violence—political, economic, psychical, xenophobic, homophobic etc.—is the main focus. For what purposes do South African filmmakers adapt canonical and contemporary texts, biographies and memoirs to the screen? How do these adaptations help us visualize the relationship between power and violence in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa? How do race, class, gender, sexuality and ethnicity complicate how we define, conceptualize and critique racial, political and gender-based violence in South Africa? Texts and films may include Njabulo Ndebele’s The Cry of Winnie Mandela, Alan Paton’s Cry the Beloved Country, André Brink’s A Dry White Season, Mahamo’s The Last Grave at Dimbaza, John Wood’s Biko (Cry Freedom), Anne Mare du Preez Bezdrob’s Winnie Mandela: A Life (Winnie) and Athol Fugard’s Tsotsi. We also study film classics such as The Voortrekkers, Zulu/Zulu Dawn and Sarafina as well as transcripts and footages of testimonies from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings.

<P>ENG 222 Spirometers, Speculums and the Scales of Justice: Medicine and Law in 19th-Century African Diasporic Literature </P>

<P>During a time of rapid professionalization, medicine and law profoundly influenced New World ideas about what it means to be a human, a person, and a citizen, and how such definitions determined the rights of people of African descent. This course surveys 19th-century African diasporic authors’ and orators’ engagements with medical and legal theories on issues of slavery, emigration, crime and revolution. Supplementing our readings of slave literature, crime narratives, emigration writings, poetry and fiction, we study contemporary and current theories of race and racial science, the human, non-human, and post-human, environmentalism, colonization, pain, disability, gender, sexuality and legal personhood. Our literary travels take us from colonial West Indies, Jamaica, and the antebellum U.S. to colonial Canada, Cuba and the Bahamas. </P>

<P>Same as ARH 258. This class examines the architectural history of French colonialism from a global historical perspective. French colonialism marked the longest episode of French interaction with the non-European world. This class encourages a broader understanding of its architectural impact through approaching the buildings, towns and cities that emerged during French imperialism. We engage colonial iterations of “high style,” or official, governmental architecture, in addition to examining vernacular forms engendered because of the blending of building traditions. We consider sites in Africa, North America, the Caribbean, Asia and the Indian Ocean. We think through the social and economic factors that caused architectural and urban typologies to display marked continuities despite geographical distinctions. (E) </P>

<P>Food and its absence are persistent themes in Caribbean literature. Cooking and culinary practices serve as a means of preserving cultural identities, yet can also reinforce colonial visions of the Caribbean as an exoticized space. Hunger figures as an indictment of that colonial history and of contemporary global inequities. Through studies of folk tales, short stories, poetry and novels, this course offers an introduction to the literature and major theoretical movements of Guadeloupe, Martinique and Haiti, with a focus on how cultural memory is inscribed in metaphors of consumption. {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 148 Migration Stories: Border-Crossing and Becoming in African-American Literature </P>

<P>This course explores how histories of migration have shaped the formation of black cultures and identities. African American culture and identities have always been produced in the crucible of migration, both forced and voluntary. Black people and black cultures have always been on the move and have always been in the process of formation and reformation. African peoples arrived in the “New World” as captives of the transatlantic slave trade. This historical event was devastating, yet it was also an occasion for new cultures and identities to be formed. Migration has compelled black peoples to refashion themselves, transform their environments and make their mark on the art and cultures of their new societies. Among the topics covered are: the transatlantic and domestic slave trades, fugitivity, the Great Migration from the South, the post–Civil Rights era “reverse migration,” and more recent immigrations by people from the Caribbean and Africa. We use literature, history, music and film to ask how these stories help us understand the intricacies of this rich history. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. Credits: 4 </P>

Key topics include issues of resistance and collaboration in African anticolonial movements, gender and popular culture in late colonial and postcolonial Africa, the Cold War, and the promise and disappointment of the postcolonial state.

<P>Anatomy of a Slave Revolt </P>

<P>During slavery, white Americans, especially U.S. slaveholders, feared the specter of insurrection. Uprisings at Stono or those led by Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner proved that slaves often fought back. Yet the central historiographical question remains: why didn’t U.S. slaves overthrow enslavement like Haitian slaves did on Santo Domingo? Enslaved people challenged slavery in a variety of ways including violence, revolts, maroon communities, truancy, passing, suicide and day-to-day resistance. This course examines the primary documents and contentious historical debates surrounding the import of slave resistance, primarily in the American South. Students examine slave societies, theories on race, gender, sexuality and resistance, as well as modern literature and film to investigate violent and nonviolent resistance and how they are memorialized both in history and in the popular imagination. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Remembering Slavery: A Gendered Reading of the WPA Slave Interviews </P>

<P>Despite the particular degradation, violence and despair of enslavement in the United States, African American men and women built families, traditions and a legacy of resistance. Using the WPA interviews—part of the New Deal Federal Writers Project of the 1930s—this course looks at the historical memory of former slaves by reading and listening to their own words. How did 70- through 90-year-old former slaves remember their childhoods and young adulthoods during slavery? And how do scholars make sense of these interviews given they were conducted when Jim Crow segregation was at its pinnacle? The course examines the WPA interviews as historical sources by studying scholarship that relies heavily on them. Most importantly, students explore debates that swirl around the interviews and challenge their validity on multiple fronts, even as they remain the richest sources of African American oral history regarding slavery. Students write an original research paper using the WPA interviews as their central source. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>IDP 102 Race and Its Intersections With Class, Gender and Sexuality </P>

<P>This course offers an interdisciplinary, critical examination of race largely in the context of the United States. Although race is no longer held by scientists to have any essential biological reality, it has obviously played a central role in the formation of legal codes (from segregation to affirmative action), definitions of citizenship, economics (from slavery to discriminatory loan arrangements), culture (dance, fashion, literature, music, sport) and identities. Where did the concept of race come from? How has it changed over time and across space? What pressures does it continue to exert on our lives? How does it intersect with gender, sexuality, social class, religion and abilities? By bringing together faculty from a variety of programs and disciplines—and by looking at a range of cultural texts, social studies and historical events where racial distinctions and identities have been deployed, constructed and contested—we hope to give the students an understanding of how and why race matters. This course meets for 10 sessions, beginning in the second week of the semester and ending on the penultimate week. (E) Credits: 2 </P>

<P>THE 319 Shamans, Shapeshifters and the Magic If </P>

<P>To act, to perform is to speculate with your body. Theatre is a transformative experience that takes performer and audience on an extensive journey in the playground of the imagination beyond the mundane world. Theatre asks us to be other than ourselves. We can for a time inhabit someone else’s skin, be shaped by another gender or ethnicity, become part of a past epoch or an alternative time and space similar to our own time but that has yet to come. As we enter this “imagined” world we investigate the normative principles of our current world. This course investigates the counterfactual, speculative, subjunctive impulse in overtly speculative drama and film with a particular focus on race and gender. We examine an international range of plays by such authors as Caryl Churchill, Tess Onwueme, Dael Orlandersmith, Derek Walcott, Bertolt Brecht, Lorraine Hansberry, Craig Lucas and Doug Wright, as well as films such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; Pan’s Labyrinth; Children of Men; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; X-Men; Contact and Brother From Another Planet.

<P>Because of the wide-ranging interests and methods included within the interdisciplinary American studies program, careful consultation between a student and her adviser is crucial to the planning of the major. </P>

<P>In order to structure their studies of American society and culture, majors select a focus—such as an era (e.g., antebellum America, the 20th century) or a topical concentration (e.g., ethnicity and race, urban life, social policy, material culture, the family, industrialization, the arts, the media, popular culture, comparative American cultures)—which they will explore in at least four courses. It is expected that several courses in the major will explore issues outside the theme. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Because American studies courses are located primarily in two divisions, humanities and social sciences, students are to balance their studies with courses in each. Courses taken S/U may not be counted toward the major. </P>

<P>AMS 201 Introduction to the Study of American Society and Culture </P>

<P>An introduction to the methods and concerns of American studies. We draw on literature, painting, architecture, landscape design, social and cultural criticism, and popular culture to explore such topics as responses to economic change, ideas of nature and culture, America’s relationship to Europe, the question of race, the roles of women, family structure, social class and urban experience. </P>

<P>AMS 202 Methods in American Studies </P>

<P>What do Americans want? What do they fear? What is an “American”? How do we draw the line between those who belong and those who do not? How do we define citizenship, its rights and responsibilities? How do race, gender, class and other differences affect the drawing of these boundaries, and the contents of consciousness? This course introduces some of the exciting and innovative approaches to cultural analysis that have emerged over the last three decades. Students apply these methods to a variety of texts and practices (stories, movies, television shows, music, advertisements, clothes, buildings, laws, markets, bodies) in an effort to acquire the tools to become skillful readers of American culture, and to become more critical and aware as scholars and citizens. </P>

<P>Dance Music Sex Romance: Popular Music, Gender and Sexuality from Rock to Rap </P>

<P>Since the 1950s rock ‘n’ roll and other forms of youth-oriented popular music in the U.S. have embodied rebellion. Yet the rebellion that rock and other popular music styles like rap have offered has often been more available to men than women. Similarly, the sexual liberation associated with popular music in the rock and rap eras has been far more open to “straight” desires over “queer.” This course will examine how popular music from the 1950s to the present has been shaped by gender and sexuality, and the extent to which the music and its associated cultural practices have allowed artists and audiences to challenge gender and sexual norms, or alternately have served to reinforce those norms albeit with loud guitars and a heavy beat.

<P>Curating American Memories </P>

<P>Which histories become part of national memory, and which do not? This course interrogates the intellectual, political and pedagogical bases of literature, museums and public history in the U.S. from the 18th century to today. We devote part of our time to the theoretical readings that will ground our inquiry: texts range from museum studies, anthropology and sociology, to history, literary studies and cultural studies. The other part focuses on specific historical and present-day case studies, such as PT Barnum’s American Museum, Wanamaker’s Hiawatha Shows, the President’s House and the Pop-Up Museum of Queer History. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>AMS 225 Corporate Capitalism, Media and Protest in America </P>

<P>The U.S. Constitution recognizes a free press as the lifeblood of democracy with a mandate to inform citizens and hold the powerful accountable. But there is widespread distrust of the media in American society today. This course analyzes the transformation of the press into a corporate enterprise over the past 150 years, and the opposition this has provoked. Examining key developments (the creation of multinational media conglomerates as well as new digital media alternatives) and focusing on case studies such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the 2016 Elections, we examine the influence of the media on American political, economic, and cultural life. {H} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>AMS 227 Trade and Theft in Early America </P>

<P>A seventeenth-century engraving imagines an encounter between two men wearing feathers and holding onto the same string of shells: depending on your perspective, this image looks like a scene of trade or one of theft at knife-point. In understanding moments from the past, representation and perspective shape not just interpretation, but sources themselves. Seeing moments as both trade and theft opens them to tellings and analyses from multiple perspectives, exposing overlooked elements and revealing the ways in which histories are made. This course introduces students to Early American history (c 1500–1800) through the themes of trade, theft, representation, and perspective. (E) </P>

<P>In this course we interrogate the space now known as “New England” by learning about it as a land with histories, peoples and life ways that predate and exceed the former English colonies and current United States. We devote our semester to studying the cultural distinctiveness of the Native peoples of New England—for example, the Mohawk, Mohegan, Abenaki, Wampanoag and Schaghticoke peoples—and to understanding the historical processes of encounter, adaptation, resistance and renewal that have characterized Native life in the area for centuries. We explore histories of the pre- and post- “contact” period through the perspectives of various Native communities, and discuss the legacies of these histories for Native New England today. {H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>This course is open to anyone particularly interested in learning about Asian/ Pacific/American (A/P/A) history. The objective of the course is two-fold. The first is to provide the students with a fundamental understanding of A/P/A history that is inextricably linked to the goal of the United States to establish military, economic and cultural hegemony in the world as seen through its colonial and neo-colonial policies both in the U.S. and the Asian/Pacific region. The second is to introduce them to the various themes as well as methodological and theoretical frameworks used by scholars in the field of A/P/A Studies in order to encourage them to either work toward a Five College A/P/A Studies Certificate or pursue further studies in the field. {H} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

Topics include the various ideological strains that inform American conservatism (traditionalism, Christian evangelicalism, neoliberalism, neoconservatism, reform conservatism, Alt-Right); affective styles and strategies that animate conservative politics; institutional networks that support conservative coalition-building and the propagation of conservative ideas (media, think tanks, PACs); the “tribal” polarization of the American political parties around issues such as race, gender, sexuality, climate change, and gun control.

<P>AMS 235 American Popular Culture </P>

<P>This course offers an analytical history of American popular culture since 1865. We start from the premise that popular culture, far from being merely a frivolous or debased alternative to high culture, is an important site of popular expression, social instruction and cultural conflict. We examine theoretical texts that help us to “read” popular culture, even as we study specific artifacts from a variety of pop culture sources, from television shows to Hollywood movies, the pornography industry to spectator sports, and popular music to theme parks. We pay special attention to questions of desire, and to the ways popular culture has mediated and produced pleasure, disgust, fear and satisfaction. Alternating lecture/discussion format.

<P>In this course, we will examine the ways that “difference”—race, gender, sexuality, disability, and class—is produced and reproduced in an era of digital media. Some questions to guide our inquiry include: How do digital technologies and digital media contribute to the intersectional production of gender, sexuality, disability, and race, particularly as these categories overlap with converged media, consumption, capital, labor, citizenship, participation, and surveillance? How are concepts of difference embodied in technology? In addition, we will trace how people use technology to resist and challenge racial, gender, and sexual norms. Enrollment limit of 20.

And what resources do we need to properly study disability? Together, students investigate: trends in disability activism, histories of medicine and science, conceptions of “normal” embodiment, the utility of terms like “crip” or “disabled” and the representation of disability in culture.

<P>From butt-kicking warriors like Imperator Furiosa, to state leaders like New York governor David Paterson and former president FDR, to ultra-glamorous models like Jillian Mercado and Nyle DiMarco, images of and persons with disabilities have shaped the discourse of American popular culture. Though popular literary genres have long framed disability as tragic or pitiable, disabled writers have successfully appropriated popular, commercial styles to leverage critiques against dominant conceptions of disability. The purpose of this course is to investigate what arguments these popular texts make, whether implicitly or explicitly, about disability. Enrollment limit of 20. (E) {H} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>AMS 253 Native Literacies to 1880 </P>

<P>This course explores the meaning and use of writing—in many forms— within Native communities in the Americas. We challenge the conventional understanding of writing by examining texts not usually considered as such— like hieroglyphic codices, wampum belts, khipu, and winter counts—alongside poetry, sermons, memoirs and treaties. To facilitate this work, the course is arranged thematically by tribe, technology, or text, rather than chronology, allowing us to deepen our knowledge about the peoples and histories concerned each week. In addition, we immerse ourselves in current-day debates over language study, textual recovery, cultural heritage and scholarly ethics.

<P>AMS 302 Seminar: The Material Culture of New England, 1630–1860 </P>

<P>This seminar examines the material culture of everyday life in New England from the earliest colonial settlements to the Victorian era. It introduces students to the growing body of material culture studies and the ways in which historic landscapes, architecture, furniture, textiles, metalwork, ceramics, foodways and domestic environments are interpreted as cultural documents and as historical evidence. Offered on-site at Historic Deerfield (with transportation available from the Smith campus), the course offers students a unique opportunity to study the museum’s world-famous collections in a hands-on, interactive setting with curators and historians. Utilizing the disciplines of history, art and architectural history, anthropology, and archaeology, we explore the relationships between objects and ideas and the ways in which items of material culture both individually and collectively convey patterns of everyday life.

<P>Culture and Catastrophe </P>

<P>According to a growing number of social theorists and scientists, the critical task of our time is to grasp the environmental conditions, economic systems, technological developments, and political ideologies that have set us on a path to converging and compounding catastrophes: climate change, resource exhaustion, inequality, social fragmentation, and political repression.  This course begins by examining how these conditions have shaped American culture, and asks why news broadcasts, the entertainment industry, and social media so often respond to crises with distraction, diversion, disinformation, fear-mongering, and scapegoating.  We explore the efforts of artists and activists to devise expressive forms (in visual arts, fiction, poetry, essays, movies, music) to constructively confront social and environmental hazards. {H} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Performing Deviant Bodies </P>

<P>This course examines how individuals whose bodies deviate from privileged norms in U.S. culture-whether because of race, gender, sexuality or disability-put their bodies on display.  We define non-normative embodiment broadly; though, since embodied differences are very often linked to disability in some way, this course heavily  discusses embodiment through different conceptions of disablement, health, illness or fitness.  We investigate how and why disabled or chronically ill authors so frequently engage theatrical genres, are we look at how their texts function both artistically ad politically.  The overarching questions that guide our discussions of the course are: How does one move through the world in a body marked as non-normal?  How does one perform non-normative embodiment in daily life, or in more traditional performance genres like drama or film? {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Internship at the Smithsonian</P>

<Sect>
<H1>Institution </H1>

<P>To enable qualified students to examine, under the tutelage of outstanding scholars, some of the finest collections of materials relating to the development of culture in America, the American Studies Program offers a one-semester internship at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The academic program consists of a seminar taught by a scholar at the Smithsonian, a tutorial on research methods and a research project under the supervision of a Smithsonian staff member. The project is worth eight credits. Research projects have dealt with such topics as the northward migration of blacks, women in various sports, a history of Western Union, Charles Willson Peale’s letters, the rise of modernism in American art and the use of infant baby formula in the antebellum South. </P>

<P>Interns pay tuition and fees to Smith College but pay for their own room and board in Washington. Financial aid, if any, continues as if the student were residing in Northampton. </P>

<P>The program takes place during the fall semester. It is not limited to American studies majors. Students majoring in art, history, sociology, anthropology, religion and economics are especially encouraged to apply. Those in project-related disciplines (e.g., art history) may consult their advisers about the possibility of earning credit toward the major for work done on the internship. Applications are available at the beginning of the second semester. </P>

<P>Exhibiting Culture: An Introduction to Museum Studies in America. This seminar examines the history, functions and meanings of museums in society, focusing primarily on the art museum in the United States. Drawing on the ever-growing literature on museology, we look critically at the ways that museums—through their policies, programs, architecture and exhibitions— can define regional or national values, shape cultural attitudes and identities, and influence public opinion about both current and historical events. As the course is concerned with both theory and practice, and the intersection of the two, we make use of the rich resources of the Smithsonian as well as other museums in Washington, D.C. Class discussion is balanced with behind-thescenes visits/field trips to museums, where we speak with dedicated professionals who are engaged in innovative and often challenging work in the nation’s capital.

<P>Requirements: Eight courses in anthropology including Introduction to Cultural Anthropology (130), History of Anthropological Theory (233) and Colloquium in Anthropology (200), preferably taken in the sophomore year, and a Smith anthropology seminar. Three additional courses for the major may be in anthropology or in fields linked to the student’s anthropological interests, such as language, math or science with approval of adviser. Students must show a competency in a foreign language equivalent to four semesters of college-level courses. A maximum of two language courses may count toward the three additional courses for the major. Students who wish to focus their major in biological anthropology may replace the language requirement with two courses in mathematics (M) or natural science (N) if the courses serve as an essential foundation for advanced work in this subfield and they are above the 100 level. Any alternative for the language requirement should be developed in consultation with an adviser and must be part of an overall plan of studies approved by the entire department. </P>

<P>Students majoring in anthropology are encouraged to consider an academic program abroad during their junior year. In the past, majors have spent a term or year in Chile, China, Costa Rica, Ecuador, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Senegal and South Africa. Students planning to study abroad should take at least one but preferably two courses in anthropology during the sophomore year. Students should discuss their study abroad plans with advisers, particularly if they wish to do a special studies or senior thesis upon their return. </P>

<P>ANT 135 Introduction to Archaeology </P>

<P>Same as ARC 135. This course studies past cultures and societies through their material remains and explores how archaeologists use different field methods, analytical technique and theoretical approaches to investigate, reconstruct and learn from the past. Data from settlement surveys, site excavations and artifact analysis are used to address economic, social, political and ideological questions across time and space. This course is taught from an anthropological perspective, exploring key transitions in human prehistory, including the origins of food production, social inequality and state-level societies across the globe. Relevance of archaeological practice in modern political, economic and social contexts is explored. Limited to first-year students and sophomores. Enrollment limited to 30. {N} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ANT 220 Collecting the Past: Art and Artifacts of the Ancient Americas </P>

<P>This course is not taught on the Smith College campus. Same as ANT 216 at Mount Holyoke College and ANT 220 at Amherst College. Early European explorers, modern travelers, collectors, curators and archaeologists have contributed to the development of ancient Latin American collections in museums across the globe. This course traces the history of these collecting practices and uses recent case studies to demonstrate how museums negotiate—successfully and unsuccessfully—the competing interests of scholars, donors, local communities and international law. Students learn how archaeologists study a variety of artifact types within museum collections and have the opportunity to conduct independent research projects using pre-Columbian pottery and textile collections from the Mead Museum at Amherst College.

<P>ANT 221 Archaeological Method, Theory and Practice </P>

<P>This course focuses on the theoretical foundations of archaeological research, the variety of methods available to analyze material culture, the interpretation of results, and ethical considerations of practicing archaeology in the United States and abroad. The course provides students with a solid foundation for evaluating and contextualizing current methodological and theoretical trends within archaeology. Case studies illustrate the diversity of archaeological thought, interdisciplinary approaches to studying material culture, and innovative directions in the field of anthropological archaeology. Discussions of practice address the roles and responsibilities of archaeologists in heritage management, museum development, and community outreach. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ANT 223 In Sickness and in Health: Biopolitics, Public Health, and Medicine in East Asia </P>

<P>Same as EAS 223. What happens when states focus on their citizen’s potential productivity and discipline to serve the interests of the nation? Biopolitics or the regulation and optimization of populations relies on biomedicine, science, statistics, laws, and policies to ensure the health and future of the nation. Using an anthropological lens the course examines how trajectories of East Asian history, politics, and science intersect with health in our globally connected futures. From SARS, AIDS, and Avian Flu, the dynamics of public health and medicine in East Asia offer an opportunity to develop insights into the relations between states, populations, and citizens.

<P>ANT 224 Anthropos in the Anthropocene: Human-Environment Relations in a Time of Ecological Crisis </P>

<P>Same as ENV 224. Anthropology seeks to understand human life in all its complexity, but what constitutes “the human” is far from straightforward. This course examines the changing ways that “Anthropos” is being understood in an era of rapid global climate change and our planet’s sixth mass extinction event, both driven by human activities. We review perspectives on the relationship between humans and their environment from various cultural perspectives, considering how they engage notions of race, class, and gender, and what they imply for nature conservation. Topics include modernity, pets, cyborgs, kinship, symbiosis, extinction, species invasions, settler colonialism, and the Anthropocene concept. Enrollment limit of 30. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ANT 226 Archaeology of Food </P>

<P>This course explores (1) how and why humans across the globe began to domesticate plant and animal resources approximately 10,000 years ago, and </P>

<P>(2) new directions in the archaeology of food across time and space. The first part of the semester focuses on the types of archaeological data and analytical methods used to understand the “agricultural revolution.” Case studies from both centers and noncenters of domestication are used to investigate the biological, economic and social implications of changing foodways. During the remainder of the semester, emphasis is placed on exploring a number of food-related topics within archaeology, such as the relationship between agriculture and sedentism, food and gender, the politics of feasting, and methods for integrating archaeological and ethnographic approaches to the study of food across the globe. This course is also offered at Mount Holyoke College in fall 2018 (ANT 216). {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ANT 229 Africa and the Environment </P>

<P>In Western discourses, African environments are defined by violence, famine, and degradation—symptoms of African cultures that resist Western values such as private property, democracy, and environmentalism. This course encourages students to think critically about such portrayals by learning about specific environments in Africa and how humans have interacted with them across time. The syllabus is anchored in cultural anthropology, but includes units on human evolution, the origins and spread of pastoralism, the history of colonial conservation science, and more. Topics covered include gender, race, land grabbing, indigenous knowledge, the commons, the “cattle complex,” desertification, oil, dams, and nationalism. {H} {N} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ANT 234 Culture, Power and Politics </P>

<P>This course is a general introduction to anthropological analysis of politics and the political. Through a broad survey of anthropological texts and theories, we explore what an ethnographic perspective can offer to our understandings of power and government. Special emphasis is placed on the role of culture, symbols and social networks in the political life of local communities. Examples are drawn from a number of case studies in Africa, East Asia, Latin America and the United States, and range in scale from studies of local politics in small-scale societies to analyses of nationalism and political performance in modern nation-states.

<P>ANT 252 The City and the Countryside in China </P>

<P>With more than 80 percent of its population based in rural areas, China is usually viewed as a primarily agrarian society. However, economic reforms in the past 20 years have brought about dramatic growth in China’s urban areas. This course examines the conceptualization of urban and rural China in terms of political and economic processes and social relations from the Communist revolution in 1949 to the present day. Against this background, the course explores how broader social theoretical concerns with concepts such as tradition/modernity and state/society have been taken up in the anthropology of China. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Death, the “supreme and final crisis of life” (Malinowski), calls for collective understandings and communal responses. What care is due to the dying? What indicates that death has occurred? How is the corpse to be handled? The course uses ethnographic and historical sources to indicate how human communities have answered these questions, and to determine just how unusual are the circumstances surrounding dying in the contemporary Western world.

<P>ANT 317 Seminar: The Anthropology of Landscape—Space, Place, Nature </P>

<P>Landscapes have long figured as a backdrop for anthropological studies, but recently the landscape has emerged as an object of deeper interest. From abandoned city blocks in Detroit, the shores of Walden Pond, the savannas of Eastern Africa, or the Chernobyl exclusion zone, landscapes are potent social and material phenomena. In this course, we explore theories of landscape from different disciplinary perspectives, and then use them to think through the ways that landscapes present themselves to anthropologists and their subjects. Topics include post-industry, colonial gardens, the US “West,” invasive species, environmental racism, time, capitalism, cartography and counter-mapping, and environmental conservation.

<P>Ethnographic Writing </P>

<P>Anthropological writing must convey the life-worlds of people and the textures of ethnographic encounters and fieldwork, and engage with and refine anthropological theories. How can writing do all of this at once? And as we craft a narrative, what do we leave out? Do we really describe ethnographic “reality” or do we create anthropological fictions? Why then do we look to ethnographic accounts to understand societies and cultures? Anthropological writing has dealt with these questions and more since its inception but most profoundly since the 1980s. In this class, we read pieces that reflect on and innovate with writing as anthropological praxis, the doubts that have riddled it and the larger developments these doubts have engendered around issues of fact versus fiction, representation, narrative style, writing as a form of political action and the creation of knowledge. We also workshop ethnographic writing in class to observe these tensions in our own work, understand them as rites in the creation of anthropological knowledge and work through them to craft anthropological narratives. </P>

<P>Biopower, Biopolitics, and Governance </P>

<P>The obesity epidemic, personalized cancer treatments, and the commercialization of surrogate pregnancy represent manifestations of Foucault's conception of biopower or the regulation of the lives of individuals and populations.  While institutions like law, medicine, and public health can make visible state interests in bodies and population, more indirect social processes operate to the same ends.  For example, advertising and consumer products indirectly shape norms and ideals convergent with government interests.  This seminar explores the workings and limitations of biopower, biopolitics, and governance through case studies drawn from anthropology. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Traditional Chinese Medicine: Transformations and Transitions in China, Japan and the U.S. </P>

<P>With a history of over 4,000 years, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is often perceived as a timeless, unchanging medical tradition. TCM, however, has undergone numerous transitions and transformations throughout its history. TCM has also traveled throughout the world where its principles and theories have been adopted in the development of medical systems in Japan and Korea among others. In the past 30 years, TCM has gained increasing popularity and credibility in the U.S. and Europe. This course examines how Traditional Chinese Medicine, much as any medical system of theory and practice, responds to historical and contemporary social, economic and political forces within China and in countries such as Japan and the U.S. Students explore the broad question as to what constitutes TCM through time and across cultures as a means to better understand the processes of translation and transformation of theories, beliefs and practices in different cultural, political, economic and social contexts.

<P>Anthropology and Medical Ethics </P>

<P>This seminar asks what medical anthropology can contribute to the study and practice of medical ethics. We begin with a historical overview and introduce the field’s core vocabulary and theoretical paradigms. We then turn to the role of the social sciences in the evolving discussion of medical ethics, noting the late engagement of medical anthropology. A core question is whether there is a meaningful distinction between an anthropology of medical ethics and an anthropology in medical ethics. Students select a medical ethics issue to explore in depth, with the goal of determining the sociocultural context that has shaped the way the issue is framed. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The Anthropology of Multiculturalism </P>

<P>In the United States, the idea of multiculturalism has come to symbolize the right of communities with distinct cultures to maintain their own ways of living in a diverse national society. Similar politics of difference have developed in other countries in the world. But is multiculturalism the same idea in every national context? How do the different histories of countries in North or South America, Europe, Asia or Africa influence the way that these different national multiculturalisms develop? How do trans-national trends in the politics of culture and diversity get adapted to work in these different contexts? The course will focus on specific historic and ethnographic studies that document the relationship between the culture and history of different national and local communities and trends of contemporary multicultural traditions. A range of readings will introduce general topics which students will apply to specific contexts for their own research. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

Demanding respect for minority languages, and promoting their use in daily life or mass media, becomes especially important in cases where language loss is associated with forced cultural assimilation or different forms of discrimination. In this seminar, each student develops a case study of language rights issues based on a particular language or language group. Topics can include the politics of bilingual education, the representation of minority languages in different media, the relationship to language and human rights, and the practical work of language revitalization. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

The course provides students with a solid foundation for evaluating and contextualizing current methodological and theoretical trends within archaeology. Case studies illustrate the diversity of archaeological thought, interdisciplinary approaches to studying material culture, and innovative directions in the field of anthropological archaeology. Discussions of practice address the roles and responsibilities of archaeologists in heritage management, museum development, and community outreach. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Prehistory of Food </P>

<P>This course explores how and why humans across the globe began to domesticate plant and animal resources approximately 10,000 years ago. The first half of the course presents the types of archaeological data and analytical methods used to study the “agricultural revolution.” The second half examines case studies from the major centers of domestication in order to investigate the biological, economic and social implications of these processes. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the relationship between agriculture and sedentism, food and gender, the politics of feasting, and methods for integrating archaeological and ethnographic approaches to the study of food. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ARH 204 Art and Architecture of the Ancient Americas </P>

<P>What is “antiquity” in the Americas? This class explores this question by focusing upon pre-Hispanic visual culture. We cross both Mesoamerica and the Andes, giving particular attention to the Aztecs, Inka and Maya. Along with architecture, textiles, ceramics and sculpted works, we consider current debates in art history and archaeology. Among the themes we discuss: sacrifice and rulership, representations of human and deified beings, the symbolic and economic meanings of materials, and the ethics of excavation and museum display.

<P>ARH 207 Translating New Worlds </P>

<P>This course investigates how New World explorations were translated into visual and material culture. Focusing upon geographies, ‘anthropologies,' material objects, and pictorial and written records, we analyze how travel to and through the Americas reshaped the lives of consumers and thinkers—from food and finery (corn, chocolate, red dye, gold and silver) to published narratives and collections of objects made in the colonial Americas. Case studies are drawn from Canada, Mexico, Peru, the Great Plains of the United States and the Hawai’ian Islands. In addition to initial colonial contacts, we discuss current cultural practices—material, imagined, factual or fantastical—that arose from the first encounters, conquests and settlements.

<P>This course explores many different aspects of life in the cities and sanctuaries of the ancient Near East, Egypt, Greece, Etruria and Rome. Recurrent themes include urbanism, landscapes and patterns of worship, including initiation, sacrifice and pilgrimage. We probe how modern notions of the secular and the sacred influence interpretation and how sometimes the seemingly most anomalous features of the worship of Isis or of the juxtaposition of commercial and domestic space within a city can potentially prove to be the most revealing about life in another place and time.

<P>Swords and S(c)andals: Ancient Rome in Film/Form </P>

<P>Since the beginning of cinema, the decadence of the ancient Romans has been a subject of fascination. Starting with HBO's Rome (2005–2007) and Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), we'll explore the multiple sources of the visual tropes used to construct this universe and seek to analyze it in aesthetic, historical, and ideological terms. Their twentieth-century counterparts from films of the silent era to Hollywood epics like Spartacus (1960) and Cleopatra (1963) as well as cult classics like Caligula (1979) will be scrutinized in order to gain an understanding of how the Romans functioned cinematically as cultural signs in varying historical contexts.

<P>The Beauty of Beasts in the Ancient Roman World </P>

<P>From animal fables, to pets, to heroic named beasts who died in the amphitheater, the visual culture of the ancient Roman world was filled with images of animals. Dogs, cats, birds, asses, elephants, lions, tigers, leopards and myriad others appear in contexts from luxury villas to funerary monuments. Utilizing the lens of interdisciplinary animals studies we explore how the Romans thought with animals representationally in ways which may initially seem familiar but prove to be distinctively different in culturally specific ways. Considering how the human/animal binary works in a past culture has the potential to reveal something about how systems of knowledge and power are structured and maintained.

The Silk Roads, long distance networks that allowed people, goods, technology, religious beliefs and other ideas to travel between China, India and Rome/Mediterranean, and the many points in between, developed against the backdrop of the rise and fall of steppe nomadic empires in Inner Asia. We examine these as interrelated phenomena that shaped Eurasian encounters to the rise of the world-conquering Mongols and the journey of Marco Polo. Topics include: horses, Silk and Steppe routes, Scythians and Huns, Han China and Rome, Byzantium, Buddhism, Christianity and other universal religions, Arabs and the rise of Islam, Turks, Mongol Empire, and medieval European trade, geography and travel. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>HST 203 (L) Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic World </P>

<P>The career and conquests of Alexander the Great (d. 323 B.C.) wrought far-reaching consequences for many in Europe, Asia and Africa. In the ensuing Hellenistic (Greek-oriented) commonwealth that spanned the Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia and India, Greco-Macedonians interacted with Egyptians, Babylonians, Jews, Iranians, Indians and Romans in ways that galvanized ideas and institutions such as the classical city as ideal community, cult of divine kings and queens, “fusion” literatures, mythologies and artistic canons and also provoked nativist responses such as the Maccabean revolt. Main topics include Greeks and “barbarians,” Alexander and his legacies, Hellenism as ideal and practice, conquerors and natives, kings and cities/regions, Greek science and philosophies, old and new gods. This course provides context for understanding early Christianity, Judaism and the rise of Rome. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

With Emperor Augustus, the traditional Republican form of rule was reshaped to accommodate the personal rule of an Emperor that governed a multiethnic empire of 50 million successfully for several centuries. Imperial Rome represents the paradigmatic classical empire that many later empires sought to emulate. We trace how this complex imperial society evolved to meet different challenges. Topics include: the emperor and historical writings, corruption of power, bread and circuses, assimilation and revolts, the Jewish war, universal and local religions, early Christianity, Late Antiquity, migrations and the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. This course offers context for understanding the history of Christianity, Judaism and the early Middle Ages. </P>

<P>Members of the Archives Advisory Committee serve as advisers to students in approving course selections and internships. </P>

<P>The archives concentration is designed to make our local, regional, national and international histories public through research projects and professional training. Through a combination of academic coursework, practical experience and independent research projects, students learn about the institutions and repositories that shape knowledge and understanding of our collective pasts through the collection, preservation, interpretation and display of artifacts, manuscripts and representation of historic sites. The concentration creates an interdisciplinary community of students engaged in first-hand use of primary sources in the arts and architecture, medicine, law, history, social activism, the histories of institutions, communities and professional organizations. Through a sequence of courses, students gain knowledge of the theory and practice of archives and public history methods through which these materials are shaped into compelling narratives. Through practical experiences in two internships, students learn about archival acquisition, processing and description skills, and building finding aids that make collections available for scholarly use. Students in disciplines in which archival research is already featured (such as history, American studies, and the study of women and gender) as well as in the sciences and a wide array of social sciences are encouraged to apply. </P>

<P>Declaring the Plan B major A student may declare a Plan B major any time after she has completed the introductory (100 level) studio art requirements and one additional studio art course. She must present a portfolio of work to the Portfolio Review Committee. Portfolios will be reviewed each semester, just before the advising period. Students who receive a negative evaluation will be encouraged to take an additional studio course or courses, and resubmit their portfolio at a subsequent review time. Students who receive a negative evaluation may resubmit their portfolios in subsequent reviews up to and including the last portfolio review available during their sophomore year. These students will be offered suggestions for strengthening their portfolios through additional studio coursework in the same or other media represented in the portfolio. The additional studio courses will count toward fulfilling the major requirements. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Mapping the Plan B major Upon receiving a positive portfolio evaluation, a student should select and meet with a Plan B adviser. Together they will discuss her interests and review her studio work to date, and select an area of studio in which she will concentrate. In exceptional cases the student and her adviser may design a sequence of studio courses that draws from several areas of concentration. </P>

<P>This course explores how art and architecture have profoundly shaped visual experiences and shifting understandings of the past and present. Featuring different case studies, each section includes work with original objects, site visits and writings about art. Unifying themes include: (1) materials, techniques and the patterns deployed to create space; (2) the design, function and symbolism of images and monuments; (3) artistic production and its relation to individual and institutional patronage, religion, politics and aesthetics; (4) issues turning on artists’ fame versus anonymity, and uniqueness versus reproducibility; (5) cross-cultural exchanges.

<P>ARH 200 China in Expansion </P>

<P>During the formative periods when the local and global forces simultaneously took actions in shaping Chinese civilization, the functions of images and objects, the approaches to things, and the discourses around art underwent significant shifts, not only responding to but also mapping out the “Chineseness” in visual and material culture. This course of early Chinese art investigates diverse media—bronze vessels, sculptures, murals, textiles, architecture and other visual and material forms—in relation to political and military conquest, cross-cultural exchange, the dissemination of ordinary practices, and the formation of identities. Key terms/issues for the course will include expansion, connection, and materiality. Group A, Counts for ARU </P>

<P>ARH 204 Art and Architecture of the Ancient Americas </P>

<P>What is “antiquity” in the Americas? This class explores this question by focusing upon pre-Hispanic visual culture. We cross both Mesoamerica and the Andes, giving particular attention to the Aztecs, Inka and Maya. Along with architecture, textiles, ceramics and sculpted works, we consider current debates in art history and archaeology. Among the themes we discuss: sacrifice and rulership, representations of human and deified beings, the symbolic and economic meanings of materials, and the ethics of excavation and museum display.

<P>ARH 207 Translating New Worlds </P>

<P>This course investigates how New World explorations were translated into visual and material culture. Focusing upon geographies, ‘anthropologies,' material objects, and pictorial and written records, we analyze how travel to and through the Americas reshaped the lives of consumers and thinkers—from food and finery (corn, chocolate, red dye, gold and silver) to published narratives and collections of objects made in the colonial Americas. Case studies are drawn from Canada, Mexico, Peru, the Great Plains of the United States and the Hawai’ian Islands. In addition to initial colonial contacts, we discuss current cultural practices—material, imagined, factual or fantastical—that arose from the first encounters, conquests and settlements.

<P>This course explores many different aspects of life in the cities and sanctuaries of the ancient Near East, Egypt, Greece, Etruria and Rome. Recurrent themes include urbanism, landscapes and patterns of worship, including initiation, sacrifice and pilgrimage. We probe how modern notions of the secular and the sacred influence interpretation and how sometimes the seemingly most anomalous features of the worship of Isis or of the juxtaposition of commercial and domestic space within a city can potentially prove to be the most revealing about life in another place and time.

From prints ridiculing the French king to photographic reports of military conflicts in the British empire, stylistic innovations introduced by avant-garde painters to the demise of state-sponsored art institutions, this course explores how change happens in art, in society, and their relationship to one another. Through the study of Goya, the Pre-Raphaelites and Eiffel Tower, among other examples, we work to develop sophisticated definitions of “modernity” and “modernism,” key concepts in the study of 19- and 20th-century art.

<P>Modernism was an architectural phenomenon of the 20th century that promised to express and realize the modern experience. However, controversy has surrounded this architectural movement from its inception to the present. This class investigates some of the major points of debate, such as what Modernism means and to whom, who can implement it and where, and what constitutes its design. Through a global perspective we investigate the complexities and contradictions of Modernism, as well as the way it intersects with such issues as colonialism, postcolonialism, nationalism, global commerce, the Cold War and personal identity.

<P>This course examines the intersection between the visual arts and games in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We examine theories of play and their relationship with both visual art and game design. We approach this topic from two directions. First, by asking how the visual arts have represented games and game playing and how they have utilized the mechanics of game play. Second, by asking how games function as works of art, and how game aesthetics touch on mechanics, narrative and visual representation. Case studies include modern art and sport; war games; video art, video games. Group B  {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The Beauty of Beasts in the Ancient Roman World </P>

<P>From animal fables, to pets, to heroic named beasts who died in the amphitheater, the visual culture of the ancient Roman world was filled with images of animals. Dogs, cats, birds, asses, elephants, lions, tigers, leopards and myriad others appear in contexts from luxury villas to funerary monuments. Utilizing the lens of interdisciplinary animals studies we explore how the Romans thought with animals representationally in ways which may initially seem familiar but prove to be distinctively different in culturally specific ways. Considering how the human/animal binary works in a past culture has the potential to reveal something about how systems of knowledge and power are structured and maintained.

It also unravels the constant re-appropriation of the “archaic” medium. The course embraces art works in various media—paintings, calligraphy, books, woodblock prints, installation, performance, and animation—that were created by premodern and modern artists. Sessions will be organized both thematically and according to a rough chronological sequence. Group A, B {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Age of Louis XIV </P>

<P>An examination of the fundamental role of the visual arts in fashioning an extraordinary and indelible image of rulership during the reign (1643–1715) of Louis XIV. Ensembles and individual objects in many media—painting, sculpture, architecture, landscape design, prints, illustrated books, furniture, tapestries, numismatics, works commissioned or obtained in Rome, and literary production—will be related to the centralized bureaucracy that came to define the French state. Time permitting, we shall briefly consider the impact of the palace of Versailles on other European courts. Group A {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Interpreting Images: Northern European Art, 1400–1550 </P>

<P>How do we make sense of works of visual representation and conceptualize what we see? What analytical tools and methodological assumptions guide and shape our acts of interpretation? These questions will inform our in-depth study of a select group of major Northern Renaissance paintings. Artists range from Van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden to Dürer and Bosch while weekly readings draw on a variety of approaches in order to introduce the full spectrum of art historical interventions, from formal and social analysis to more recent perspectives on gender and the global turn.Prerequisite: ARH 110 Art and Its Histories, or permission of the instructor.

<P>From Eyes to I: The Art of Portraiture </P>

<P>A major artistic genre, portraiture invites us to examine historically changing notions of identity, personal and collective, private and public. Within a broad time span (antiquity to contemporary practices), the main focus is on Western paintings created between 1400 and 1900. Through the combined study of visual examples and art historical approaches, we explore such issues as: strategies of self-fashioning; tensions between norm and individuality, realism and idealization; the roles of portraits and self-portraits in cementing social roles and manufacturing gendered bodies.

<P>History of European Decorative Arts, 1400-1800 </P>

<P>Costly raw materials and boundlessly creative workmanship were deployed to fashion and acquire cameos and engraved gems, ceramics, clothing, embroidery, enamel, furniture, ivory, jewelry, luxuriously bound manuscripts and printed books, medals, metalwork and tapestries, among other objects. This course examines these and other “minor” arts with an eye toward reconstructing their rich cultural, symbolic and aesthetic charge; their role in the conduct of diplomacy and statecraft; and original contexts of production, marketing, patronage, use, collecting and display. Recommended background: one course in European art from the period 1400 to 1800. Group A {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>What motivated individuals and corporate bodies to collect and display varieties of objects, works of art among them, and how did those paired activities forge social identities, generate fascination, and productively frame knowledge of the world? Among the topics considered are the indissoluble Plinian link between art and nature on the one hand, and cabinets of curiosities (Kunst- und Wunderkammern) on the other; the art market; the design of purpose-built galleries, museums, and libraries; the illustrated recording or publication of renowned collections (&quot;paper museums&quot;); the nineteenth-century foundation (or reconstitution) of national and municipal art collections.

<P>Swords and S(c)andals: Ancient Rome in Film/Form </P>

<P>Since the beginning of cinema, the decadence of the ancient Romans has been a subject of fascination. Starting with HBO's Rome (2005-2007) and Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), we'll explore the multiple sources of the visual tropes used to construct this universe and seek to analyze it in aesthetic, historical, and ideological terms. Their twentieth-century counterparts from films of the silent era to Hollywood epics like Spartacus (1960) and Cleopatra (1963) as well as cult classics like Caligula (1979) will be scrutinized in order to gain an understanding of how the Romans functioned cinematically as cultural signs in varying historical contexts.

<P>Monsters and Marvels in Medieval Art </P>

<P>Dog-headed, chest-faced, one-footed, the “monstrous races” were believed to dwell at the edges of the known world. By lack, excess, or hybrid permutations, they unsettled the boundaries between the human, the animal, and the monstrous, opening up a creative space for the deployment of the marvelous, written as well as visual. Broad questions about cultural identity and alterity are examined through the prism of case studies that draw on a broad range of sources, from illuminated manuscripts, sculpted works, world maps to encyclopedias and travel accounts.

<P>Why Impressionism? Autopsy of an Art Historical, Commercial, and Curatorial Obsession </P>

<P>This course seeks to unravel the critical, scholarly, commercial and curatorial trends that contributed to making Impressionism one of the most well-researched and revered movements in art history. Readings, class discussion and assignments juxtapose different, sometimes conflicting, interpretations of artworks, highlighting how these reflect intellectual and ethical assumptions about what matters most in art—and, by extension, society in general. From formal analysis to more recent art historical approaches, informed by gender and sexuality studies, our investigation brings us to consider the merits and limitations of studying the ‘‘canon’’ and what, if anything, remains to be said about Impressionism.

We also compare later innovations from Labrouste’s Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris to Snøhetta’s award-winning 2002 Bibliotheca Alexandrina on the site of the ancient library, to Maya Lin’s renovation of Neilson Library in analyzing how the buildings themselves make systems of knowledge manifest.

<P>Constitutional limits on monarchical power, the embrace of Protestantism, religious intolerance and fanaticism, revolution and regicide, and a much vaunted (when not exaggerated and misleading) insularity, set the stage in England for patterns of patronage and a relationship to the visual arts both similar to and significantly different from modes established in Continental absolutist courts. While critically examining the perennial notion of &quot;the Englishness of English art,&quot; we shall study the careers of the painters, printmakers, sculptors, architects, and landscape designers whose collective efforts made English art, at long last, one to be reckoned with. </P>

<P>Art and Natural History: Beasts and Bestiaries, c.1250 – c.1650 </P>

<P>Bridging the gap between the history of art and the history of science, the manuscript and the print age, the medieval and early modern periods, this seminar interrogates the creative ways in which the writing of natural history was entwined with visual representation. It focuses on bestiaries or treatises on animals, the genre from which modern zoology would emerge. Themes include the depiction of animals; classifications of the animal kingdom; the collecting of animals in menageries and of animal parts in cabinets of curiosity. Part of the course will be taught in the Mortimer Rare Book Room. It welcomes students interested in art history, the history of science, the history of ideas, Medieval and Renaissance studies.

<P>The Song dynasty has been celebrated as China’s golden age and the peak of Chinese painting. Monumental landscapes, meticulous depictions of birds and flowers, and graceful figures, all seemingly born from direct observations of the real world, have been seen as an embodiment of political ideals at court and a forum for personal expression among literati. This seminar will explore the historical formation and aesthetic development of these genres, examine the complexities of Song visual experience, and investigate the degree to which the period shaped the artistic tradition of China down to the twentieth century. {A} </P>

Among the topics we consider are interpretive work in the field of “colonial studies,” the mapping and construction of colonial spaces, exchanges that brought people and objects into contact (and conflict) with one another, how colonialism can shape the meaning of objects, and the nationalist histories of colonial projects. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

What role has gender played in shaping dominant understandings of private and public spheres? What role does space play in defining socially acceptable and unacceptable sexual relationships? Finally, how is our understanding of these issues informed by depictions of gender, sexuality and the built environment in painting, photography and film? {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ARS 280 Introduction to Architectural Design Studio: Analog Processes—Ground </P>

<P>In nurturing architecture’s foundational principles of visual, material, and conceptual experimentation, ARS 280 lays the foundation for subsequent studios, lifelong learning, and curiosity for architectural design processes. It probes the material, organizational, and spatial qualities of the ground—a shared horizontal territory inhabited by plants, people, and buildings—one that is as much cultural as it is natural. Through iterative and analog processes, students integrate drawing and making to construct and reconstruct lines in the ground. Probing the physical and conceptual ground for natural or constructed patterns, students develop foundation-level design skills within the context of larger environmental and cultural discourses. A required fee of $75 to cover group-supplied materials and/or printing is charged at the time of registration. Prerequisite: ARH 110 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limited to 15. </P>

<P>The arts and technology minor engages students and faculty from across the campus and from all three academic divisions. The emphasis is on arts plural, including art, music, dance, theater and film, and on technology broadly conceived, including computer science, engineering, mathematics and statistics, physics, and other interested departments. </P>

<P>This interdisciplinary minor provides students with a strong foundation in media arts and technology studies, while laying the groundwork for more advanced work in this area. Two primary strengths of the minor are the broad range of topics and approaches to which students are exposed, and the individualized nature of each student’s trajectory through the minor. The field of arts and technology is by nature diverse and rapidly changing, and therefore requires broad exposure, as well as self-direction and high motivation from the student. With careful and attentive advising, our students are able to navigate this complex field successfully, while developing the background and experience necessary for more advanced work. </P>

<P>Although each student’s path through the minor is unique, all students must meet certain core requirements. The requirements entail six courses structured into three layers: a specific foundational level, a flexible intermediate level and a culminating Special Studies. Students take one or more of the foundation-level courses to discover how technology is employed in various fields of art, to experience the process of art critique and to identify the areas of creativity in which they are interested. The intermediate-level courses provide a progressive interdisciplinary structure that guides students to embrace at least two disciplines, at increasingly advanced levels of artistic and technological stages. The sixth course is a Special Studies the student designs with her advisers. There are many exciting possibilities, including collaborations with other students, and venues for performance, exhibitions, demonstrations and publications. </P>

How do scientists, decision makers and the public communicate with each other, and how can scientists do better at it? What should the role of scientists be in advocacy and social movements? How does scientific information influence lifestyle and behavior choices among the public at large? We focus on three topics with close ties to astronomy: (1) global climate change, which involves basic atmospheric physics; (2) light pollution, which wastes billions of dollars per year and ruins our view of the starry sky without providing the safety it promises; and (3) controversial development of mountaintop observations such as the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea, HI. Throughout the course we will develop science communication skills using proven techniques borrowed from theater.

</Sect>

<P>Prehealth Professional Programs </P>

<P>Students may prepare for health profession schools by majoring in any area, as long as they take courses that meet the minimum requirements for entrance. For most schools, these are two semesters each of English, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, math and biology. The science courses must include laboratories. The requirements for the biochemistry major include several of the courses necessary for entrance into health professional programs, making the major an excellent choice for students applying to programs in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy or veterinary medicine. Other courses often required or recommended include biochemistry, calculus and statistics, and social or behavioral science. Because health profession schools differ in the details of their requirements, students should confer with a prehealth adviser as early as possible about specific requirements. </P>

<P>Prehealth Professional Programs </P>

<P>Students may prepare for health profession schools by majoring in any area, as long as they take courses that meet the minimum requirements for entrance. For most schools, these are two semesters each of English, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics and biology. The science courses must include laboratories. Students should select biology courses in consultation with an adviser, taking into consideration the student’s major and specific interests in the health professions. Other courses often required or recommended include biochemistry, mathematics including calculus and/or statistics, and social or behavioral science. Because health profession schools differ in the details of their requirements, students should confer with a Prehealth adviser as early as possible about specific requirements. </P>

<P>Preparation for Graduate Study in the Biological Sciences </P>

<P>Graduate programs that grant advanced degrees in biology vary in their admission requirements, but often include at least one year of mathematics (preferably including statistics), physics, and organic chemistry. Many programs stress both broad preparation across the biological sciences and a strong background in a specific area. Many institutions require scores on the Graduate Record Examination, which emphasizes a broad foundation in biology as well as quantitative and verbal skills. Students contemplating graduate study beyond Smith should review the requirements of particular programs as early as possible in the course of their studies and seek advice from members of the department. </P>

<P>Application of Molecular Biology to the Study of Infectious Diseases </P>

<P>This seminar focuses on the study of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and parasitic and viral diseases that are of great concern in the public health community. The spread of diseases such as Ebola, Chikungunya, Dengue Fever, West Nile, SARS, avian influenza, malaria, river blindness and many other parasitic infections is also a worrisome trend. What can we learn from the great pandemics of the past (the great influenza of 1918, the Black Death of the Middle Ages, the typhus epidemic of 1914–21, and others)? How can modern biotechnology be applied to the development of new drugs and vaccines to prevent such pandemics in the future? In addition to natural infections, we now must also be concerned with rare diseases such as anthrax and smallpox that may be introduced to large populations by bioterrorism. The challenges are great but new tools of molecular biology (genomics, proteomics, RNA interference, next-generation sequencing and others) provide unprecedented opportunities to understand infectious diseases and to develop new strategies for their elimination.

<P>Hampshire College: Sue Darlington, Alan Hodder, Rafal Stepien Amherst College: Maria Heim, Sam Morse Mount Holyoke: Suzanne Mrozik, Ajay Sinha UMass Amherst: Stephen Miller, Reiko Sono </P>

<P>A minor in Buddhist studies is an excellent adjunct to majors in such fields as religion, philosophy, American studies, anthropology, art history, Asian studies, comparative literature, East Asian languages and literature, East Asian studies, and the study of women and gender. It allows for a deeper focus in Buddhism, offering an interdisciplinary complement to one’s major as well as an important credential for graduate admissions. Complete details about the Buddhist studies program are available at www.smith.edu/buddhism/ </P>

<P>Requirements </P>

<P>BUS 120 The Study of Buddhism is required of all Buddhist studies minors. The minor also requires 24 additional credit hours drawn from at least two disciplines, including anthropology, art history, literature, philosophy, religion and sociology, or others where appropriate, chosen in consultation with the minor adviser. Buddhist studies is interdisciplinary, and students must understand multiple approaches to the field in order to study it successfully. </P>

<P>Students should study Buddhism as it is practiced in at least two of the following four geographical areas: South and Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Tibeto-Himalayan region, and the West. Buddhism is constituted differently in different cultures, and it is important to understand this diversity in order to make sense of Buddhism's development and dissemination. </P>

<P>The minor should comprise study of both classical and contemporary Buddhism. The Buddhist tradition cannot be understood without an appreciation of its rich history and evolution. Nevertheless, any understanding of Buddhism would be incomplete without a sense of its contemporary manifestations and role in world culture. </P>

<P>No language study is required for the minor. A maximum of 8 credits towards the minor may be satisfied by the study of a language relevant to Buddhist studies (to be approved by the minor adviser). This language might be a canonical language, or a modern language that facilitates research in Buddhism. Buddhist studies relies on linguistic competence, and students who intend to pursue graduate studies in Buddhist studies are strongly encouraged to study languages. Credit for language will only be given for courses at the second-year level or above. </P>

<P>At least 8 credits in the minor must be taken at Smith; up to 12 credits of overseas study may be counted. The minor requires one seminar addressing a topic in Buddhist studies. </P>

<H1>Greek </H1>

<P>GRK 100Y Elementary Greek </P>

<P>A yearlong introduction to ancient Greek through the language of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the two 8th-century epics that represent the culmination of a long and rich tradition of oral poetry. The ancients regarded these poems as unparalleled masterpieces; the great tragedian Aeschylus called his own plays &quot;crumbs from Homer's table,&quot; and both epics have endured over the millennia and are still alive and relevant. Identity, love, seduction, loyalty, the tension between individualism and community, between home and adventure—these are some of the very human issues the Odyssey explores. Students will learn all the fundamentals of Greek vocabulary and grammar, and experience the joy of reading Homer's Odyssey in the original. Credits: 5 Rebecca Worsham </P>

<P>Normally offered each academic year </P>

<P>GRK 214 Greek Poetry of the Archaic Age </P>

<P>An exploration of the poetic masterpieces of the Archaic period. We will study some of the songs bards performed to the accompaniment of the lyre, stories of war, exile and homecoming, monsters and divinities, love and lust. Readings will be chosen from works such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days, the Homeric Hymns. </P>

May be repeated for credit, provided the topic is not the same. Prerequisite: 213 or permission of the instructor. </P>

<P>Herakles: Tragic Figure, Comic Boor </P>

<P>Herakles is a complex figure, always larger than life.  His superhuman strength and famous labors make him a benefactor of mankind and a model for Roman emperors and European princes over the centuries.  Yet that same strength coupled with an inability to control his temper or his urges make him in other instances a dangerous and violent brute.  In tragedy he is presented as the first hero to suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, while in comedy his outrageous animal appetites and crude behavior make him the butt of endless jokes. We will explore the transformations of Herakles in Attic tragedy and comedy, focusing on Euripides, Herakles; Sophocles, Trachiniai; selections from Aristophanes, Frogs.  {F} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department </P>

<H1>Latin </H1>

<P>LAT 100Y Elementary Latin </P>

<P>The Latin language has had an extraordinarily long life, from ancient Rome through the Middle Ages to nineteenth-century Europe, where is remained the language of scholarship and science. Even today it survives in the Romance languages that grew out of it and in the countless English words derived from Latin roots. This course prepares students to read Latin texts in any period or area of interest through a study of the fundamentals of classical Latin grammar and through practice in reading from a range of Latin authors. Some attention will also be given to Roman culture and Latin literary history. This is a full-year course and cannot be divided at midyear with credit for the first semester. Enrollment limited to 30. Credits: 5 </P>

<P>The World of Nero </P>

<P>The last of the heirs of Augustus, the emperor Nero (37-68 AD) has been regarded as a deranged tyrant, a savvy populist, and a pre-cursor to the stars of modern reality television, with the attendant confusion of fact and fiction. Through reading in both Latin and English translation, this course will examine the main ancient literary sources for Nero's reign, with a focus on two very different responses from the artists in his circle: the Stoic resistance of Lucan (de Bello Civili) and the exuberant resignation of Petronius (Satyricon). Some attention to the &quot;afterlife,&quot; including at the movies, of the Roman figure who became, fairly or not, a watchword for decline. {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Sixty percent of all English words are derived from Greek and Latin roots, yet most speakers of English are unaware of the origins and true meaning (&quot;etymology&quot;) of the words they use to communicate with others every day. This course aims to fill that gap, with an eye to sharpening and expanding English vocabulary and enhancing understanding of the structures of language in general. Combines hands-on study of Greek and Latin elements in English with lectures and primary readings that open a window onto ancient thinking about language, government, the emotions, law, medicine and education.

<P>CLS 190 The Trojan War </P>

<P>The Trojan War is the first conflict to be memorialized in Greco-Roman literature—“the war to start all wars.” For Homer and the poets who came after him it raised such questions as: What justifies going to war? What is the cost of combat and the price of glory? How does war affect men, women and children, winners and losers? We look at the “real” Troy of the archaeological record, then focus on imaginary Troy as represented by Homer, Aeschylus, Euripides, Virgil, Ovid and Seneca. WI {A} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

It tracks the development of the Greek city-state and the increasing power of the Greeks in the Mediterranean, culminating in the major diaspora of Greek culture accompanying the campaigns of Alexander the Great and his followers. The course takes a broadly chronological approach, and the question of a unified Greek culture is stressed. Continuing archaeological work is considered. (E) {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

What constituted a proper man and a proper woman in these ancient societies? Which sexual practices and objects of desire were socially sanctioned and which considered deviant? What ancient modes of thinking about these issues have persisted into the modern world? Attention to the status of women; the role of social class; the ways in which genre and convention shaped representation; the relationship between representation and reality. {H} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>CLS 238 The Age of Heroes: Archaeology of the Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age </P>

<P>For many of us, the Mediterranean Bronze Age is associated with mythological events like the Trojan War. But how did the people of the Bronze Age actually live? This course surveys the archaeology of the Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age, including Egypt and the Aegean, among others, from 3000 to 1100 BCE. We explore not only the pyramids and palaces of the period, but also the evidence for day-to-day living, from crafts production to religion. We also examine how these cultures interacted, and the Mediterranean networks that both allowed them to flourish and led to their collapse. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

How do the translator’s language and culture, the expectations of the target audience, and the marketplace determine what gets translated and how? We consider different translations of the same text, including rogue translations, adaptations and translations into other forms (opera, musicals, film). Students produce their own translations or adaptations. No prerequisites, but students who have not taken CLT 150 are urged to enroll in that (2-credit, S/U) course concurrently. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The Community Engagement and Social Change (CESC) concentration allows each participating student to connect an interdisciplinary area of interest to practical work in communities. Examples of areas of interest include immigration and citizenship, public health, education, law and policy, community organizing, community narratives, environmental justice, activist science, social movements, and arts and activism. </P>

<P>Through a combination of carefully selected coursework, practical experiences, independent research projects and guided reflection, students (1) expand and deepen their understanding of local, national and global issues that affect communities, and (2) develop the skills, attitudes and knowledge necessary to collaborate mindfully with these communities as citizens and leaders. </P>

<P>The CESC concentration draws on the rich curricular offerings at Smith College and in the Five Colleges, as well as the resources and expertise available through the Jandon Center for Community Engagement, other centers and offices at Smith, and the Smith College School for Social Work. For more information, see the CESC concentration webpage. </P>

<H1>Requirements </H1>

<P>The CESC concentration is open to any student by application. The application is available online at the JCCE website. Students are strongly encouraged to have taken CCX 120 (required for the Concentration) before they apply. </P>

<P>In addition to the gateway course (CCX 120) and the capstone seminar (CCX 320), CESC concentration students will take four electives, complete two practical experiences, and participate in guided reflection sessions. </P>

<P>Electives </P>

<P>Students take four 4-credit courses that support their area of interest and deepen knowledge in relevant core content, including social justice, systems analysis, diversity, community development and community-based learning/research. Examples of areas of interest for students include immigration and citizenship, public health, education, law and policy, community organizing, community narraives, environmental justice, activist science, social movements, and arts and activism. Course offerings with this content are available in multiple departments at Smith and in the Five Colleges. Electives must be derived from multiple disciplines, and two of the electives must be Community-Based Learning (CBL) courses. For a list of CBL courses, see www.smith.edu/academics/jandon-center/community-learningresearch. Electives should be chosen in consultation with the concentration adviser. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Practical Experiences </P>

<P>Students will complete two different practical experiences to fulfill the requirements for the CESC concentration. One experience will consist of at least 100 documented hours of work with an off-campus community organization. The other experience will be at least 200 hours. When possible, experiences of longer duration are strongly encouraged. These may include internships, service-learning, community-based participatory research, and paid or volunteer community service. They may occur at any time in the calendar year: during the academic semester, interterm, spring break or summer. They may be combined with Praxis, off-campus work-study or other stipend programs. </P>

<P>Reflection Sessions </P>

<P>Students will complete at least one semester’s worth of reflection sessions, coordinated by the JCCE. These sessions facilitate student learning from practical experiences and should be taken concurrently with or immediately following one of the practical experiences. </P>

<P>Submittal of Concentration Advising Checklist </P>

<P>Upon completion of the CESC concentration, students are required to submit a completed Concentration Advising Checklist form, signed by their adviser, indicating that the student has completed all requirements. Students will not receive credit for the concentration without submitting this form. The checklist and other relevant forms are available on the CESC concentration website (www. smith.edu/academics/community-engagement-and-social-change-concentration). Completed forms are due in the Office of the Registrar no later than the end of the first week of the student’s final semester. </P>

<P>CCX 120 Community-Based Learning: Ethics and Practice </P>

<P>Service learning, civic engagement, community-based research and community service have become familiar terms for describing forms of community-based learning (CBL) in higher education. Theorists and practitioners continue to debate how to bring community issues into the classroom and how best to bring students into the neighborhoods surrounding their colleges and universities. This course considers these issues through exposure to both the literature of community engagement and the experiences of those who practice its different forms. CCX 120 serves as a gateway course for the Community Engagement and Social Change concentration. As such, one of the primary purposes of the course is to give students exposure to the varied opportunities available at the college for engaging with communities. Specifically, the course focuses on volunteer opportunities, course-based engagement and examples of community-based research. Within and across these different approaches, we identify and explore the ethical issues that characterize community partnerships and the best practices that attempt to address these issues. Students also interact with peers, faculty, guest speakers, and community members who provide firsthand perspectives on the local practice of CBL and the critical needs in surrounding communities.

<P>Topics course. May be repeated once with a different topic. </P>

<P>Natives, Nationals and Nobodies: Home, Food and Belonging in the Cultural Imaginary </P>

<P>This course considers the many ways in which we experience and (re)create “home”: as the place where we are born, where we seek refuge, where our families are, where we emigrate. Food plays a central role in how we think of home—how do scents, spices, rituals, and preparations inform our sense of self and community? Studying selected works of fiction, film, oral history, and essays, we will explore the ways in which you, as well as refugees, migrants, immigrants, exiles, and émigrés, understand and conceptualize home, belongig, and “otherness.” {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 101 The Lives of Animals: Literature and the Nonhuman </P>

<P>In this course, we will track animals across a range of poems, stories, novels, essays, and films that try to imagine what it is like not to be human. From stories of people transforming into animals to texts that insist that we have no clue what animals really feel, we will consider the various ways that writers distinguish—or refuse to distinguish—humans from other animals. Why, we will ask, are literature and art so haunted by animal life? We will discuss zoos, pets, fables, cartoons, animal rights, vegetarianism, anthropocentrism, and extinction.

<P>Same as RES 140. Often portrayed as hostile to the West, Vladimir Putin and the Russia he rules remain little known. Going beyond the headlines, this course examines contemporary Russia, and historical events and figures that have shaped Putin-era Russia. We will trace the culture wars that have ensued in this post-communist and post-atheist state, across historical documents, art, film, literature, and journalism. Topics include state power and political opposition; the resurgence of religion, and tensions between religion and the secular in the public sphere; debates over the Soviet past, including revolution, war and political terror; human rights and “traditional values.” {H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 146 Can Women Have Adventures? </P>

<P>We will examine contemporary girls’ adventure in novels and films. These fictions rework the classic patterns of “boys’ books” to create heroic girls meant to inspire young female readers. We begin with two classic 19th-century boys' books to situate our readings of contemporary girls’ adventures. We will focus on the structure of the girls’ adventure landscape by creating maps and writing blog posts for each fiction asking questions such as: What significant boundaries do the fictions imagine? What gender and class ideas do they enforce? How do boy and girl heroes differ? What does a girl hero do? Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>CLT 150 The Art of Translation: Poetics, Politics, Practice </P>

<P>We hear and read translations all the time: on television news, in radio interviews, in movie subtitles, in international bestsellers. But translations don’t shift texts transparently from one language to another. Rather, they revise, censor and rewrite original works, to challenge the past and to speak to new readers. We explore translation in a range of contexts by hearing lectures by experts in the history, theory and practice of translation. Knowledge of a foreign language useful but not required. Graded S/U only. Can be taken concurrently with FRN 295 for 4 credits. {L} Credits: 2 </P>

<P>This course explores the island as a mythical blank space, a paradise, a no-man's land that encourages humankind's &quot;primordial&quot; impulses. We associate islands with adventure, wilderness, freedom, magic, dystopia and utopia. In the cultural imaginary, the island exists to be invented, discovered, and reinvented. We will consider a wide range of texts (and some films) from the isles of the Odyssey (home to seductive goddesses, a fairy-tale virgin princess, giant cannibals, and lotus addicts) to Prospero’s magic kingdom, Swift’s Lilliput, Peter Pan’s Neverland, Golding’s man-made dystopia (Lord of the Flies), Jean Rhys’s Jamaica (Wide Sargasso Sea), and Jamaica Kincaid’s Antigua (A Small Place).

We explore the dark world-view and desperate religion of the Vikings from the creation of the world to the end of time, including relations between living and dead, male and female, animals and humans, gods and giants, Æsir and Vanir—a crowded universe of trolls, elves, witches, dwarfs, valkyries, berserks, shapeshifters and various kinds of human being.

<P>Queering Don Quixote This course is devoted to a slow reading of Don Quijote de la Mancha (1605– 15), allegedly the first and most influential modern novel. Our approach to this hilarious masterpiece by Cervantes is through a “queering” focus, i.e., as a text that exposes all sorts of binary oppositions (literary, sexual, social, religious and ethnic), such as: high-low, tradition vs. individual creativity, historical vs. literary truth, man vs. woman, authenticity vs. performance, Moor vs. Christian, humorous vs. tragic. The course also covers the crucial role played by Don Quixote in the development of modern and postmodern novelistic concepts (multiple narrators, fictional authors, palimpsest, dialogism) and examples of its worldwide impact. With an optional 1-credit course in Spanish (SPN 356) for those who want to perfect their linguistic and literary skills by reading, translating and commenting selected sections of Miguel de Cervantes’ masterpiece and additional secondary literature in Spanish.

<P>A study of the major writers and diverse literary traditions of modern Africa with emphasis on the historical, political and cultural contexts of the emergence of writing, reception and consumption. We pay particular attention to several questions: in what contexts did modern African literature emerge? Is the term “African literature” a useful category? How do African writers challenge Western representations of Africa? How do they articulate the crisis of independence and postcoloniality? How do women writers reshape our understanding of gender and the politics of resistance? Writers include Chinua Achebe, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiong’o, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele and Ama Ata Aidoo.

<P>CLT 208 Dreams, Magic and the Sublime in Modern European Literature </P>

<P>Pending CAP approval. Starting in the late eighteenth century, avant-garde artists began to explore the claim that logic and rationality cannot account for all of human experience; they were fascinated by madness, dreams, the irrational, and the sublime. We will be investigating this phenomenon from a literary, artistic, and philosophical point of view, from the time of the Enlightenment philosophers to the twentieth century. We will be reading stories by Nerval, Tolstoy, and Kafka; Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights; poems by Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and Rilke, as well as philosophical essays.

This interdisciplinary course explores how Russian writers, filmmakers, and artists have represented the vast territory comprising Imperial Russia, the USSR, and the Russian Federation, from the Enlightenment to present. In addition to considering how artistic production has reflected and shaped understanding of the Russian “anthropocene,” we will compare these works with cultural production of the Western tradition. The course also explores initiatives to legislate and transform the Russian environment, which often precipitated ecological and social disasters. {H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

To celebrate this groundbreaking novel’s 200th anniversary, this co-taught class will explore the making of the text, alongside its monstrous legacy in contemporary culture. We will look at the novel’s influences and afterlives – from the Frankenstein collection in Smith’s rare book room to a range of films, electronic novels, and comics that reveal the enduring role of gothic monstrosity today.

Why are they often so elaborately framed, with their kernel presented as a kind of oral performance; a story told by one Character to another? Why do they so often rely on the fantastic and the unlikely—and how, by the End of the century, did the story come to concentrate instead on the mundane and the ordinary?

We pay particular attention to texts and films in which violence—political, economic, psychical, xenophobic, homophobic etc.—is the main focus. For what purposes do South African filmmakers adapt canonical and contemporary texts, biographies and memoirs to the screen? How do these adaptations help us visualize the relationship between power and violence in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa? How do race, class, gender, sexuality and ethnicity complicate how we define, conceptualize and critique racial, political and gender-based violence in South Africa? Texts and films may include Njabulo Ndebele’s The Cry of Winnie Mandela, Alan Paton’s Cry the Beloved Country, André Brink’s A Dry White Season, Mahamo’s The Last Grave at Dimbaza, John Wood’s Biko (Cry Freedom), Anne Mare du Preez Bezdrob’s Winnie Mandela: A Life (Winnie) and Athol Fugard’s Tsotsi.

<P>Same as TSX 330. The capstone seminar brings together a cohort of concentrators to discuss the final translation project that each student undertakes with the guidance of their adviser in the concentration and to situate the project within the framework of larger questions that the work of translation elicits. The seminar readings focus on renowned practitioners’ reflections on the difficulties and complexities of translating, the obstacles, discoveries and solutions that the translator encounters. We read a series of essays that engage with the conflicting interpretations and nuances of translations in 14 languages of Ferdinand Oyono’s iconic 1956 African novel, Une vie de boy. We compare how these translations transform the original novel and question the concept of original text as it interacts with the culture and the language into which it is translated. Students are responsible for presenting essays that focus on the particular challenges of translation that they have encountered in their individual project. Open to students in the Concentration in Translation Studies and students in comparative literature. Enrollment limit of 12 students. Prerequisite: CLT 150. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>CLT 340 Problems in Literary Theory </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>Comparative Literature in the Age of Cosmopolitanisms </P>

<P>The concept of cosmopolitanism has recently gone through a process of democratization. Dismissing the singular “cosmopolitanism” as a form of Eurocentric universalism, critics today study a plurality of cosmopolitanisms, focusing on transnational experiences, both elite and subaltern, Western and non-Western. How can we study comparative literature within this new framework? If the Western canon is no longer setting the standards, what are the new aesthetic values? How can we avoid the pitfalls of both cultural relativism and Oriental-ism, that is, reading unfamiliar literatures through an exotic lens? Does “World Literature” promote reading in translation at the expense of original languages? Authors may include Appiah, Apter, Casanova, Chakrabarty, Damrosch, Moretti, Nussbaum, Robbins, Said, Coetzee, Maalouf, Pamuk and Zadie Smith. The seminar is required of senior majors. By permission of the instructor. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Brasil Profundo: Landscape and the Environmental Imaginary in Brazilian Culture </P>

<P>This course addresses diverse modes of representing nature and the environment in Brazil, from the pre-colonial period to the present. Drawing upon visual arts, film, poetry, fiction and non-fiction, we will consider mytho-poetic accounts of the creation of the land, colonial accounts of flora, fauna and plantation agriculture, 19th-century scientific expeditions, Romantic and Modernist associations of nature and national identity, rural social movements and ideas of rural authenticity, and global orientations of contemporary “earth art” and “ecopoetry.” Deepening our understanding of the diversity of Brazilian landscapes and ecologies and historical forces that have shaped them, we will consider ways in which gender, class, ethnicity and ideology are implicated in different paradigms of environmental representation. Course conducted in Portuguese. Enrollment limited to 14.  {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>DAN 291 Yoga for Dancers </P>

<P>Rather than working from a singular movement approach, emphasis in this course is placed on understanding the dynamic relationship of both dance and yoga from multiple perspectives. We explore how these two practices reflect, inform and enhance each other through their anatomical/energetic organization and alignment strategies, movement logic and sequencing, and embodied awareness in motion and stillness. Investigating a variety of yogic structuring principles that address the technical, restorative and performance-related issues of the dancer, we work to refine standing, sitting, reclining and arm-supported postures, and then incorporate this information into the creation and performance of dancing phrases.

<P>This course examines the many ways in which writing has been used to gain, maintain and overturn power throughout Chinese history, from the prognosticating power of oracle bone script to the activist potential of social media. We examine writing as a tactic of agency, a force for social change, and an instrument of state power; analyze the changing role of literature; and consider the physical forms of writing and the millennia-long history of contemporary issues like censorship and writing reform. Finally, students work to make their own writing as powerful as possible. No knowledge of Chinese required. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>EAL 231 The Culture of the Lyric in Traditional China </P>

<P>China grounds its literary tradition in lyric poetry. One enduring definition of lyric, or shi, in the Chinese tradition is the natural, direct expression and reflection of one’s inner spirit as a result of a unique encounter with the world. This course is an introduction to masterworks of the Chinese lyric tradition from its oral beginnings through the Qing dynasty. Through close, careful readings of folk songs, poems, prose, and excerpts from the novel Dream of the Red Chamber, students inquire into how the spiritual, philosophical and political concerns dominating the poets’ milieu shaped the lyric language through the ages.

Much of Chinese literature is composed from the perspective of one who is, or has been, on the road: whether as exile, pilgrim, soldier, pleasure traveler, or even shaman. Through close reading of selected poems, diary entries, essays, and fictional writings, and visual images selected from across the centuries, we explore how various writers define such notions as “place” and “home.” All readings are in English translation. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>A survey of Japanese literature from the late 19th century to the present. Over the last century and a half, Japan has undergone tremendous change: rapid industrialization, imperial and colonial expansion, occupation following its defeat in the Pacific War, and emergence as a global economic power. The literature of modern Japan reflects the complex aesthetic, cultural and political effects of such changes. Through our discussions of these texts, we also address theoretical questions about such concepts as identity, gender, race, sexuality, nation, class, colonialism, modernism and translation.

<P>EAL 244 Japanese Women’s Writing </P>

<P>This course focuses on the writings of Japanese women from the 10th century until the present. We examine the foundations of Japan’s literary tradition represented by such early works as Murasaki Shikibu’s Tale of Genji and Sei Shonagon’s Pillow Book. We then move to the late 19th century to consider the first modern examples of Japanese women’s writing. How does the existence of a “feminine literary tradition” in pre-modern Japan influence the writing of women during the modern period? How do these texts reflect, resist and reconfigure conventional representations of gender? We explore the possibilities and limits of the articulation of feminine and feminist subjectivities, as well as investigate the production of such categories as “race,” class and sexuality in relation to gender and to each other. Taught in English, with no knowledge of Japanese required. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>EAL 245 Writing, Japan and Otherness </P>

<P>An exploration of representations of “otherness” in Japanese literature and film from the mid-19th century until the present. How was (and is) Japan’s identity as a modern nation configured through representations of other nations and cultures? How are categories of race, gender, nationality, class and sexuality used in the construction of difference? This course pays special attention to the role of “otherness” in the development of national and individual identities. In conjunction with these investigations, we also address the varied ways in which Japan is represented as “other” by writers from China, England, France, Korea and the United States. How do these images of and by Japan converse with each other? All readings are in English translation. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Adviser for Study Abroad: Mahnaz Mahdavi </P>

<P>Basis for the major: 150 and 153. </P>

<P>Requirements: The five courses in the core—150 and 153 or their equivalent, 220, 250 and 253—plus five other courses in economics. Of these latter five, one must be a 300-level course (or honors thesis) taken at Smith (or with prior permission at one of the other colleges in the Five College system) that includes an economics research paper and an oral presentation. 220 may be replaced in the core with either MTH 220 or MTH 291. In the case of MTH 220, the students will be required to take six rather than five economics courses beyond the core. Students who have already taken any of GOV 190, SOC 204, SDS/MTH 201, PSY 201 or MTH 220 may not receive college or major credit for 220. MTH 111 or its equivalent is a prerequisite for 250 and 253. </P>

<P>Students who pass the department's placement examination in microeconomics or macroeconomics, or who pass the AP examination in microeconomics or macroeconomics with a score of 4 or 5, or who have the appropriate grades in A-level or IB courses in economics, may count this as the equivalent of 150, 153 or both. Course credit toward the major will be granted as long as the overall number of economics credits recorded on the transcript is at least 36. Students with AP, A-level or IB credit are urged to take the placement exams to ensure correct placement. </P>

<P>With prior permission of the instructor, economics credit will be given for Public Policy, Environmental Science and Policy, and for Middle East Studies courses when taught by a member of the economics department. Economics credit will not be given for ACC 223. </P>

<P>The S/U grading option is not allowed for courses counting toward the economics major. An exception may be made in the case of 150 and 153. </P>

<P>Majors may spend their junior year abroad if they meet the college’s requirements. Only 4 semester course credits (and no more than 2 in any one semester) taken by a Smith student outside the five colleges may be counted toward the courses required for the major. This includes courses taken during study abroad or study away, and courses taken in summer school or during a leave of absence from the college. Any course taken for economics credit outside the Five Colleges should normally have prior approval by the major adviser or the department's adviser for study abroad. Economics courses and appropriate statistics courses taken by transfer students before their matriculation to Smith and approved by the department and the college will be counted toward the major as if they had been taken at Smith. </P>

<P>Majors may also participate in the Jean Picker Semester-in-Washington Program, administered by the Department of Government and described under the government major. </P>

<P>To adequately address the challenges facing society in the 21st century, there is a critical need for broadly educated engineers who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets. Engineers must have the understanding needed to address the cultural, political, and economic realities of our times, along with the technical depth to appropriately frame complex problems using ethical reasoning. The preparation for such a path is argued to be effectively achieved in a liberal arts setting. </P>

<P>At Smith, the engineering degrees offered are based on rigorous plans of study integrated with the liberal arts and sciences. There are two possible paths for the study of engineering at Smith College. The first is the ABET-accredited bachelor of science (S.B.) in engineering science, and the second is the bachelor of arts (A.B.) in engineering arts. More detailed information about both degree options can be found below. </P>

<P>The Picker Engineering Program’s educational objectives are to produce graduates who, within a few years of graduation, will: </P>

<L>

<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>incorporate their knowledge and understanding of the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences in the application of their engineering education; </LBody>

<H1>The Majors </H1>

<P>Engineering Arts, Bachelor of Arts </P>

<P>Advisers: Members of the Picker Engineering Program </P>

<P>The Purpose of the Major. The bachelor of arts in engineering arts is offered for those students who recognize the increasing importance of engineering and design in today’s world, who want to better understand the engineer’s role in service to humanity, and who do not intend to pursue professional practice as engineers. The bachelor of arts is not an ABET-accredited degree. </P>
</Sect>

<P>The Importance of the Liberal Arts. The possibilities of coupling the bachelor of arts in engineering arts with other disciplines are boundless. The bachelor of arts coupled with a focused set of studies in the liberal arts is a particularly well-suited course of study for preparing students to address the complexities of the world in which we live. </P>

<P>Advisers: Members of the Picker Engineering Program </P>

<P>Smith offers an undergraduate curriculum leading to an ABET-accredited degree in engineering science, the broad study of the foundational scientific and engineering principles that govern the practice of all engineering disciplines. The bachelor of science degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The American Society for Engineering Education, identifying the critical need for broadly educated engineers, points out that the design of an engineering curriculum should “recognize the pitfalls of overspecialization in the face of an increasing demand for graduates who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets.” An integral component of the program is the continuous emphasis on the use of engineering science principles in design. This culminates in a final capstone design project that incorporates broad-based societal aspects. Students are encouraged to pursue a corporate and/or research internship to complement their classroom instruction. Engineers must be able to communicate effectively and work in team settings. Smith’s highly-regarded writing intensive first-year curriculum ensures that engineering students begin their engineering curriculum with appropriate communication skills that will be refined during the remainder of their studies. Every engineering course offered at Smith incorporates elements of teamwork and oral/written communication. </P>

<H1>The Major </H1>

<P>Advisers: Members of the department </P>

<P>Major Requirements </P>

<P>The English major requires at least ten semester courses. The following requirements aim to provide majors with a broad understanding of literatures in English, acquaint them with the key questions and intellectual strategies that shape the discipline of literary study, and offer them the opportunity to work independently at an advanced level. </P>

<P>I. Major in English with a Literary Emphasis </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Majors take two gateway courses: English 199 (Methods of Literary Study) provides foundational methodological training in interpretation; English 200 (The English Literary Tradition I) offers an historical survey of English literature from its origins through the 18th century. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Because their writing has been so crucial to the history of literary study and so generative for later writers, we require at least one course wholly devoted to works by Chaucer, Shakespeare or Milton. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Because the spread of the British Empire has made English a global language with a rich array of divergent postcolonial literary traditions, and because multiple racial formations in North America have generated different ethnic American and diasporic literatures, we require at least one course at the 200-level (or above) with a focus on the global/racial as a central category of analysis. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>To encourage our students to move toward independence and sophistication as they pursue their studies, we require, as capstone experiences, one 300-level seminar in literature and one of the following: a four-credit special studies course, a second seminar, an honors thesis, a long-term Kahn Institute project, or a relevant four-credit concentration capstone course. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>At least four additional courses, one of which may be in creative writing. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>II. Major in English with a Creative Writing Emphasis </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Two gateway courses: English 199 (Methods of Literary Study) and English 200 (The English Literary Tradition I). </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>At least one course wholly devoted to works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, or Milton. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>At least one course at the 200-level or above with a focus on the global/racial as a central category of analysis. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>At least three writing workshops, two of which must be at the 200 or 300 level. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>At least one additional course in literature. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>As capstone experiences, one 300-level seminar in literature and one of the following:  a 4-credit special studies, a second seminar, a year-long Kahn Institute project, a relevant concentration capstone, or a thesis in creative writing, to be completed in the senior year, and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>Completion of ENG 395 (Creative Writing Capstone), submission of a portfolio of published work (2-3 pieces or about 25 pages of fiction or nonfiction prose or 10-12 poems), and participation in public reading by creative writing seniors. (Seniors writing a thesis in creative writing are exempt from this requirement.) </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students in the classes of 2019 and 2020 may complete the creative writing emphasis by taking three writing workshops, at least two at the advanced level, and by fulfilling the capstone requirement with a literature seminar plus a third advanced workshop (or any of the alternatives listed in the major requirements) and may choose not to take ENG 395. Beginning with the class of 2021, only the requirements above will be in effect. </P>

<Sect>
<P>We also ask students to develop a deliberative plan for their major in consultation with their advisers, to be revised and updated every semester. Students may if they wish design a special focus within the major by choosing three courses related by genre (such as poetry, fiction, drama), historical period, methodological approach or any other category of interest. </P>

<P>Courses that fulfill requirement number 2 above include but are not limited to ENG 250, 256, 257, 260; courses that fulfill requirement number 3 include but are not limited to ENG 222, 229, 230, 236, 239, 241, 246, 248, 249, 267, 277, 278, 282, 309, 312, 319, 334, 387,391, AFR 209, 360, AMS 230, CLT 205, 266. </P>

<P>One course in film, a foreign or comparative literature, or dramatic literature offered through the theatre department may count toward the major; courses in any of these categories that are cross-listed in English do not count against this limit. While only one course in creative writing may count toward the ten required courses for the literature emphasis, we encourage majors with interests in creative writing to choose additional courses in this area. Only one elective first-level course (e.g., ENG 120, ENG 135) or one FYS taught by a member of the English Department may count toward the major. ENG 118 does not count. No course counting toward the major may be taken for an S/U grade. We strongly recommend that all students take at least one historical sequence: ENG 200, 201; ENG 202, 203; or ENG 231, 233, 235. </P>

<P>Students interested in graduate school in English literature would be well advised to take a course in literary theory and should be aware that most doctoral programs in English require a reading knowledge of two foreign languages. Students interested in high school teaching would be well advised to take both the English (200, 201) and the American (231, 233) literature surveys and a course in literature in English outside Britain and America. Those considering an MFA program in creative writing would be well advised to take literature courses in their chosen form or forms and to consult with their advisers about building a portfolio of selected writings. </P>

<P>ENG 430D Honors Project </P>

<P>Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Applicants to honors must have an average of B+ or above in the courses they count toward the major, and an average of B or above in all other courses. During the senior year they will present a thesis, of which the first complete formal draft will be due on the first day of the second semester. After the readers of the thesis have provided students with their evaluations of this draft, the student will have time to revise her work in response to their suggestions. The final completed version of the thesis will be due after spring vacation, to be followed during April by the student’s oral presentation and discussion of her work. Students in honors will normally be given priority in seminars. </P>

<P>Map My Words: Writing About Borders and Belonging </P>

<P>This course is designed to get you thinking about maps to generate ideas for your writing. Our main focus will be learning to write logical, complex academic essays, and assignments will include four essays, blog posts, and a presentation, accompanied by lessons on rhetoric, revision, structure, grammar, and research basics. Questions addressed in discussions, readings, and essays will include: Is a map a rhetorical document? Is there bias in the language of maps? How do maps and essays hide the process of creation? What histories of exploration and exploitation are communicated (or silenced) by the act of mapping? </P>

<P>Hope and Fear: The Power of Persuasion </P>

<P>We are immersed in a culture of persuasion: advertisers make claims, politicians' promises. Yet, despite what we believe about how we make decisions, successful persuasion is often based more on emotion than logical evidence. We examine the rhetoric of persuasion from the ancient Romans to the intentionally addictive nature of social media in order to separate the hype from the content and to develop our own, authentic persuasive styles.

<P>The Space in Our Identity: Writing About Home </P>

<P>Home is more than the physical structure where we reside. Home is where we live in every sense: the physical sense, yes, but also the spiritual, romantic, ideal and maybe even mythical. All of these aspects of home, hometown, home country, or adopted home serve to shape our identities. In this course, we explore the importance of these spaces, be they physical or metaphysical, to the construction of “home” and how these terms, whether we accept them wholly, shun them entirely or experience them via travel, dictate to us and others a sense of self and identity. Can be repeated for credit with a different topic. Enrollment limited to </P>

We see it on websites like YouTube and on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. In this class, we look at how our lives have grown more performative in the advent of new concepts like “reality,” “sincerity,” “self” and “friend,” and what that means for us as individuals and as a society.

<P>Water: Science and Politics </P>

<P>The management of global water resources presents a major challenge for the 21st century. Water defines the boundaries of the livable world. It’s crucial for drinking, energy, travel, irrigation and food. But water can also transmit disease, flood homes and spread contamination. Students in this course hone their science-writing skills while exploring contemporary problems related to water. They focus on presenting scientific data, reasoning and controversies in accurate but lively language, while learning and writing about the politics surrounding water use. Sources include scientific research papers, government reports, newspaper articles, and op-ed pieces. May be repeated once for credit with a different instructor. Enrollment limited to 15.

<P>No, Seriously... What’s so Funny? Writing About Humor </P>

<P>Nietzsche called maturity the rediscovered seriousness of a child at play. What is the meaning of comedy, in light of this “seriousness of the child at play?” Why do we laugh, at what and in what way? How do we distinguish silly comedy from serious comedy? This course examines such questions on comic platforms including film, music, videos, short stories and cartoons. We explore the “structure” of the comic moment as viewer or listener encounters surprise, transgression or enchantment, especially in 20th-century comedy, and the affectivity of the comic encounter from pure “clowning” to savage social commentary.

<P>Worth a Thousand Words </P>

<P>This course explores and analyzes the popular saying, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” The saying is generally interpreted to suggest that a complex idea can be expressed in just one picture. But it also raises questions about the complex meanings of pictures and the complex process of interpreting them. We analyze images and discuss essays about the politics of interpretation. There may be opportunities to bring some of your own pictures into the course. Bilingual students and nonnative English speakers are especially invited to register for this section.

<P>Bad History </P>

<P>George Santayana famously wrote, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,” but can anyone remember all the past? Which past should I remember? Whose past? Maybe history isn't one memorizable narrative, but billions of individual stories and perspectives. Even if you told your own life story, which events would you include or leave out? Would you tell it as a tragedy? Comedy? Coming-of-age story? In this class, we consider the distance between history and myth, story and storyteller, the event and how it's remembered. We uncover histories, doubt histories, and write our own. (E) WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>How to Live </P>

<P>Through wide-ranging readings from ancient philosophy to contemporary memoirs, we engage this most essential question: How are we to live our lives? Philosophers and artists, farmers and writers, religious leaders and political activists have given us a rich variety of approaches to this question, envisioning utopias both large and farm-small, proposing maxims to live by, conducting private and public experiments, condensing hard-won knowledge into prose. The range of forms of these provocative writings leads to this class’s second question: How are we to write about matters? Can be repeated for credit with a different topic. WI Credits: 4 </P>

This course examines that confusion, considering which of the many diets available to us—vegan, slow food, locavore—is truly healthy; what roles ethnicity, gender and class play in our choices; and how pervasive hunger is in the United States. Students read from the spectrum of food writing and hone their own writing in a variety of genres ranging from academic essays to restaurant reviews.

<P>ENG 135 Introduction to Writing Creative Nonfiction </P>

<P>Students learn to use literary techniques to write factual, engaging narratives that read like fiction. Based on research, interviews and personal experience, creative nonfiction encompasses a wide range of genres, including memoir, travel writing, nature writing, science writing, food writing and biography. Prerequisites: one WI course. Enrollment in each section limited to 16. Course may be repeated once on a different topic. (E) </P>

<P>Creative Nonfiction About Place and Travel </P>

<P>In creative nonfiction writing, authors of fact-based essays and memoirs use the same craft tools as novelists—from description and dialogue to reflection, scene, structure and exposition—to tell a story. We sharpen these tools with writing and reading assignments that draw from the linked themes of place and travel, and how the passage of time changes perspectives on both. You don't have to be a seasoned traveler to join the course: you can write about any place at all, including home. We also use the Smith College Archives to write about the place we all know and share at different times in its history. Students may respond to assignments and prompts in traditional written essays; graphic essays (comics); or digital essays. Either way, be prepared to write frequently in class and out, read well, participate in class discussion, and be ready to explore your world with new eyes. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Writing About the Arts </P>

<P>Students write true stories about art, music, theater, film and dance that read like a novel. Writing assignments include a profile of an artist or performer, a review of a performance or an exhibit, and a personal essay exploring how a work of art, theater or music influenced the author. The essays read like fiction, relying on character, pacing, scenes, structure and sensory details. Unlike fiction, these stories are based on facts gathered through research, observation and interviews. The course offers tools and an approach to writing to help students develop a writing process that works for them. Enrollment limited to 16. (E) Credits: 4 </P>

We read and discuss works that illuminate the experiences of health and illness, and that examine how American society and the medical establishment respond to these. Each student develops her voice, her sense of purpose and her authority as a writer, while strengthening her relationship with her reader. Students practice revising for style, structure and accuracy. Enrollment limited to 16. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Writing About Sports </P>

<P>Through reading, in-and-out-of-class writing, and editing one another's work, students learn different forms of creative non-fiction essays through a focus on the topic of sports. Among other subjects, students may explore their own sports backgrounds, the dynamics of individual sports, sports ethics, the lives and careers of sports figures, and subjects like momentum: where does it come from and where does it go? Students are encouraged to use sports-related material in the Smith Archives and explore our sports rich environment, including Smith athletics and local landmarks such as the Basketball Hall of Fame.

<P>Writing About the Senses </P>

<P>Sight, sound, touch, smell, taste: Everything we know reaches us through our senses. We share a world filtered through a million sensibilities—finding the words to convey what we hear, see, smell, taste, and feel is one of the most fundamental skills a writer can develop. In this class, we will hone our descriptive powers to go beyond the obvious and uncover language that delights and surprises us even as we write. We will learn to use one sense to write about another, combine them in powerful metaphors, and explore how our senses shape the narratives that drive us. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Courses numbered 199–249. Open to all sophomores, juniors and seniors, and to qualified first-year students. </P>

<P>Gateway Courses </P>

<P>These courses serve as entry points to the major, introductions to the critical, historical and methodological issues and questions that underlie the study of literatures in English. Beginning with the class of 2019, English majors must take ENG 199 and ENG 200. Fall gateway courses are open to first-year students with the English Literature and Composition AP score of 4 or 5, or a score of 710 on the Critical Reading portion of the SAT, or by permission of the instructor. </P>

<P>ENG 199 Methods of Literary Study </P>

<P>This course teaches the skills that enable us to read literature with understanding and pleasure. By studying examples from a variety of periods and places, students learn how poetry, prose fiction and drama work, how to interpret them and how to make use of interpretations by others. English 199 seeks to produce perceptive readers well equipped to take on complex texts. This gateway course for prospective English majors is not recommended for students simply seeking a writing intensive course. Readings in different sections vary, but all involve active discussion and frequent writing. Enrollment limited to 20 per section. WI {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 201 The English Literary Tradition II </P>

<P>In this course we journey from the Romantics to the Victorians to the Modernists, reading a wide variety of poetry, plays, and novels from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first. We read some of the most important, strange, beautiful, and complex texts of the English literary tradition, while considering the formations and deformations of that tradition, with its inclusions and exclusions, its riches and its costs, its ceaseless attention to and radical deviations from what is past or passing, or to come. Authors may include Blake, Conrad, Dickens, Eliot, Equiano, Keats, Joyce, Rossetti, Tennyson, Walcott, Wilde, Woolf, and Wordsworth. WI {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Old High German and Old Saxon </P>

<P>An introduction to the vernacular literatures of early medieval Europe with readings from the Old High German Lay of Hildebrand and Merseburg Charms, as well as the Old Saxon Hêliand ‘Savior’, a powerful retelling of the gospel in the style of ancient Germanic alliterative verse like the Old English Beowulf. The Hêliand offers a unique glimpse into how the new Christian religion with its Jewish spirituality and Mediterranean civic ethos was processed by the tribal peoples of Northern Europe.

<P>ENG 220 The Voyage Within: The Novel in England from George Eliot to Virginia Woolf </P>

<P>What it would be like to hear the squirrel’s heartbeat, to open one’s mind fully to the sensations and impressions of the world around us? The image belongs to George Eliot, who in Middlemarch suggested we couldn’t bear it; we would die of a sensory overload, the “roar on the other side of silence.” The novelists of the generations that followed tried to live in that roar: to explore the stream of consciousness, to capture the way we make sense of experience and order out of our memory’s chaos. Readings in George Eliot, Henry James, Virginia Woolf and others. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>This course traces the emergence of a 21st-century gothic tradition in American writing through texts including novels, films and television shows. We analyze the shifting definitions and cultural work of the Gothic in contemporary American literature in the context of political and cultural events and movements and their relation to such concerns as race, gender, class, sexuality and disability. From the New Mexican desert to the rural south, from New York City, San Francisco and the suburbs of Atlanta to cyberspace, these literary encounters explore an expanse of physical, psychological, intellectual and imagined territory. {A} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 224 Frankenstein: The Making of a Monster </P>

<P>At the age of 19, Mary Shelley began writing the first science fiction novel. Frankenstein not only describes fears about monstrosity and accelerating technology; it also sets the stage for continuing discussions about gender, reproduction, race, ethics, and disability. To celebrate this groundbreaking novel’s 200th anniversary, this co-taught class will explore the making of the text, alongside its monstrous legacy in contemporary culture. We will look at the novel’s influences and afterlives – from the Frankenstein collection in Smith’s rare book room to a range of films, electronic novels, and comics that reveal the enduring role of gothic monstrosity today. Meets on alternating days at Smith and Amherst College. Enrollment limit of 36. (E) {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 228 Children's Literature </P>

<P>Shapes speak to us. Prose shapes us. From the picture book to the chapter book, we will explore the ways in which literature for children invents the child reading that literature. And we will attempt to break through our natural nostalgia for works we know to rediscover their innovative and experimental nature. In so doing, we will see these works work their magic on themes that will become familiar throughout the semester: identity, nostalgia, interiors and exteriors, authority, independence and dependence and, of course, the nature of wild things. Works may include Peter Rabbit; Where the Wild Things Are; Winnie-the-Pooh; Alice in Wonderland; Peter Pan; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; The Secret Garden; The Giver. {L} Credits: 4 Gillian Murray Kendall </P>

<P>ENG 229 Turning Novels Into Films: Imperialism, Race, Gender and Cinematic Adaptation </P>

<P>“Not as good as the book,” is a frequent response to film adaptations of novels. Adaptation studies, an interdisciplinary field that combines literary and film studies, rejects this notion of “fidelity” (how faithful a film is to its source) and instead reads literature and film as equal but different artistic and cultural forms, where the film may translate, transmute, critique, or re-interpret the novel. This course will look closely and analytically at some paired fiction and film adaptations that focus on issues of imperialism, race, class, and gender. We’ll begin with some classics (Austen’s Mansfield Park, Forster’s Passage to India), move to international postcolonial fiction and film (Tagore’s Home and the World, Ondaatje’s The English Patient), and end with U.S. texts about non-white, hyphenated citizens (Lahiri’s Namesake, Stockett’s The Help). We will also read some critical and theoretical essays to frame our key concepts and conversations. Prerequisites: At least one college level course in literature or film. </P>

<P>Explores the significant contributions and challenges of Jewish writers and critics to American literature, broadly defined. Topics include the American dream and its discontents; immigrant fiction; literary multilingualism; ethnic satire and humor; crises of the left involving 60s radicalism and Black-Jewish relations; after-effects of the Holocaust. Must Jewish writing remain on the margins, too ethnic for the mainstream yet insufficiently multicultural for contemporary gatekeepers of diversity? No prerequisites. {H} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 231 Inventing America: Nation, Race, Freedom </P>

<P>This course will focus on the extraordinary burst of literary creativity that coincided with the emergence of a new American nation. From its conflicted founding episodes to the crisis of the Civil War, American writers interpreted and criticized American life with unmatched imaginative intensity and formal boldness, taking as their particular subject both the promise of freedom implicit in the nation's invention—and the betrayals of that promise: in the horrors of slavery, and in the subtler entrapments of orthodox thinking, constricted vision, a self-poisoning psyche, and a repressive or unjust social life. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 232 London Fog: Victorian Secrets, Sensations and Subversions </P>

<P>The deadly fog that hung over London throughout the 19th century was both a social reality and a pungent metaphor for a metropolis in which it seemed that almost anything could be hidden: secrets, crimes, identities. But sometimes the fog parts—and then comes scandal. We'll begin with Dickens' anatomy of the city in Bleak House; move on to sensation novels by Wilkie Collins and Mary Elizabeth Braddon, which contest and subvert the period's gender roles; look at murder with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Jekyll; urban bombings with Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent; and end with a neo-Victorian novel by Sarah Waters. </P>

<P>ENG 233 Re-forming America: Region, Race, and Empire </P>

<P>Re-forming the nation after the Civil War was no easy feat. During the period between 1865 and 1914, how did regions recently at war with one another view America differently? How did people of different races, classes, genders, and other identities define their relationship to the nation? What role did empire-building, science, and industrialization play in the re-forming of America into the superpower that it would become in the twentieth century? This course engages American writers as they explore these and other questions of meaning, value, and power—with an emphasis on writers who shaped, critiqued, and stood apart from their rapidly changing society. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 237 Environmental Poetry and Ecological Thought </P>

<P>This course considers how literature represents environmental change and crisis, and shapes our understanding of the natural world. How can poetry provide new ways for thinking through extinction, conservation, and environmental justice? We explore these issues by reading a selection of environmental poetry in conversation with key texts from the environmental humanities. Central to the discussions: the sublime and the aesthetics of landscape and wilderness; garbage and the poetics of waste; the ethics of representing animal and plant life; the relation between landscape, labor, and power; and how ecopoetry intervenes in debates about climate change. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 247 Race, Suburbia, and the post-1945 U.S. Novel </P>

<P>This course aims to identify, analyze, and complicate the dominant narrative of U.S. suburbia vis-à-vis the postwar American novel. While the suburb may evoke a shared sense of tedium, U.S. fiction positions suburbia as &quot;contested terrain,&quot; a battleground staging many of the key social, cultural, and political shifts of our contemporary age. Reading novels and short stories by writers like Toni Morrison, Hisaye Yamamoto, John Updike, Chang-Rae Lee and Celeste Ng, we assess the narrative construction of the suburb as a bastion of white domesticity, as well as the disruption of this narrative through struggles for racial integration.

<P>Visiting the pulpits, meeting houses and gallows of British North America to the colonial West Indies and docks of Liverpool to the modern day Caribbean, U.S., Canada, U.K. and France, this course analyzes the literatures of the Black Atlantic and the development of black literary and intellectual history from the 18th to the 21st century. Some key theoretical frameworks, which help inform our study of literature emerging from the Black Atlantic, include diaspora, transnationalism, internationalism and cosmopolitanism. Readings range from early African diasporic sermons, dying words, poetry, captivity and slave narratives to newspapers, essays, novels, drama and film. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Same as CLT 255. How did the modern short story emerge—why, where, when? What is its relation to other forms of short fiction—the Italian novella or the German novelle, or the fairy tale? Why are they often so elaborately framed, with their kernel presented as a kind of oral performance: a story told by one character to another? Why do they so often rely on the fantastic and the unlikely—and how, by the end of the century, did the story come to concentrate instead on the mundane and the ordinary? What, in short, makes a tale worth telling? Readings in Goethe, Hoffman, Hawthorne, Gogol, Turgenev, Maupassant, Verga, Kipling, Chekhov, Jewett, and others. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 264 Faulkner </P>

<P>The sustained explosion of Faulkner’s work in the dozen-odd years between The Sound and the Fury and Go Down, Moses has no parallel in American literature. He explored the microtones of consciousness and conducted the most radical of experiments in narrative form. At the same time he relied more heavily on the spoken vernacular than anyone since Mark Twain, and he made his “little postage stamp of native soil” in northern Mississippi stand for the world itself. We read the great novels of his Yoknapatawpha cycle along with a selection of short stories, examining the linked and always problematic issues of race, region and remembrance in terms of the forms that he invented to deal with them. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 267 Asian American Literature </P>

<P>Although we sometimes think only of modern-day authors like Amy Tan or Jhumpa Lahiri when we think of Asian American literature, in fact Asian Americans have been writing and publishing in English since at least 1887. In this course, we read selected Asian American poetry, novels, short stories, plays and films produced from the late 19th century until the present. We consider how works engage with issues that have always concerned Asian Americans, like identity development and racism. Also, we pay attention to how works speak to concerns specific to their period, such as the exclusion acts of the 1880s, the proletarian movement of the 1930s, the decolonization of South Asian and Southeast Asian countries since the 1940s, and the increasing size and diversity of the Asian American population in the late 20th century. At all times, we attend closely to matters of language and form. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

Standing at the junction of literature, philosopy, and religion, the notion of evil reveals much about the development of the autonomous individual, the intersection of morality, freedom and identity, and the confrontation of fantasy and history. Readings include literary works from Milton, Goethe, Blake, Kleist, E.T.A., Hoffmann, Tolkien, Le Guin; theoretical texts from Augustine, Luther, Nietzsche, Freud, Arendt.

<P>Members of the Bloomsbury movement led non-normative (what many now call queer) lives. The complexity and openness of their relationships characterized not only the lives but also the major works of fiction, art, design, and critical writings its members produced. “Sex permeated our conversation,” Woolf recalls, and in Bloomsbury and Sexuality we’ll explore the far-reaching consequences of this ostensible removal of discursive, social, and sexual inhibition in the spheres of literature, art, and social sciences. The course will draw from the art of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, the writings of E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Radclyffe Hall, Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and others, along with contemporary queer theory. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 274 The Pleasures of Not Thinking: Romanticism and the Irrational </P>

<P>Romantic writers were obsessed with uncertainty, ignorance, and the irrational, unthinking mind. Concerned with the unusual ideas that surface when we are sleeping or spaced out, absorbed or intoxicated, Romanticism embraced reason’s alternatives: forgetting, fragmentation, stupidity, and spontaneous, uncontrollable emotion. From Wordsworth’s suggestion that children are wiser than adults to Keats’s claim that great writers are capable of remaining uncertain without reaching for fact or reason, Romantic poets and novelists suggested that we have something to learn from not thinking. We will read texts by Austen, Blake, Burke, Coleridge, Cowper, De Quincey, Freud, Kant, Keats, Locke, and Rousseau. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 275 Witches, Witchcraft and Witch Hunts </P>

<P>This course has two central ambitions. First, it introduces themes of magic and witchcraft in (mostly) American literature and film. We work together to figure out how the figure of the witch functions in stories, novels and movies, what witches and witchcraft mean or how they participate in the texts’ ways of making meaning. At the same time, we try to figure out how witches and witchcraft function as loci or displacements of social anxiety—about power, science, gender, class, race and politics. Since the identification of witches and the fear of witchcraft often lead to witch panics, we finally examine the historical and cultural phenomenon of the witch hunt, including both the persecution of persons literally marked as witches and the analogous persecution of persons (Communists, sexual outsiders, etc.) figuratively “hunted” as witches have been. Open to students at all levels, regardless of major. (E) {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>A comparative study of 20th-century women writers in English from Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia and Australia. We read novels, short stories, poetry, plays and autobiography in their historical, cultural and political contexts as well as theoretical essays to address questions such as: How have women writers addressed the dual challenge of contesting sexism and patriarchy from within their indigenous cultures as well as the legacies of western imperialism from without? How have they combined feminism with anti-colonialism? How have they deployed the act of writing as cultural work on multiple counts: addressing multiple audiences; challenging different stereotypes about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity? What new stories have they told to counter older stories, what silences have they broken? How have they renegotiated the public and the private, or called attention to areas often ignored by their male contemporaries, such as relations among women, familial dynamics, motherhood, bodily desire, or the gendered effects of migration and diaspora? Writers include Anita Desai, Kamala Das, Thrity Umrigar, Deepa Mehta, Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head, Nawal el Saadawi, Jamaica Kincaid, Michelle Cliff, Zadie Smith, Sally Morgan.

<P>ENG 285 Introduction to Contemporary Literary Theory </P>

<P>What do we do when we read literature? Does the meaning of a text depend on the author’s intention or on how readers read? What counts as a valid interpretation? Who decides? How do some texts get canonized and others forgotten? How does literature function in culture and society? How do changing understandings of language, the unconscious, class, gender, race, history, sexuality or disability affect how we read? “Theory” is “thinking about thinking,” questioning common sense, critically examining the categories we use to approach literature or any discursive text. This course introduces some of the most influential questions that have shaped contemporary literary studies. We start with New Criticism but focus on interdisciplinary approaches such as structuralism, poststructuralism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, New Historicism, postcolonialism, feminism, queer, cultural, race and disability studies with some attention to film and film theory. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate work. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 206 Intermediate Fiction Writing </P>

<P>A writer’s workshop that focuses on sharpening and expanding each student’s fiction writing skills, as well as broadening and deepening her understanding of the short story form. Exercises will concentrate on using real-world interviewing and reporting to feed one's fictional work. Students will analyze and discuss each other's stories, and examine the work of established writers. Writing sample and permission of the instructor are required. A writing sample and permission of the instructor are required. Enrollment limited to 12. </P>

<P>Fiction Through Photography </P>

<P>This course uses concepts and methods of photography to advance students' fiction-writing abilities and comprehension. Students take photographs as a way of grappling with issues of focus, framing, depth of field, point of view, &quot;flatness,&quot; timing, and other precepts of photography that are transferable to writing, and include their photographs in their fictional pieces. The point of the course is not to improve students' photo abilities (and no pre-req skills or special equipment are required), but to use photography to enhance writing skills and understanding. Final product is a publishable short story. {A} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Factual Fiction </P>

<P>Even the most imaginative fiction is grounded in a tangible world, and writing it well requires skilled observation as well as expression. ENG 206 is a creative-writing course that will advance students' fiction-writing abilities by refining techniques of observation. Students will report on such aspects as &quot;process&quot; and &quot;place&quot; and will employ that reporting in composing short stories, using gathered real-world facts to bring fictional pieces into focus and greater brilliance. Readings and assignments will explore the interplay of fact and imagination in fiction. Finished stories produced by students will be work-shopped in class. {A} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENG 245 Worldbuilding: Topics in Reading and Writing Creative Fiction </P>

<P>Whether in fantasy or more mainstream narratives, storylines evolve in a carefully constructed world space. Imaginary settings—whether they be Narnia or New York — involve the creation of spatially coherent locations, a backstory and a world that is peopled. In this course, students examine fictional worlds and learn to build those worlds themselves. This class is not limited to but is recommended for students interested in fantasy, science fiction or speculative fiction. Writing sample and permission of the instructor are required. Enrollment limited to 12. </P>

<P>The Landscape and Cityscapes of Creative Fiction </P>

<P>In this course, we explore the constructed worlds made by some wonderful writers and build fictional worlds of our own.

This class will examine reporting and writing by and about women, and engage students in the practice of writing about gender, feminism, and women’s lives. Students will produce their own researched and reported magazine-style project, while inspecting how the media represents feminist issues and analyzing the works of other writers who have probed women’s conditions and concerns. We will grapple with questions of reportage, structure, ethical obligations to one’s subject, fair representation, and more. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The goal of this workshop is to help more advanced fiction-writing students become stronger writers in a supportive context that encourages experimentation, contemplation, and attention to craft. The workshop will include all the traditional elements of a fiction writing workshop, focusing on writing skills and technique, close reading, and the production of new work. In addition, the workshop will include instruction in mindfulness meditation to help students cultivate their powers of concentration, observation, imagination, and creative expression on the page. Students will be asked to submit manuscripts for discussion in class, to revise and edit their work, and to keep a process journal about their writing practice. They will be asked to read fiction by established authors in a range of genres and to lead a class forum discussion on a published short story of their choosing.

<P>Seminars. Seminars are open only to juniors and seniors, and admission is by permission of the instructor. </P>

<P>Seminars in the English department stand as the capstone experience in the major. They bring students into the public aspects of intellectual life, and the papers they require are not only longer but also different in kind from those in 200-level classes. These papers require a research component in which students engage the published arguments of others, or at least demonstrate an awareness of the ongoing critical conversation their work is entering. But such work proves most useful when most available, and so we also require that students present their thinking in some way to the semi-public sphere of the seminar itself. </P>

<P>All students who wish to take a seminar must contact the instructor by the last day of the preregistration period. The instructor selects the students admitted from these applicants. Enrollment limited to 12. </P>

<P>ENG 310 Studies in Early Modern Literature and Culture </P>

<P>Topics course by the visiting Kennedy Professor </P>

<P>Renaissance Color Across Media </P>

<P>Since Newton's experiment with prisms in 1666, color has been considered a matter of physics (light rays at frequencies between 700 and 420 nanometers) and physiology (stimulation of rods and cones in the retina). During the two centuries preceding Newton, however, such assumptions were challenged by chromaticism in musical lines, coloratura singing, and the deployment of rhetorical colors in verbal texts. This seminar will study cross-media examples of color in verbal fictions, paintings, dramatic performances, and music. Participants contribute one 1000-word response paper, accompanied by five questions for class discussion, and a final 3500-word paper pursuing one theme or concern across at least two media.

<P>ENG 318 Blackness and the Long Poem </P>

<P>Amid the political and cultural discourses of racial struggle, justice, and equality during the twentieth century, poets of the African diaspora turned frequently to the epic tradition and the genre of the long poem as a means of exploring and expressing complex Black histories and identities. This seminar surveys the emerging tradition of the long poem of Blackness from Aime Cesaire to Harryette Mullen, situating individual poetic projects in the specific cultural conjunctures that provoked them and theorizing the peculiar values of the long poem for these poets' moments and purposes.

Everyone knows the social bandit who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, hated by the authorities and loved by the people, but few have read the early formative texts that first inspired this unceasingly popular legend.

Edith Wharton (1862-1937) examined the privileged world into which she was born with an anthropological skepticism, a sardonic dissection of unforgiving social laws and mores, and yet also provided a backwards glance at a vanishing world. A reading of her major work in social and historical context: The House of Mirth, The Custom of the Country, Ethan Frome, Summer, The Age of Innocence, and others. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department </P>

<P>ENG 361 Poetry of War </P>

<P>This course studies a range of poetic representations of war. After reviewing some of the writings of Homer, Virgil and Shakespeare that were most influential for British poets of the 19th and 20th centuries, the course moves from Tennyson, Hardy and Kipling to the poets of the first and second world wars (Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and others). We situate the poetry with relevant historical and theoretical materials, as well as prose responses to war by authors such as Vera Brittain and Virginia Woolf. We end by reading poets who did not see combat (W.B. Yeats, W. H. Auden, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath) but whose work is nevertheless profoundly concerned with the complex relation of the martial to the lyrical, the destructive to the creative.

<P>Anti-Memoir </P>

<P>Like many ethnic American groups, Asian Americans first entered the U.S. publishing marketplace by offering works in the genre of autoethnography, or self-culture-writing.While many writers have valued this genre as a gateway, others have viewed it as a prison. While some see it as an opportunity to express themselves, others feel constrained by mainstream expectations. Hence, a few Asian American writers have played with the genre, sometimes in radical ways, in order to do new kinds of aesthetic and cultural work. Memoirs and anti-memoirs for consideration include those by Maxine Hong Kingston, Agha Shahid Ali, Paisley Rekdal, Amanda Ngoho Reavey, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Thi Bui, Bao Phi, and Lynda Barry.

<P>The mission of the Center for the Environment, Ecological Design and Sustainability (CEEDS) is to graduate women who excel at integrating knowledge in support of environmental decisions and actions. A concentration, that links academic integration with agency and action, is a natural means by which to achieve this mission, and CEEDS offers two environmental concentrations with topics that change every four years. </P>

<P>Many world leaders, scientists and analysts of all types agree that global climate change is perhaps the most significant challenge confronting human life and well-being and the stability of life on Earth. The climate change concentration builds on strong student and faculty interest, pulling together the many diverse fields and disciplines that bear on this complex subject. </P>

<P>Giovanna Bellesia (Italian Studies) Barbara Brehm-Curtis (Exercise and Sport Studies) **1 May George (Middle East Studies) Michelle Joffroy (Spanish and Portuguese) Ann Leone (French Studies and Landscape Studies) 2† Patricia Mangan (Anthropology) Denise Annette McKahn (Engineering) Nancy Saporta Sternbach (Spanish) Paul Robert Wetzel (Environmental Concentration) </P>

<P>The mission of the Center for the Environment, Ecological Design and Sustainability (CEEDS) is to graduate women who excel at integrating knowledge in support of environmental decisions and actions. A concentration, that links academic integration with agency and action, is a natural means by which to achieve this mission, and CEEDS offers two environmental concentrations with topics that change every four years. </P>

<P>Through 2020, one environmental concentration topic will be sustainable food, building on current student and faculty interest in this subject and capitalizing on Smith’s location in the heart of the Pioneer Valley. This concentration enables students and faculty to engage in interdisciplinary explorations of food and the many issues involved in sustainability, such as food production, food distribution systems, the economics of agriculture, food cultures around the world, agricultural policy, and various questions pertaining to gender and food. For more information, see  www.smith.edu/food/ </P>

<H1>Requirements </H1>

<P>The environmental concentration in sustainable food has four components: a gateway course, an academic core, practicum experiences and a capstone. </P>

<P>1. Gateway Course (choose one) </P>

<P>ENX 100 Environment and Sustainability: Notes from the Field </P>

<P>This 1-credit lecture series introduces students to theory and practice in fields related to the environment, sustainability and climate change. Students gain insight into how their liberal arts education and skills in critical thinking and analysis apply to a variety of environmental issues and sustainability contexts. Speakers, including distinguished alumnae, are drawn from the five colleges, the Pioneer Valley and beyond. Graded S/U only. This course can be repeated for credit. Credits: 1 </P>

<P>Normally offered each fall </P>

<P>LSS 100 Landscape, Environment and Design </P>

<P>Through readings and a series of lectures by Smith faculty and guests, we examine the history and influences out of which landscape studies is emerging. We look at the relationship of this new field with literary and cultural studies, art, art history, landscape architecture, history, biological and environmental sciences. What is landscape studies? Where does it come from? Why is it important? How does it relate to, for instance, landscape painting and city planning? How does it link political and aesthetic agendas? What is its role in current sustainability debates and initiatives among architects, landscape architects, planners and engineers? Students may take this course twice for credit. S/U only. Credits: 2 </P>
</Sect>

<P>Normally offered each spring </P>

<P>2. Academic Core (four courses) </P>

<P>In consultation with their advisers, students choose four courses from among the many food-related courses offered by the Five Colleges (see examples listed in the Courses section). The four courses must span at least two of three divisions (humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering). </P>

<P>3. Practicum Experiences </P>

<P>The concentration requires students to pursue two practicum experiences, which can include internships, projects on campus, and volunteer and paid work. </P>

<P>4. Capstone Course </P>

<P>This course (below) will be offered through the fall of 2020. Students wishing to pursue the environmental concentration in sustainable food must have clear plans to ensure that they can take this capstone course. </P>

<P>The environmental science and policy (ES&amp;P) major is designed for students with interests in the environment and sustainability and a commitment to scientifically-based problem solving and policy analysis. The objectives of the major are to prepare students to transcend disciplinary boundaries, combine analytical and communication skills with a well-rounded understanding of the environment, and translate this knowledge into meaningful action and innovative solutions. Four integration courses form the intellectual and organizational core of the major. Each course brings together frameworks, proficiencies and knowledge from natural and social sciences in an explicitly integrative fashion to explore and analyze important environmental topics at local, regional, national and global levels. Additional introductory courses provide breadth in the natural and social sciences, humanities, and statistics, and introduce students to fundamental aspects of disciplines important to understanding human-environment interactions. Students gain depth of knowledge by choosing a coherent sequence of electives with a clear environmental focus. Students are strongly encouraged to engage in environmentally oriented internships, independent research or study-away opportunities. Prospective majors should consult with an ES&amp;P faculty adviser in choosing their courses. In their first semesters, students are encouraged to enroll in one of the introductory courses (see list) and an appropriate integration course (101), as well as statistics. </P>

<P>Requirements: The ES&amp;P major requires 14 courses. These include the following: </P>

<P>ENV 101 Sustainability and Social-Ecological Systems </P>

<P>We have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, characterized by the accelerating impact of human activities on the Earth’s ecosystems. All over the globe, humans have transformed the environment and have sometimes created catastrophic dynamics within social-ecological systems. Scientists have studied these phenomena for decades, alerting both the general public and policy-makers of the consequences of our actions. However, despite convincing evidence of environmental degradation, humans continue to radically transform their environment. This course explores this puzzle and asks how we can remodel our social-ecological systems to build a more sustainable and resilient future. Enrollment limited to 60. {H} {N} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Andrew Berke </P>

<P>Normally offered each spring </P>

<P>ENV 150 Mapping Our World: An Introduction to Geographic Information Systems </P>

<P>Same as GEO 150. A geographic information system (GIS) enables data and maps to be overlain, queried and visualized in order to solve problems in many diverse fields. This course provides an introduction to the fundamental elements of GIS and applies the analysis of spatial data to issues in geoscience, environmental science and public policy. Students gain expertise in ArcGIS — the industry standard GIS software — and online mapping platforms, and carry out semester-long projects in partnership with local conservation organizations. Enrollment limited to 20. {N} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Denise Lello, Camille Washington-Ottombre </P>

<P>Normally offered both fall and spring semesters </P>

<P>ENV 224 Anthropos in the Anthropocene: Human-Environment Relations in a Time of Ecological Crisis </P>

<P>Same as ANT 224. Anthropology seeks to understand human life in all its complexity, but what constitutes “the human” is far from straightforward. This course examines the changing ways that “Anthropos” is being understood in an era of rapid global climate change and our planet’s sixth mass extinction event, both driven by human activities. We review perspectives on the relationship between humans and their environment from various cultural perspectives, considering how they engage notions of race, class, and gender, and what they imply for nature conservation. Topics include modernity, pets, cyborgs, kinship, symbiosis, extinction, species invasions, settler colonialism, and the Anthropocene concept. Enrollment limit of 30. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Colin B Hoag </P>

<P>Normally offered each fall </P>

<P>ENV 230 Colloquium: Environment and Society in Contemporary China </P>

<P>China faces a range of environmental challenges in the 21st century: air pollution, water contamination, food scarcity, energy management and deforestation. The course considers these environmental issues, examining how they have come about; the Chinese response to them; their global impact; and the measures being proposed—and taken—to address them. Environmental issues are placed in the context of the social, economic and political changes that have occurred in China during the past few decades: economic growth, globalization, urbanization, population migration and media expansion. Finally, the course considers China’s traditional attitudes toward nature and the environment, and asks what role those attitudes play today. Enrollment limited to 18. {H} {N} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Daniel K. Gardner </P>

<P>Normally offered each academic year </P>

<P>ENV 275 Decoding the Experts: Modeling the Impact of Climate Change </P>

<P>The U.S. estimates the cost of carbon is $37/ton. Is this estimate too low? Too high? What will emission reductions cost? This course is a cooperative research effort to understand and evaluate the Integrated Assessment Models used to estimate the costs and benefits of carbon emission reductions. We begin with the IPCC predictions of the physical impacts of climate change and then turn to the economic models that translate physical predictions into cost estimates. Emphasis on understanding and critiquing the logic of the models and learning how differing assumptions translate into a wide range of reported estimates. Enrollment limit of 20. (E) {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Expected to be offered in the next 3 years </P>

<P>ENV 311 Interpreting and Communicating Environmental Information </P>

<P>This course focuses on the interpretation and communication of environmental issues and solutions from multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives. Using contemporary environmental topics as a foundation, this course emphasizes careful assessment of both message and audience to design effective communication strategies for complex topics. Students develop the ability to read, interpret, and critique environmental research from a variety of disciplines; to consider the needs and motivation of their audience; to develop evidence-based arguments tailored to a particular audience; and to articulate those arguments clearly and concisely. Prerequisite: one semester of statistics. 101 and 201/202 are strongly recommended. Enrollment limited to 25. </P>

<P>ENV 312 Sustainable Solutions </P>

<P>This course is designed to develop a student’s abilities as an environmental problem solver through practice. The problems come in two forms: a campus or local problem related to environmental sustainability or resilience, and the problem of what to do with one’s life. To address each, students engage in a semester-long group project that addresses a real-world environmental issue or question (projects vary from year to year) and a more individualized examination of the student’s own values, career aspirations and skills. Student work is assessed via progress reports, exercises, class participation, an oral presentation and a final written report. Prerequisites: 101, a statistics course, 201/202 and 311 (311 may be taken concurrently). Enrollment limited to 16. </P>

<P>ENV 323 Climate and Energy Policy </P>

<P>This course examines climate change and energy policy from several perspectives including scientific, economic, equity, political and practical considerations. We examine sources and trends of greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts and then focus on a specific sector (e.g., electric power) to consider existing policies, market structures and the spectrum of approaches to reduce emissions. Students work in small groups on projects in an active policy area and prepare a briefing and memo. Prerequisite: ENV 101 or permission of the instructor. (E) {N} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>ENV 326 Seminar: Natural Resource Management and Environmental Justice in the US and the Global South </P>

<P>This course will examine the connections between natural resource management and environmental justice in the US and the Global South. We will study the benefits and limits of traditional top-down approaches to the management of forests, land, fisheries, biodiversity, underground resources, water, food, and genomes in different parts of the world. By discussing case studies of environmental justice issues from tar sands mining in Alberta to the impact of biofuels and GMOs on local populations in Mexico, students will question and rethink the management of natural resources.

<P>FMS 150 Introduction to Film and Media Studies </P>

<P>This course introduces students to FMS through units that pair four scholarly approaches with four influential media forms: the Aesthetics of Film, the History of Television, the Ideologies of Video Games, and the Technologies of Internet Media. Through these units, we will ask: what human desires animate our relationship with media? For what purposes have people invented and evolved these technologies? How do makers use them, and what are audiences seeking in them? These questions will help us see the fundamental forces that unite film, television, video games, and Internet media alongside the elements that distinguish them from each other. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 234 Cinema by Other Means </P>

<P>This course explores articulations of “cinema” in materials other than those typically associated with the film medium. Recasting the medium as a practice, an idea, and a cultural episteme, we’ll try to think beyond received wisdom about what the “cinema” is. We’ll investigate a broad range of unconventional works: from science fiction to the proto-filmic projections of the historical avantgarde; musique concrète; and the radical exhibition and film-performance practices of the postwar period, including militant film practice in the so-called Third World. We will also devote a week to discussing works on view in the Smith College Museum of Art. (E) {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 235 Listening to Cinema </P>

<P>This course explores the sound worlds of narrative, experimental and documentary cinema. Emphasis is placed on critical listening with regular sound exercises and focused analysis of individual films. Topics addressed include the aesthetics and politics of listening; sound design; the voice; film music; and the history of sound technology. The first half of the course will be devoted to sound theory and practice, with sound-oriented readings drawn from disparate fields including philosophy, film theory, musicology and short fiction. In the second half, we will undertake an historical survey of sound technology since the late nineteenth century. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

We will exhume the cinema’s prehistory in motion studies, optical toys, and popular entertainments such as magic lantern shows and wax museums; then survey the critical reception of early cinema and major theoretical debates about the specificity of the film medium. The second half of the course addresses reception in more depth. Topics may include non-Western exhibition practices; African-American filmmaking and spectatorship; gender, sex and censorship; historical and contemporary practices of silent film music; and the afterlife of silent cinema in contemporary art. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 237 The Documentary Impulse </P>

<P>The drive to represent reality has animated media makers throughout history. In the service of this urgent, impossible ambition, documentarians have used myriad forms of media and produced some of each form’s most complex works. This course examines how they have done so, concentrating on different approaches to documentary (observational, ethnographic, essayistic, autobiographical), and considering work in photography, film, television, radio/ podcasts, websites and virtual reality. Throughout the semester, we interrogate the boundaries of the documentary mode; the unique ethical considerations of doing documentary work; and the social, cultural and technological factors that shape documentary’s history and current practice. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot (1959), Mann’s Lover Come Back (1961) and the Coen Brothers’ Intolerable Cruelty (2003). We will examine the genre in its historical context and examine elements of the system studios, writers, producers, clothes and set designers, actors that produced this astonishingly witty and short-lived film genre. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 243 After the End of the World: Transnational/Transmedia Studies in Science Fiction </P>

<P>Perhaps no genre has addressed the prospect of the world’s end more fully than science fiction. In many science fiction narratives, the end of the world spells disaster. A future is imagined in which sinister forces threaten the continuation of life as we know it. In other narratives, leaving the world behind may represent a kind of liberation: from the tedium of everyday life, or from oppressive contemporary social and political systems. This course presents a series of investigations focused on compelling moments, themes and expressions within the wider universe of science fiction. Each case study enables us to imagine the world’s end from a different perspective. Each also demands that we carry out our investigation across and between various forms of media. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

Since the advent of synchronous sound film, the musical has become one of the global film industry’s most enduring and profitable genres. What has made the musical so successful the world over? Though much critical and scholarly attention has been paid to the Hollywood studio-era musicals of the 1930s–’50s, the scope of our investigation is global and our focus is on more recent iterations of the genre. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 246 The Western and American Identity after World War II </P>

<P>This class examines the relation of perhaps the defining American film genre to questions of both American cinema and American identity. How are Westerns reflective and symptomatic of vital issues in United States history and culture? How does the genre help shape and define how Americans think of themselves? How did the genre change over the post-war period, and what does this tell us about the changing needs, ideas, and ideologies of both American filmmaking and the United States itself? We consider the classical films of John Ford and the revisionist work of Sam Peckinpah and Robert Altman, as well as other canonical Westerns, considering the way they were used to think through historical and cultural events like the Red Scare, Civil Rights and the development of a more robust Queer Public Sphere. We also consider more recent developments and changes in the genre as produced by Reagan’s tenure as the Cowboy President (including US foreign policy in Latin America) and, currently, shifts in the genre affected by digital technology and the Age of New Media. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 247 American Film and Culture from the Depression to the Sixties </P>

<P>This course explores the relationship between film and culture during some of the most crucial decades of &quot;The American Century.&quot; It looks at the evolving connection between films and their audiences, the extent to which films are symptomatic of as well as influential on historical periods, major events and social movements, and the ways in which film genres evolve in relation to both cultural change and the rise and fall of the Hollywood studio system. Among the questions we'll consider: How did the Depression have an impact on Hollywood film style and form? How were evolving ideas about American motherhood puzzled out in American cinema of the period? What were some of the important differences between the way mainstream U.S. cinema and European film represented World War II? How did Civil Rights and the Red Scare become appropriate topics for Westerns? Did the lighthearted veneer of the fluffy sex comedies of the sixties actually hide some serious questions about labor, independent female subjectivity and heteronormativity? Particular and sustained attention will be paid to relations among gender, genre, race and class. {A} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>A survey of women in American films from the silent period to the present, examining: 1) how women are represented on film, and how those images relate to actual contemporaneous American society, culture, and politics; 2) how theoretical formulations, expectations, and realities of female spectatorship relate to genre, the star and studio systems (and other production and distribution modes), dominant and alternative codes of narration, and developments in digital and new media modes; and 3) how women as stars, writers, producers, and directors shape and respond to, work within and against, dominant considerations of how women look (in every sense). {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 249 Queer Cinema/Queer Media </P>

<P>From the queer avant-garde of Kenneth Anger and Su Friedrich, to The Kids Are All Right and Glee, the queer in film and television is often conflated with gay and lesbian representation on screen. Instead of collapsing queer cinema into a representational politics of gay and lesbian film and television, we look at theories and practices that uphold what queerness means in a contemporary framework of America neoliberalism and transnational media. Screenings include the New Queer Cinema classics Paris Is Burning, It Wasn't Love and Poison, and work by multimedia artists including Shu Lea Cheang, Issac Julien, Carmelita Tropicana and PJ Raval. Readings by Alexander Doty, Thomas Elsaesser, Kobena Mercer, Jasbir Puar, B. Ruby Rich, J. Halberstam, Jose E. Munoz, Chris Straayer and Hayden White. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 250 Global Cinema After World War II </P>

<P>The post-war period was a time of increasing globalization, which brought about a more interconnected and international film culture. But it was also a time during which certain key national cinemas defined, or redefined, themselves. This course examines both trends, as well as focuses on the work and influence of significant directors and landmark films, emphasizing not only cinematic and cultural specificity, but also cross-cultural, and transhistorical concerns. What makes a film Italian or Brazilian or British? How does national identity help shape any country’s cinema, and how do films help shape national identity? How do films circulate through other cultures and what kinds of conversations do films from one nation or culture have with others? How and when is the idea of nation a counterproductive way to think about cinema? How do ideas of history and self inform cinema, and vice versa? How do we need to adjust our own spectatorship as we engage with films from other places and times? We examine films, filmmakers, and film movements including: Italian Neo-realism, French New Wave, New German Cinema, Brazilian Cinema Novo, Chinese Fifth Generation, Hong Kong Action Cinema, and the films of Ousmane Sembene, Thomas Gutierrez Aléa, Satyajit Ray, Akira Kurosawa, Julie Dash and Spike Lee.

<P>FMS 260 Digital Media and Participatory Culture </P>

<P>Among the claims made for the newness of new media is the assertion that new media are interactive, turning the passive consumers of “old” media into active, engaged participants. This course explores the shape of this technologically-enabled “participatory culture” and will also investigate cracks in the foundation of the alleged digital utopia. To what extent are new technologies democratizing and to what extent do they offer new forms of surveillance and control to the powers that be? What social and economic factors govern “convergence culture?” How have fan cultures evolved as their material networks of conventions and zines go digital? {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 261 Video Games and the Politics of Play </P>

<P>An estimated 63% of U.S. households have members who play video games regularly, and game sales routinely exceed film box office figures. As this medium grows in cultural power, it is increasingly important to think about how games make meaning. This course serves as an introduction to Game Studies, equipping students with the vocabulary to analyze video games, surveying the medium’s genres, and sampling this scholarly discipline’s most influential theoretical writing. The particular focus, though, is on the ideology operating beneath the surface of these popular entertainment objects and on the ways in which video games enter political discourse.

<P>FMS 265 Film in the Digital Age </P>

<P>Film, a dominant entertainment form in the twentieth century, faces sweeping changes in the twenty-first. Digital technologies are widely replacing film cameras and projectors, theatrical exhibition continues to decline as audiences watch movies on smaller and smaller screens, and the list of other entertainment forms competing for the public’s attention grows longer each year. Appropriating Peter Greenaway’s provocation, “Cinema is dead, long live cinema,” this course will consider the challenge digital media present to film’s primacy, but also the ways in which film has survived and thrived during this and previous periods of dramatic technological change.

<P>FMS 270 Making Knowledge </P>

<P>This colloquium examines the life cycle of knowledge making: studying what it means to produce knowledge, how one decides how (and with whom) to share one’s knowledge, and the implications of having the privilege to engage in such projects. We study a range of questions: Who desires knowledge, and why? When do data and information become knowledge? How does knowledge become wisdom? Students work collaboratively and independently on public scholarship projects, develop expertise in digital critique and seminar style discussion, and present work to a range of different publics.

<P>FMS 285 Screenwriting </P>

<P>This class explores modes of screenwriting that give weight to cinematic elements usually ignored by orthodox screenplay form. We treat the pictorial and audio-visual as content rather than mere style, and we explore ways to write the visual in addition to dialogue. Throughout the class, the emphasis for student writing is on personal content and human-scaled stories rather than historical film genres. Weekly writing exercises includes both original content and scenes for established characters in finished films or TV shows. There are also specific technical exercises built on structural film elements like time-lapse, etc. A first workshop in narrative screenwriting. Weekly short writing assignments and in-class workshops of student scenes. Longer final project. Prerequisite: FMS 150 Introduction to Film and Media Studies (may also be taken concurrently).

<P>FMS 290 Theories and Methods of Film and Media Studies </P>

<P>This course is designed to give FMS majors and minors a solid grounding in the primary methods of our field. In other words, what are the broad approaches scholars have taken to the study of media, and what specific methodological strategies have proved most effective? We begin with theory as one such method—one that zooms out to ask broad questions about the essential nature of a medium. Our history unit shifts the focus to how media are impacted by and implicated in the progression of time and culture. Finally, our criticism unit features strategies for analyzing individual media objects. Prerequisite: FMS 150. Enrollment limit of 15. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 345 Violence, Mortality and the Moving Image </P>

<P>If cinema is, as André Bazin writes, “change mummified,” violence and death are among the most dramatic physical changes it can “mummify.” This course studies the long, complex relationship between cinema and these bodily spectacles. How has censorship impacted the way violence has been screened? How can cameras make the internal processes of death externally visible? What are the ethics of filming “real” violence and death in a documentary mode? How are cultural attitudes toward violence and death reflected in and shaped by films? As a cautionary note, this course necessarily includes graphic representations of violence and death. Prerequisites: FMS 150. Enrollment limit of 12. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Film and Visual Culture from Surrealism to the Digital Age </P>

<P>This class investigates the moving image and its relationship to the rest of 20th and 21st century art, especially visual culture. Working with the premise that film has been arguably the most influential, powerful and central creative medium of the age, the course examines how film has been influenced by, and how it has influenced, interacted with, critiqued, defined, and been defined by other media. Historically we examine how film has moved from a marginal to a mainstream art form, while still often maintaining a very active avant-garde practice. We’ll look at how cinema and other moving images have consistently and trans-historically grappled with certain fundamental issues and themes, comparing the nature of cinematic investigations with those of other media. Over the course of the semester, we shall also attend to the idea of “film” in relation to the larger category of “moving image.” {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<Sect>
<P>Richard H. Millington, Helen and Laura Shedd Professor of English Languages and Literature, Director </P>

<P>First-Year Seminars are interdisciplinary courses that enable faculty and first-year students to engage in extensive inquiry about an issue, topic or problem. First-Year Seminars are writing intensive and focused on the seminar-style of investigation; they are not survey courses or introductions to a specific discipline. They afford the faculty and students an opportunity to explore a subject broadly and intensively. </P>

<P>First-Year Seminars are voluntary, but we encourage students to enroll in them since they aim to give new students a unique introduction to college-level learning. First-Year Seminars are small (normally 16 students) and are restricted to first-year students. They incorporate the development of intellectual capacities that form the foundation of a successful liberal arts education. In addition to focusing on writing, the seminars help students develop some or all of the following skills: critical thinking, speaking, research and working independently and collaboratively. First-Year Seminars are also effective in showing students how to integrate student support services into their academic pursuits. </P>

<P>FYS 100 My Music: Writing Musical Lives </P>

<P>This first-year seminar begins with an exploration of our own musical lives. What does the particular constellation of material that we call “My Music” tell us about who we are, where we come from, and how we relate to the world? After analyzing and comparing musical lives within the class, we will read selected case studies and collaboratively design a musical biography project. Each student will curate one person’s musical life story, gathering data through oneon-one interviews, weaving together their interlocutor’s words with their own interpretations, and ultimately reflecting on what they have learned from the experience. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 101 The Lives of Animals: Literature and the Nonhuman </P>

<P>In this course, we will track animals across a range of poems, stories, novels, essays, and films that try to imagine what it is like not to be human. From stories of people transforming into animals to texts that insist that we have no clue what animals really feel, we will consider the various ways that writers distinguish—or refuse to distinguish—humans from other animals. Why, we will ask, are literature and art so haunted by animal life? We will discuss zoos, pets, fables, cartoons, animal rights, vegetarianism, anthropocentrism, and extinction. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 103 Geology in the Field </P>

<P>Clues to over 500 million years of earth history can be found in rocks and sediments near Smith College. Students in this course attempt to decipher this history by careful examination of field evidence. Class meetings take place principally outdoors at interesting geological localities around the Connecticut Valley. Participants prepare regular reports based on their observations and reading, building to a final paper on the geologic history of the area. The course normally includes a weekend field trip to Cape Cod. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {N} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 107 Women of the Odyssey </P>

<P>Homer’s Odyssey presents a gallery of memorable women: Penelope above all, but also Nausicaa, Calypso and Circe. Helen plays a cameo role, while Clytemnestra is regularly invoked as a negative example. Together these women define a spectrum of female roles and possibilities: the faithful wife, the bride-tobe, the temptress, the adulteress, the murderer. We begin with a careful reading of the Odyssey, then study the afterlife of its female characters in the Western literary tradition. Readings are drawn from authors both ancient (Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Ovid) and modern (H.D., Robert Graves, Louise Glück, Margaret Drabble). This course counts toward the classics, classical studies and study of women and gender majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>This course explores interdisciplinary approaches to the search for life in the Universe by using the Earth as a natural laboratory. We will address fundamental questions surrounding the formation of our solar system and the first appearance of life, the definition of life and how we can search for it elsewhere, and the biases we introduce by using Earth as a model system. The goal of this class is to present a multidisciplinary view of exobiology by integrating geology, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and physics. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

<P>We examine what the Bible (and to some extent the broader Jewish and Christian traditions) have to say about controversial issues that have divided Americans in the past (e.g., slavery) and present (e.g., abortion). The aim is to give students the skills to assess critically various arguments that invoke the Bible or religious tradition and authority, wherever they come from on the political spectrum. Students are introduced to the Bible and biblical scholarship, as well as learn about different understandings of biblical authority and views of applying the Bible to contemporary political and ethical debates. This course counts toward the Jewish studies and religion majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {H} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>This seminar will explore representations of health and illness in writing by women of the African diaspora from the nineteenth century to the present. Our authors hail from Antigua, Bermuda, Canada, Guadeloupe, and the United States, and their interventions (ideological and geographical) engage an even broader territory. We will ask how women novelists, memoirists, poets, and playwrights (some of them health care professionals) challenge, support, influence, and/or respond to contemporary medical theories of health and illness. We will also make use of archival and digital resources at Smith. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

Students write three papers, each focusing on the dynamics of Cuban society and relations with the United States, covering three time periods: pre-1959, 1959–88 and 1989– present.

<P>FYS 137 Of Minds and Molecules: Philosophical Perspectives on Chemistry and Biochemistry </P>

<P>What is the “shape,” “size,” or “color” of a smell? We often use vision as a metaphor when describing our perceptions from our other senses, but does this limit what we perceive? How do the (often visual) models that chemists use, and the metaphors that are associated with those models, affect what chemists study? For example, what do we mean when we speak of molecular “switches” or “brakes”? How do the metaphors and the kinds of languages that chemists use differ from those used in the arts? Is chemistry a single discipline, sharing a common language? Is it even an autonomous discipline at all, or is it reducible to physics? We will explore these questions from a philosophical perspective, using examples drawn primarily from chemistry and biochemistry. The course is designed for first-year students who would like to explore current conceptual issues that challenge some of the common beliefs about science.

<P>In Reacting students learn by taking on roles, in elaborate games set in the past; they learn skills—speaking, writing, critical thinking, problem solving, leadership, and teamwork—in order to prevail in complicated situations. Reacting roles do not have a fixed script and outcome. While students adhere to the intellectual beliefs of the historical figures they have been assigned, they must devise their own means of expressing those ideas in papers, speeches or public presentations. Class sessions are run entirely by students; instructors guide students and grade their oral and written work. It draws students into the past, promotes engagement with big ideas, and improves intellectual and academic skills. Enrollment limited to 24 first-year students. WI {H} Credits: 5 </P>

<P>We will examine contemporary girls’ adventure in novels and films. These fictions rework the classic patterns of “boys’ books” to create heroic girls meant to inspire young female readers. We begin with two classic 19th-century boys' books to situate our readings of contemporary girls’ adventures. We will focus on the structure of the girls’ adventure landscape by creating maps and writing blog posts for each fiction asking questions such as: What significant boundaries do the fictions imagine? What gender and class ideas do they enforce? How do boy and girl heroes differ? What does a girl hero do? Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

Field experiences are complemented by readings, quantitative work with GIS, engagement with local historical collections and resources, participation in local events, and class discussions. Students in the course will learn about the place in which they are living by exploring its cultural landscape history as it relates to the river that run through us.

<P>This course explores the island as a mythical blank space, a paradise, a no-man's land that encourages humankind's &quot;primordial&quot; impulses. We associate islands with adventure, wilderness, freedom, magic, dystopia and utopia. In the cultural imaginary, the island exists to be invented, discovered, and reinvented. We will consider a wide range of texts (and some films) from the isles of the Odyssey (home to seductive goddesses, a fairy-tale virgin princess, giant cannibals, and lotus addicts) to Prospero’s magic kingdom, Swift’s Lilliput, Peter Pan’s Neverland, Golding’s man-made dystopia (Lord of the Flies), Jean Rhys’s Jamaica (Wide Sargasso Sea), and Jamaica Kincaid’s Antigua (A Small Place).

<P>Although German immigrants faded as a distinct ethnic group in American society after World War I, American popular culture has consistently been fascinated with German-ness and all the strange and intriguing images it evokes. This course will explore the profound influence of German culture in the U.S. as well as the response of American popular culture to this influence in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will examine, among other things, various films, such as The Big Lebowski, Blazing Saddles, Dr. Strangelove and many others, as well as TV series such as The Simpsons, The X-Files, Saturday Night Live and more.

<P>FYS 160 The End of the World as We Know It: The Post-Apocalyptic Novel </P>

<P>We explore a wide range of literary scenarios that depict the collapse of civilization in the wake of plague-like disease and/or nuclear war. The motif of the post-Apocalyptic novel has become common, yet its roots go back as far (and further than) Jack London’s The Scarlet Plague and Mary Shelley’s The Last Man. In the works we will be examining, we witness the attempts of the few survivors of catastrophe to create a new world, or merely to live in a world in which the past casts a vast shadow over the present. The society that comes forth from these worlds can be anarchic, dystopic, utopian or a combination of these. Some works we explore include Alas, Babylon; On the Beach; Riddley Walker; The Postman; A Canticle for Leibowitz; The Chrysalids; The Road and others. Film adaptations are shown as part of the course. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

We explore the dark world-view and desperate religion of the Vikings from the creation of the world to the end of time, including relations between living and dead, male and female, animals and humans, gods and giants, Æsir and Vanir—a crowded universe of trolls, elves, witches, dwarfs, valkyries, berserks, shapeshifters and various kinds of human being. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 173 Through the Green: Reading the Landscape of Golf </P>

<P>The game of golf is an experience shaped by (bio)-mechanics, sociocultural contexts, historical conditions, and the landscape of the course itself. In this seminar, we will focus primarily on the environmental and sociocultural conditions of play. This approach takes in race, class, gender and bodies, the historical scope of golf in the United States, its roots to Scotland and its global appeal. Additionally, we will explore the landscape and layout of the golf course itself. Here we will examine the architectural renderings of courses ranging from recreational spaces to the privileged environs of renowned courses built by world class architects.

<P>FYS 174 Merging and Converging Cultures: What Is Gained and Lost in Translation? </P>

<P>By reaching across linguistic and cultural barriers, this course fosters understanding of different worldviews and introduces students to the varied field of translation in order to develop their critical thinking skills and broaden their intercultural awareness. Translation is a fundamental human activity; the way individuals perceive the world influences their interpretation and understanding of all communication. Traditional forms of translations and interpretation will be studied along with adaptation/transformation of literary texts into films and different art forms. Topics studied include: translation, theories, ethics of translation, invisibility/visibility of translators, transculturation, subtitling and dubbing, machine translation and globalization. Competence in a language other than English or enrollment in a foreign language course is not required, but highly recommended. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 177 The Tranquil(ized) Fifties </P>

<P>In popular culture and some political discourse, the 1950s appear as a lost paradise of a decade, a time of peace and prosperity, a golden age from which American culture has fallen. Any serious examination of the period, though, reveals not the fact of tranquility so much as the act of tranquilizing as Cold War tensions roiled internationally and political and social unrest continually erupted in the domestic sphere. Studying selected works of art and literature from the 1950s, this course explores some key episodes of this dynamic of conflict and conformity. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

<P>FYS 184 Educating Women: A History and Sociology, at Home and Abroad </P>

<P>In the United States and abroad, in the past and today, the nature and scope of women's education are deeply connected to religious, economic, and social norms and beliefs. Why and how we educate women are interdisciplinary questions that draw in fascinating ways on issues of national identity and culture. In this seminar, we will explore the history and sociology of this subject, beginning in our own country, at the very start of America's public school system, and ending with a global perspective, considering the challenges of educating women in countries where female literacy is still deeply contested. Students will do in depth research in the Sophia Smith collection and college archives. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 185 Style Matters: The Power of the Aesthetic in Italian Cinema </P>

<P>Examining Italian cinema from neorealism to today, this course investigates how major directors have negotiated two apparently independent postwar traditions: the aesthetic of realism (which purports to show Italian society and landscape without embellishments) and that search for beauty and style which has historically characterized Italian civilization and become its trademark in today’s global culture (Made in Italy). We study the Italian pinups of postwar cinema, the Latin lover figure, representations of Fascism, the Bel Paese myth, portraits of the lower classes and the immigrants. Directors include Amelio, Antonioni, Bertolucci, De Santis, De Sica, Germi, Moretti, Ozpetek, Pasolini, Sorrentino and Visconti. Conducted in English. Films with English subtitles. This course counts toward the film and media studies and Italian studies majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {A} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Why do people collect things and what do they collect? Members of this seminar explore these questions by focusing on local museums and exhibitions. From a behind-the-scenes look at the Smith College Museum of Art to an examination of hidden gems like the botanical sciences herbarium collection or that cabinet of curiosities which is Mount Holyoke’s Skinner Museum, we research the histories of these collections and analyze the rationale of varying systems for ordering objects. By learning the critical skills of visual analysis and by grappling with the interpretations of art historians, anthropologists and psychologists, we attempt to come to an understanding of how knowledge is constructed in the context of display and how visual juxtapositions can generate meaning.

<P>In this course, students study fiction, memoir, slam poetry and hip-hop authored by residents of France’s multi-ethnic suburbs and housing projects, also known as the banlieues and cités. We examine the question of whether banlieue authors can escape various pressures: to become native informants; to write realistic rather than fantastical novels; to leave the “ghetto”; to denounce the sometimes difficult traditions, religions, neighborhoods and family members that have challenged but also molded them. Often seen as spaces of regression and decay, the banlieues nevertheless produce vibrant cultural expressions that beg the question: Is the banlieue a mere suburb of French cultural life, or more like one of its centers? {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

How did the concept of the foreigner evolve as confrontations with other nations, other religions, other ethnicities put into question France’s conception of its own society and culture?

And how are we, today, to judge this historical period and those who lived through it? Students experience this difficult period through a global simulation in which each creates a character with a specific identity and past—a secret collaborator, a Jewish immigrant, a resistance fighter, a closeted homosexual, an avant-garde artist, a reporter, the widow of a soldier who fought under Maréchal Pétain in WWI—and representing the diversity of the Parisian population at the time. Each student writes her character’s “memoirs” reacting to historical as well as personal events from her unique perspective.

A novel (Les Misérables), an autofiction (L’Immoraliste), a theater play (Les Justes), and a film script (Hiroshima mon amour) provide us with four venues for examining and debating which values are at stake, what questions they bring up and what answers, if any, they provide.

What access did women have to education and to the works of other writers, male and female? To what extent did women writers question the traditional gender roles of their society? How did they represent female characters in their works and what do their statements about authorship reveal about their understanding of themselves as writing women? What do we make of anonymous works written in the feminine voice? Readings include the love letters of Héloïse, the lais and fables of Marie de France, the songs of the trobairitz and women trouvères, and the writings of Christine de Pizan. {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Social Networking in Early Modern France–A Digital Humanities Approach </P>

<P>How did social networks connect people who shared common interests and activities in early modern France? How did good taste, galanterie and wit, still crucial to French identity and sociability today, take root? In this course, students will examine the social practices, spaces and networks that defined French society, politically and culturally, from the height of the Ancien Régime up to the French Revolution. Students will also be exposed to digital humanities methods and theories, combining the study and praxis of these approaches, in order to reflect on how their use of digital tools and &quot;virtual&quot; teamwork change the ways in which they produce, share and disseminate knowledge. {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Marie Antoinette's Semiotic Body </P>

<P>Naïve pawn in European geopolitics or political intriguer? Fashion leader or obsessive consumer? Scandalous pleasure seeker or devoted mother? French Queen or Austrian spy? Instigator of the French Revolution or innocent victim? More than two hundred years after her execution, Marie Antoinette continues to fascinate, caught between history and myth and open to conflicting interpretations. How can we understand the persona behind or in the body that proliferated so many meanings? How can we trace the origins and the impacts of those meanings? Does Marie Antoinette’s semiotic body continue to signify for us? We'll examine Marie Antoinette from a variety of perspectives: archival sources, documents and letters, biographies, portraits, both official and unofficial, caricatures, pornographic pamphlets, and fictional works such as plays, novels and films in which she figures. The course will incorporate a role-playing unit reenacting her trial, during which every member of the class will play the role of one of the important participants.

<P>FRN 343 Cultural Wars at the Theater </P>

<P>What effects does theater have on its audience and society at large? Does it corrupt the public and society, as J.-J. Rousseau argued, or on the contrary, can it morally reform its audience and society, as Diderot believed? The debate about the moral and political uses and misuses of theater animated the public, the philosophes and their critics, as well as the state, from the mid-17th century until the Révolution, and on to today. We will study the way authors, critics and the theater itself responded to the debate, from the classical drama of Racine and Molière, to the street theater of the Paris fairs and the influence of the Comédie italienne, from the new genres of the drame bourgeois to the liberation of the theater during the Revolution, and in the 20th and 21st centuries from the uses of theatre to resist the German occupation during WWII to the recent debate about the censoring of a new staging of Voltaire's Le Fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète, and the contemporary theatre of Ariane Mnouchkine which aims to raise the political consciousness of an audience to the crisis of global migration today. There will be a number of film screenings. </P>

<P>Food, Hunger, Memory: Literature of the Caribbean </P>

<P>Food and its absence are persistent themes in Caribbean literature. Cooking and culinary practices serve as a means of preserving cultural identities, yet can also reinforce colonial visions of the Caribbean as an exoticized space. Hunger figures as an indictment of that colonial history and of contemporary global inequities. Through studies of folk tales, short stories, poetry and novels, this course offers an introduction to the literature and major theoretical movements of Guadeloupe, Martinique and Haiti, with a focus on how cultural memory is inscribed in metaphors of consumption. {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

Students examine both cultural productions and social science texts: memoirs, psychoanalytical literature, activist statements, sociological studies, feature films, fashion, performance art, blogs and news reports. France has historically been the leading European host country for immigrants, a multiplicity of origins reflected in its current demographic make-up. Topics include: the hyper-sexualization of black and brown bodies, France as a Mediterranean culture, immigrant loneliness in Europe, intermarriage and demographic change, the veil and niqab, as well as sexual nationalism and homo-nationalism. {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>France in America What is l’Amérique française? What is the nature of the French-American relationship, historically and today? During recent Franco-American culture wars, France and the United States seemed to be polar opposites. Yet at one time, people in New England and Louisiana spoke French, lived and laughed in French, cried and died in French. Must French now be translated in America? Through what cultural mechanisms is Frenchness expressed by Americans? In what language(s) does one write French America today? We will answer such questions in our exploration of the French experience of North America from the 16th to the 21st century. {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>French Travel Writing and Self-Discovery </P>

<P>A survey of Francophone travel writing from the 16th to the 21st centuries. Students are exposed to a literary form that achieved popularity and cultural prestige early on, was then significantly challenged and diversified, and is presently enjoying a resurgence. We consider fictional and nonfictional accounts reflecting various geographies of travel and migration. While early voyagers tended to assert the relative superiority of French culture, subsequent generations of travelers abandoned discovery for self-discovery, and critiqued colonialism instead of indigenous cultures. Countries and regions surveyed include the Holy Land, Turkey, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Central and West Africa, the United States, Iran, France, Indonesia and Thailand. {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Same as LSS 288. The work of certain writers —often women and often Wharton, von Arnim and Colette— is categorized as small in scope, narrowly focused and therefore marginal in some ways. Here are questions, based in part on readings in landscape and domestic design theory, that we can ask to help us see their work differently: When and how is it appropriate to juxtapose writers’ biographies on their fiction? How do they represent domestic discord — loss, rage, depression— in their fiction? In particular, how do local landscapes and other domestic spaces—houses, rooms, gardens — figure in this representation? Texts include novels, short stories, correspondence, excerpts from journals, and other autobiographical writing: Prerequisite: one other literature course at any level, or permission of the instructor.

<P>FYS 141 Reading, Writing and Placemaking: Landscape Studies </P>

<P>Landscape studies is the interdisciplinary consideration of how we view, define and use the land, whether it be our backyard, a moonscape or a national park. How does land become a landscape? How does space become a place? Scientists study and manipulate landscapes as do politicians, builders, hunters, children, artists and writers, among others. In this course, we examine how writers, in particular, participate in placemaking, and how the landscape influences and inhabits literary texts. The course includes some landscape history and theory, visits by people who study landscape from nonliterary angles, and the discovery of how landscape works in texts in transforming and surprising ways.

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>Astronomy and Public Policy </P>

<P>This seminar explores the intersection of physical science, social science, psychology, politics and the environment. How do scientists, decision makers and the public communicate with each other, and how can scientists do better at it? What should the role of scientists be in advocacy and social movements? How does scientific information influence lifestyle and behavior choices among the public at large? We focus on three topics with close ties to astronomy: (1) global climate change, which involves basic atmospheric physics; (2) light pollution, which wastes billions of dollars per year and ruins our view of the starry sky without providing the safety it promises; and (3) controversial development of mountaintop observations such as the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea, HI. Throughout the course we will develop science communication skills using proven techniques borrowed from theater.

Yet, despite such labels and accolades she was a deeply independent individual who was not comfortable with the strictures of her fame. Although a graphic artist and sculptor, she was also a free-thinker who drew inspiration and insight from German and European culture. She was active in social and political causes of her time and wanted her art to effect real change in German society.

<P>The global financial institutions concentration (GFIC) combines academic courses, research and fieldwork to provide a rigorous study of global financial markets. Students acquire in-depth knowledge of the structure and operation of U.S. and world financial institutions. Through a sequence of six courses, two internships, and a workshop to develop appropriate computer skills, the GFX would specifically equip students with knowledge of the workings of financial institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank, central banks around the world, and private financial institutions as well as related financial regulations. Students could normally complete the requirements of GFX in three years. The concentration admits a maximum of 15 students each year, starting in their sophomore year. </P>

<H1>Program </H1>

<P>The Jean Picker Semester-in-Washington Program is a first-semester program open to Smith junior and senior government majors and to other Smith juniors and seniors with appropriate background in the social sciences. It provides students with an opportunity to study processes by which public policy is made and implemented at the national level. Students are normally resident in Washington from the June preceding the semester through December. </P>

<P>Applications for enrollment should be made through the director of the Semester-in-Washington Program no later than November 1 of the preceding year. Enrollment is limited to 12 students, and the program is not mounted for fewer than six. </P>

<P>This course provides the necessary background to integrate our modern understanding of judicial behavior into the realm of American Political Science. For centuries the prevailing wisdom was that judges merely applied the relevant law to the facts in evidence. Over the past seventy years a more nuanced analysis has emerged, and we are now very much inclined to attribute both bias and political motive to many of the holdings that courts issue.

We will also consider how the meaning of citizenship has been challenged and reformulated by those who have contested racialized hierarchies and exclusions. While this course will cover texts from early settlement and antebellum periods, focus will be on the modern era, from the late 19th century through the present, drawing on historical texts as well as political theory to analyze both race and U.S. citizenship. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>GOV 257 Colloquium: Refugee Politics </P>

<P>This course examines refugees—i.e., people displaced within their country, to another country or, perhaps, somewhere “in between.” Refugee politics prompt a consideration of the cause of refugee movements; persecution, flight, asylum and resettlement dynamics; the international response to humanitarian crises; and the “position” of refugees in the international system. In addition to international relations theory, the seminar focuses on historical studies, international law, comparative politics, refugee policy studies and anthropological approaches to displacement and “foreignness.” Although special attention is devoted to the Middle East, other cases of refugee politics are examined.

<P>Intelligence and National Security </P>

<P>How do governments learn about the threats facing them and their citizens? What is the proper balance between liberty and security in a democratic society? Why did the U.S. government fail to prevent the 9/11 attacks, and what can be done to ensure against such attacks in the future? This course considers these and other questions through the lens of the U.S. intelligence community. The modern American intelligence system was established in the wake of World War II, and has since grown to comprise seventeen different agencies requiring upwards of $80 billion per year in funding. We review the history of this system, both at home and abroad, with special attention to the Central Intelligence Agency and its often controversial role in U.S. foreign policy.

But the word utopia literally translates as &quot;nowhere land.&quot; This course will explore the question how the exploration of &quot;what could be&quot; has been and remains a central focus in the work of much of political theory. Serving as both an exemplar and a warning of planned political societies, utopian and dystopian literature is always engaged in the work of making, unmaking, and remaking the possibilities for the original political question, &quot;How should we govern?&quot; Enrollment limit of 25. </P>

<P>The Politics of Heterosexuality </P>

<P>This course explores the social and political construction of heterosexuality; it’s interaction with race, class and gender; and the queer resistances to heteronormativity that have formed to oppose it. Examining heterosexuality as a form of social and political privilege, we explore the ways in which it acts as a coercive yet successful cultural norm, often disappearing as a category of investigation altogether. Attention is paid to rendering visible the historical, political, economic and social forces that have contributed to the construction and maintenance of a coerced and coercive heterosexuality, while simultaneously exploring the uniqueness produced through the intersections of heterosexuality with race, class and gender. These intersections reveal the many ways that heteronormativity has been deployed as a form of political organization of the body politic, even as it produces multiple locations of resistance for politicized bodies. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The Political Theory of Michel Foucault </P>

<P>This course examines the work of Michel Foucault (1926–84), French philosopher, social critic, historian and activist, and generally acknowledged as one of the most influential of the thinkers whose work is categorized as poststructuralist. Foucault’s various inquiries into the production of knowledge and power have formed the paradoxically destabilizing foundation for much of the work on the status of the human subject in post-modernity. We explore the theoretically rich and dense approaches undertaken by Foucault, as well as illuminating his central ideas that seem to challenge much of what political theory accepts as a given. From The Birth of the Clinic, The Order of Things and Discipline and Punish to his later works including The History of Sexuality, The Use of Pleasure, and The Care of the Self, attention is given to how his works simultaneously advance and critique much of the canon of political theory.

<P>Politics, Wealth and Inequality </P>

<P>Since Plato and Aristotle, wealth inequality has been the subject of political interrogation. In the last 50 years, most economic benefits have gone to the top 1 percent of the population; corporations and the very rich have paid lower taxes and corporations have received more corporate support from government while federal, state and local budgets for social welfare programs have been cut and working people's salaries have fallen. This course examines and compares what contemporary political theorists and mainstream authors have to say about the connection between wealth, inequality and the health of a political system. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

In this course, we will take up the study of African American political thought both as political thinking generated by concrete historical experiences of enslavement, colonialism, violence, and resistance/resilience; but also, as political thinking that engages, challenges, and fundamentally shapes the core conceptual categories of modern political theory.

<P>HST 150 (L) The Historian's Craft </P>

<P>This course serves as an introduction to the study of History and to what historians do. It is a requirement for the History major. At the root of this course is the question of what is history and what it means to study history. Key questions driving the course are: Is history simply the study of the past? What is the past’s connection to the present? Is it even necessary to make such connections to the present and what is lost and gained in making such connections? {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FYS 142 Reacting to the Past </P>

<P>In Reacting students learn by taking on roles, in elaborate games set in the past; they learn skills—speaking, writing, critical thinking, problem solving, leadership, and teamwork—in order to prevail in complicated situations. Reacting roles do not have a fixed script and outcome. While students adhere to the intellectual beliefs of the historical figures they have been assigned, they must devise their own means of expressing those ideas in papers, speeches or public presentations. Class sessions are run entirely by students; instructors guide students and grade their oral and written work.

<P>HST 201 (L) The Silk Road and Premodern Eurasia </P>

<P>An introduction to major developments and interactions among people in Europe and Asia before modernity. The Silk Roads, long distance networks that allowed people, goods, technology, religious beliefs and other ideas to travel between China, India and Rome/Mediterranean, and the many points in between, developed against the backdrop of the rise and fall of steppe nomadic empires in Inner Asia. We examine these as interrelated phenomena that shaped Eurasian encounters to the rise of the world-conquering Mongols and the journey of Marco Polo. Topics include: horses, Silk and Steppe routes, Scythians and Huns, Han China and Rome, Byzantium, Buddhism, Christianity and other universal religions, Arabs and the rise of Islam, Turks, Mongol Empire, and medieval European trade, geography and travel. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The career and conquests of Alexander the Great (d. 323 B.C.) wrought far-reaching consequences for many in Europe, Asia and Africa. In the ensuing Hellenistic (Greek-oriented) commonwealth that spanned the Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia and India, Greco-Macedonians interacted with Egyptians, Babylonians, Jews, Iranians, Indians and Romans in ways that galvanized ideas and institutions such as the classical city as ideal community, cult of divine kings and queens, “fusion” literatures, mythologies and artistic canons and also provoked nativist responses such as the Maccabean revolt. Main topics include Greeks and “barbarians,” Alexander and his legacies, Hellenism as ideal and practice, conquerors and natives, kings and cities/regions, Greek science and philosophies, old and new gods.

<P>Anatomy of a Slave Revolt </P>

<P>During slavery, white Americans, especially U.S. slaveholders, feared the specter of insurrection. Uprisings at Stono or those led by Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner proved that slaves often fought back. Yet the central historiographical question remains: why didn’t U.S. slaves overthrow enslavement like Haitian slaves did on Santo Domingo? Enslaved people challenged slavery in a variety of ways including violence, revolts, maroon communities, truancy, passing, suicide and day-to-day resistance. This course examines the primary documents and contentious historical debates surrounding the import of slave resistance, primarily in the American South. Students examine slave societies, theories on race, gender, sexuality and resistance, as well as modern literature and film to investigate violent and nonviolent resistance and how they are memorialized both in history and in the popular imagination. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Grounding our work in the current scholarship in lesbian history, this course explores lesbian, queer and bisexual communities, cultures and activism. While becoming familiar with the existing narratives about lesbian/queer lives, students are introduced to the method of oral history as a key documentation strategy in the production of lesbian history. What are the gaps in the literature and how can oral history assist in filling in the spaces? What does a historical narrative that privileges categories of gender and sexuality look like? And how do we need to adapt our research methods, including oral history, in order to talk about lesbian/queer lives? Our texts include secondary literature on 20thcentury lesbian cultures and communities, oral history theory and methodology, and primary sources from the Sophia Smith Collection (SSC). Students conduct, transcribe, edit and interpret their own interviews for their final project. The oral histories from this course are archived with the Documenting Lesbian Lives collection in the SSC. Prerequisite: SWG 150 or permission of the instructor.

<P>Remembering Slavery: A Gendered Reading of the WPA Slave Interviews </P>

<P>Despite the particular degradation, violence and despair of enslavement in the United States, African American men and women built families, traditions and a legacy of resistance. Using the WPA interviews—part of the New Deal Federal Writers Project of the 1930s—this course looks at the historical memory of former slaves by reading and listening to their own words. How did 70- through 90-year-old former slaves remember their childhoods and young adulthoods during slavery? And how do scholars make sense of these interviews given they were conducted when Jim Crow segregation was at its pinnacle? The course examines the WPA interviews as historical sources by studying scholarship that relies heavily on them. Most importantly, students explore debates that swirl around the interviews and challenge their validity on multiple fronts, even as they remain the richest sources of African American oral history regarding slavery. Students write an original research paper using the WPA interviews as their central source. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

We examine the important influence of scientific developments on cultural production during these pivotal periods, while at the same time exploring the cultural environments that fostered these scientific innovations. The emphasis is on modes of observation and the notions of the observing subject that they reflect. At the center of discussion are literary, scientific and philosophical texts—along with a few films—that negotiate the intersection of perception, documentation and communication. Readings include scientific, literary and aesthetic works from Goethe, Lessing, Lichtenberg, Lange, Nietzsche, Mach, Freud, Schnitzler and Benjamin. Readings and discussions in English.

We study the Italian pinups of postwar cinema, the Latin lover figure, representations of Fascism, the Bel Paese myth, portraits of the lower classes and the immigrants. Directors include Amelio, Antonioni, Bertolucci, De Santis, De Sica, Germi, Moretti, Ozpetek, Pasolini, Sorrentino and Visconti. Conducted in English. Films with English subtitles. This course counts toward the film and media studies and Italian studies majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {A} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>THE 208 American Musical Comedy: From Gershwin to Sondheim </P>

<P>The course examines the roots of the American musical as a seminal theatrical form, with its own distinctive venues and styles; we pay particular attention to the socio-cultural factors that made the American musical stage a locus for identity-formation. The history of the American musical is deeply intertwined with the assimilationist project, particularly among Jewish-Americans, who were highly instrumental in its development. The economics of theatrical production in the early 20th century, along with the rise of a burgeoning middle class with time for leisure (a new phenomenon), gave rise to a “popular” form of musical theatre—the musical comedy—that was instrumental in creating what became “show business.” {A} {H} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

We look at religious and communal life in Yiddish plays from Eastern Europe; plays of the Holocaust, with emphasis on the ways rendering catastrophe has evolved; assimilation and modernization in the U.S. Black-Jewish relationships explored on stage; and selected texts on the Israeli experience, as depicted from within Judaism. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>LSS 100 Landscape, Environment and Design </P>

<P>Through readings and a series of lectures by Smith faculty and guests, we examine the history and influences out of which landscape studies is emerging. We look at the relationship of this new field with literary and cultural studies, art, art history, landscape architecture, history, biological and environmental sciences. What is landscape studies? Where does it come from? Why is it important? How does it relate to, for instance, landscape painting and city planning? How does it link political and aesthetic agendas? What is its role in current sustainability debates and initiatives among architects, landscape architects, planners and engineers? Students may take this course twice for credit. S/U only. {A} {H} {S} Credits: 2 </P>

<P>LSS 245 Place Frames: Photography As Research Method In Landscape Studies </P>

<P>Photography and landscape are intertwined. Scholars, design professionals, artists, and journalists use photographs as evidence, as a means of representing sites, as a design tool, as source material for project renderings, and as a device for documentation and record keeping. This course focuses on how photography is a part of field observations and research techniques, how photographs are used in landscape studies, and how text and image are combined in different photographic and scholarly genres. Students will take their own photographs and examine the works of photographers, including landscape architects, urbanists, artists, and journalists. The course will include field exercises in combination with workshops, discussions, and research at the Smith College Museum of Art. Major themes include cultural landscapes, topography and land forms, transportation, sense of place, aerial and satellite photography, suburbia, patterns on the land, abandonment and decay, and the image of the city.

<P>Favelas in Brazil: The Commodification of Places of Protest </P>

<P>A favela is a distinct, irregular, unplanned community in Brazil. Characterized by self-help construction methods and inadequate access to public services, these communities grew out of protest and have etched themselves into the permanent landscape and fabric of Brazil. Intrinsically, the culture of slavery, which was successfully maintained through terror and spectacular punishment, continues to inform the favelas today as many actors including local leaders, politicians, the Church, drug traffickers, militias, NGOs, residents, and the police have tried to govern these sprawling communities with varying degrees of success. Through articles, books, films and guest lecturers, this course will introduce the rich history of favelas and describe how the distinct spectacle of violence, commodification and speculation is deeply embedded in the (re)production of favelas in Brazil.

<P>LAS 310 Latin American Studies: Issues, Methods and Debates </P>

<P>This course studies how people trained in the field of Latin American and Latin@ Studies “do their work,” asking: what constitutes a compelling research topic and what methodologies are required to complete such research. Focus rests on the last decade. We explore a wide range of authors, from those interested in the arts to those who study immigration or climate change. This class also asks each student to develop and present an independent research project, teaching others in class about her topic. Throughout we consider and debate the implications of working in this field—both inside and outside academic settings. {A} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<H1>The Minor </H1>

<P>Linguistics is the science of human language: what is common to the languages of the world, and how it can best be described. It addresses questions concerning how languages diversify, and what the connections are among them. It also asks: What do humans know when they know a language? The minor allows students to explore some of these questions, making it a useful conjunction to several majors, for example in a language, or philosophy, education, logic, psychology, computer science or anthropology. An alternative minor in linguistics and philosophy of language is listed under philosophy. </P>

<P>Requirements: </P>

<P>Requirements: The mathematics major has a foundation requirement, a core requirement, a depth requirement and a total credit requirement. </P>

<P>The entryway foundation requirement consists of MTH 111, MTH 112, MTH 153, MTH 211 and MTH 212. Some of these requirements might be waived for a well-prepared student. </P>

<P>The core requirement consists of one course in algebra (MTH 233 or MTH 238) and one course in analysis (MTH 280 or MTH 281). Alternatively, a student may focus on statistics; students pursuing this track through the major are not required to take a course in algebra and instead must complete MTH 220, MTH 246, MTH 320, and either MTH 290 or MTH 291. </P>

<P>Majors are required to take at least one advanced course. This is the depth requirement. An advanced course is a mathematics course at Smith numbered between 310 and 390. </P>

<P>In total, majors must take at least 36 credits among courses numbered at or above 153, with the following exceptions.  With the approval of the department, up to 8 of the credits may be satisfied by courses taken outside the mathematics and statistics department. Courses taken outside the department must contain either substantial mathematical content at a level more advanced than MTH 211 and 212 or statistical content at a level more advanced than MTH 220. Generally, such a 4-credit course will be given 2 credits toward the mathematics major. Note that courses that are cross-listed with mathematics and another department (CSC 250, PHI 202, PHI 203, PHI 220, and SDS 292) are counted as mathematics courses and given full credit toward the mathematics major, as does ECO 220. The following courses meet the criteria for 2 credits toward mathematics major: AST 337, AST 351, AST 352, CHM 331, CHM 332, CSC 240, CSC 252, CSC 274, CSC 334, ECO 240, ECO 255, EGR 220, EGR 315, EGR 320, EGR 326, EGR 374, EGR 389, LOG 100,  PHY 210, PHY 317, PHY 318, PHY 319, PHY 327, and SDS 293. A student may petition the department if she wishes credit for any course not on this list. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Normally, all courses that are counted towards either the major or minor must be taken for a letter grade. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H1>The Minor in Mathematical Sciences </H1>

<P>The minor in mathematical sciences consists of 211 and 16 credits from 153, 205, and courses numbered above 211, including two courses above 218. Four of the credits may be replaced by eight credits from the list in the description of major requirements found above. </P>

<H1>Honors </H1>

<P>A student majoring in mathematics and statistics may apply for the departmental honors program. An honors project consists of directed reading, investigation and a thesis. This is an opportunity to engage in scholarship at a high level. A student at any level considering an honors project is encouraged to consult with the director of honors and any member of the department to obtain advice and further information. </P>

<P>MTH 432D Honors Project </P>

<P>Credits: 12 </P>

<P>Normally offered both fall and spring semesters </P>

<P>Eligibility and application: Normally, a student who applies to do honors work must have an overall 3.0 g.p.a. for courses through her junior year, and a 3.3 </P>

<P>g.p.a. for courses in her major. A student may apply either in the second semester of her junior year or by the second week of the first semester of her senior year; we strongly recommend the former. </P>

<P>Requirements: In addition to the credits required for the major, students must take 430d or 432d (for either eight or twelve credits). In unusual circumstances, a student may instead take 431. The length of the thesis depends upon the topic and the nature of the investigation, and is determined by the student, her adviser, and the department. The student will give an oral presentation of the thesis.

<P>A student with three or four years of high school mathematics (the final year may be called precalculus, trigonometry, functions, or analysis), but no calculus, normally enrolls in Calculus I (111). A student with a year of AB calculus, A levels, or IB math SL normally enrolls in Discrete Mathematics (153) and/ or Calculus II (112) during her first year. Placement in 112 is determined not only by the amount of previous calculus but also by the strength of the student's preparation. If a student has a year of BC calculus or IB math HL, she may omit MTH 112. </P>

<P>A student with two years of high school mathematics, but no calculus or precalculus, should enroll in Elementary Functions (102). This course provides a solid basis for calculus. </P>

<P>Discovering Mathematics (105) and Statistical Thinking MTH/SDS (107) are intended for students not expecting to major in mathematics or the sciences. </P>

<P>First and second year students may also wish to consider enrolling in IDP170 (Frontiers in Biomathematics ), the gateway course for the Five College Certificate Program in the Biomathematical Sciences. </P>

<P>A student who receives credit for taking MTH 111 may not have AP calculus credits applied toward her degree. A student with 8 AP Calculus credits (available to students with a 4 or 5 on the AP exam for BC Calculus) may apply only 4 of them if she also receives credit for MTH 112. A student who has a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics examination may receive 4 AP credits. She may not however, use them toward her degree requirements if she also receives credit for MTH/SDS 107, 201, or 220, PSY 201, or ECO 220. (AP credits can be used to meet degree requirements only under circumstances specified by the college.) </P>

<P>The interdepartmental major and minor in medieval studies provide students with an opportunity to study the civilization of medieval Europe from a multidisciplinary perspective. Subjects that belong today to separate academic disciplines were rarely so separated in the Middle Ages, and it is therefore appropriate that students be given an opportunity to bring these subjects together again. The great diversity of regional cultures in medieval Europe was balanced by a conscious attempt to hold to a unified view of the world that embraced religious and social ideals, Latin and vernacular literature, and music and the visual arts. </P>

<P>The medieval studies major and minor provide students with an opportunity to re-create for themselves, through courses in a variety of related disciplines, an understanding of the unity and of the diversity of European civilization in the Middle Ages.

<P>All medieval studies majors are expected to achieve a working knowledge of the Latin language. This requirement may be satisfied by taking at least one Latin course (4 credits) at the 200 level or above. If a student has no prior Latin or is insufficiently prepared for a 200-level course, she will take Latin 100d (8 credits) in order to fulfill this requirement. However, all students are urged to continue Latin at the 200 level. A biblical or Koranic language (Greek, Hebrew, Arabic) can substitute for Latin with permission of the adviser. The student must pursue the classical or scriptural form of the language, not modern Greek, Hebrew or Arabic. </P>

<P>ARA 200 Intermediate Arabic 1 </P>

<P>According to the ACTFL standards, this course is Intermediate Low Arabic. It covers the four skills of the language. Writers at the intermediate level are characterized by the ability to meet practical writing needs, such as simple messages and letters, requests for information, and notes. In addition, they can ask and respond to simple questions in writing. At the intermediate level, listeners can understand information conveyed in simple, sentence-length speech on familiar or everyday topics while readers at the same level can understand information conveyed in simple, predictable, loosely connected texts. Readers rely heavily on contextual clues. They can most easily understand information if the format of the text is familiar, such as in a weather report or a social announcement. Speakers at the intermediate level are distinguished primarily by their ability to create with the language when talking about familiar topics related to their daily life. They are able to recombine learned material in order to express personal meaning. Students should expect text assignments as well as work with DVDs, audio materials and websites. Exercises include writing, social interactions, role plays, and the interplay of language and culture. Prerequisite is ARA 100Y or the equivalent. {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>“Banlieue Lit” </P>

<P>In this course, students study fiction, memoir, slam poetry and hip-hop authored by residents of France’s multi-ethnic suburbs and housing projects, also known as the banlieues and cités. We examine the question of whether banlieue authors can escape various pressures: to become native informants; to write realistic rather than fantastical novels; to leave the “ghetto”; to denounce the sometimes difficult traditions, religions, neighborhoods and family members that have challenged but also molded them. Often seen as spaces of regression and decay, the banlieues nevertheless produce vibrant cultural expressions that beg the question: Is the banlieue a mere suburb of French cultural life, or more like one of its centers? {F} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Popular Music of the Islamic World </P>

<P>Music is a thorny issue in many Islamic societies. There is often tension between hardliners who believe that music has no place in Islam and thus try to prohibit it and those who tolerate it, albeit within well-defined parameters. The debate intensifies in the case of popular music. Despite this, there is an incredible variety of vibrant popular music traditions throughout the Islamic world. In this course, we engage with Islamic debates on popular music, explore music in a variety of cultures (e.g., Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Senegal and Turkey), and examine the ways they illuminate different themes (forms of Islam, issues of diaspora, gender considerations, musical diversity, etc.).

<P>Jihad </P>

<P>The persistence of the ideology of jihad in modern Islam drives revivalists and apologists to disagree over the meaning of “jihad” and whether it should be understood to necessitate violence or as an interpersonal spiritual struggle. This course examines the most important modern debates about Jihad and how each position engages and appeals to the foundational Islamic sources (e.g. Qur’an, Muhammad, Sharia/Islamic Law) and Islamic history for legitimacy. It also explores the factors that make the rhetoric used by modern jihadists popular among certain Muslim constituencies, inspiring them to wage holy war against “infidels” as well as fellow Muslims.

The debate intensifies in the case of popular music, a core part of the self-identification of young people everywhere. Despite this, there is an amazing variety of vibrant popular music throughout the Islamic world.

The Museums Concentration provides a unique opportunity at the undergraduate level for students to consider how their academic studies might connect to their future lives and careers. Students are introduced to issues such as community access, cultural ownership and public accountability—areas of study that will be important whatever they decide to do after Smith. </P>

<P>The Museums Concentration draws on the educational resource of the Smith College Museum of Art’s collection of more than 25,000 original works of art and the other special collections at Smith, on the expertise of SCMA’s professional staff, and on the exceptional academic programs of Smith College and the other Five Colleges that support learning in this area. Students are encouraged to apply for participation in the Museums Concentration in the fall of their sophomore year, and up to fifteen students from each graduating class are accepted into the program. For more information about the Museums Concentration, please visit: http://www.smith.edu/museums/. </P>

<P>Students may apply to participate in the Museums Concentration beginning in their sophomore year. The application deadline each year is December 1. Students are strongly encouraged to have taken the required gateway course MUX 119, Museums in Society, before they apply. Admitted students will be required to take MUX 300 (in the spring semester of senior year), as well as four electives.

<P>In world music and in American music, 101 and 105 or 106, respectively, may be substituted for an additional classroom course above the 100 level. </P>

<P>The four credits in performance can be fulfilled by taking: two semesters of lessons on an instrument or in voice, or two semesters of conducting; or, four semesters of participation in an ensemble, which may be the same ensemble over four semesters, or may consist of participation in multiple ensembles as long as the four-semester requirement is met. </P>

<P>Students may be exempted from courses required for the basis of the major as a result of Advanced Placement exams or departmental placement tests. Such exemption does not affect the number of courses required for the major. </P>

<P>Students who are contemplating graduate work in any branch of music should consult an appropriate member of the department for advice in selecting suitable elective courses. Students interested in graduate work in music are urged to acquire some knowledge of German, French or Italian (for studies in the Western tradition) or of a relevant foreign language (for studies beyond the Western tradition). </P>

<P>With the approval of the department, students may substitute one 4-credit Special Studies for one of the six additional classroom courses in the major. </P>

<P>MUS 100 Colloquia </P>

<P>Colloquia are especially designed for those with no previous background in music. Limited to 20 students, they emphasize class discussion and written work, which consists of either music or critical prose as appropriate to the topic. Open to all students, but particularly recommended for first-year students and sophomores. </P>

<P>Fundamentals of Music </P>

<P>An introduction to music notation and to principles of musical organization, including scales, keys, rhythm and meter. Limited to beginners and those who did not place into 110. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Members of the department </P>

<P>Normally offered each spring </P>

<P>FYS 100 My Music: Writing Musical Lives </P>

<P>This first-year seminar begins with an exploration of our own musical lives. What does the particular constellation of material that we call “My Music” tell us about who we are, where we come from, and how we relate to the world? After analyzing and comparing musical lives within the class, we will read selected case studies and collaboratively design a musical biography project. Each student will curate one person’s musical life story, gathering data through oneon-one interviews, weaving together their interlocutor’s words with their own interpretations, and ultimately reflecting on what they have learned from the experience. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Expected to be offered in the next 3 years </P>

<P>MUS 101 Introduction to World Music </P>

<P>Music may not be a “universal language,” but it is a universal phenomenon; every culture has something that we recognize as music. This course introduces you to a number of musical systems—traditional, classical and popular—from around the world and uses case studies to explore the complex relationships between music and culture. By engaging with music analytically, as musicologists (paying attention to the sounds you hear) and ethnographically, as anthropologists (paying attention to the cultural context), you learn basic principles that enhance your understanding of music globally speaking. No prerequisites. {A} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>MUS 102 First Nights </P>

<P>This course serves as an introduction to the history of Western music by studying in detail the first performances of a small number of singularly important works in the Western tradition including Orfeo (Monteverdi), Messiah (Handel), the Ninth Symphony (Beethoven), the Symphonie fantastique (Berlioz), and Le Sacre du printemps (Stravinsky). Using Thomas Kelly’s textbook First Nights (which treats these five compositions), we analyze musical monuments as aesthetic objects and consider their relation to such issues as exoticism, politics and religious belief, as well as the status of this canon in the early 21st century. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Andrea Moore </P>

<P>Normally offered each fall </P>

<P>MUS 105 Roll Over Beethoven: A History of Rock </P>

<P>This course provides a critical survey of rock music, tracing the music’s development from blues and blackface minstrelsy to heavy metal, grunge, and techno. Emphasis throughout is placed upon understanding musical developments in the context of American race and gender relations and the politics of youth cultures in the U.S. Topics to be covered include: Elvis Presley and American race relations; Jimi Hendrix and the blues; girl groups; the rise of arena rock; and the significance of the DJ in hip hop. Enrollment limited to 45. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Members of the department </P>

<P>Normally offered in alternate years </P>

<P>MUS 106 American Sounds </P>

<P>This course surveys developments in the history of American music, with a primary focus on the 20th century. We pay particular attention to blues and country music, two styles that arose early in the century and provided the foundation for much of what followed. The course may cover other styles such as: blackface minstrelsy, Tin Pan Alley, folk, jazz, classical or varieties of Latino music. Throughout, we attend to musical aspects of these styles, and connect them to larger historical themes and social issues concerning race, class, gender and the making of “American” identity through music. Formal knowledge of music is not required. Enrollment limited to 45. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Members of the department </P>

<P>Normally offered in alternate years </P>

<P>MUS 110 Analysis and Repertory </P>

<P>An introduction to formal analysis and tonal harmony, and a study of pieces in the standard repertory. Regular exercises in harmony. Prerequisites: ability to read standard notation in treble and bass clefs, including key signatures and time signatures, and the ability to name intervals. (A placement test is given before the fall semester for incoming students.) One 50-minute ear training section required per week, in addition to classroom meetings. Class sections limited to 20. {A} Credits: 0–4 </P>

<P>MUS 202 Thinking About Music </P>

<P>This course explores different approaches to the study of music as a cultural phenomenon. We consider basic questions, such as: Why is music so often at the center of our most profound personal and social experiences? Why is music a fundamental means of connecting with our own lives, our communities and the wider world in which we live? Through in-depth reading and in-class discussion, we study the institutions of music (concerts, recording studios) and the varied practices of music making (classical, popular; amateur, professional) in order to construct a picture of the musical worlds around us and to understand what they tell us about the societies in which we live. {A} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>MUS 203 Music as Memorial and Monument </P>

<P>Music has long played an important role in both memorialization and monumentalization. In this class, we use music as a lens through which to consider the agendas and values behind public displays of memory, history, and political strength. We will study music written to commemorate victims of war, state violence, and illness, from requiems to 9/11 memorial works. We will also consider how composers, performers, and listeners have participated in monumentalizing historical or political occasions, from composer anniversary celebrations to national anthems. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>MUS 205 Topics in Popular Music </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>Improvising History: The Development of Jazz </P>

<P>The course combines exploration of jazz music with examination of topics in the social and cultural history of jazz. Musically, the development of jazz is traced from the early styles that took root in New Orleans and Chicago to the challenging &quot;free jazz&quot; sounds of the 1960s and the 1970s, and into the current &quot;postmodern&quot; moment of jazz history. Historically, the course considers such issues as the key importance of race to the social development of jazz, the shifting status of jazz as &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;art&quot; music, and the nature and significance of improvisation as a medium of creative expression in 20th century American culture. Some previous knowledge of African American music and history or permission of the instructor required. Enrollment limited to 20. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Expected to be offered in the next 3 years </P>

<P>Metal and Punk: Rock History Out Loud </P>

<P>In-depth examination of the historical, musical and social development of heavy metal and punk rock, two key genres in the recent history of rock. In this course, we explore metal and punk as interrelated musical responses to the &quot;crisis&quot; that beset post-1960's rock, and use the two genres as a lens for examining the nature and definition of popular music genres, the status of rock music as commodity, the politics of &quot;noise,&quot; and the shifting qualities of the rock audience from the 1970s to the present. Enrollment limited to 20 students. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>MUS 220 Topics in World Music </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>African Popular Music </P>

<P>This course focuses on twentieth century African popular music: it examines musical genres from different parts of the continent, investigating their relationships to the historical, political and social dynamics of their respective national and regional origins. Regional examples like highlife, soukous and mbaqanga will provide the basis for assessing the significance of popular music as a creative response to the colonial and postcolonial enviromnet in Africa. Themes explored include the use of music in the construction of social identity and the interaction of local and global elements. No prerequisites. Maximum enrollment 30 students. {A} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The Music of Japan </P>

<P>An introduction to the music of Japan focusing on selected ritual, instrumental, theatrical and popular music genres.

<P>AMS 220 Colloquium </P>

<P>Topics course. </P>

<P>Dance Music Sex Romance: Popular Music, Gender and Sexuality from Rock to Rap </P>

<P>Since the 1950s rock ‘n’ roll and other forms of youth-oriented popular music in the U.S. have embodied rebellion. Yet the rebellion that rock and other popular music styles like rap have offered has often been more available to men than women. Similarly, the sexual liberation associated with popular music in the rock and rap eras has been far more open to “straight” desires over “queer.” This course will examine how popular music from the 1950s to the present has been shaped by gender and sexuality, and the extent to which the music and its associated cultural practices have allowed artists and audiences to challenge gender and sexual norms, or alternately have served to reinforce those norms albeit with loud guitars and a heavy beat.

<P>MUS 231 From Goat Songs To Flash Mobs: Music and Theater </P>

<P>Music and theatre are both time-based arts that involve bodies in motion in front of an audience. Though they may be considered separate disciplines, the full extent of what they share often makes them wonderfully indistinguishable. This course probes the intersections of music and theatre through a survey of genres, works, artists, and practitioners. While material covered will include clearly relevant genres such as musicals and opera, the focus will be on more difficult to categorize topics such as performance art, immersive theatre, and experimental music, in an open-minded examination of what makes this alliance so compelling. Enrollment limit of 20. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>FMS 235 Listening to Cinema </P>

<P>This course explores the sound worlds of narrative, experimental and documentary cinema. Emphasis is placed on critical listening with regular sound exercises and focused analysis of individual films. Topics addressed include the aesthetics and politics of listening; sound design; the voice; film music; and the history of sound technology. The first half of the course will be devoted to sound theory and practice, with sound-oriented readings drawn from disparate fields including philosophy, film theory, musicology and short fiction. In the second half, we will undertake an historical survey of sound technology since the late nineteenth century. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>MUS 249 Islamic Popular Music </P>

<P>Same as REL 249. Music is a complex issue in many Islamic societies. There are tensions between those who believe that music has no place in Islam and try to prohibit it, those for whom it is a central component of mystical devotion, and those who tolerate it, albeit within well-defined parameters. The debate intensifies in the case of popular music, a core part of the self-identification of young people everywhere. Despite this, there is an amazing variety of vibrant popular music throughout the Islamic world. This course explores the religious debates over music and the rich musical tradition (including religious music) in Islam. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>An introduction to a broad range of vocal music, from the Middle Ages to the present, and an investigation of such issues as text setting, interpretation, extended vocal techniques and the use of technology as it relates to vocal performance. Topics of study include chant, 19th-century art song, opera and experimental music. Composers to be considered include Hildegard of Bingen, Mozart and Wagner as well as such recent and contemporary figures as Meredith Monk, Pauline Oliveros and Julius Eastman, and popular artists including Beyoncé and Björk. Open to all students (including first-year students) who have had previous musical experience or who have obtained the permission of the instructor. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>An introduction to opera with emphasis on the role of women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We consider the monstrous and beautiful representations of women in opera and the discourses that surrounded them, and we interrogate the real women who performed, listened to and sometimes wrote this music. Works include Verdi’s La traviata, Bizet’s Carmen and Strauss’s Salome. {A} {H} Credits: 4 Andrea Moore </P>

<P>MUS 258 Performing Culture </P>

<P>Same as ANT 258. This course analyzes cultural performances as sites for the expression and formation of social identity. Students study various performance genres such as rituals, festivals, parades, cultural shows, music, dance and theater. Topics include expressive culture as resistance; debates around authenticity and heritage; the performance of race, class and ethnic identities; the construction of national identity; and the effects of globalization on indigenous performances.

<P>MUS 260 The Music of J.S. Bach </P>

<P>This course is an introduction to the music, life, and legacy of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music inspired generations of composers and performers across genres. In addition to studying some of his works in depth and his biography, we will explore the cultural and historical context in which he worked, raising questions about performance, instruments, religious life, and patronage. We also look at his influence on music in the nineteenth century, the controversies around his St. John Passion in the twentieth, and his legacy in the twenty-first century. {A} {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>What counts as music? Who decides? Can anyone make music? This course raises these and other questions by focusing on experimental music. We explore the history and practice of experimental music, focusing on text, graphic, and other forms of notation. We also look at the history of experimental music in performance, and make our own in-class performances of several key pieces. Through our reading and practice, we ask questions about musical authority, skill, and even failure, and the role of institutions in shaping our musical ideas. </P>

<P>MUS 315 Digital Orchestration </P>

<P>A practical introduction to principles of orchestration at the digital audio workstation, the basis of the production studio for music in media today. Following models from chiefly late Romantic repertory, students explore various instrumental combinations among the four sections of the orchestra—strings, winds, brass, percussion— in their own digital realizations. Working with libraries of digital samples, they develop a foundation in the production of music for film and video. For a final project, they orchestrate a given piano piece of two to three minutes, and produce a sound file of their work. Prerequisite: MUS 210 and permission of the instructor. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<H1>Performance </H1>

<P>The music department offers a range of performance courses: individual lessons, which are numbered MUS 914Y, 924Y, 930Y and 940Y; chamber music coaching (MUS 901); conducting (MUS 903); and large ensembles, numbered MUS 951 and above. </P>

<P>Admission to individual lessons, chamber music, and some ensembles is determined by audition during fall semester orientation period and the first days of the semester. Students are accepted on the basis of musicianship, competence and potential. With the exception of voice, some prior experience is assumed. There is a lesson fee which is waived for music majors and minors. Other students may apply for departmental scholarship funds. Information and sign-up sheets for auditions may be found at the Music Department office. </P>

<P>When no instructor for a particular instrument is available at Smith College, every effort is made to provide students with qualified instructors from the Five College community. Such arrangements may require Smith students to travel to other campuses within the Five College system. Students wishing to study performance with Five College faculty must obtain departmental approval. </P>

<P>Individual voice or instrument performance courses consist of weekly private lessons, with specific expectations determined by each instructor. Lessons require a yearlong commitment and are normally taken in addition to a regular course load. Two such courses may only be taken concurrently with departmental approval. (This restriction does not apply to enrollment in MUS 901 or MUS 903, or to participation in large ensembles for credit.) </P>

<P>For more detailed information on instrumental and voice lessons and a list of current faculty please see the Music Department website, www.smith.edu/ music. </P>

<P>All performance students are encouraged to study music in the classroom. Non-majors and non-minors should talk with their instructors about which courses best complement their interests. </P>

<P>No more than 24 credits in performance may be counted toward graduation. This includes participation in the various large ensembles described below. </P>

<P>Regeneration </P>

<P>“I’d give my right arm to know the secret of regeneration.”  A quote by Oscar E. Schotté (1950) that captures the fascination science has had with the remarkable ability of some organisms to rebuild themselves. Why can some worms and salamanders regrow whole body parts, yet mammals have very restricted regenerative capabilities? This seminar explores the developmental mechanisms known to enable regeneration in some species, and delves into the possibility of whether we can harness these mechanisms to foster regeneration in humans. Course materials use primary research literature as a springboard to hold video conferences with the researchers who conducted the work. Students create a documentary movie focused as different aspects of regeneration. Prerequisites: BIO 132 (formally 150) and at least one upper-level BIO course. BIO 202, 230, and 302 are recommended.

<P>For many philosophical and religious thinkers, desire has been a source of some anxiety: depicted as being by their very nature powerful and insatiable, desires appear to weaken people’s capacities to control themselves and at the same time to open up opportunities for other people to control them. Focusing especially on the importance of desire to a consumer society, we examine questions such as: Is it possible to make a clear distinction between need and desire? To what extent are desires plastic, pliable, amenable to reshaping? Are we in any sense responsible for our desires? {S} Credits: 4 </P>

If not, which is the better approach? Is there one distinctive way of being cosmopolitan, or might there be varieties of cosmopolitanism arising in different cultural contexts, for instance, under colonial rule or conditions of exile? Is it self-evidently true that being a cosmopolitan person is a good thing, for an individual or a society? What are some of its challenges?

<P>Philosophical Explorations of Humor and Laughter </P>

<P>This seminar focuses on philosophical accounts of some of the ethical, social and political issues raised by humor and laughter.  Humor can be a forceful instrument, often deployed by the powerful in their attempts to control the powerless and by the powerless to topple the powerful. Humor tends to operate in such a way as to include some and exclude others. Its effects, intended or unintended, can be benign or hurtful. Closely examining texts from a variety of philosophical perspectives, we will explore questions such as: What have been the hopes for, and worries about, what humor achieves?

<P>FYS 137 Of Minds and Molecules: Philosophical Perspectives on Chemistry and Biochemistry </P>

<P>What is the “shape,” “size,” or “color” of a smell?  We often use vision as a metaphor when describing our perceptions from our other senses, but does this limit what we perceive?  How do the (often visual) models that chemists use, and the metaphors that are associated with those models, affect what chemists study?  For example, what do we mean when we speak of molecular “switches” or “brakes”?  How do the metaphors and the kinds of languages that chemists use differ from those used in the arts?  Is chemistry a single discipline, sharing a common language?  Is it even an autonomous discipline at all, or is it reducible to physics?  We will explore these questions from a philosophical perspective, using examples drawn primarily from chemistry and biochemistry. The course is designed for first-year students who would like to explore current conceptual issues that challenge some of the common beliefs about science. Enrollment limited to 20 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 </P>

<H1>The Major </H1>

<P>Advisers: Members of the department </P>

<P>Physics is crucial to understanding our world. Physics challenges our imagination, provides insight into our most important challenges and leads to great discoveries and new technologies. Physicists are problem solvers whose analytical skills and training make them versatile and adaptable. A foundation in physics provides a gateway to interdisciplinary careers incorporating many scientific and educational fields, including astronomy, engineering, biology, chemistry, climate science, environmental science, geoscience, mathematics, medicine and teaching. </P>

<P>The undergraduate physics curriculum at Smith stresses the fundamental principles, concepts and methods of physics with emphasis placed on analytical reasoning, problem-solving and the critical evaluation of underlying assumptions in theory and experiment. Built around the core courses that achieve this goal, the major allows options within the requirements that provide flexibility to students primarily interested in interdisciplinary applications of physics. </P>

<P>The requirements for the major are as follows: 117, 118, 210, 215, 240, 317, 318, 319, 327, 350 (at least 4 credits), 360 (or an approved 300level alternative in physics or a related field), and 399. </P>

<P>While students are typically discouraged from taking PHY major requirements S/U, it may be allowed, after consultation with a student's major advisor and approval of the Department. </P>

<P>Students double majoring in engineering may substitute EGR 220 for PHY 240 but are encouraged to take both. </P>

<P>Students may substitute CHM 331 for PHY 327 and CHM 332 for PHY 319. This option is intended for students double majoring (and/or planning on graduate work) in chemistry. </P>

<P>Students double majoring in astronomy and/or planning on graduate work in astrophysics may substitute AST 330, 335, 337 or 352 for PHY 360 as their 300 level physics elective. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Students planning on graduate work in chemistry may substitute CHM 335, 336, 338, or 398 for PHY 360 as their 300 level physics elective. </P>

<P>Students planning on graduate work in the geosciences may substitute GEO 309 or 311 for PHY 360 as their 300 level physics elective. </P>

<P>Students may repeat PHY 360 for credit in the major, with permission of the department. </P>

<P>Students are advised to check with members of the physics department to choose appropriate course substitutions; other courses may qualify, with advanced permission of the department. </P>

<P>Physics majors and minors are advised to acquire a facility in scientific computing and numerical analysis (e.g. CSC 111 Introduction to Computer Science or CSC 205 Modeling in the Sciences) and to learn to design and fabricate a working tool, instrument or device in the Center for Design and Fabrication. Students planning graduate study in physics are advised to take as many 300level physics courses as possible. </P>

<P>The poetry concentration allows students to pursue work on and about poetry through a range of different experiences and courses. Through a combination of academic study, practical work and independent projects, students gain a deeper understanding of the craft of writing, the business of publication and the dissemination of poetry to others. The poetry concentration supports the study of poetry within a range of scholarly disciplines and lets students explore areas of professional practice (writing poetry, teaching poetry, writing about poetry, translating poetry and book arts/publishing of poetry) through meaningful connections with local, regional and national presses, journals, book-arts centers and other sites where poetry is made, critiqued and taught. The concentration draws on the educational resources of the Poetry Center and the Mortimer Rare Book Room, as well on the unique expertise of poets and artists working both at the college and in the larger Pioneer Valley.

<P>Foundation Courses: PSY 100, PSY 201 and PSY 202 or NSC 230. </P>

<P>Each student, with the approval of her major adviser, elects a carefully planned program of course selections designed to meet the following requirements: 10 semester courses including the foundational courses in psychology (100, 201, 202).  Students should normally complete these foundational courses by the end of their sophomore year. Foundational courses must be taken using the regular grading option (not S/U). </P>

<P>Competence in the major is demonstrated by sufficient breadth of course selections from the various substantive areas, as well as adequate depth of course selections. Breadth is achieved by selecting at least one course within each of the department’s three curricular areas. Depth is achieved by selecting two colloquia as well as two courses at the advanced level (300- or above), at least one of which is a seminar. Furthermore, depth requires that at least one course at the advanced level combines with the student’s other courses to create a constellation of three courses that represent a depth in a field of study that is important to the student and recognized by the department. Students may count no more than three 100-level courses toward the major, not including PSY 100.  Although we discourage the use of the S/U option for courses in the major, students are allowed to take one non-foundational course S/U. All students (including transfer students) must take at least one colloquium and one advanced seminar within the department. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to attend departmental colloquia. Students planning careers in academic or professional psychology, social work, personnel work involving guidance or counseling, psychological research, or paraprofessional occupations in mental health settings or special education programs should consult their major advisers regarding desirable sequencing of courses. </P>

<P>PSY 356 The Scientific Basis of Psychotherapy </P>

<P>This seminar provides a guided tour through the scientific literature on psychotherapy.

<P>The Program in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies (REEES) offers students the opportunity to study the cultures and peoples of Russia, Eastern Europe and Eurasia from a broad, interdisciplinary perspective. In addition to completing the foundation courses in language, students take courses that are offered by faculty who teach in a wide variety of departments and programs that include but are not limited to comparative literature, history, government, Jewish studies and religion. </P>

<H1>The Major </H1>

<P>Advisers: Justin Cammy, Serguei Glebov, Thomas Roberts, Vera Shevzov </P>

<P>The major in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies (REEES) allows students to focus on any aspect of the region’s histories, literatures, cultures, religions, or politics, and to develop their own concentration within the major in consultation with their advisor. In developing their concentration, students are encouraged to pursue an interdisciplinary approach, combining coursework in language, government, history, literature, and religion. Students may choose from courses offered both at Smith and through the Five College Consortium; students are also encouraged to study abroad during a summer, semester, or year-long program. </P>

<P>The REEES program is committed to accommodating students who coordinate their studies in REEES with a second major. </P>

<P>In order to help guide students in developing their concentrations, the REEES program offers two tracks: 1) Area Studies; 2) Language and Literature. </P>

<P>Area Studies Track </P>

<P>Students who choose the Area Studies Track will gain a working understanding of the history and culture of Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, and the geopolitical significance of this region in today’s global world. Students will acquire proficiency in Russian or another language relevant to the region. By pursuing coursework in a broad array of disciplines, students will gain an appreciation for the different methodological approaches scholars use in their study of this highly diverse and dynamic region of the world. </P>

<P>The Area Studies track consists of 11 courses, which include the following requirements: </P>

<P>• Four semesters of language instruction, usually fulfilled by taking RES 100Y (a year-long introductory course to the Russian language) or RES 120 (an intensive 8-credit semester-long course which covers a year of Russian), and RES 221 and RES 222 (the combination of which is equivalent to second-year Russian). Students are welcome to pursue the study of another language relevant to the region. Students who place out of first- or second-year Russian (or other relevant language) will consult with their advisor or Program Director on how best to fulfill the four-semester language instruction requirement.  Students are highly encouraged to continue the study of Russian (or another language of the region), especially in a study abroad program, in order to achieve an advanced level of fluency. Credits earned in study-abroad language courses may count toward the fulfillment of the major requirements. </P>
</Sect>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Six semester (4-credit) courses, at least one of which will include a semester course taught in Russian (equivalent to RES 331) or another relevant language. In developing their area of concentration, students are strongly encouraged to seek out courses that span a broad range of disciplines, including anthropology and sociology, art and film, government/political science/ international relations, history, literature, and religion. </LBody>

</L>

<P>Language and Literature Track </P>

<P>The Language and Literature Track provides the opportunity for students to focus closely on the language, literature, and cinema of Russia, Eastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students are expected to achieve advanced proficiency in Russian or another relevant language, and to engage closely with works of literature and film in the original language of study. While focusing on the language, literature, and cinema of one or more culture in the region, students in this track are also encouraged to explore correlated disciplines represented in the REEES curriculum. </P>

<P>The Language and Literature track consists of 11 courses, which include the following requirements: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Six semesters of language instruction in Russian, or another relevant language of the region. For Russian, this will usually be fulfilled by taking RES 100Y (a year-long introductory course to the Russian language; this may also be fulfilled by taking the equivalent RES 120, an intensive single semester course), RES 221 and RES 222 (the combination of which is equivalent to second-year Russian), and RES 331 and RES 332 (the combination of which is equivalent to third-year Russian). Students who place into a higher level of Russian or another language, on the basis of existing knowledge, will consult with their advisor or Program Director on how best to fulfill the six-semester language instruction requirement. While six semesters of language instruction in Russian, as well as courses in other languages of the region, are normally offered at Smith or in the Five Colleges, students in the Language and Literature track are highly encouraged to enroll in a study abroad program (or comparable program in the United States). Credits earned in these language courses will count toward the fulfillment of the major requirements, while they may also provide the opportunity for students to achieve a higher proficiency in the language. </LBody>

<P>RES 127 Manuscripts Don’t Burn: Literature and Dissent Under Stalin </P>

<P>Explores how Russian literary culture responded to the tumult and upheaval of the twentieth century, an epoch encompassing the Bolshevik Revolution, two World Wars, the ascent of Stalin, and the decline and collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as unprecedented aesthetic innovations. While spanning key artistic movements of the period (including the avant-garde and other modernist tendencies, Socialist Realism, conceptualism, and postmodernism), the survey focuses on Stalinism and its aftermath, considering how Soviet writers developed strategies of dissent and protest in literature. Conducted in English, no previous knowledge of Russian required. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>RES 140 Putin’s Russia: After Communism, After Atheism </P>

<P>Same as RES 140. Often portrayed as hostile to the West, Vladimir Putin and the Russia he rules remain little known. Going beyond the headlines, this course examines contemporary Russia, and historical events and figures that have shaped Putin-era Russia. We will trace the culture wars that have ensued in this post-communist and post-atheist state, across historical documents, art, film, literature, and journalism. Topics include state power and political opposition; the resurgence of religion, and tensions between religion and the secular in the public sphere; debates over the Soviet past, including revolution, war and political terror; human rights and “traditional values.” {H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>GOV 223 Russian Politics </P>

<P>This course examines recurring issues facing the Russian state and its citizens: the complex interplay between formal institutions and informal politics, patterns of cooperation and antagonism in relationships with other countries, and the “resource curse.” It also addresses the importance of public opinion in a hybrid political regime; the use of the Internet and the mass media; and human rights in contemporary Russia. It examines history to provide sufficient context, but will concentrate on the period between the end of the Soviet Union and the present day. Enrollment limit of 40. {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>HST 240 (C) Stalin and Stalinism </P>

<P>Joseph Stalin created a particular type of society in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. Stalinism became a phenomenon that influenced the development of the former Soviet Union and the Communist movement worldwide. This course covers the period on the eve of and during the Russian Revolution, Stalinist transformation of the USSR in the 1930s, WWII and the onset of the Cold War. We consider several questions about Stalinism: Was it a result of Communist ideology or a deviation? Did it enjoy any social support? To what extent was it a product of larger social forces and in what degree was it shaped by Stalin’s own personality? Did it have total control over the people’s lives? Why hasn’t there been a de-Stalinization similar to de-Nazification? How is Stalinism remembered? The course is a combination of lectures and class discussions. {H} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>RES 210 Environment and Ecology in Russian Culture </P>

<P>How does a culture conceptualize its natural environment in aesthetic, political, and even religious terms, and what does a landscape “mean” in this context? This interdisciplinary course explores how Russian writers, filmmakers, and artists have represented the vast territory comprising Imperial Russia, the USSR, and the Russian Federation, from the Enlightenment to present. In addition to considering how artistic production has reflected and shaped understanding of the Russian “anthropocene,” we will compare these works with cultural production of the Western tradition. The course also explores initiatives to legislate and transform the Russian environment, which often precipitated ecological and social disasters. {H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>RES 273 Cosmic Cold War: Russian and Western Science Fiction in Political Context </P>

<P>Same as CLT 273. How did the “final frontier” of space become a “front” in the Cold War? As the US and USSR competed in the Space Race, science fiction reflected political discourses in literature, film, visual art, and popular culture. This course explores Russian and Western science fiction in the contexts of twentieth-century geopolitics and artistic modernism (and postmodernism), examining works by Bogdanov, Kubrick, Tarkovsky, Butler, Haraway, Pelevin, and others. The survey considers science fiction’s utopian content and political function, as well as critical and dystopian modes of the genre.

<P>RES 242 The Russian Icon: Culture, Politics and the Sacred </P>

<P>Same as REL 242. How can we explain the unique aura of the Russian icon? As devotional object, political symbol, and art commodity, the icon is revered as sacred, vilified as reactionary, and displayed and sold as masterpiece. This course examines the complex world of the Russian icon from its ancient Byzantine roots, to its modern branding as “other,” and its recent recent reemergence in the turbulent public sphere of post-communist Russia. Topics include: the production and reception of icons; theology and visual “presence”; visuality and spirituality, religious seeing and visual practices; the secularization of the sacred; historical memory and national identity; modern art and film; visual warfare and contemporary protest movements.

<P>This course embarks upon the critical study of both the past and the contemporary Spanish-speaking world by examining the relationship between cuisine, race and national identity. Through native and imported foodways we interpret the history of Spain, Latin America, the U.S. Southwest and the Ottoman Empire by examining migrations, empires, multiple geographic locations and identity. By invoking the premise that history is contained in cookbooks and their oral counterparts, we study food of the indigenous cultures that inhabited Latin America long before the arrival of Europeans, as well as examine the impact of colonialism and nationalism on the continent. We explore the role of women in and out of the kitchen; the history of slavery and forced migrations from Spain and Latin America; and the impact of industrialization through recipes, food and eating.

<P>Becoming Latin America: Modernization and Resistance </P>

<P>This course looks at the ways in which Latin American authors confronted, appropriated and also resisted the paradigms of Modernity, from the post-Independence period to the mid 20th century. Through the study of primary sources and some recent re-interpretations of historical events, the class reflects on how Latin American culture was shaped by the legacy of colonialism and the persistent struggle to leave it behind. Special attention is paid to the clashing interactions between the indigenous populations, creole elites in a conflicted dialogue with the cultures of Europe and North America, and Africans brought to the continent as slaves. Class discussions will center on how cultural practices were traversed by notions of race, gender and social class, as well as by the larger geopolitical world context.

<P>Blackness in Spain </P>

<P>In this seminar we investigate the lives of individuals of African origin who lived or travelled in Spain at different historical times: painter Juan de Pareja (Velazquez’s slave) in the 17th century, whose breathtaking portrait by Velazquez hangs at the New York Metropolitan Museum; Arturo Schomburg, a pioneer scholar of Afro-American Studies who travelled to Spain in the 1920s to research Pareja; volunteers of the Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, such as poet Langston Hughes, singer-actor Paul Robeson and nurse Salaria Kea; migrant workers in the late 20th century; and finally Smith student Lori L. Tharp, author of a travel memoir of her Junior Year Abroad, Kinky Gazpacho (2008), which she describes as a “racial coming of age.” Through these different periods, people and situations we study the effects on racial ideology of factors such as class, marginality, love and the existence of shared projects of social transformation. The ultimate goal is to gain some understanding of racial relations in Spain, and to interrogate the meaning and causes of racism. Enrollment limited to 14. {A} {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Stages of Conflict: Performing Memory and Change in Spain and Latin America </P>

<P>A study of two societies (Spain and Argentina) at a critical moment in their histories. With theoretical readings from an array of disciplines such as the political sciences, history, theater and art, we examine at least two different responses to these societies’ respectively traumatic transitions from dictatorship to “democracy.” Through dramatic texts that vary from tragedy to farce, and with the help of films, documentaries, diaries, journal articles, correspondence and graphic art, we discuss repression, state-terrorism, censorship, corruption and the reciprocal roles of victim and oppressor. The class includes training in methodologies of acting, and at the end of the course, scenes from these texts are staged in Spanish. One of the goals of this course is to develop the ability to speak in Spanish before an audience.  No previous acting experience required. Enrollment limited to 14. {A} {F} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Recent Latin American Films: Bridging the Public and the Private </P>

<P>This course looks at recent Latin American films dealing with subjects that blur the boundaries between the public and the private spheres. We will make reference in particular to films that portray experiences of loss, dealing with topics such as grief, memory and recovery. The class will study films dealing with both public and private loss, reflecting on the differences and similarities between the two. Films looking at losses that resulted from events that affected the whole nation turn their attention to those events. By contrast, films dealing with individual loss tend to privilege the characters’ emotions. In both cases the focus on loss allows for reflections on identity, memory, and the future—reflections that blur the apparent boundary between the private and the public. Focusing mainly on films from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, students will reflect on the wider social significance of these films in reference to the context where they were made.

The seminar readings focus on renowned practitioners’ reflections on the difficulties and complexities of translating, the obstacles, discoveries and solutions that the translator encounters. We read a series of essays that engage with the conflicting interpretations and nuances of translations in 14 languages of Ferdinand Oyono’s iconic 1956 African novel, Une vie de boy. We compare how these translations transform the original novel and question the concept of original text as it interacts with the culture and the language into which it is translated. Students are responsible for presenting essays that focus on the particular challenges of translation that they have encountered in their individual project. Open to students in the Concentration in Translation Studies and students in Comparative Literature. Enrollment limit of 12 students. Prerequisite: CLT 150. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The course examines the roots of the American musical as a seminal theatrical form, with its own distinctive venues and styles; we pay particular attention to the socio-cultural factors that made the American musical stage a locus for identity-formation. The history of the American musical is deeply intertwined with the assimilationist project, particularly among Jewish-Americans, who were highly instrumental in its development. The economics of theatrical production in the early 20th century, along with the rise of a burgeoning middle class with time for leisure (a new phenomenon), gave rise to a “popular” form of musical theatre—the musical comedy—that was instrumental in creating what became “show business.” {A} {H} {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>THE 319 Shamans, Shapeshifters and the Magic If </P>

<P>To act, to perform is to speculate with your body. Theatre is a transformative experience that takes performer and audience on an extensive journey in the playground of the imagination beyond the mundane world. Theatre asks us to be other than ourselves. We can for a time inhabit someone else’s skin, be shaped by another gender or ethnicity, become part of a past epoch or an alternative time and space similar to our own time but that has yet to come. As we enter this “imagined” world we investigate the normative principles of our current world. This course investigates the counterfactual, speculative, subjunctive impulse in overtly speculative drama and film with a particular focus on race and gender. We examine an international range of plays by such authors as Caryl Churchill, Tess Onwueme, Dael Orlandersmith, Derek Walcott, Bertolt Brecht, Lorraine Hansberry, Craig Lucas and Doug Wright, as well as films such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; Pan’s Labyrinth; Children of Men; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; X-Men; Contact and Brother From Another Planet.

Brecht's influences on contemporary theatre are incalculable; his &quot;epic&quot; theatre combined political analysis with vaudeville, song, buffoonery and brilliant dramaturgy to create a new form of theatre. In this class, fundamental acting work combines with focus on the texts, including development of the actor’s score, choice work, and style. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>THE 360 Production Design for Film </P>

<P>Filmmaking is storytelling. This story can be told by the actors or by its visuals. Every film employs a production designer who, with the director and cinematographer, is in charge of the visual design of the film. In this class we learn how a production designer breaks down a script to determine which scenes should be shot on location and which should be built as sets. Each student makes design choices for the entire script. Whether picking out locations or creating sets to be shot on a soundstage, this class examines what makes one design choice better than another. Students also learn the basic skills to communicate their designs through storyboards, photo research and drafting. Permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit of 12 students. {A} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The translation studies concentration offers students studying a foreign language and culture an opportunity to refine their knowledge of the foreign language through translation. A student who wants to create a bridge between two majors, one of which is in a foreign language and culture and the other in a different discipline, will also find the concentration to be an important supplement to her curriculum. Student concentrators may not only be drawn to the literary side of translation; they may also seek to link their knowledge in the social sciences or sciences to their practice of a foreign language, translating governmental or legal documents, working with immigrant or refugee communities who need the help of a translator or interpreter, or translating scientific papers. </P>

<P>The translation studies concentration encourages study in a broad range of scholarly disciplines, including courses in the various departments of foreign languages and cultures, comparative literature, classics, film studies, American studies and English. The Poetry Center, the Five College Center for East Asian Studies, and the Five College journal Metamorphoses: A Journal of Literary Translation provide opportunities for guest translators as well as for student internships. Other resources include the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages (www.fivecolleges.edu/fclang) and the UMass Translation Center (www.umasstranslation.com). </P>

<P>The requirements for the concentration are deliberately flexible to allow students to pursue the translation practice that most suits their interests or needs—from literary to technical translation to the ethical complexities that arise in interpretation. </P>

<P>CLT 150 The Art of Translation: Poetics, Politics, Practice </P>

<P>We hear and read translations all the time: on television news, in radio interviews, in movie subtitles, in international bestsellers. But translations don’t shift texts transparently from one language to another. Rather, they revise, censor and rewrite original works, to challenge the past and to speak to new readers. We explore translation in a range of contexts by hearing lectures by experts in the history, theory and practice of translation. Knowledge of a foreign language useful but not required. Graded S/U only. Can be taken concurrently with FRN 295 for 4 credits. {L} Credits: 2 </P>

<P>TSX 330 Capstone Seminar in Translation Studies </P>

<P>Same as CLT 330. The capstone seminar brings together a cohort of concentrators to discuss the final translation project that each student undertakes with the guidance of their adviser in the concentration and to situate the project within the framework of larger questions that the work of translation elicits. The seminar readings focus on renowned practitioners’ reflections on the difficulties and complexities of translating, the obstacles, discoveries and solutions that the translator encounters. We read a series of essays that engage with the conflicting interpretations and nuances of translations in 14 languages of Ferdinand Oyono’s iconic 1956 African novel, Une vie de boy. We compare how these translations transform the original novel and question the concept of original text as it interacts with the culture and the language into which it is translated. Students are responsible for presenting essays that focus on the particular challenges of translation that they have encountered in their individual project. Open to students in the Concentration in Translation Studies and students in Comparative Literature. Enrollment limit of 12 students. Prerequisite: CLT 150. {L} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>The concentration is composed of six courses. In addition to the gateway course and the capstone experience, a student must take four courses, two of which should be in her language and culture of expertise, one with a focus on translation theory or practice, and one elective. In addition to the course work, students will engage in two practical learning experiences, one of which must be the equivalent of one semester on study abroad. The practical experiences do not carry credit. The combined course work in the concentration will total between 20 and 22 credits. </P>

<LBody>An internship or independent research project that focuses on translation/ interpretation or cross-cultural issues; that engages the foreign language in a significant way; and which may be undertaken while on study abroad. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Financial support for internships or practical experiences are available through Smith’s own study abroad and consortia, Praxis, and International Experience Grants, as well as a number of other grants for specific regions available for students studying or interning abroad or in immigrant communities in the United States. The Study Abroad programs, the Office for International Study, and the Lazarus Career Center have built databases of students who have worked, interned or studied abroad with organizations or companies and that offer a ready resource for concentrators. </P>

<P>Demonstration of achievement in the foreign language[s] from which the student translates. Student must reach a high intermediate level or B2 level according to the Common European Framework of References for Languages. Students are encouraged to take the officially recognized tests whenever possible, for example, when studying abroad on Smith’s Study Abroad programs. Normally, advanced-level courses (at the 300 or above level) will be considered to be equivalent to the B2 level of the CEFRL. For students working in “critical languages”—or non-Western languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Turkish, Urdu—the level of achievement should be the 300-level at Smith and with consultation with their adviser. International students, or students whose native language is other than English, should consult with their concentration adviser on how best to show they have attained the equivalent of a B2 level in English, the language from which they will translate. </P>

<P>E-Portfolio Language Passport </P>

<P>Students will be expected to develop an e-portfolio Language Passport with the guidance of the Director of the Concentration. Students may include the following in their e-portfolio: a detailed language self-assessment; a reflection on their language-learning; a reflection on how their practical experiences have deepened their understanding of the language and culture they are studying; a shortened version of the introduction to their final translation project. </P>

<P>Capstone: A choice of three possibilities: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>An independent translation project (10 pages minimum, depending on the type of translation) with a substantial introduction that reflects on the obstacles, difficulties and successes of the task of translation. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>An extra translation project within the context of an existing seminar or 300-level course in the language or culture of the student’s translation focus. (If students choose this option, the course will be in addition to the other four academic courses required for the concentration.) </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>An Honors thesis that is a translation project or reflects on translation. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Whichever of the three options the student chooses for the capstone, she will consult with her concentrator adviser.

<H1>The Major </H1>

<P>The Program for the Study of Women and Gender examines gender, race, class and sexuality as important and simultaneous aspects of social worlds and human lives. This examination requires inquiry into the construction and operation of power relations, social inequalities and resistances to injustice in both national and transnational contexts. We understand women, gender, feminism and  queer as politicized terms. As categories of analysis they help reveal how subjects become racialized, sexualized, gendered and class located. </P>

<P>Building on its origins in women’s studies, our program continues to examine the experiences, ideologies, works and actions of women in a variety of national, cultural, historical and political contexts. As an interdisciplinary endeavor, the study of women and gender shows students how different academic disciplines view the operation of gender in the labor market, the family, political systems and cultural production. Research and theory emerge from these everyday realities and, in turn, feminist theory informs our analysis of political choices and our understanding of the forms of activism around the globe. </P>

<P>SWG 105 Intro to LGBT Histories and Cultures </P>

<P>This course is an introduction to the growing field of queer American history. Over the course of the semester, we will explore the historical emergence of same-sex desire, practice, and identity, as well as gender transgression, from the late 19th century to the present. Using a wide range of sources, including archival documents, films, work by historians, and oral histories, we will investigate how and why people with same-sex desire and non-normative gender expressions formed communities, struggled against bigotry, and organized movements for social and political change. This course will pay close attention to the intersections of race, gender, class, and sexuality and the ways that difference has shaped queer history. We will work in the Special Collections at Smith and Mt. Holyoke and the community-based Sexual Minorities Archive. Together we will contribute a project to the web-based archive outhistory.org.

<P>In this course we will immerse ourselves in the 1990s, looking specifically at the emergences and points of contention that made the ‘90s a queer, radical, deeply contested decade.The Queer 90s examines the moment in lesbian and gay studies when the recuperation of the term “queer” emerged. By engaging with the readings and films assigned in this course students will gain an understanding of the AIDS crisis and the rage that mobilized ACT UP. Students will learn what the Culture Wars, Welfare Reform, and the conservative attacks against the National Endowment for the Arts have to do with one another. In order to grasp the charged feeling, the urgency, the upheaval of this era we will read foundational queer theoretical texts and analyze a selection of films from the movement known as New Queer Cinema.

We study constitutional and statutory law as well as public policy. Some of the topics we will cover are sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination, pregnancy/caregiver discrimination, pay equity, sexual harassment, school athletics, marriage, sterilization, contraception and abortion, reproductive technologies, sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and gender-based asylum. We will study feminist efforts to reform the law and examine how inequalities based on gender, race, class and sexuality shape the law.

<P>SWG 227 Feminist and Queer Disability Studies </P>

<P>In the essay “A Burst of Light: Living with Cancer,” writer-activist Audre Lorde forges pioneering connections between the work of social justice and the environmental, gendered, and healthcare inequities that circumscribe black and brown lives. Following Lorde’s intervention, this course examines contemporary feminist/queer expressive culture, writing, and theory that centrally engages the category of dis/ability. It will familiarize students with feminist and queer scholarship that resists the medical pathologization of embodied difference; foreground dis/ability’s intersections with questions of race, class, and nation; and ask what political and social liberation might look like when ablebodiedness is no longer privileged.

<P>Feminist science studies is a rich and diverse interdisciplinary field with genealogies in science practice, history, social sciences, and philosophy. Science studies has been a vital resource to feminist, queer, critical race, post- colonial, and disability theory and has also been profoundly shaped and extended by work in these fields. This class introduces core epistemological interventions and innovations in feminist and postcolonial science studies in order to frame readings of exciting new and classics works in the field. In particular we will explore themes of post/colonialism, posthumanism, and the queer. (E) </P>

<P>Flickers of global finance capital across computer screens cannot compare to the travel preparations of women migrating from rural homes to work at computer chip factories. Yet both movements, of capital and people, constitute vital facets of globalization in our current era. This course centers on the political linkages and economic theories that address the politics of women, gender relations and capitalism. We will research social movements that challenge the raced, classed and gendered inequities, and the costs of maintaining order. We will assess the alternatives proposed by social movements like the landless workers movement (MST) in Brazil, and economic shifts like the workers cooperative movement. Assignments include community-based research on local and global political movements, short papers, class-led discussions &amp; written reflections. </P>

<P>SWG 250 Methodologies of Gender Studies </P>

<P>This course introduces students to the theory and practice of research in gender, queer, and women's studies. The course begins with an introduction to key terms and debates in the field about how knowledge is produced. We focus particularly on how the power relations of gender combine with related relations of inequality/domination/oppression, such as race, class, sexuality, religion and nation. We then examine the distinguishing qualities of feminist methodologies in the social sciences, arts, humanities and sciences. The course gives particular attention to the interdisciplinary focus of feminist research and future directions of feminist methods. Prerequisite: SWG 150. {H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>SWG 270 Colloquium: Oral History and Lesbian Subjects </P>

<P>Grounding our work in the current scholarship in lesbian history, this course explores lesbian, queer and bisexual communities, cultures and activism. While becoming familiar with the existing narratives about lesbian/queer lives, students are introduced to the method of oral history as a key documentation strategy in the production of lesbian history. What are the gaps in the literature and how can oral history assist in filling in the spaces? What does a historical narrative that privileges categories of gender and sexuality look like? And how do we need to adapt our research methods, including oral history, in order to talk about lesbian/queer lives? Our texts include secondary literature on 20thcentury lesbian cultures and communities, oral history theory and methodology, and primary sources from the Sophia Smith Collection (SSC). Students conduct, transcribe, edit and interpret their own interviews for their final project. The oral histories from this course are archived with the Documenting Lesbian Lives collection in the SSC. Prerequisite: SWG 150 or permission of the instructor.

<P>This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of reproductive health, rights and justice in the United States, examining history, activism, law, policy, and public discourses related to reproduction. A central framework for analysis is how gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, disability and nationality intersect to shape people’s experiences of reproductive oppression and their resistance strategies. Topics include eugenics and the birth control movement; the reproductive rights and justice movements; U.S. population control policies; criminalization of pregnant people; fetal personhood and birth parents’ citizenship; the medicalization of reproduction; reproductive technologies; the influence of disability, incarceration and poverty on pregnancy and parenting; the anti-abortion movement; and reproductive coercion and violence.

<P>SWG 290 Gender, Sexuality and Popular Culture </P>

<P>In this course we will consider the manner in which norms of gender and sexuality are reflected, reinforced, and challenged in popular culture. We use theories of knowledge production, representation, and meaning-making to support our analysis of the relationship between discourse and power; our engagement with these theoretical texts helps us track this dynamic as it emerges in popular culture. Key queer theoretical concepts provide a framework for examining how the production gender and sexuality impacts cultural production. Through our critical engagement with a selection of films, music, television, visual art, and digital media we will discuss mainstream conventions and the feminist, queer, and queer of color interventions that enliven the landscape of popular culture with which we contend in everyday life.

<P>This course examines visual and literary documentations of queer life by reading memoirs and screening short and feature length documentaries films. We consider the power and value of documenting queer lives while examining the politics of visibility as impacted by race, class and gender. We will attend to the expansiveness of the term “queer” and consider the performativity of gender and the fluidity of sexuality in our analysis of each text. Students will produce a short film, write a short biography or propose another mode of documenting experiences of queer life as members of, or in solidarity with, the LGBT community.

<P>SWG 318 Women Against Empire </P>

<P>Anti-imperialist movements across the globe in the 20th century carried with them multiple projects for the liberation and equality of people. These movements sought to build sovereign nations independent of colonial power and to develop radically new social orders. For women in these movements, the problem of empire had complex regional and local inflections that began with the politics of reproduction. This course will look at three sites of women’s involvement contesting empire: first, the struggles of anti-imperial movements, second, women in the nationalist movements after formal independence and third, women’s movements in the current age of empire that has developed alongside the stealth of economic globalization and remote-control warfare.

<P>This seminar is an interdisciplinary examination of the international and domestic sex trade and trafficking involving women and girls, including sex trafficking; commercial sexual exploitation of girls; brokered, forced and child marriage; and sex work. We explore the social, economic and political conditions that shape these practices, including poverty and wealth inequality, globalization, war, technology, restrictions on migration, and ideologies of race, gender and nation. We also examine the social movements that address sex trafficking and sex work, particularly divisions among activists working on these issues, and learn about and assess anti-trafficking laws and public policies. Throughout the seminar, we analyze these issues from a feminist intersectional perspective. Prerequisites: SWG 150, one additional course in the major, and permission of the instructor.

We will explore the emergence and evolution of social movements against sexual harassment and assault, and how these movements advanced law and public policy on these issues in the United States. A central focus will be on how relations of power based on gender, race, class, sexuality, age, disability, and nationality shape people’s experiences of sexual harassment and assault and their responses to it.

<P>IDP 555 Seminar: American Society and Culture </P>

<P>“Freedom” has long been a defining ideal of U.S. life, passionately desired and intensely contested. This course investigates freedom in its cultural and social aspects. How did the ideals of freedom become so intimately associated with “America,” and specifically with the United States of America? How have various dispossessed peoples—slaves, immigrants, women, racial and ethnic minorities, colonized populations—looked to the ideals and practices of U.S. freedom to sustain their hopes and inform their actions? How have progressive and conservative reform movements fashioned myths of freedom to support their aspirations? How have ideals of freedom shaped the various roles the United States plays in the world? How should we assess the institutional framework that underlies the implementation of freedom as a “way of life” in the United States—that is, democratic politics, representative governance, and market capitalism? This course is limited to students in the Interdisciplinary Studies Diploma Program. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Five College Center for the Study of World Languages </P>

<P>The Five College Center for the Study of World Languages encourages students to embark on language study during their first year of college so that they can achieve the fluency needed to use the language for work in their major field. The center offers courses in Less-Commonly Taught Languages (LCTLs) to undergraduate and graduate students at Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The center offers multiple programs with varying pacing options for students who are interested in independent language study. </P>

<P>Courses offered through the Mentored Language Program cover all four primary language skills: speaking, listening, reading and writing. The format includes guided individual study along with one-on-one tutorials and small group conversation sessions. The format includes guided individual study along with one-on-one tutorials and small group conversation sessions. Independent Plus courses combine independent study with small group conversation sessions and one-on-one peer-tutoring. These courses emphasize speaking, listening and basic literacy in the language; reading and writing practice reinforces developing oral skills. Students are required to complete a standard syllabus during the semester and demonstrate competencies through regular attendance and participation in conversation and peer-tutoring sessions, a homework portfolio (with both video and written submissions), and a final oral evaluation with an external evaluator conducted at the end of the course. The Supervised Independent Language Program (FCSILP) offers independent study courses in many less-commonly studied languages. The courses emphasize speaking and listening skills. Students study independently following a program syllabus, meet once a week with a native speaker of the language for conversation practice and complete an oral evaluation with an outside evaluator at the end of the course. </P>

<P>Current and recent offerings include Afrikaans, Amharic, Bangla/Bengali, Bulgarian, Czech, Dari, Filipino, Georgian, Modern Greek, Haitian Creole, Hungarian, Malay, Mongolian, Nepali, Norwegian, Pashto, Romanian, Shona, Thai, Twi (Ghana), Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof (Senegal), Xhosa (South Africa), Zulu (South Africa). </P>
