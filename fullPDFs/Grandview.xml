<H2>University Mission </H2>

<P>Grand View engages, equips, and empowers students to fulfill their individual potential and serve society. Committed to the development of the whole person – mind, body and spirit – and to preparing students for successful careers and responsible citizenship in their communities and in a diverse and changing world, Grand View offers a liberal arts education that: </P>

<P> Challenges students to inquire with a disciplined and critical mind, communicate effectively, and display an awareness of the global issues that affect us all.  Creates a community of learners where differing perspectives are welcome, where friendly interaction is the norm, and where intellectual and personal integrity is expected and modeled.  Offers a supportive environment where students can engage in community with others, discern life purpose, and grow in leadership.  Affirms Christian faith and ethics as a vision for life, a vision that enhances our respect for the diversity and dignity of all people, for relating to others, and for the pursuit of lifelong learning. </P>

<P>Informed by its Danish Lutheran heritage, Grand View is a School for Life. </P>

<H2>History, Facilities, and Partnerships </H2>

<Sect>
<P>History </P>

<P>Grand View Founders </P>

<P>Grand View was founded in 1896 by members of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. These founders believed that a good education was essential as a foundation for life, work and service to others. </P>

<P>The educational and religious ideals of the Danish philosopher N. F. S. Grundtvig and the experience of the Scandinavian folk school shaped the founders’ vision for Grand View and its future development. </P>

<P>Growth </P>

<P>Since its founding, Grand View has provided students a program of general liberal education and has responded to changing societal needs. In 1912 Grand View opened an academy or high school department. In 1924 instruction at the junior college level began. Following discontinuation of the academy, the Iowa State Department of Public Instruction accredited the junior college in 1938. By 1959 Grand View was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. In 1960 the theological seminary at Grand View was relocated to Maywood, Illinois, with the formation of the Lutheran Church in America and its Iowa Synod. </P>

<P>In 1975 the College added a new division offering preparation for nursing and allied health professions, and the nursing program became the first four-year degree offering.  Baccalaureate accreditation in the summer of 1975 was a major event in the College’s continuing development.  Thereafter Grand View has expanded its offerings to 40 undergraduate and five graduate degree programs, and many combine classroom learning with career-related experiences in the Des Moines area. </P>

<P>In 1988 Grand View became one of 27 colleges of the newly formed Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 2008, with the launch of its inaugural master’s program, Grand View became a University. </P>

<P>Throughout its history the University has emphasized a personalized admissions process, moderate tuition, quality teaching, liberal learning, career preparation, community contacts, religious heritage, and lifelong education. </P>

<P>Lutheran Higher Education </P>

<P>Grand View University is one of the 26 institutions of higher education that are sponsored by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. These colleges and universities share a common commitment to faith, learning, and service. They are called upon by the founding documents of the Church to be: “faithful to the Lutheran tradition [as] …an essential expression of God’s mission in the world; faithful to the will of God as institutions providing quality instruction in religion and a lively ministry of worship, outreach, and service; faithful to the world by preparing leaders committed to truth, excellence, and ethical values; and faithful to students in their dedication to the development of mind, body, and spirit.” </P>

<P>Church Relations </P>

<P>To inform congregations about the mission of Grand View as a university of the ELCA, the University provides outreach and service to congregations and other church organizations through a program of church relations activities. </P>

<P>Off-campus church relations activities include preaching and church school instruction by university faculty and staff and musical programs by the Grand View University Choir. </P>

<P>For additional information about these church relations programs and services, contact the Campus Pastor. </P>

<P>Facilities </P>

<P>The beautiful 60-acre Grand View campus resides in northeast Des Moines in the Union Park neighborhood. The original 4-acre campus anchors the west campus which extends along Grandview Avenue, Boyd Street and Morton Avenue to East 14th Street. The “east” campus continues to East 16th Street, and is bordered on the north by East Hull Avenue, and on the south by East Sheridan Avenue. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Grand View’s location in Des Moines, the capital city of Iowa, offers many advantages to students, especially internship opportunities with premier businesses and state, municipal, and social agencies. Des Moines offers exceptional facilities for the enjoyment of lectures, forums, concerts, museums, and other cultural opportunities. </P>

<P>Partnerships with the Community </P>

<P>As a natural outgrowth of Grand View’s historical and continuing mission, the University seeks to capitalize on its unique location, skills, and resources by maintaining and expanding a range of partnership opportunities. Such partnerships include those formed with public and private institutions, external and internal constituencies, and formal and informal associations.  In addition, Grand View’s partnerships seek to fulfill one or more of the following missions: 1) to expand the educational experience of students outside of the university environment; 2) to provide community service consistent with Grand View’s educational focus; 3) to provide career enrichment opportunities to students; 4) to provide opportunity for beneficial faculty and student connection to the community; 5) to provide educational seminars, short courses and/or certificate programs to meet the needs of Grand View’s community partners. </P>

<P>Moreover, wishing to be a responsible member of its community, Grand View publicly commits itself to ethical and open relationships in all of its partnerships with institutions and people. The hallmark of Grand View’s commitment shall be a desire to foster: </P>

<P> A mutually beneficial relationship between </P>

<P>parties of compatible missions.  Policies and practices consistent with ethical </P>

<P>values.  Openness and ample communication between </P>

<P>partners.  Sufficient procedures for periodic review and </P>

<P>conscientious redress of difficulties.  A maximizing of current and potential </P>

<P>resources. </P>

<P>The department chair of the courses being evaluated has the ultimate approval of transferability of the courses.  Official transcripts must be submitted from all institutions attended whether coursework was completed or not.  Transcripts must be mailed directly from the originating institution to Grand View University. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Only credits and grade points earned at Grand View will be used to calculate a student’s cumulative grade point averages.  Credits with grades of D or better that transferred from an accredited institution can be used toward graduation and may be used to meet requirements and prerequisites for specific courses, but not necessarily toward students’ majors.  Students awarded Latin honors must receive at least 45 credit hours from Grand View from which the grade point average will be calculated.  The maximum number of transfer credits accepted from junior/community colleges is 66 semester credits.  All transfer coursework is accepted at the course level from the originating institution. </P>

<P>Transfer with an Associate in Arts Degree </P>

<P>The Associate in Arts degree (AA) satisfies the Grand View University General Education Core requirements for the baccalaureate degree except for the composition and quantitative reasoning courses (unless fulfilled by transfer coursework), Core Seminars II and III, and the required number of outcome iterations (number determined by class status on entry to the University; see General Education Core section of the catalog for further details).  The student must have graduated from an accredited institution and earned a 2.00 cumulative grade point average on a 4.00 system based on work completed at all institutions attended, and have satisfied Grand View’s Quantitative Reasoning and Composition course requirements.  Students holding Associate in Arts degrees from accredited institutions based outside the United States are required to satisfy Grand View’s Quantitative Reasoning and Composition course requirements.  </P>

<P>The maximum number of transfer credits accepted from junior/community colleges is 66 semester hours.  All junior/community college transfer credit is considered lower division credit (100-200 level). Developmental courses taken at a community college (below 100 level) will be accepted as prerequisite courses but will not count towards a student’s credit total. </P>

<P>Students holding any other Associate’s degree other than an Associate of Arts degree are not exempt from the general degree requirements. </P>

<P>Transfer with a Baccalaureate Degree </P>

<P>Students holding a baccalaureate degree or higher from an accredited institution based in the United States are considered to have fulfilled all Grand View University General Education Core requirements except for the completion of one iteration of each of the Core outcomes and Core Seminar III.  To earn the additional degree, they must complete the following: 30-hour residency requirement, one iteration of each outcome, Core Seminar III, requisite courses for the major, and prerequisites for those courses. </P>

<P>Students holding baccalaureate degrees from accredited institutions based outside the United States are frequently considered to have fulfilled all General Education Core requirements except English Composition, though Grand View reserves the right to make a determination of comparability.   </P>

<P>Transfer from Vocational-Technical Schools </P>

<P>Grand View University, with departmental approval, awards credit in some cases for courses successfully completed in technical and/or vocational programs at institutions of higher education which have the accreditation of their regional association or of a professional accrediting association recognized by the U.S. Office of Education.  Grand View may refuse to recognize vocational/technical credit or may accept some or all of the credit.  No grades are averaged into the cumulative GPA.  A maximum number of 30 vocational/technical transfer credits are accepted.  Core courses are accepted on a course-for-course basis only, at the discretion of the Registrar’s Office.  Other courses receive general elective credit.  Students must meet all graduation requirements. </P>

<P>Transfer from a Non-Accredited College </P>

<P>Grand View University may refuse to recognize credit from a non-accredited college or may accept credit for courses successfully passed with a C or better.  Credit may be given for courses equivalent to the core courses required of every Grand View graduate. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>At the discretion of the Registrar’s Office and the major department, courses may be counted toward the major.  Additional coursework is considered elective.  These elective credits count toward hours required for graduation but do not meet any specific degree requirements.  The transferability of coursework follows the principles outlined in Transfer from an Accredited Institution. </P>

<P>No grades from non-accredited institutions are averaged into the cumulative GPA. </P>

<P>Readmission </P>

<P>Students who have not attended Grand View for two or more consecutive semesters (not including summer) must reapply for admission through the Office of Admissions by completing the online Application for Admission. </P>

<P>Students who have attended another institution since leaving Grand View are required to submit current official transcripts from those institutions attended. </P>

<P>Readmission – Suspended Students </P>

<P>Students who are returning to Grand View University after an academic suspension must complete the following additional requirements to be considered for readmission: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Cease course work at Grand View for a minimum of one fall or spring semester. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Complete college courses from an accredited institution of higher education other than Grand View.  Must be able to demonstrate ability to be successful in college level course work. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Apply for readmission to Grand View University.  An Application for Readmission may be obtained at www.admissions.grandview.edu.   Submit current official transcripts from all institutions attended since leaving Grand View regardless of whether credit was earned.   </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must petition the Academic Advising and Progression Committee showing evidence of substantial improvement in their ability to </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>perform college level work.  Submit a Petition </P>

<P>for Readmission for a Suspended Student form </P>

<P>to the Admissions Office.  Forms may be </P>

<P>obtained from the Admissions Office or online. </P>

<P>Completion of these tasks is no guarantee for readmittance and each application will be judged on its own merits. </P>

<P>All requirements for readmission must be completed before the first day of the academic term in which the student wishes to enroll.  Students who successfully petition the Academic Advising and Progression Committee for readmission after this deadline will not be allowed to enroll at Grand View University until the following semester or academic session. </P>

<P>Students who have been suspended for disciplinary reasons may request readmission from the vice president for student affairs after the term of suspension has expired.  Additionally, students with a history of disciplinary behaviors that are counter to the effective functioning of the University may be required to petition prior to readmission. </P>

<P>Readmission – Deployed Veterans </P>

<P>If called to active duty a student (or student who is a spouse/dependent child of a member of the military called to active duty, and who needs to withdraw due to the call-up), should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office to complete a Military Leave of Absence form. Verification of military deployment must be submitted with the completed Military Leave of Absence form. </P>

<P>If the student is called to active duty before the mid-point of a term, the student may request to withdraw from some or all courses and the University will fully refund their tuition and mandatory fees for the withdrawn courses. </P>

<P>If the student is called to active duty military service during the term, the student may make arrangements with their instructors to remain enrolled in some or all of their course and will be assigned an I grade (Incomplete) for each course in which they remain enrolled.  In such a case, no adjustment of tuition charges for enrolled courses will occur.  Students have until the end of the next academic term following their release from military service to complete the course.  Failure to do so will result in the I grade becoming an F grade. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>A student receiving Veteran’s Benefits should notify the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office in order to complete the required documents.   </P>

<P>A student will have one calendar year after the end of their deployment to re-enroll at Grand View.  Grand View considers the end date of deployment to be the date listed on the original deployment papers, or more recent paperwork (such as a DD-214) that lists a deployment end date.  After one calendar year beyond the deployment end date, the student will need to apply for readmission to Grand View through the Admissions Department. </P>

<P>A student will be re-enrolled in the same academic program (or the most similar one, if same program does not exist), will carry forward the same number of credits, and same academic status.  Grand View University scholarship awards will be preserved for students holding such awards when called to active duty. </P>

<P>During the first academic year of return, the veteran will be assessed the same tuition and fee charges as were in effect during the academic year he/she left the program (Veterans or other service member education benefits may be taken into account) or up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veteran’s education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other service member education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the current academic year in which the student left for Grand View. </P>

<P>A student who wishes to re-enroll at Grand View after deployment should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office.  The VA Certifying Official will serve as the main point of contact for the student during the re-enrollment process. </P>

<P>Provisional Admission </P>

<P>Full-time and part-time transfer and CPAL students who demonstrate potential may be admitted under a provisional basis for a maximum of two semesters. </P>

<P>Provisionally accepted students will be limited to 12-13 credit hours until the provisional status has been removed.   </P>

<P>Students may be removed from Provisional status once they attain a sufficient cumulative grade point average to be considered in Good Academic Standing by the Academic Advising and Progression Committee: </P>

<P>Non-Degree Students </P>

<P>Students interested in taking courses for academic credit, but who are not seeking a degree are welcome to enroll as non-matriculating students.  These students are not eligible for any financial aid through Grand View University, the State of Iowa, or federal entitlement programs.  If students decide to become degree seeking, they must complete the admission process meeting all the standards.  Students may apply up to 20 credit hours taken as non-degree students toward a degree.  Students enrolled at another college and planning to transfer credit back to that institution should verify that the course is equivalent with their college prior to enrolling at Grand View.  Non-matriculating students (other than students in approved programs) will register one week prior to the start of the term for the course. </P>

<P>Registration will begin for non-degree-seeking students one week prior to the start of the class and will be completed only if there is an available seat in the class.  Only 20 credits earned while a nondegree-seeking student may be applied toward a Grand View University degree.  Completion of coursework as a non-degree-seeking student does not guarantee admission to a Grand View University degree program. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Senior Citizens </P>

<P>The policy for senior citizen students (persons aged 65 years or over on the first day of the class) is divided into two categories of students: degree-seeking students and students who are not degree-seeking.  </P>

<P>Degree-seeking senior citizen students follow the same policies and processes as any other degree-seeking student including payment of all regular tuition and fees.  They are required to meet admission requirements, apply for Federal and State financial aid, and meet with an advisor to register after they have been admitted.  </P>

<P>Senior citizens who are not degree-seeking are eligible to register for undergraduate classes at a discounted rate, equal to the fee assessed for audited courses (see fee schedule published by the Business Office each year) if they plan to earn credit for the course.  To audit the course (attend the course without earning credit for it), the student must declare at the time they register that they do not wish to take the course(s) for credit, and they may attend at no charge.  This standing cannot be changed at a later time.  To receive this benefit, students must submit proof of age and a completed request form at the Registrar’s Office. </P>

<Sect>
<P>For purposes of evaluation, students who are currently enrolled at the University may access their grades and transcript through myView, including the automated Evaluate Student Program process that compares completed coursework with academic program requirements.  Copies of a student’s high school transcript, as well as transcripts which have been sent to Grand View from other colleges and universities cannot be released.  Students must direct their requests for copies of these transcripts directly to the originating institution. </P>

<P>Student records are confidential and may be released only upon the written request of the student involved or upon the signed request of a person legally authorized to act on behalf of the student. </P>

<P>Tuition and Fees </P>

<P>The full time day* tuition charge is a comprehensive fee covering the academic costs of attending Grand View University.  It includes the student identification card, the use of campus facilities, and the use of the Health Clinic.  Students registered for more than 18 semester hour credits are charged an overload rate per additional semester hour credit.  Please go to www.grandview.edu for an up-to-date listing of tuition and fees. </P>

<P>Senior Citizens </P>

<P>The policy for senior citizen students (persons aged 65 years or over on the first day of the class) is divided into two categories of students: degree-seeking students and students who are not degree-seeking. </P>

<P>Degree-seeking senior citizen students follow the same policies and processes as any other degree-seeking student including payment of all regular tuition and fees.

<Sect>
<P>Registration will begin for non-degree-seeking students one week prior to the start of the class and will be completed only if there is an available seat in the class.  Only 20 credits earned while a nondegree-seeking student may be applied toward a Grand View University degree.  Completion of coursework as a non-degree-seeking student does not guarantee admission to a Grand View University degree program. </P>

<P>Payments and Refunds </P>

<P>Payment of Student Accounts </P>

<P>Payment of charges for tuition, fees, room, and board are due by the Friday before the start of class for any term.  All other charges (fines, etc.) are due within 10 days of the date assessed.  Payments can be made online or at the Business Office and may be made by cash, check, MasterCard, Visa, Discover Card or American Express. A convenience fee will be applied to all credit card payments made towards student account balances. </P>

<P>The Employer Reimbursement Plan is available to students who are reimbursed by their employer for the cost of classes.  While the students have the ultimate responsibility for payment of tuition, the amount reimbursed by the company can be deferred until 30 days after the end of the term.  To defer payment students must: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Complete and submit the Grand View Tuition Reimbursement Form (available in the Business Office) no later than the tuition due date; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>On or before the tuition due date pay the portion of tuition not covered by the employer reimbursement plan plus a processing fee of $25.00 per semester. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Additionally, the University offers a variety of payment plan options.  For additional information on this payment option, please contact the Business Office. </P>

<P>Any amount not paid in full by the due date will be assessed a 1.5% per month late charge.  The balance shall be due and payable at once, without any additional notice to the students, if the students terminate enrollment at Grand View University or the total due is not paid by the final payment deadline.  The student is responsible for all interest, collection costs and attorney fees necessary for the collection of any amount not paid when due.  Late fees will continue to be charged in the amount of 1.5% per month.  Any past due balance may result in prevention of further enrollment and may also result in cancellation of registration for upcoming classes.  Transcripts and diplomas will be held until all financial obligations to the University are satisfied. </P>

<P>Students who do not pay tuition, fees, room or board, or make arrangements for payment by the published deadline each semester may have their future schedules cancelled and future housing room and board plans terminated. Students will be notified using their Grand View e-mail account concerning outstanding delinquencies and given an opportunity to pay the past due balance or make arrangements for payment with the Business Office prior to cancellation. If the University takes such action, the student will still be responsible for any outstanding balance. </P>

<P>All returned checks will be charged a $25.00 fee which will be added to the students’ tuition accounts, and no further checks will be accepted. </P>

<P>Tuition Refunds </P>

<P>Financial Aid refunds are issued beginning Wednesday of the 2nd week of each term and thereafter are issued twice weekly within 5 business days from the date the credit balance was created.  All refund checks will be mailed immediately upon issue to the student’s primary address, or deposited into a bank account specified by the student. </P>

<P>Dropping Classes </P>

<P>Students have the first five days of each semester (add/drop period) to add and drop classes without financial penalty.  The Business Office and Financial Aid Office will establish each student’s tuition charges and financial aid based on the student’s enrollment after the add/drop period.  Any classes dropped after the add/drop period will continue to count toward total billing credits and will not result in an adjustment to tuition charges or financial aid unless students completely withdraw (drop all classes) from the University.  Classes added after this date may result in increased tuition charges as the total billing credits charged will include all courses not dropped before or during the add/drop period.  Students enrolled in both accelerated sessions within a semester* will have their withdrawal calculations based upon complete attendance in the semester and not in the individual accelerated sessions.  Please contact the Financial Aid Office or Business Office for more information regarding your withdrawal calculation. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>*Semester is equivalent to two terms.  Fall semester (Term 1 and 2), Spring Semester (Term 3 and 4), Summer (Term 5 and 6).  The add/drop period is adjusted for courses that do not last the full length of a semester or session. </P>

<P>Complete Withdrawal </P>

<P>Students who are considering withdrawing from Grand View University should first consider all academic options with their advisor.  Students should then consult with the Financial Aid and Business Offices to understand the financial implications of a complete withdrawal. Students who then decide to officially withdraw from the University must contact the Registrar’s Office if a full- or part-time day student, or the Center for Graduate, Adult, and Online Learning staff (CPAL) if an evening/weekend student or graduate student.  These offices will assist in completing the official withdrawal/exit form. Students who wish to remain enrolled for a future term must indicate their intention in writing. </P>

<P>The official withdrawal date will be determined by the date that the student begins the official withdrawal process.  This date will be used to determine any adjustments to tuition and financial aid awards.  Students who withdraw on or after the first day of the term and before the 60% point in time in the semester will receive a prorated refund in tuition.  The amount of the refund is based on the percentage of the semester that has not been completed (the number of calendar days remaining in the semester divided by the number of calendar days in the semester).  Financial aid will be refunded to the respective sources (federal, state and institutional) using the same percentage.  Stated simply, a student who completely withdraws after completing 20% of the semester will be charged 20% of tuition charges and will retain 20% of the financial aid.  Examples of the application of the refund policy are available upon request at the Financial Aid Office.  If funds have been released to the student because of a credit balance on the student’s account at Grand View University, then the student may be required to repay some or all of the amount released to the student.  This policy is subject to federal regulations.  Contact the Financial Aid Office for details and to learn of any changes to this policy. </P>

<P>Room and Board Refunds </P>

<P>Written notification of a contract termination must be received by July 1 for the fall semester and by November 15 for the spring semester.  Housing deposits will be forfeited for all contracts terminated beyond this deadline.  Room charges are not refundable after classes begin the first day of the academic year.  For students withdrawing from Grand View, board charges are refunded based on the number of full weeks remaining in the semester at the time of withdrawal.  Board charges are not refundable beyond 60% of the semester.  Please refer to your Housing and Meal contract for additional information. </P>

<P>Student Activity Fee/Technology Fee/Online Course Fee/Parking Fee/Residence Hall Activity Fee Refunds </P>

<P>Fees are charged to student accounts on a per semester basis.  Parking fees are assessed to all students.  Technology fees and Student Activity fees are both assessed to full-time students.  Resident Activity fees are assessed to students living in any campus housing.  Online course fees are charged per credit hour for all online courses. Fees are not refundable after the start of the semester.  Please go to www.grandview.edu for an up-to-date listing of tuition and fees. </P>

<P>Active Military Service Withdrawal </P>

<P>If called to active duty a student (or student who is a spouse/dependent child of a member of the military called to active duty, and who needs to withdraw due to the call-up), should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office to complete a Military Leave of Absence form. Verification of military deployment must be submitted with the completed Military Leave of Absence form. </P>

<P>If the student is called to active duty before the mid-point of a term, the student may request to withdraw from some or all courses and the University will fully refund their tuition and mandatory fees for the withdrawn courses. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>If the student is called to active duty military service during the term, the student may make arrangements with their instructors to remain enrolled in some or all of their course and will be assigned an I grade (Incomplete) for each course in which they remain enrolled.  In such a case, no adjustment of tuition charges for enrolled courses will occur.  Students have until the end of the next academic term following their release from military service to complete the course.  Failure to do so will result in the I grade becoming an F grade. </P>

<P>A student receiving Veteran’s Benefits should notify the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office in order to complete the required documents.   </P>

<P>A student will have one calendar year after the end of their deployment to re-enroll at Grand View.  Grand View considers the end date of deployment to be the date listed on the original deployment papers, or more recent paperwork (such as a DD-214) that lists a deployment end date.  After one calendar year beyond the deployment end date, the student will need to apply for readmission to Grand View through the Admissions Department. </P>

<P>A student will be re-enrolled in the same academic program (or the most similar one, if same program does not exist), will carry forward the same number of credits, and same academic status.  Grand View University scholarship awards will be preserved for students holding such awards when called to active duty. </P>

<P>During the first academic year of return, the veteran will be assessed the same tuition and fee charges as were in effect during the academic year he/she left the program (Veterans or other service member education benefits may be taken into account) or up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veteran’s education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other service member education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the current academic year in which the student left for Grand View. </P>

<P> The financial aid program and Grand View University provides assistance to students who, without such aid, would be unable to attend Grand View and provides opportunity to reward, encourage, and recognize students’ academic achievements. </P>

<P> The primary responsibility for financing a higher education rests upon the students and parents.  Financial aid from Grand View and other sources will be viewed only as supplementary to the family contribution. </P>

<P> For financial aid purposes, undergraduate students enrolled in 12 credit hours or more per term in the standard Fall, Spring and/or Summer Semesters as well as the two sessions that comprise fall, spring or summer semesters for students enrolled in the Center for Graduate, Adult, and Online Learning accelerated classes are considered full-time students. Those students enrolled in less than 12 but at least 6 credit hours per standard semester as well as the two sessions that comprise fall, spring or summer semesters are considered half-time. The following is a breakdown of enrollment statuses for undergraduate students enrolled in the Fall/Spring, Summer Semester/Trimester and/or two sessions that comprise fall, spring or summer for students enrolled in the CPAL accelerated classes:  </P>

<P>The assessment of financial assistance offered by Grand View University is based on financial need as reported by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and merit based on academic history of the student.  Primary considerations for aid is given to students who meet the January 15 priority deadline (must have the FAFSA to processing center by that date). </P>

<P>Note: to insure that forms are received by the processor by the priority deadline date, complete an on-line FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov by December 30. </P>

<P>Should questions arise concerning the financial aid application process or the awards you receive, contact the Financial Aid Office at (515) 263-2820 or 1-800-444-6083, ext. 2820. </P>

<P>The Financial Aid Office is dedicated to providing excellent service.  Should you wish to recommend staff for exemplary performance or express a complaint, please contact the Financial Aid Director. </P>

<P>Grand View University Assistance </P>

<P>Full-time students who are charged the full-time day tuition rate and are degree seeking may be eligible for Grand View University awarded aid.  Grand View awarded aid is available to students for a maximum of eight semesters. Transfer students’ eligibility will be prorated based on hours transferred to Grand View. Students with greater than 27 transfer credits would be eligible for a maximum of six semesters. Students transferring between 15-27 credits would be eligible for a maximum of seven semesters. Students with less than 15 transfer credits would be eligible for eight semesters. Grand View assistance is available only for the Fall and Spring semesters. For a complete listing of scholarships, grants, and other awards, please see the Financial Aid Handbook at www.grandview.edu.  </P>

<P>Work-Study Program </P>

<P>Grand View University’s work program allows eligible students to earn up to the amount shown on the financial aid award at a part-time job on- or off-campus.  Awards are based on calculated need as determined by information provided on the FAFSA.  Need-based employment is funded by Federal Work-Study.  Student workers must complete paperwork in the Career Center prior to beginning work.  Employment earnings are paid DIRECTLY to the student for hours worked and DO NOT show as a credit on the tuition bill.  Students earning pay through work may choose to apply their paycheck toward their tuition balance.  Checks are issued in the Business Office on the 10th of each month, or students may elect to have their paycheck deposited directly into their bank account.  Enrollment forms for Direct Deposit are available in the Business Office. </P>

<P>Work-Study awards are offered to students as part of their financial aid packages.  Employment awards generally range between $500 and $1,500 per year.  The typical work-study position pays minimum wage.  The work-study award is not a guarantee of employment.  Available work-study positions are posted through the Career Center.  When you find a position of interest, you will need to contact the campus employer to arrange an interview.  You are responsible for establishing a work schedule with your supervisor so that you can earn the total amount of your work award.  It is not possible for Grand View University to make up any award that you do not earn.  If you choose to decline your work-study award, Grand View will not make up this amount in scholarships or grants. </P>

<P>Satisfactory Academic Progress </P>

<P>Standards and Duration of Eligibility for Receiving Financial Aid for Undergraduates </P>

<P>The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, requires students to maintain satisfactory progress toward their degree in order to receive financial aid.  At Grand View University, these standards are established for students who are receiving or applying for financial aid from one or more of the various federal, state, or institutional scholarship, grant, work, or loan programs. </P>

<P>Grand View’s Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for financial aid apply to all students who want to establish or maintain financial aid eligibility.  These standards apply to a student’s entire academic transcript, including terms for which financial aid was not applied or disbursed. </P>

<P>The Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards require that students successfully complete a certain percentage of attempted credit hours and maintain a minimum required grade point average as defined by the standards.  These are minimum standards that must be attained.  Specific aid programs or departments standards may require more than these minimum standards. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>The academic progress of financial aid recipients is monitored a minimum of once each semester/payment period.  Students should contact the Financial Aid Office with questions regarding the intent and/or interpretation of these standards. </P>

<P>Completion Rate Requirements and Duration of Eligibility </P>

<P>Students must successfully complete 67% of their attempted credit hours.  Credits for which students receive grades of W or F are counted as credits that are attempted, but not completed.  Students who do not earn 67% of their attempted credit hours will be granted one warning period in which to increase their percentage of credit hours earned.  Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period will result in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the student has earned 67% of the attempted credit hours. </P>

<P>Eligibility will terminate when the credit hours required for a specific degree/program are earned or the student has attempted greater than 150% of the credit hours required for a specific degree/program.  </P>

<P>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirements </P>

<P>Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA.  The minimum GPA requirements are as follows: </P>

<Table>
<TR>
<TH/>

<TH> Minimum Cumulative GPA </TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Year 1, first semester 1 – 14 hours </TD>

<TD>1.7 GPA </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Year 1, second semester 15 – 27 hours </TD>

<TD>1.8 GPA </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Year 2, first semester 28 – 42 hours </TD>

<TD>1.9 GPA </TD>

<TD>2.0 GPA </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Year 4  More than 89 hours </TD>

<TD>2.0 GPA </TD>
</TR>
</Table>

<P>Students who do not have the minimum cumulative minimum GPA are granted one warning period in which to raise their cumulative GPA to the minimum.  Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period results in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the cumulative GPA meets the minimum standards. </P>

<P>Courses with a grade of Incomplete must be completed in the following semester.  The Incomplete is not factored into academic progress until the grade is assigned by the faculty member.  Incomplete courses that remain after one semester will be assigned a grade of F and factored into academic progress at that time. </P>

<P>Warning Periods </P>

<P>Please note that students will receive a total of one warning period whether they are in violation of one or more Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. </P>

<P>Transfer Students </P>

<P>Transfer credits that are accepted at Grand View University are counted toward the total attempted credits in determining Duration of Eligibility.  </P>

<P>Repeated Coursework </P>

<P>When students repeat a course, the most recent grade received is used in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average.  The credit hours for the class will be calculated as part of a student’s completion rate. </P>

<P>In regards to financial aid in relation to the repeating of a course, the following applies: </P>

<P> A failed course may be repeated as many times as needed until passed  A previously passed course may only be repeated once </P>

<P> This includes even those courses where a higher grade is required for the major (e.g., minimum of C for nursing major courses, etc.) </P>

<P> This does not include courses designated as repeatable (e.g., ensembles, music lessons, communications labs, etc.) as these are not restricted nor limited (unless designated otherwise) and, therefore, a student may repeat these courses as often as needed </P>

<P> If a student finally passes a failed course with a passing grade, he/she may repeat the course </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>one more time to try and achieve a higher </P>

<P>grade </P>

<P>Non-credit Coursework </P>

<P>Non-credit coursework is not counted in the minimum credit requirement. </P>

<P>Re-establishing Eligibility </P>

<P>Students who have lost financial assistance eligibility due to a deficiency in completed hours or a low GPA can regain eligibility by achieving the minimums established in this policy.  It is the student’s responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office when this has been accomplished in order to request the aid to be reinstated. </P>

<P>Appeal Process </P>

<P>Extenuating circumstances such as the death of a relative, an injury or illness of the student, or other special circumstance that results in a student failing to achieve the minimum completed credit hours and/or GPA requirements will be evaluated by the Financial Aid Academic Progress Committee.   </P>

<P>A student’s appeal must include the following: </P>

<P> A completed Financial Aid Appeal Form found </P>

<P>Consortium Agreements </P>

<P>Grand View University allows qualified students to take courses at other institutions while receiving financial aid from Grand View in rare instances.  Students must be enrolled in coursework at Grand View during the term for which they request a consortium agreement.  The classes must not be offered at Grand View in the time frame that the students need to graduate or would hinder their progress toward graduation.  The approved classes must transfer back to Grand View, and they must meet the students’ graduation requirements.  Forms are available in the Financial Aid Office and must be completed with the student’s academic advisor and have the provost’s approval.  Courses taken by consortium agreement do not interrupt nor count toward the last 30 hours at Grand View University requirements. </P>

<P>Other Financial Matters </P>

<P>Disbursements of Aid for Non-Institutional Costs </P>

<P>This is applicable only if aid exceeds institutional costs.  Financial aid refunds in excess of institutional costs will be disbursed according to federal financial aid guidelines.  For more information, contact the Grand View Business Office. </P>

<P>Student Responsibilities and Discipline </P>

<P>The submission of an application for admission to Grand View University represents a voluntary decision by a prospective student.  Acceptance for admission to the University represents the extension of privilege to join this academic community.  Students may remain part of the University so long as they fulfill academic and behavioral expectations as set forth in University publications, as announced by University authorities, and as posted on bulletin boards. </P>

<P>When students are closely associated in an academic community, externally imposed restraints on behavior are necessary to maintain order and fairness and to protect the majority from possible inconsistent behavior of those who infringe on the rights of others.  Grand View University maintains rules and regulations which are consistent with its announced educational objectives and which are fairly related to the accomplishment and protection of these objectives. </P>

<P>University policies on student life are presented in the Student Handbook, which is available online at www.grandview.edu.  Specific expectations of students are explained in this publication. </P>

<P>Any student unable or unwilling to abide by University regulations may expect disciplinary action by the University and/or civil authorities.  The University will cooperate fully with civil authorities having jurisdiction in specific matters.  Students charged with misconduct have the rights of due process and appeal.  The University may suspend or dismiss any student whose conduct is unsatisfactory, and shall be under no liability for such action. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Student Grievances </P>

<P>Procedures to appeal or reexamine a previously made decision have been established by several administrative units of the University.  Formal grievance procedures exist: </P>

<P>To appeal a final course grade or instructor’s final academic disciplinary action (Office of the Provost).  Students who wish to appeal a final course grade or other final academic disciplinary action of an instructor must complete and file the first section of an Academic Appeal form electronically within 14 calendar days after the end of the academic term in which the issue of disagreement occurred. </P>

<P>To appeal decisions regarding admission, progression, or graduation in the nursing program (Office of the Chair of the Nursing Department).  Students who wish to appeal a previously made decision must submit a Letter of Intent to File a Grievance to the Chair of the Nursing Department within 14 days after the incident.  The student must subsequently complete a Statement of Grievance within 48 hours after the Letter of Intent is received in the Chair’s office. </P>

<P>To appeal decisions regarding admission, progression, or graduation in the education program the student must submit a written letter and schedule a meeting with the Education Department Chair within 14 calendar days after the incident. Students who wish to continue the grievance further make speak with the Dean of Humanities and Education. </P>

<P>To appeal a parking ticket (Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs).  Students who wish to appeal a parking ticket must complete and submit a Parking Appeal Form to the Office of Student Life within 10 days after receiving a citation. </P>

<P>To appeal a housing exemption decision (Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs).  Appeals must be submitted in writing with any supporting documentation.  The student should present the appeal to the Vice President for Student Affairs.  Appeals must be received within five working days from the date of the original exemption decision.  Questions regarding the process should be directed to the Student Life Office at 515-263-2886. </P>

<P>To appeal a financial aid suspension (Office of Financial Aid).  Students who are on financial aid suspension for failure to meet standards of academic progress may write an appeal letter if extenuating circumstances prevented them from meeting grant or scholarship requirements.  Students need to write a letter to the Assistant Director of Financial Aid, which will then be reviewed by the Financial Aid Academic Progress Committee.  This letter must include an explanation of the extenuating circumstances, as well as how the student plans to improve his/her academic status in future semester.  Any supporting documentation the student can provide, such as plan of study as well as letters from professors, advisors, etc., is helpful.  If a student is suspended for having too many credit hours without earning a B.A., a copy of his or her petition to graduate or similar documentation is requested. </P>

<P>To appeal time limit restrictions on Grand View grants and scholarships (Office of Financial Aid).  Full-time students who have exhausted their institutional aid eligibility may write an appeal for an additional semester/year of Grand View grants or scholarships.  This letter should be sent to the Assistant Director of Financial Aid, which will be reviewed by the financial aid committee.  It should explain the reason it is taking the student more than four years to graduate.  It must request that Grand View grants/scholarships be reinstated for the student’s remaining semester/year. </P>

<P>To appeal decisions regarding intercollegiate athletics (Office of the Director of Athletics). Appeals for reexamination of a decision by a Coach must be submitted in writing to the Director of Athletics, which will then be reviewed by a committee consisting of the Director of Athletics, Athletic Success Coordinator, and one other member of the Athletic Department not otherwise included in the appeal. </P>

<P>Registration </P>

<P>New students may register in advance according to information that will be sent after the acceptance process is completed.  In addition, registration is possible on days specified in the University calendar. </P>

<P>Returning students will pre-register for the following semester according to the schedule distributed by the Registrar’s Office each semester. </P>

<P>The times of registration for the Center for Graduate, Adult, and Online Learning and the Summer Session are stated in connection with the announcement of course offerings prior to the opening of each session. </P>

<P>In every instance registration is complete when students have enrolled for a schedule of courses and have completed financial arrangements in the Business Office. </P>

<P>Prerequisites </P>

<P>Many course descriptions provide a list of prerequisites that provide essential background for successful completion of a class.  Prerequisites may include specific courses or may also refer to acceptable class standing, prior academic standing, permission of instructor, departmentally determined competencies or other departmental requirements.  Prerequisites must be completed prior to the beginning of the term in which the course with prerequisites is scheduled.  It is the responsibility of the student to comply with the prerequisites for a course that they plan to take.  Failure to meet the prerequisites can result in cancellation of registration for a course. </P>

<P>Academic Load </P>

<P>Normal load is considered 12-18 semester hours. Full-time students are those enrolled in 12 semester hours of credit or more during any regular term (fall, spring or summer) as well as the two sessions that comprise fall, spring or summer semesters for students enrolled in the Center for Graduate, Adult, and Online Learning accelerated classes. Those enrolled for fewer than 12 hours but at least 6 hours are considered half-time students. Those enrolled in less than 6 hours are less than half-time. Full-time and part-time standing requirements for other organizations (such as VA educational benefits) may vary. </P>

<P>Students may not register for more than 18 semester hours unless special permission is granted by the registrar and the advisor.  An additional fee will be charged for a class load totaling more than 18 semester hours.  Please go to www.grandview.edu for an up-to-date listing of tuition and fees. </P>

<P>Changes in Registration </P>

<P>When necessary, changes in registration may be made.  However, students should plan their academic programs carefully so that subsequent changes are kept to a minimum. </P>

<P>After the first five class days of the fall or spring academic terms, no new courses may be added to students’ schedules without the instructor’s written approval.  </P>

<P>For other academic terms, the add/drop period is the first 7% of the term.  Specific dates are listed on the course schedule for each term. </P>

<P>Withdrawal from Courses or from the University </P>

<P>1. Individual Course Withdrawal </P>

<P>Students may officially withdraw from an individual course during the first 60% of a semester.  If withdrawal occurs after the first five class days of the fall or spring academic terms and before the end of the first 60%, the registrar will place the symbol W on a student’s transcript.  Students who drop individual courses after the first 60% will receive an F (fail) grade for those courses.  For academic courses of irregular length, the withdrawal date shall be 60% of the length of the course.  If withdrawal occurs after the first 7% of the academic term and before the final withdrawal date, the registrar will place the symbol W on a student’s transcript.  An F (fail) grade will be recorded for any irregular length course that a student drops after the withdrawal deadline.  The specific date for this deadline is listed on the Term Calendar for each term, which is distributed by the Registrar’s Office.  If students have been found guilty of academic dishonesty and a penalty of an F (fail) grade is assigned, a W cannot be granted. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>2. Withdrawal from the University </P>

<P>Students may withdraw from the University and receive a W for each course if withdrawal occurs before the end of the first 60% of the semester.  A failing grade will be recorded for all courses if the University withdrawal is made after the first 60% of the term.  Students who withdraw from Grand View will need to apply for readmission if they do not return within one academic year.  Contact the Registrar’s Office for further information. </P>

<P>3. Late Withdrawal </P>

<P>Students who wish to withdraw from one or more of their courses after the first 60% of the term for medical reasons or for rare circumstances must apply to the Late Withdrawal Committee in order to receive grades of W for their course(s).  To apply, students must submit the undergraduate withdrawal form and must provide documentation supporting the reasons for requesting a late withdrawal.  In the case of illness, students must provide a letter from a licensed professional documenting their need to withdraw. No refund will be granted for a withdrawal that occurs after the first 60% of the term.  The Late Withdrawal Committee will consist of the Registrar, Director of Student Success, and the Director of Counseling and Leadership.  Students whose request is denied may appeal to the Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs. </P>

<P>Students who withdraw from Grand View will need to apply for readmission if they do not return within one academic year.  Contact the Registrar’s Office for further information. </P>

<P>4. Excessive Withdrawal </P>

<P>Full time students who withdraw from the University after the first five class days of a semester, are administratively withdrawn, or receive Ws for all courses for two consecutive semesters may be placed on Academic Probation.  </P>

<P>Students who withdraw from all courses after the first five class days or are administratively withdrawn for three consecutive semesters may be placed on Academic Suspension. </P>

<P>5. Active Military Service Withdrawal </P>

<P>If called to active duty a student (or student who is a spouse/dependent child of a member of the military called to active duty, and who needs to withdraw due to the call-up), should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office to complete a Military Leave of Absence form. Verification of military deployment must be submitted with the completed Military Leave of Absence form. </P>

<P>If the student is called to active duty before the mid-point of a term, the student may request to withdraw from some or all courses and the University will fully refund their tuition and mandatory fees for the withdrawn courses. </P>

<P>If the student is called to active duty military service during the term, the student may make arrangements with their instructors to remain enrolled in some or all of their course and will be assigned an I grade (Incomplete) for each course in which they remain enrolled.  In such a case, no adjustment of tuition charges for enrolled courses will occur.  Students have until the end of the next academic term following their release from military service to complete the course.  Failure to do so will result in the I grade becoming an F grade. </P>

<P>A student receiving Veteran’s Benefits should notify the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office in order to complete the required documents.   </P>

<P>A student will have one calendar year after the end of their deployment to re-enroll at Grand View.  Grand View considers the end date of deployment to be the date listed on the original deployment papers, or more recent paperwork (such as a DD-214) that lists a deployment end date.  After one calendar year beyond the deployment end date, the student will need to apply for readmission to Grand View through the Admissions Department. </P>

<P>A student will be re-enrolled in the same academic program (or the most similar one, if same program does not exist), will carry forward the same number of credits, and same academic status.  Grand View University scholarship awards will be preserved for students holding such awards when called to active duty. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>During the first academic year of return, the veteran will be assessed the same tuition and fee charges as were in effect during the academic year he/she left the program (Veterans or other service member education benefits may be taken into account) or up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veteran’s education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other service member education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the current academic year in which the student left for Grand View. </P>

<P>A student who wishes to re-enroll at Grand View after deployment should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office.  The VA Certifying Official will serve as the main point of contact for the student during the re-enrollment process. </P>

<P>6. Non-academic dismissal </P>

<P>Students who are dismissed from Grand View University for non-academic reasons will receive a grade of W in all courses if the dismissal is before the withdrawal deadline.  If the dismissal is after the withdrawal deadline, the earned grade for the course will be determined including zero credit for the incomplete course work after the date of dismissal. </P>

<P>7. Students are reminded that if withdrawal is not official, they will be responsible for tuition charges relating to the course(s) in question. </P>

<P>Transfer to Other Institutions </P>

<P>The fact that Grand View University is an accredited member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and is accredited at the baccalaureate level insures a maximum of convenience in the transfer of credits to other educational institutions. </P>

<P>Students planning to transfer, however, should realize that there is no such thing as automatic transfer.  Each college has its own requirements and standards and is free to apply these restrictions to all applicants.  Moreover, many colleges reserve the right to refuse to accept credits in which the students received a low grade. </P>

<P>For these reasons students who plan to transfer are strongly urged to plan their programs at Grand View University with careful reference to the catalogs of the colleges in which they are interested, or better yet, with a letter or visit to the registrar of such colleges.  In addition, students are urged to maintain as high a grade point average as possible to minimize difficulties associated with low grades. </P>

<P>Educational Records Policy </P>

<P>Notification to Students on Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 </P>

<P>Grand View University, in full compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, shall make educational records available to students upon request.  Likewise, in accordance with the law, individually identifiable educational records will not be released to other than authorized individuals without the written consent of the students.  Students have the right to file complaints with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA) in Washington, D.C., concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the Act. </P>

<P>Student educational records are open to inspection and review by the individual student with certain exceptions which are permitted under the act.  Among those items excepted from this policy are confidential letters written prior to January 1, 1975, records held by counselors and other psychological records held on a student, private records in the sole possession of the maker, or financial records of the parents.  Students’ records are open to other school officials, including teachers within the educational institution or local educational agency who have been determined to have legitimate educational interest, and those others specified in the act. </P>

<P>As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which student education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records — including Social Security Number, grades, or other private information — may be accessed without student consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the </P>

<P>U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (&quot;Federal and State Authorities&quot;) may allow access to student records and PII without student consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is &quot;principally engaged in the provision of education,&quot; such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to student education records and PII without student consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive your PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without student consent PII from your education records, and they may track student participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about students that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Students have the right to challenge the contents of their education records, to have a hearing if the outcome of the challenge is unsatisfactory, and to submit explanatory statements for inclusion in their files if they feel the decision of hearing officers is unacceptable. </P>

<P>Grand View University considers the following categories to be directory information, and, as such, may release it to any or all inquiries in such forms as news releases, directories, or computer address lists: the student’s name, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, advisor, major field of study, dates of attendance, enrollment status, degrees and awards received, honors received (including Dean’s and President’s Lists), most recent previous educational agency or institution attended, photographic view or electronic images, class level, anticipated date of completion, participation in official recognized activities and sports, and for members of athletic teams, weight and height. </P>

<P>written request to the Registrar’s Office.  If a student requests that directory information not be released, it will prohibit Grand View University from providing any of the above information except the student’s name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program.  If students do not want student’s name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program released, they should contact the registrar. </P>

<P>Academic Advising </P>

<P>At Grand View University, academic advising is a collaborative educational process that facilitates students’ understanding of the meaning and purpose of a liberal arts education and fosters their holistic development that leads to academic success and lifelong learning.  The responsibilities for student and advisor, listed below, are essential for an effective student/advisor relationship. Ultimately, each student is responsible for determining and shaping his/her own education and for ensuring timely progress toward graduation. </P>

<P>Grading and Academic Progress </P>

<P>Permanent Grades </P>

<P>There are five permanent grades that indicate the quality of students’ work in a course.  Four of these indicate successful completion of the course: A (highest), B, C, and D (lowest).  The fifth, F, indicates failure to complete the course successfully. </P>

<P>Several other symbols may appear on students’ transcripts.  The symbol P indicates that students have passed a course taken under the pass/fail option.  The symbol W is entered on the transcript when students withdraw.  The symbol Z denotes that the course has been audited. </P>

<P>Incomplete Work </P>

<P>Students who have made satisfactory progress in a course (achieved passing grades) but are unable to complete course requirements due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control may ask their instructor for an “Incomplete.”  Students must discuss this option with their instructor, document the circumstances preventing them from completing the course to the instructor’s satisfaction, and receive the instructor’s approval before the University will recognize such requests.  The faculty member, in consultation with the student, will decide the amount of time allowed to complete the course requirements.  Students receiving an Incomplete during the Spring Semester or during one of the summer terms must finish all specified course work before the end of the following Fall Semester.  Students receiving an incomplete during the Fall Semester must complete all specified course work before the end of the following Spring Semester.  This completion period may be extended if special circumstances exist.  Requests to extend the completion period beyond one additional semester must be made by the instructor and approved by the college dean.  The temporary symbol I is noted on a student’s transcript when an incomplete is granted.  This symbol is removed from the student’s transcript and replaced with the appropriate grade for the course if the requirements are completed within the designated time period.  If the requirements are not completed during the designated time period, the I symbol is automatically replaced with a grade of F. </P>

<P>Students requesting an incomplete must fill out an incomplete request form in consultation with their instructor.  When completed the faculty member must submit it to the Registrar’s Office no later than the day grades are due for the semester in which the course is taken.  The registrar must sign this form to acknowledge its receipt.  Students and faculty are encouraged to keep copies of this form as well as copies of all the work required to complete the course until they receive written verification of their final course grade. </P>

<P>Grading Policies, Credits, Grade Points, and Grade Point Average </P>

<P>Academic credit is expressed in semester hours. Grade points are assigned to the students’ grades and used to determine the academic standing of the students. </P>

<P> Each credit hour of A = 4 grade points  Each credit hour of B = 3 grade points  Each credit hour of C = 2 grade points  Each credit hour of D = 1 grade point  Each credit hour of F = 0 grade points </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>The symbols I (incomplete), W (withdraw), Z (audited), and P (pass) do not carry grade point values. </P>

<P>The grade point average is the total of all grade points divided by the total of all credit hours attempted, with the exception of credit hours passed with a grade of P. </P>

<P>Grade point averages are recorded on official transcripts to the nearest 0.01 of a point.  All decisions affecting students’ academic progress that make use of a grade point criterion (e.g. academic probation, academic suspension, and graduation) are made with reference to the nearest </P>

<P>0.01 of a point of the students’ GPA. </P>

<P>Good Academic Standing </P>

<P>Students must achieve the following minimum cumulative grade point averages to remain in Good Academic Standing: </P>

<P>Students entering as first semester freshmen are considered to be in Good Academic Standing if they have met regular admission standards. </P>

<P>Grade Change </P>

<P>After an instructor reports a grade at the end of a semester or term, it may be changed only under one of the following circumstances: </P>

<P>1. An error has been made in computing or reporting the grade.  If an error has been made, the student should contact the course instructor immediately.  The instructor completes and signs a change of grade form and sends it to the registrar.  Upon receipt of the completed form, the registrar will change the student’s </P>

<P>permanent record. </P>

<P>2. An unusual set of circumstances necessitates such an action.  In these situations, the instructor must provide a written justification with appropriate documentation and receive the approval of the college dean.  Upon receipt of the completed grade change form, the registrar will change the student’s permanent record. </P>

<P>It is the student’s responsibility to initiate the procedure for a grade change.  Grade change forms are available at the Registrar’s Office.  Students should verify grade changes by going to myView, or by requesting a copy of their official University transcript. </P>

<P>Pass/Fail Option </P>

<P>The pass/fail option stipulates that no grade will be given other than P (passing) or F (failing).  Credit will be awarded only for work equivalent to a C grade of better; work equivalent to a D or F grade will receive an F grade. </P>

<P>The pass/fail option is not open to freshmen.  Only one course per semester may be so taken. The option must be designated by the student through the Registrar’s Office, and cannot be changed after the first 60% of the academic term.  A maximum of nine semester hours of pass/fail work, excluding PACT credit, CLEP examination, test-out examination, Cooperative Education, Internships, Experiential Learning, vo-tech credit may be applied toward graduation.  Passed hours will not be counted toward eligibility for the Dean’s List.  Failed hours will be computed in the GPA. </P>

<P>The pass/fail option does not apply to requirements taken at Grand View for a major or minor in a baccalaureate degree, except for internships.  Internships that are required for a major or a minor may be taken pass/fail or for a grade at the discretion of the instructor. </P>

<P>Mid-term Low Grade Notification </P>

<P>Grand View University provides mid-term low grade notification for semester long classes to alert students to poor academic performance in time for them to take corrective measures.  Instructors are encouraged to identify students who are performing at the D and F levels.  These deficiencies are reported to the students so they can seek special help from instructors and academic advisors. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Final Grade Reports </P>

<P>Following the end of each term, final grade reports are available on the University computer system.  Students who need an official copy may request it online or in the Registrar’s Office. </P>

<P>Repeating Failed Courses </P>

<P>Students may repeat any credit course in which a failing grade (F) was received.  A student is strongly advised to repeat a failed course as soon as possible.  Students will find that this is the most effective way of raising their cumulative grade point average.  The grade earned for the most recent enrollment will be used in calculating the cumulative GPA.  While all previously earned grades remain on the academic record, they are not counted in GPA calculations.  All course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript with an indication that the course was retaken.  If the new course is taken at another institution, it is the student’s responsibility to request that the registrar remove the earlier grade in calculating the cumulative GPA. </P>

<P>In regards to financial aid, a failed course may be repeated as many times as needed until passed. However, students should refer to the departmental rules listed with the major requirements, as some departments limit the number of times a course may be repeated. </P>

<P>Repeating Passed Courses </P>

<P>If students decide that their mastery of a previously passed course will be improved by retaking the course, they may do so subject to the following conditions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>The grade received for each course retaken will appear on the transcript, and the new grade will be used for computing the cumulative grade point average.  However, all course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript, along with a notation that a course was retaken. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>No additional credit toward graduation may be received for retaking a previously passed course. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Fees must be paid for all courses retaken. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must properly register to retake a course during registration or pre-registration. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>If the earlier course or the retaken course is at another institution, it is the student’s </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>responsibility to request that the registrar </P>

<P>replace the earlier grade with the new grade. </P>

<P>6. Students should refer to the departmental rules listed with the major requirements, as some departments limit the number of times a course may be repeated. </P>

<P>In regards to financial aid, a previously passed course may only be repeated once.  This includes even those courses where a higher grade is required for the major (e.g., minimum of C for nursing major courses, etc.).  This does not include courses designated as repeatable (e.g. ensembles, music lessons, communication labs, etc.) as these are not restricted nor limited (unless designated otherwise) and, therefore, a student may repeat these courses as often as needed. </P>

<P>Previously passed courses are those for which any of the following grades have been received: A, B, C, D or P. </P>

<P>Repeatable Courses </P>

<P>Courses may be repeated for credit if the catalog course description specifies that the course is repeatable.  Each instance of a repeatable course will count in the student’s cumulative GPA. </P>

<P>Variable Credit Courses </P>

<P>Courses with a variable credit designation may be taken for a different number of credit hours.  Students should consult the course instructor or the department offering the course to determine the number of semester hours for which they may register.  A variable credit course cannot be taken again unless it is clearly designated as repeatable. </P>

<P>Audited Courses </P>

<P>Students who desire to enroll in courses but not receive grades for their participation have the opportunity to audit.  Audited courses are denoted on student transcripts with the symbol Z.  Audited courses are not included in the computation of grade point averages and do not satisfy requirements for a major, minor, the general education core, or any other graduation requirement.  Audited courses do not count toward a student’s academic course load.  Students pay a fee specified in the Financial Information section of the University catalog for each course audited.  This option must be chosen when registering for the course and may not be changed during the term in which the course is audited.  Students may take the audited course for credit during a later academic term. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Veterans Satisfactory Progress </P>

<P>Students receiving veteran’s benefits who do not earn a 2.0 grade point average on all hours for which a grade is given during the probationary semester will be subject to termination of benefits at the end of that semester. </P>

<P>Student Eligibility </P>

<P>Athletes must meet the eligibility requirements of the NAIA and standards of satisfactory progress as outlined above for all students at Grand View. </P>

<P>Officers of the Viking Council must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.5 and must be doing satisfactory work in all courses at the time of appointment. </P>

<P>The editors and business managers of the Grand Views must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 and must be doing satisfactory work in all courses at the time of appointment. </P>

<P>In addition, the editors of the Grand Views must have earned at least a B in Freshman English. </P>

<P>Unless otherwise indicated, current eligibility is determined at the beginning of each semester and remains valid throughout the semester. </P>

<P>The eligibility of potential representatives of the University, as specified above, will be checked with the provost and vice president for academic affairs prior to announcement of the appointment. </P>

<P>The standards mentioned under this section are minimum, all-University requirements.  Directors of individual programs may set higher standards with the approval of the provost and vice president for academic affairs. </P>

<P>Class Attendance </P>

<P>Regular attendance at classes is expected of all students.  There is no system of allowed absences or class cuts.  Special attendance regulations are the responsibility of the faculty member, who will announce the policy to the students at the beginning of each course. </P>

<P>Students incurring absences due to participation in off-campus experiences and trips approved by the provost and vice president for academic affairs have the responsibility of clearing such absences with faculty whose classes they will miss and arranging for any make-up work prior to being absent.  Because approved trips are considered to be supportive of the total University program, faculty are strongly encouraged to allow students to make up work that has been missed.  Final permission to make up work because of absence for ANY reason rests with the individual faculty member. </P>

<P>Even though the attendance policy is up to the discretion of each faculty member, non-attendance is monitored in the classroom as required by federal regulation (34 CFR 668.22).   </P>

<P>Students are responsible for submitting the Change in Registration form to drop any class they are not attending. </P>

<P>Once a student has attended one class meeting for a semester, the student has committed to maintaining his/her entire registration for the semester, including the charges associated with those decisions.  It is the personal responsibility of the student to know the University’s registration policies, to follow those policies when adjusting registration, and to verify through their record in myView that requested schedule changes have been made.  Registrants who do not attend a single class during the first week of the semester will be administratively dropped from all of their classes for the semester; however, it is the personal responsibility of the student to complete the appropriate admission deferment or withdrawal process. </P>

<P>Academic Recognition </P>

<P>Dean’s and President’s Lists </P>

<P>Following the end of fall and spring semesters, the provost and vice president for academic affairs publishes a list of those students who have successfully completed a minimum of 12 graded semester hours of credit, have earned no grade lower than a C during the semester, and have achieved an overall semester grade point average of 3.50. </P>

<P>The president of the University publishes a list of those students who have successfully completed a minimum of 12 graded hours and have achieved an overall semester grade point average of 4.00. </P>

<P>Any course in which a grade of P is earned cannot be counted toward the 12 hour minimum.  In addition, the following courses cannot be counted toward the 12 hour minimum: MATH 094, 095, 096.  No student with a grade of Incomplete will appear on the Dean’s List or President’s List during the semester in which the Incomplete is given. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Appearance of the students’ names on the Dean’s List or President’s List indicates that the students’ achievements meet the high academic standards of the University at the time records are reviewed for these lists. </P>

<P>University Honor Society </P>

<P>Full-time Grand View students who have been named to the Dean’s List and/or the President’s List for at least four semesters are eligible for membership in the Grand View University Honor Society.  Part-time students who have accumulated 60 semester credit hours and maintained a 3.50 GPA and transfer students who have accumulated 60 semester credit hours, maintained a 3.50 GPA, and have completed 12 graded semester credits at Grand View may petition the provost and vice president for academic affairs for membership in the Grand View University Honor Society. </P>

<P>Graduation Honors </P>

<P>Graduating students who have attained academic excellence on the basis of their cumulative grade point average are recognized at Commencement and on their diploma.  Students must earn at least 45 graded semester hours at Grand View University and be earning their first bachelor’s degree to be eligible for Latin honors.  The honors include: </P>

<P> Cum Laude – GPA 3.50 – 3.69  Magna Cum Laude – GPA 3.70 – 3.89  Summa Cum Laude – GPA 3.90 – 4.00 </P>

<P>GPAs are computed to the nearest .01 and are not rounded up. </P>

<P>Penalties for Grade Point Deficiencies </P>

<P>Academic Probation </P>

<P>Students, both full-time and part-time, will be placed on Academic Probation if they fail to attain the minimum cumulative grade point averages necessary to be in Good Academic Standing, or they meet the conditions for Academic Probation as stated in the University’s excessive withdrawal policy.  Students will be notified by the University in writing of their probationary status. </P>

<P>Students on Academic Probation will be limited to a course load of 12 semester hours.  It is the students’ responsibility to contact their advisors so that their course loads can be adjusted to the 12 hour limit.  Students on Academic Probation may lose financial aid and intercollegiate athletic eligibility. </P>

<P>If students do not earn a 2.00 grade point average for all hours attempted during a probationary semester, their continued enrollment at Grand View University will be subject to review by the Academic Advising and Progression Committee.  This review could lead to either Academic Suspension or admission to an additional probationary semester. </P>

<P>If students do earn a 2.00 grade point average for all hours attempted during a probationary semester, but do not sufficiently improve their cumulative grade point average to be considered in Good Academic Standing, they will be allowed to enroll for another probationary semester. </P>

<P>Students may be removed from Academic Probation once they attain a sufficient cumulative grade point average to be considered in Good Academic Standing by the Academic Advising and Progression Committee. </P>

<P>Students placed on Academic Probation may appeal the decision before the Academic Advising and Progression Committee.  The appeal process must conclude prior to the end of the first week of the semester or summer term following notification of probationary status.  Appeals must be submitted in writing to the chairperson of that committee.  A form is available in the office of the provost and vice president for academic affairs or online. </P>

<P>Academic Suspension </P>

<P>The Academic Advising and Progression Committee places students on Academic Suspension when one of the following occurs: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students with fewer than 90 credit hours fail to earn a 2.00 GPA during a probationary semester and fail to merit consideration for continued probation from the Academic Advising and Progression Committee. </LBody>

<P>Students placed on Academic Suspension may appeal the decision before the Academic Advising and Progression Committee.  The appeal process must conclude prior to the end of the first week of the semester or summer term following notification of suspension.  Appeals must be submitted in writing to the chairperson of that committee. </P>

<P>Academic Responsibility/Academic Honesty Policy </P>

<P>In accordance with the mission statement, Grand View University is dedicated to the development of the whole person and committed to truth, excellence, and ethical values. The University strives to promote an appreciation of the dignity and worth of each individual and open interaction among student, faculty and staff. Personal integrity and academic honesty are essential to building a campus of trust. Thus, honesty in all aspects of the college experience is the responsibility of each student, faculty, and staff member. </P>

<P>This expectation is reflected in the Grand View University Code of Integrity which states: As a member of the Grand View University community, and in accordance with the mission of the University and its Lutheran identity, I agree to appreciate and respect the dignity and worth of each individual. I will honor and promote a community of open interaction, personal integrity, active and intellectual engagement, and academic honesty with students, faculty and staff. </P>

<P>All requirements for readmission must be completed before the first day of the academic term in which the student wishes to enroll.  Students who successfully petition the Academic Advising and Progression Committee for readmission after this deadline will not be allowed to enroll at Grand View University until the following semester or academic session. </P>

<P>Students who satisfy the reinstatement requirements are admitted with probationary status.  They may enroll for a maximum of 12 hours of courses during each probationary semester.  In addition, students must earn a minimum of a 2.00 </P>

<P>Academic Dishonesty Defined </P>

<P>Academic dishonesty is any deliberate misrepresentation by a student of the following: </P>

<P> academic record or status; </P>

<P> ability to perform in any course with regard to writing papers; taking examinations, and/or doing assignments; and </P>

<P> personal efforts and work accomplished toward the fulfillment of course requirements; and </P>

<P> the honest work of a fellow student.  That is, any dishonest action performed or statement </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>made with the intention of impeding or discrediting said honest work. </P>

<P>Typical Violations   </P>

<P>The following list describes various ways in which the principles of academic honesty/integrity can be violated. Neither the types of violations nor the list of examples are exhaustive. </P>

<P>Plagiarism: The use of another’s ideas, words, or results and presenting them as one’s own. To avoid plagiarism, students are expected to use proper methods of documentation and acknowledgement according to the accepted format for the particular discipline or as required by the faculty in a course. Some common examples are: </P>

<P> Copying word for word from an oral, printed, or electronic source without proper acknowledgement or citation. </P>

<P> Paraphrasing, or presenting in one’s own words another person’s written words or ideas as if they were one’s own, without proper acknowledgement or citation. </P>

<P> Submitting a downloaded or purchased paper or other materials to satisfy a course requirement. </P>

<P> Incorporating into one’s own work, graphs, drawings, photographs, diagrams, tables, spreadsheets, computer programs, or other non-text material from other sources without proper citation. </P>

<P>Cheating: The use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, notes, study aids, or other devices in any academic exercise. Cheating also includes submitting papers, research results and analyses, etc. as one’s own work when they were, in fact, prepared by others. Some common examples are: </P>

<P> Receiving research, programming, data collection, or analytical assistance from others or working with another student on an assignment where such help is not permitted. </P>

<P> Copying another student’s work or answers on a quiz or examination. </P>

<P> Collaborating with another student(s) when completing any assignment or examination, unless the faculty explicitly states otherwise. </P>

<P> Using or possessing books, notes, calculators, cell phones, or other prohibited devices or materials during a quiz or examination. </P>

<P> Submitting the same work or major portions of a work to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the faculty involved. </P>

<P> Preprogramming a calculator or other electronic device to contain answers, formulas, or other unauthorized information for use during a quiz or examination. </P>

<P> Acquiring a copy of an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination.  Having a substitute take an examination for one.  Having someone else prepare a term paper or other assignment. </P>

<P>Fabrication and Falsification: The invention or falsification of sources, citations, data, or results, and recording or reporting them in any academic exercise. Some examples are: </P>

<P> Altering the record of data or experimental procedures or results.  False citation of the source of information or citing a source that does not exist. </P>

<P> Altering the record of or reporting false information about internship or practicum experiences. </P>

<P>Facilitation of Dishonesty: Facilitation of dishonesty is knowingly or negligently allowing one’s work to be used by another student without prior approval of the instructor or otherwise aiding another in committing violations of academic integrity. A student who facilitates a violation of academic honesty/integrity can be considered as responsible as the student who receives the impermissible assistance, even if the facilitator does not benefit personally from the violations. Some examples are: </P>

<P> Knowingly allowing another student to copy answers on a quiz or examination or assisting others to do so. </P>

<P> Distributing an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination.  Distributing or selling a paper to another student.  Taking an examination for another student. </P>

<P>Academic Interference: Academic interference is deliberately impeding the academic progress of another student. Some examples are: </P>

<P> Intentionally destroying or obstructing another student’s work. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P> Altering computer files that contain data, </P>

<P>reports, or assignments belonging to another </P>

<P>student. </P>

<P> Removing posted or reserve material or </P>

<P>otherwise preventing another student’s access </P>

<P>to it. </P>

<P>Procedure for dealing with an incident of academic dishonesty </P>

<P>Any instance of academic dishonesty requires action involving both the student and the faculty member directly involved and the submission of an Academic Dishonesty Report to the Office of the Academic Deans.  If the instructor is unsure how to proceed, she/he may consult with the Standards and Progression Subcommittee of the Student Success Leadership Committee at any point in the process. </P>

<P>The faculty member must also provide the student with a copy of the Academic Dishonesty Report. The report form should identify the following series of consequences. </P>

<P>If it is the student’s first incident of academic dishonesty, the instructor can impose a range of sanctions from the following, depending on the nature and degree of seriousness of the incident: </P>

<P> A warning with opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the assignment with no opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the course. </P>

<P>The student will receive a letter from the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs about the incident, the University’s expectations regarding academic honesty/integrity, and future possible consequences should the student commit another act of academic dishonesty during their enrollment at Grand View. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student’s academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar. </P>

<P>Following a second incident of academic dishonesty, the student minimally will fail the course and be placed on academic dishonesty probation. Upon receiving notification from the instructor of a violation, and determining that it is a second violation, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs must notify the student about the incident. This letter will inform the student of her/his failing grade and placement on probation. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student’s academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar.  </P>

<P>When a student is reported for a third incident of academic dishonesty, the student will be suspended from the University and the suspension for academic dishonesty will be noted on the student’s transcript. Upon receiving notification from the instructor of a violation, and determining that it is a third violation, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs must notify the student about the incident. This letter will inform the student of her/his suspension. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student’s academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar. Should the student appeal the decision, he/she will be allowed to complete the term during which the appeal is heard; if upheld, the suspension will occur during the regular term following the appeal. </P>

<P>Students suspended for Academic Dishonesty must follow the same procedures for readmission as those listed for students who have been academically suspended, with the exception that they will not be required to enroll elsewhere during their suspension. </P>

<P>When a student has returned to Grand View after being suspended for a third violation and is subsequently reported for a fourth incident of academic dishonesty, the student will fail the course and be suspended immediately from the University, and the suspension for academic dishonesty will be noted on the student’s transcript. The suspension will remain in force during the appeal process; if the suspension is upheld, the student will be expelled from the University. </P>

<P>Procedure for Initiating an Appeal </P>

<P>A student who wishes to appeal a decision regarding academic dishonesty must initiate that process within 14 calendar days of the postmark of the letter from the Provost regarding the incident. The first section of the Academic Appeal Form, which identifies the reason for the appeal must be completed and hand delivered to the Executive Administrative Assistant of the Provost in the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. This form and the complete appeal process can be located on myView &gt; Academics &gt; Registrar’s Office &gt; Forms &gt; Academic Dishonesty Appeal Form. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Dismissal from the Nursing and Education Programs </P>

<P>Students who are dismissed from the Nursing or Education programs will be removed from their Nursing or Education courses immediately upon notification of the registrar.  If this action takes place during the time period in the semester or term when students may withdraw from individual courses, they will receive a W for all Nursing or Education courses in which they are enrolled, unless they have been found guilty of academic dishonesty or other grievous offenses and a penalty of an F grade for a course or series of courses has been sanctioned.  If students are dismissed after this time period, they will receive a W for the Nursing or Education courses in which they are earning a grade of D or better and an F for courses in which they are not making satisfactory progress or in which they have been found guilty of academic dishonesty or other grievous offense and such a penalty has been assessed. </P>

<P>Learning Support </P>

<P>At Grand View University, it is believed that all students benefit from learning support that extends beyond the classroom. Such support deepens and enriches students’ understanding of the classes in which they are enrolled. This support is primarily provided in the Academic Learning and Teaching (ALT) Center and is described below. </P>

<P>Mathematics Lab </P>

<P>The Math Lab is designed to accommodate the diversity of mathematics learning styles and backgrounds of Grand View students by supplementing the traditional classroom learning environment with individual tutoring.  This tutoring is available on a drop-in basis. Math tutors help students make the transition to college mathematics as well as supporting students in advancing levels of math and statistics courses and courses with a quantitative reasoning component.  Students may seek assistance on their own or be referred by faculty members or advisors. </P>

<P>Writing Center </P>

<P>The Writing Center is a place to get one-on-one feedback on any type of writing, including research essays and personal statements, at any stage of the writing process (brainstorming, outlining, developing, editing, etc.). A Writing Center session is, at its core, a conversation between the tutor and writer to determine how best to represent one’s ideas. The Writing Center is a place all writers benefit from, from any major and at any stage in their college career. For example, first year students might bring an assignment from English 100 to brainstorm ideas, whereas senior nursing majors might bring in a research project to discuss organizational strategies and citation format. The Writing Center also supports multilingual students for whom English is not their primary language; tutors can assist multilingual students in understanding the conventions of American essay writing (such as structure, citing, and so on) as well as practice conversation with multilingual students. The Writing Center encourages students to make appointments ahead of time, but walk-ins are also welcome. </P>

<P>Disability Services </P>

<P>Recognizing and supporting diversity, Grand View University provides services for students with disabilities through the Director of Disability Services. The Director facilitates access to programs, services, and activities that are provided at Grand View while encouraging and empowering students with disabilities to develop self-advocacy. Students with documented disabilities can arrange accommodations through the Director of Disability Services.  </P>

<P>Tutoring </P>

<P>The ALT Center utilizes peer tutors to provide learning support to students in selected courses. These tutoring services are FREE and available to all Grand View students on a drop-in basis when tutors are available. Coordinated by the Senior Director of Advising and Learning Support, tutors are recruited and selected based on their demonstrated knowledge of a subject area and faculty recommendations. Tutors are then trained to provide learning support to students. </P>

<P>Other support is available through the ALT Center in areas such as time management, study skills, and test-taking strategies.  Assistance with navigating the learning management system (Blackboard) can also be arranged. </P>

<P>Graduation Requirements </P>

<P>Students must complete the graduation requirements listed in the Grand View catalog in effect at the time of initial registration.  They may, however, opt to follow requirements in the current catalog either for their major or core requirements.  The core and major requirements are considered separately.  These requirements are in effect unless the students have been out of Grand View for over six years.  Then the requirements for graduation become those in effect at the time of reentry into the program. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Applying for Graduation </P>

<P>Students must submit a graduation application to the Registrar’s Office no later than one year before their intended graduation date.  This is not an automatic process; one must apply for graduation. </P>

<P>Students who plan to complete their requirements for graduation by August may petition the registrar, in writing, to participate in the commencement ceremony.  This petition must include a plan to earn the remaining credit hours throughout the summer terms which follow the April commencement ceremony. </P>

<P>Any changes made to a graduation application, including the intended graduation date, must be submitted in writing to the Registrar’s Office in order for the changes to be reviewed by the University.  The University may use student registration and the electronic Completion Plan as justification for adjustment, as well.

<H2>General Education Core </H2>

<Sect>
<P>The General Education Core at Grand View University serves to help develop the whole person, as students are challenged to see new perspectives; make connections between their values, life and work; and develop in mind, body, and spirit.  It is an intellectual encounter which affirms faith and the quest for meaning in life, understanding human society and behavior, expression of creativity through the arts, and the study of the natural world.  The core is designed to ignite curiosity, present values and ideas that shape the world, provide necessary skills, and prepare students for responsible citizenship and a lifetime of learning.  Throughout the core experience, students are challenged with tasks which exercise their skills in information literacy, critical inquiry, and communication (written, oral and quantitative), as well as ask them to encounter and reflect on human diversity and their own sense of purpose and service to others. </P>

<P>Core Foundations </P>

<P>Core Seminars </P>

<P>Students are required to take all three Core Seminars, which may not be transferred in.  First Year Seminar is required for all full time freshmen as well as transfer students with less than 20 credits.  </P>

<P>The Academic Major </P>

<P>The Academic Major is the primary area of specialized study selected by a candidate for a baccalaureate degree.  An academic major may be disciplinary, interdisciplinary, or individualized in nature.  Here at Grand View, a student is ordinarily required to complete between 35 and 45 semester hours of course work in a specific area/field of study in order to satisfy requirements for the academic major.  A few programs, especially those that are approved by external accrediting or licensing agencies/boards may require students to accumulate more than 45 semester hours in order to satisfy all of the requirements for an academic major.  Some majors may require the completion of a limited number of prerequisite courses for admission to the program or eligibility to enroll in selected courses in the major. </P>

<P>Each student seeking a baccalaureate degree must complete the requirements for at least one academic major.  Some students also may wish to earn a second academic major.  Students who already hold a baccalaureate degree from another college may earn a second baccalaureate degree by completing the requirements for the major at Grand View University, as well as any other requirements for the Grand View University bachelor’s degree. </P>

<P>Each academic major that is offered by the University consists of: </P>

<P> A series of “middle-range” courses or educational experiences that convey topical knowledge, issues and methods; provide opportunities to explore issues; offer activities to begin the process of gaining critical perspectives and making connections; help students to see and experience interactions with other disciplines and parts of the curriculum; and create and enhance a sense of intellectual community. </P>

<P> At least one integrating or capstone course which fosters a broad reflective and critical view of the academic major and its relationship to other disciplines and which explores ways that graduates in this field might put their knowledge to post-baccalaureate use. </P>

<P> One course, learning activity, or examination which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department a knowledge of technical advances appropriate to their field of study. </P>

<P>Biology </P>

<P>Degree Earned: Bachelor of Arts </P>

<P>The major in Biology is designed to prepare students for careers and post-baccalaureate study requiring specialization in biology.  While many Biology majors continue their education in graduate school and in professional programs such as medicine, dentistry, physician assistant and physical therapy, others find excellent vocational opportunities in private and governmental laboratories, in health-related sales, and in education. </P>

<P>To properly prepare our students for such vocational diversity, the major requires foundational courses in biology, allows students sufficient opportunity to choose electives in biology, and requires and recommends support courses in other scientific disciplines.  In order to tailor a program of study that meets an individual student’s specific needs and interests, the student is expected to work closely with a faculty advisor.  Transfer credit for Biology courses must be taken within the last 10 years. </P>

<P>Communication </P>

<P>Communication Department Rules </P>

<P>Communication majors need a high level of language proficiency, both verbal and written.  There is also a need to ensure that all students graduating from Grand View in this department have uniformly attained a certain level of competency in the major.  Courses from other colleges may not always contain material equivalent to our courses.  Therefore, transfer and cross-enrolled credits must be examined carefully. </P>

<P>To be certain all students in the major are ready to take departmental courses and to ensure all classes taken at other colleges meet our requirements, certain policies have been developed by the Grand View Communication Department: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must be in or have passed English 101 before taking any courses in the major.  If an English 101 equivalent is taken elsewhere, a competency test may be required of the students with a transfer grade of “C” or lower before they are allowed to take major courses at Grand View. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>A course in the major taken at certain other institutions where courses are not equivalent may not be accepted until the students have passed a competency test of the Grand View courses. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>All Communication majors must pass with at least a “C” 110 and 151 before taking any 300400 level courses.  Digital Media Production and Mass Communication majors need to pass with at least a “C” 121 and 222 before taking any 300-400 level classes; Journalism majors need to pass 131 with a “C” before taking any 300-400 level classes.  These restrictions can only be waived by a majority vote of the Communication Department faculty. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Reporting should be taken by the students’ third semester, preferably in the freshman year. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must earn a “C” or higher in all classes in their major checklist.  In some cases the students have the option of choosing one of two classes on the major checklist.  Once that choice has been made, there is no longer an option.  The students must receive a “C” or higher in that specific class or retake it. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>After the first failed attempt to pass a major course with at least the required “C,” the student should immediately retake that course the next term it is available.  When taking it a second time, the student is required to complete the entire semester.  If the student withdraws from the course with a W grade during the second attempt, it will count as the second failed attempt to pass the course unless overturned by departmental review. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>After completing any one of the following: 110, 131, 151, 121 and 222, students’ records may be reviewed by departmental faculty.  Following that review, some students may be required to meet the departmental faculty for a review of their status in the major.  After such a review, students may be counseled into another major if the evidence warrants.  This generally will occur after the sophomore year, or if transfer students, upon the completion of the courses listed.  100-level classes are taken during the freshman year, 200-level classes are taken during the sophomore year, 300-level classes are taken during the junior year, and 400-level classes are taken during the senior year. </LBody>

<P>After satisfying the pre-education requirements, students make formal application for admission to the education program of the University.  Admission is based on the following criteria: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Overall minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 and minimum 3.0 GPA in the pre-education program with a) grades of B or higher in ENGL 101, SPCH 103 or 126, EDUC 111, 145, 243 or 244, 280, plus for the 12 hours of initial endorsement coursework required for secondary education majors only; and b) a minimum grade of C in all other pre-education courses.  No D grades are accepted for preeducation, major, or endorsement coursework.  Students who need to raise their grade in the pre-education courses are limited to one repeat attempt per course. </LBody>

<LBody>Successful personal interview at the discretion of the Teacher Education Admissions Committee. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Three prescribed letters of recommendation. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>All students must pass an entry exam and meet the requirements as specified by the Teacher Education Program Admissions Committee. These requirements are kept current on the “Teacher Education Community” Blackboard site. Currently, the test is the Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators test, which includes mathematics, reading, and writing. Students may take the required tests any time before applying to the program. Not passing the required test makes the student ineligible for admission and prevents the student from enrolling in methods and practicum courses. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students formally admitted to the baccalaureate program in education are required to successfully complete the curriculum maintaining at least a 2.5 cumulative grade point average and a minimum 3.0 GPA in the major and each endorsement. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Upon successful completion of a minimum of 124 credits, all other Grand View graduation requirements, and all State of Iowa teacher licensure requirements, students are recommended to the State of Iowa Board of Educational Examiners for licensure in Elementary or Secondary Education or both (Art K-12, Music K12, or Physical Education K-12). </P>

<P>Student Teaching </P>

<P>A student teaching experience during the senior year is required for all Elementary, Secondary, Art, Music, and Physical Education majors.  The time required is one full semester (16 weeks) of full-time teaching during the day-time hours when schools are in session. </P>

<P>Formal application for student teaching is made by each student to the Education Department ONE YEAR PRIOR to student teaching.  The application and supporting materials (which include a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in major and each endorsement, practica evaluations, faculty evaluations, departmental recommendations, and an interview at the discretion of the department), are evaluated before the student is accepted for student teaching. </P>

<P>Elementary, Secondary, Art, Music, and Physical Education majors are assigned to student teaching placements appropriate to licensure and endorsement requirements. </P>

<P>Student teachers follow out-of-school, holiday, and conference schedules of their assigned schools and keep the same hours as their cooperating teachers. </P>

<P>Praxis II Requirement </P>

<P>As of January 1, 2013, the Iowa Board of Education requires that ALL education majors (Elementary, Secondary, and K-12 majors) achieve passing scores at the 26th percentile on two designated Praxis II tests – one on learning-teaching pedagogy and one on content of the specific major. Each student must successfully pass the required tests for their major before a recommendation for a teaching license can be made to the State of Iowa Board of Educational Examiners. A student may be awarded a degree from Grand View upon completion of all graduation requirements, but a recommendation for teacher licensure cannot be made until verification of passing scores for each required Praxis II test has been received. An education graduate may not assume the duties of a teacher or substitute until a teaching license has been issued by the State of Iowa Board of Educational Examiners. </P>

<P>Transfer Students </P>

<P>For those students transferring to Grand View University from other accredited institutions, every effort is made to allow credit for equivalent course work at the other institution(s) toward the preeducation and education requirements.  Transfer students normally spend at least one semester at Grand View University before they are eligible for formal admission to the education program.  During that semester, they may be required to enroll in Education 111 to establish a basis for judging their potential as a teacher.  Other requirements may also be specified.  Each student is evaluated on an individual basis.  Transfer credit is evaluated by the university transcript analyst in conjunction with the chair of the Education Department.  Original credits more than 10 years old are not accepted. </P>

<P>Post-Baccalaureate Students Seeking Licensure </P>

<P>Students already possessing a baccalaureate degree are welcomed into the Education program.  The baccalaureate degree normally satisfies university general education core requirements.  It will be necessary, however, to take refresher work in specific courses in Education and Education support courses, if the original credits are more than 10 years old, or if no previous Education course work was taken.  Normally this is assessed through the transfer evaluation process. </P>

<P>Appeal Policy </P>

<P>To appeal decisions regarding admission, progression, or graduation in the education program the student must submit a written letter and schedule a meeting with the Education Department Chair within 14 calendar days after the incident. Students who wish to continue the grievance further make speak with the Dean of Humanities and Education. </P>

Students gain practical skills, work experience and knowledge from internships in community, mental health and other agency settings. Des Moines and the Polk County area have many agency settings to choose from. </P>

<P>Students prepare to work in direct care service areas, assisting and serving diverse populations and ages. Students also prepare to meet the needs of individuals, families, and/or communities to help them function as effectively as possible in a variety of settings: group homes and halfway houses; correctional, intellectual disability, and community mental health centers; family, child, and youth service agencies; and programs concerned with alcoholism, drug abuse, family violence, and aging. Other students can prepare to work in community crisis centers, outpatient clinics, public and private social service agencies, hospitals, schools and religious organizations. Since all Human Services majors are required to complete two 150 hour internships, they are well equipped to join the workforce on or before graduation. Most students choose an internship where they will continue to work after graduation. Other students may decide to attend graduate school. </P>

<H2>Alternative Credit and Collaborative Programs </H2>

<Sect>
<P>Grand View University recognizes that learning occurs outside of the classroom.  Several opportunities are available for students to meet graduation requirements through alternative means. </P>

<P>Experiential Learning </P>

<P>Grand View University recognizes three opportunities for the conversion of experiential learning into college credit: </P>

<P> Successful preparation and evaluation of experiential learning portfolios,  Successful completion of Grand View University Departmental Examinations, </P>

<P> Successful completion of selected tests from the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DSST tests (formerly DANTES Subject Standardized Tests). </P>

<P>Credit received through Experiential Learning does not satisfy residency requirements of degree programs at Grand View University.  No more than 32 semester hours of credit by CLEP, DSST, industry exams, departmental examination, and/or experiential portfolio assessment at Grand View University can be granted.  Grand View University does not accept transfer experiential credit. </P>

<P>Experiential Learning Portfolio Option </P>

<P>Many adult learners have engaged in educational activities outside the formal classroom which have resulted in the acquisition of new knowledge, skills, and attitudes.  This experiential learning or prior learning may qualify for college credit.  Not all such learning, however, can be so converted.  College credit may be given only if learning meets the following criteria: </P>

<P> It lends itself to definition and assessment,  It is at the college level in difficulty,  It can be documented,  It does not duplicate learning for which previous </P>

<P>college credit has been given. </P>

<P>Students must have at least 12 semester hours of classroom credit from Grand View University before the experiential learning portfolio credits will be reflected on the transcript.  All submissions for credit must be made prior to the completion of the last 6 hours of classroom credit. </P>

<P>Students must pay a portfolio evaluation fee to the Business Office and register for a one-credit class on portfolio preparation. </P>

<P>Departmental Credit by Examination </P>

<P>Currently enrolled students may, at the discretion of the department, receive credit after successfully completing a course content examination.  Credit cannot be earned by examination if it duplicates credit earned previously (grade of D or better) or if the course is a lower-level course in a sequence in which the student has previously received credit for a higher-level course (for example, a student who has earned credit in FREN 201 could not test out of FREN 101 or 102).  Credit by examination does not satisfy residency requirements for degree programs. </P>

<P>Interested students should complete a Request for Credit by Departmental Examination form available on myView or from an academic advisor.  Departmental Credit by Examination is $30.00 per examination. </P>

<P>CLEP and DSST </P>

<P>The University is a participant in College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and DSST tests (formerly DANTES Subject Standardized Tests). Students should check with the Registrar’s Office to determine how specific CLEP and DSST exams are accepted. </P>

<P>Credit cannot be earned by examination if it duplicates credit earned previously (grade of D or better) or if the course is a lower-level course in a sequence in which the student has previously received credit for a higher-level course (for example, a student who has earned credit in FREN 201 could not test out of FREN 101 or 102).  Credit received through CLEP and DSST does not satisfy residency requirements of degree programs at Grand View University.  Students should discuss this opportunity with their academic advisor. </P>

<P>CLEP and DSST subject examinations may be scheduled and taken through the Student Life and Success Office at Grand View University or the Center for Graduate, Adult, and Online Learning. For more information, contact the Director of Disability Services.  To see a listing of CLEP and DSST tests and their Grand View course equivalents, please go to www.grandview.edu.  </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Advanced Placement </P>

<P>Entering students who have participated in Advanced Placement Programs of the College Entrance Examinations Board while in high school may receive college credit if they attain scores of three or better on the Advanced Placement Test.  These tests are given each May.  Interested seniors should contact their high school guidance counselors early in their senior year.  Students must have their test results mailed directly from the College Board to the Registrar’s Office at Grand View as soon as they are available to receive credit.  Transfer students must also have the test results mailed directly to the Registrar’s Office. Test results can be ordered online at http://www.collegeboard.com.  All equivalents will be listed as non-coursework, so they will meet requirements but not count toward GPA.  Some exams are not directly equivalent to courses offered at Grand View but can be applied to core or elective requirements.  To see a listing of AP exams and their Grand View course equivalents, please go to www.grandview.edu.  </P>

<P>Other Alternative Credit Opportunities </P>

<P>Military Service </P>

<P>Credits may be granted for military service-related experience on a pass basis and according to the Armed Services Guide.  Providing a Joint Services Transcript (JST), when available, is preferred.  If a JST transcript is not available, submission of a DD-214 or other approved military credit documentation is acceptable. </P>

<P>Job-Related Courses </P>

<P>Credit may be granted for certain job-related courses as recommended by the American Council on Education Guide. </P>

<P>Grand View University allows credit for learning that has occurred in off-campus educational programs evaluated and endorsed by the government or by selected professional organizations such as: the American Council on Education, the Armed Services, the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA), the international Association of Administrative Professionals, the Life Management Institute (LOMA), and the Insurance Institute of America. </P>

<P>Collaborative Programs </P>

<P>Cross-Enrollment Program </P>

<P>In 1975 the Des Moines Area Consortium for Higher Education implemented a Cross-Enrollment Program, extending the course offerings available to students attending Grand View, Drake University, and Des Moines Area Community College.  Under this program, full-time students at Grand View may enroll for one three credit course offered at Drake or Des Moines Area Community College each semester at no additional tuition cost.  The Grand View University Registrar’s Office coordinates this process and must be notified prior to registration for the class.  Additional information is available in the Registrar’s Office.  Cross-enroll courses do not interrupt nor add to the last 30 hours of Grand View requirements. </P>

<P>Air Force ROTC </P>

<P>The Department of Aerospace Studies at Iowa State University administers the Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) under an agreement between Grand View University, Iowa State University, and the Secretary of the Air Force.  Under this program, a student at Grand View can take courses which lead to a commission as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.  Scholarships are available to qualified students. </P>

<P>Additional information concerning AFROTC may be obtained from the Department of Aerospace Studies, Iowa State University. </P>

<P>Army ROTC </P>

<P>Grand View students may participate in the Army ROTC program at Drake University through special provisions of the Cross-Enrollment Program.  Scholarships are available to qualified students. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Des Moines Art Center </P>

<P>Grand View University has entered into a cooperative program with the Des Moines Art Center whereby students may enroll for art courses taught at the Des Moines Art Center and receive credit from Grand View.  Interested students should contact the Registrar’s Office. </P>

<P>Cooperative Education Program </P>

<P>Under the Cooperative Education Program, students earn University credit under specified conditions while working as employees or volunteers in jobs either related to the students’ major fields or those which will enable them to investigate prospective careers.  Students may earn up to three credit hours in this program.  Grading is on a pass/fail basis. </P>

<P>Internships </P>

<P>Because of its location in Des Moines, the largest city in Iowa, Grand View is able to provide meaningful internships for its students. </P>

<P>The Internship is an integral component of career development efforts at the University.  It is an academic experience in a career-related work setting supervised jointly by the University and an associated employer.  The Internship at Grand View is the application of classroom experience to the work setting.  Students should see their advisors or visit the Career Center for more information.  A maximum of six credits may be earned from Internship. </P>

<P>Independent Study </P>

<P>Students may engage in independent study according to their needs and interests through most departments of the University as faculty time permits.  These courses enable students to undertake independent study, research, or field work in selected topics.  An independent study project should cover an academic topic or provide a learning experience that is not offered by any of the courses identified in the current University catalog. </P>

<P>To be eligible, students must have attained sophomore standing and must have their proposals for study approved by the Registrar and the instructor.  Students may earn up to a maximum of eight semester credits for independent study work.  No more than four credits may be awarded for a single project. </P>

<P>Summer Session </P>

<P>Summer Session day classes are organized into three terms, May Term, June Term, and July Term, with classes usually meeting Monday through Friday.  Students may take a maximum of six courses, two per term, through the Summer day Sessions.  New students admitted to the University for Fall semester may wish to begin their work during Summer Session.  Students may use the Summer Session to accelerate, enrich, or improve their educational programs.  Summer schedules are available on-line.  Additional summer course schedules are offered through the Center for Graduate, Adult, and Online Learning for qualified students. </P>

<P>Students who need additional financial aid than that provided by the Stafford Loan program may qualify for a federal Graduate Plus loan. </P>

<P>All questions about financial assistance for graduate study should be referred to the Director of Financial Aid. </P>

<P>Grand View Assistance </P>

<P>Graduate students who are degree seeking may be eligible for limited Grand View awarded aid.  Please contact the Financial Aid Office for information. </P>

<P>Grand View University is committed to providing every student a quality education at a reasonable cost.  Through the annual contributions of the churches of the Iowa Synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, gifts from individuals and businesses, and income generated by the Grand View University Endowment Fund, the actual cost to the students may be reduced. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Satisfactory Academic Progress </P>

<P>The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, requires students to maintain satisfactory progress toward their degree in order to receive financial aid.  At Grand View University, these standards are established for students who are receiving or applying for financial aid from one or more of the various federal, state or institutional scholarship, grant, work or loan programs. </P>

<P>Grand View’s Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for Financial Aid apply to all students who want to establish or maintain financial aid eligibility.  These standards apply to a student’s entire academic transcript, including terms for which financial aid was not applied nor disbursed. </P>

<P>The Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards require that students successfully complete a certain percentage of attempted credit hours and maintain a minimum required grade point average as defined by the standards.  These are minimum academic standards that must be attained.  Specific aid programs or academic departments may require more than these minimum standards. </P>

<P>The academic progress of financial aid recipients is monitored each term.  Students should contact the Financial Aid Office with questions regarding the intent and/or interpretation of these standards. </P>

<P>Completion Rate Requirements &amp; Duration of Eligibility </P>

<P>Students must successfully complete at least 67% of the credit hours they attempt.  Credits for which students receive grades of W or F are counted as credits that are attempted, but not completed.  Students who do not complete 67% of their attempted credit hours will be granted one warning period in which to increase their percentage of credit hours earned.  Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period will result in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the student has earned 67% of his or her attempted credit hours.  Eligibility will terminate when the credits required for a specific degree/program are earned. </P>

<P>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirements </P>

<P>Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA.  Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 minimum cumulative GPA.  Students who do not meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirements will be granted a warning period in which to raise their cumulative GPA to the minimum standard.  Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period will result in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the cumulative GPA meets the minimum standard. </P>

<P>Courses with a grade of Incomplete must be completed in the following semester.  Incomplete courses that remain after one semester will be assigned a grade of F and factored into academic progress at that time. </P>

<P>Warning Periods </P>

<P>Please note that students will receive a total of one warning period whether they are in violation of one or more Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. </P>

<P>Repeated Coursework </P>

<P>When a student repeats a course, the most recent grade received will be used in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average.  The credit hours for the class will be calculated as part of a student’s completion rate.  A course that has been successfully completed with a C or above can only be repeated once. </P>

<P>Re-Establishing Eligibility </P>

<P>A student who has lost financial aid eligibility due to a deficiency in completed hours or GPA can regain eligibility by achieving the minimum standards established in this policy.  It is the student’s responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office and request that aid be reinstated when this has been accomplished. </P>

<P>Appeal Process </P>

<P>Extenuating circumstances that result in a student failing to achieve the minimum completed credit hours and/or GPA requirements will be evaluated by a Financial Aid Academic Progress Committee.  Appeals should be sent in writing to the Assistant Director of Financial Aid, Grand View University, 1200 Grandview Avenue, Des Moines, IA 50316-1599. </P>

<P>Financial Charges </P>

<P>Books and Supplies </P>

<P>Books and supplies may be purchased at the Grand View University Bookstore. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Library Fees </P>

<P>The Grand View University Library does not charge a daily fine for the late return of library books or other materials.  However, after 90 days students are charged a replacement fine for the item (minimum of $10.00), plus a service fee of $5.00.  This charge is debited to the student’s account at the Business Office. </P>

<P>Tuition  </P>

<P>Students registering for degree-seeking graduate credit are charged per credit hour based on the specific degree.  Please go to www.grandview.edu for an up-to-date listing of tuition and fees. </P>

<P>Technology Fee/Parking Fee/Online Course Fee </P>

<P>Fees are charged to student accounts on a per semester basis.  Parking and technology fees are assessed to graduate students.  Online course fees are charged per credit hour for all online courses. Fees are not refundable after the start of the semester. Please go to www.grandview.edu for an up-to-date listing of tuition and fees. </P>

<P>Payments and Refunds </P>

<P>Payment of Student Accounts </P>

<P>Payment of charges for tuition is due by the Friday before the start of class for any term.  All other charges (fines, etc.) are due within 10 days of the date assessed.  Payments can be made online or at the Business Office and may be made by cash, check, MasterCard, Visa, Discover Card or American Express. A convenience fee will be applied to all credit card payments made towards student account balances. </P>

<P>The Employer Reimbursement Plan is available to students who are reimbursed by their employer for the cost of classes.  While the students have the ultimate responsibility for payment of tuition, the amount reimbursed by the company can be deferred until 30 days after the end of the therm.  To defer payment students must:  </P>

<P>1. Complete and submit the GV Tuition Reimbursement Form (available in the Business Office) no later than the tuition due date;  </P>

<P>Graduate Degree Programs </P>

<P>2. On or before the tuition due date, pay the portion of tuition not covered by the employer reimbursement plan, plus a processing fee of $25.00 per semester. </P>

<P>Additionally, the university offers a variety of payment plan options. For additional information on this payment option, please contact the Business Office. </P>

<P>Any amount not paid in full by the due date will be assess a 1.5% per month late charge.  The balance shall be due and payable at once, without any additional notice to the students, if the students terminate enrollment at Grand View University or the total due is not paid by the final payment deadline.  The student is responsible for all interest, collection costs and attorney fees necessary for the collection of any amount not paid when due.  Late fees will continue to be charged in the amount of 1.5% per month.  Any past due balance may result in prevention of further enrollment and may also result in cancellation of registration for upcoming classes.  Transcripts and diplomas will be held until all financial obligations to the university are satisfied. </P>

<P>Students who do not pay tuition, fees, room or board, or make arrangements for payment by the published deadline each semester may have their future schedules cancelled and future housing room and board plans terminated. Students will be notified using their Grand View e-mail account concerning outstanding delinquencies and given an opportunity to pay the past due balance or make arrangements for payment with the Business Office prior to cancellation. If the University takes such action, the student will still be responsible for any outstanding balance. </P>

<P>All returned checks will be charged a $25.00 fee which will be added to the students’ tuition accounts, and no further checks will be accepted. </P>

<P>Tuition Refunds </P>

<P>Dropping Classes </P>

<P>Students have the first 7% of each class to add and drop classes without financial penalty.  The Business Office and Financial Aid Office will establish each student’s tuition charges and financial aid based on the student’s enrollment after the add/drop period.  Any classes dropped after the add/drop period will continue to count toward billing credits and will not result in an adjustment to tuition charges or financial aid unless students completely withdraw (drop all classes) from the university.  Classes added after this date may result in increased tuition charges as the total billing credits charged will include all courses not dropped before or during the add/drop period. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>The add/drop period is adjusted for courses that do not last the full length of a semester or session. </P>

<P>Complete Withdrawal </P>

<P>Students who are considering withdrawing from Grand View University should first discuss all academic options with their advisor.  Students should then consult with the Financial Aid and Business Offices to understand the financial implications of a complete withdrawal.  Students who then decide to officially withdraw from the University must contact the Graduate Studies Office. Students who wish to remain enrolled for a future term must indicate their intention in writing. </P>

<P>The official withdrawal date will be determined by the date that the student begins the official withdrawal process. This date will be used to determine any adjustments to tuition and financial aid awards.  Students who withdraw on or after the first day of the term and before the 60% point in time in the semester will receive a prorated refund in tuition.  The amount of the refund is based on the percentage of the semester that has not been completed (the number of calendar days remaining in the semester divided by the number of calendar days in the semester).  Financial aid will be refunded to the respective sources (federal, state and institutional) using the same percentage.  Stated simply, a student who completely withdraws after completing 20% of the semester will be charged 20% of tuition charges and will retain 20% of the financial aid.  Examples of the application of the refund policy are available upon request at the Financial Aid Office. </P>

<P>If funds have been released to the student because of a credit balance on the student’s account at Grand View University, then the student may be required to repay some or the entire amount released to the student. </P>

<P>This policy is subject to federal regulations.  Contact the Financial Aid Office for details and to learn of any changes to this policy. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>All students admitted to Graduate Studies will be assigned an advisor during their first semester of enrollment.  The advisor will prepare and distribute to each student enrolled in the graduate program a two-year Plan of Study which identifies the courses that are to be taken, the requirements that are to be satisfied, and the academic term in which courses and requirements are to be completed.   </P>

<P>Graduate students are encouraged to meet with their academic advisor regularly. </P>

<P>Students must submit an application for graduation through their academic advisor to the Registrar’s Office no later than one year before their intended graduation date.  This is not an automatic process; one must apply for graduation. </P>

<P>International Students </P>

<P>The Director of Multicultural and Community Outreach serves as the designated school official (DSO) and as an advisor to non-immigrant students.  Non-immigrant students must keep informed of special requirements concerning their residence while in the United States.  Please note that you (the F-1 student) are solely responsible for following U.S. immigration laws.  These special requirements relate primarily to immigration laws.  International students must keep their passport and visa current.  International students also are required to report to Grand View University’s DSO any change of address within 10 days of the address change.  The law provides for rather severe penalties for failing to properly notify the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. </P>

<P>The Student Life staff is available to assist with housing, personal adjustment counseling, and other concerns.  All international students are required to have health insurance prior to registering for classes. </P>

<P>Academic Information </P>

<P>Registration </P>

<P>New students may register in advance according to information that will be sent after the acceptance process is completed.  In addition, registration is possible on days specified in the University calendar. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Returning students will pre-register for the following semester according to the schedule distributed by the Registrar’s Office each semester. </P>

<P>The times of registration for Graduate Students are stated in connection with the announcement of course offerings prior to the opening of each session. </P>

<P>In every instance registration is complete when students have enrolled for a schedule of courses and have completed financial arrangements in the Business Office. </P>

<P>Academic Load </P>

<P>Full time graduate load is 9 semester hours.  Those enrolled for fewer than 9 hours are considered part-time students.  Half time is considered 5 semester hours.  Typically a semester is designed to have 7 credit hours. Full-time and part-time standing requirements for other organizations (such as VA educational benefits) may vary. </P>

<P>Changes in Registration </P>

<P>When necessary, changes in registration may be made.  However, students should plan their academic programs carefully so that subsequent changes are kept to a minimum.  After the first 7% of each class has passed, a student may only add the class with instructor approval.  Specific dates are listed on the course schedule for each term, which may be found by going to myView &gt; Academics &gt; Calendars and Course Schedules &gt; Term Calendars. </P>

<P>Withdrawal from Courses or from the University </P>

<P>1. Individual Course Withdrawal </P>

<P>Students may officially withdraw from an individual course during the first 60% of a semester.  If withdrawal occurs after the first 7% of the length of the course, and before the end of the first 60% of the length of the course, the registrar will place the symbol W on a student’s transcript. Students who drop individual courses after the first 60% will receive an F (fail) grade for those courses.  For academic courses of irregular length, the withdrawal date shall be 60% of the length of the course.  If withdrawal occurs after the first 7% of the academic term and before the final withdrawal date, the registrar will place the symbol W on a student’s transcript.  An F (fail) grade will be recorded for any irregular length course that a student drops after the withdrawal deadline.  The specific date for this deadline is listed on the Term Calendar for each term, which is distributed by the Registrar’s Office.  If students have been found guilty of academic dishonestly and a penalty of an F (fail) grade is assigned, a W cannot be granted. </P>

<P>2. Withdrawal from the University </P>

<P>Students may withdraw from the University and receive a W for each course if withdrawal occurs before the end of the first 60% of the semester.  A failing grade will be recorded for all courses if the University withdrawal is made after the first 60% of the term.  Students who withdraw from Grand View’s graduate program will need to apply for readmission. </P>

<P>3. Active Military Service Withdrawal </P>

<P>If called to active duty a student (or student who is a spouse/dependent child of a member of the military called to active duty, and who needs to withdraw due to the call-up), should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office to complete a Military Leave of Absence form. Verification of military deployment must be submitted with the completed Military Leave of Absence form. </P>

<P>If the student is called to active duty before the mid-point of a term, the student may request to withdraw from some or all courses and the University will fully refund their tuition and mandatory fees for the withdrawn courses. </P>

<P>If the student is called to active duty military service during the term, the student may make arrangements with their instructors to remain enrolled in some or all of their course and will be assigned an I grade (Incomplete) for each course in which they remain enrolled.  In such a case, no adjustment of tuition charges for enrolled courses will occur.  Students have until the end of the next academic term following their release from military service to complete the course.  Failure to do so will result in the I grade becoming an F grade. </P>

<P>A student receiving Veteran’s Benefits should notify the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office in order to complete the required documents.   </P>

<P>A student will have one calendar year after the end of their deployment to re-enroll at Grand View.  Grand View considers the end date of reserve the right to refuse to accept credits in which deployment to be the date listed on the original the student received a low grade. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect/>

<Sect>
<P>deployment papers, or more recent paperwork (such as a DD-214) that lists a deployment end date.  After one calendar year beyond the deployment end date, the student will need to apply for readmission to Grand View through the Admissions Department. </P>

<P>A student will be re-enrolled in the same academic program (or the most similar one, if same program does not exist), will carry forward the same number of credits, and same academic status.  Grand View University scholarship awards will be preserved for students holding such awards when called to active duty. </P>

<P>During the first academic year of return, the veteran will be assessed the same tuition and fee charges as were in effect during the academic year he/she left the program (Veterans or other service member education benefits may be taken into account) or up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veteran’s education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other service member education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the current academic year in which the student left for Grand View. </P>

<P>A student who wishes to re-enroll at Grand View after deployment should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar’s Office.  The VA Certifying Official will serve as the main point of contact for the student during the re-enrollment process. </P>

<P>4. Students are reminded that if withdrawal is not official, they will be responsible for tuition charges relating to the course(s) in question. </P>

<P>Transfer to Other Institutions </P>

<P>The fact that Grand View University is an accredited member of the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and is accredited at the baccalaureate and master’s levels insures a maximum of convenience in the transfer of credits to other educational institutions. </P>

<P>Students planning to transfer, however, should realize that there is no such thing as automatic transfer.  Each institution has its own requirements and standards and is free to apply these restrictions to all applicants.  Moreover, many institutions </P>

<P>For these reasons, students who plan to transfer are strongly urged to plan their programs at Grand View with careful reference to the catalogs of the institutions in which they are interested, or better yet, with a letter or visit to the Registrar of such institutions.  In addition, students are urged to maintain as high a grade point average as possible to minimize difficulties associated with low grades. </P>

<P>Notification to Students on Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 </P>

<P>Grand View University, in full compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, shall make educational records available to students upon request.  Likewise, in accordance with the law, individually identifiable educational records will not be released to other than authorized individuals without the written consent of the students.  Students have the right to file complaints with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA) in Washington, D.C., concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the Act. </P>

<P>Student educational records are open to inspection and review by the individual student with certain exceptions which are permitted under the act.  Among those items excepted from this policy are confidential letters written prior to January 1, 1975, records held by counselors and other psychological records held on a student, private records in the sole possession of the maker, or financial records of the parents.  Students’ records are open to other school officials, including teachers within the educational institution or local educational agency who have been determined to have legitimate educational interest, and those others specified in the act. </P>

<P>As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which student education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records — including Social Security Number, grades, or other private information — may be accessed without student consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the </P>

<P>U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (&quot;Federal and State Authorities&quot;) may allow access to student records and PII without student consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is &quot;principally engaged in the provision of education,&quot; such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to student education records and PII without student consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive your PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without student consent PII from your education records, and they may track student participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about students that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Students have the right to challenge the contents of their education records, to have a hearing if the outcome of the challenge is unsatisfactory, and to submit explanatory statements for inclusion in their files if they feel the decision of hearing officers is unacceptable. </P>

<P>Grand View University considers the following categories to be directory information, and, as such, may release it to any or all inquiries in such forms as news releases, directories, or computer address lists: the student’s name, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, advisor, major field of study, dates of attendance, enrollment status, degrees and awards received, honors received (including Dean’s and President’s Lists), most recent previous educational agency or institution attended, photographic view or electronic images, class level, anticipated date of completion, participation in official recognized activities and sports, and for members of athletic teams, weight and height. </P>

<P>Students who do not wish this information to be released may prevent such a release by sending a written request to the Registrar’s Office.  If a student requests that directory information not be released, it will prohibit Grand View University from providing any of the above information except the student’s name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program.  If students do not want student’s name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program released, they should contact the registrar. </P>

<P>Grading and Academic Progress </P>

<P>Permanent Grades </P>

<P>There are four permanent grades that indicate the quality of students’ work in a course.  Three of these indicate successful completion of the course: A (highest), B, and C (lowest).  The fourth, F, indicates failure to complete the course successfully. </P>

<P>The symbol W is entered on the transcript when students withdraw.  No course in the core or track may be taken pass/fail. </P>

<P>Incomplete Work </P>

<P>Students who have made satisfactory progress in a course (achieved passing grades) but are unable to complete course requirements due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control may ask their instructor for an “Incomplete.”  Students must discuss this option with their instructor, document the circumstances preventing them from completing the course to the instructor’s satisfaction, and receive the instructor’s approval before the University will recognize such requests.  The faculty member, in consultation with the student, will decide the amount of time allowed to complete the course requirements.  Students receiving an Incomplete during the Spring Semester or during one of the summer terms must finish all specified course work before the end of the following Fall Semester.  Students receiving an incomplete during the Fall Semester must complete all specified course work before the end of the following Spring Semester.  This completion period may be extended if special circumstances exist.  Requests to extend the completion period beyond one additional semester must be made by the instructor and approved by the academic dean.  The temporary symbol I is noted on a student’s transcript when an incomplete is granted.  This symbol is removed from the student’s transcript and replaced with the appropriate grade for the course if the requirements are completed within the designated time period.  If the requirements are not completed during the designated time period, the I symbol is automatically replaced with a grade of F. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Students requesting an incomplete must fill out an incomplete request form in consultation with their instructor.  When completed the faculty member must submit it to the Registrar’s Office no later than the day grades are due for the semester in which the course is taken.  The registrar must sign this form to acknowledge its receipt.  Students and faculty are encouraged to keep copies of this form as well as copies of all the work required to complete the course until they receive written verification of their final course grade. </P>

<P>Grading Policies, Credits, Grade Points, and Grade Point Average </P>

<P>Academic credit is expressed in semester hours. Grade points are assigned to the students’ grades and used to determine the academic standing of the students. </P>

<P>Each credit hour of A: 4 grade points </P>

<P>Each credit hour of B: 3 grade points </P>

<P>Each credit hour of C: 2 grade points </P>

<P>Each credit hour of F: 0 grade points </P>

<P>The symbols I (incomplete), W (withdraw), and Z (audited) do not carry grade point values. </P>

<P>For graduate courses, the grade point average is the total of all grade points divided by the total of all graduate credit hours attempted. </P>

<P>Grade point averages are recorded on official transcripts to the nearest 0.01 of a point.  All decisions affecting students’ academic progress that make use of a grade point criterion (e.g. academic probation, academic suspension, and graduation) are made with reference to the nearest </P>

<P>0.01 of a point of the student’s GPA. </P>

<P>Academic Progression </P>

<P>Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA and may not accumulate more than 2 “C” course grades toward graduation.  Students with a cumulative GPA below </P>

<P>3.0 will be placed on probation and may be dismissed from the program by the Council of Graduate Studies.</P>

<P> Grade Change </P>

<P>After an instructor reports a grade at the end of a semester of term, it may be changed only under one of the following circumstances: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>An error has been made in computing or reporting the grade.  If an error has been made, the student should contact the course instructor immediately.  The instructor completes and signs a change of grade form and sends it to the Registrar.  Upon receipt of the completed form, the Registrar will change the student’s permanent record. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>An unusual set of circumstances necessitates such an action.  In these situations, the instructor must provide a written justification with appropriate documentation and receive the approval of the graduate Director.  Upon receipt of the completed grade change form, the Registrar will change the student’s permanent record. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>It is the student’s responsibility to initiate the procedure for a grade change.  Grade change forms are available at the Registrar’s Office.  Students should verify grade changes by checking online, or requesting a copy of, their official University transcript. </P>

<P>Pass/Fail Option </P>

<P>The pass/fail option stipulates that no grade will be given other than P (passing) or F (failing).  Credit will be awarded only for work equivalent to a C grade or better; work equivalent to an F grade will receive an F grade.  The pass/fail option is not available for required courses for degree-seeking graduate students. </P>

<P>Final Grade Reports </P>

<P>Following the end of each term, final grade reports are available on the University computer system.  Students who need an official copy may request it online or in the Office of the Registrar. </P>

<P>Prerequisites </P>

<P>Many course descriptions provide a list of prerequisites that provide essential background for successful completion of a class.  Prerequisites may include specific courses or may also refer to acceptable class standing, prior academic standing, permission of instructor, departmentally determined competencies or other departmental requirements.  Prerequisites must be completed prior to the beginning of the term in which the course with prerequisites is scheduled.  It is the responsibility of the student to comply with the prerequisites for a course that they plan to take.  Failure to meet the prerequisites can result in cancellation of registration for a course. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Repeating Failed Courses </P>

<P>Students may repeat any credit course in which a failing grade (F) was received.  A student is strongly advised to repeat a failed course as soon as possible.  Students will find that this is the most effective way of raising their cumulative grade point average.  The grade earned for the most recent enrollment will be used in calculating the cumulative GPA.  While all previously earned grades remain on the academic record, they are not counted in GPA calculations.  All course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript with an indication that the course was retaken.  If the new course is taken at another institution, it is the student’s responsibility to request that the registrar remove the earlier grade in calculating the cumulative GPA. </P>

<P>In regards to financial aid, a failed course may be repeated as many times as needed until passed. </P>

<P>Repeating Passed Courses </P>

<P>If students decide that their mastery of a previously passed course will be improved by retaking the course, they may do so subject to the following conditions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>The grade received for each course retaken will appear on the transcript, and the new grade will be used for computing the cumulative grade point average.  However, all course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript, along with a notation that a course was retaken. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>No additional credit toward graduation may be received for retaking a previously passed course. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Fees must be paid for all courses retaken. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must properly register to retake a course during registration or pre-registration. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>If the earlier course or the retaken course is at another institution, it is the student’s responsibility to request that the registrar replace the earlier grade with the new grade. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Graduate Degree Programs </P>

<P>In regards to financial aid, a previously passed course may only be repeated once.  This includes even those courses where a higher grade is required for the major (e.g., minimum of C for nursing major courses, etc.).  This does not include courses designated as repeatable (e.g. ensembles, music lessons, communication labs, etc.) as these are not restricted nor limited (unless designated otherwise) and, therefore, a student may repeat these courses as often as needed. </P>

<P>Previously passed courses are those for which any of the following grades have been received: A, B or C. </P>

<P>Repeatable Courses </P>

<P>Courses may be repeated for credit if the catalog course description specifies that the course is repeatable.  Each instance of a repeatable course will count in the student’s cumulative GPA. </P>

<P>Variable Credit Courses </P>

<P>Courses with a variable credit designation may be taken for a different number of credit hours.  Students should consult the course instructor or the department offering the course to determine the number of semester hours for which they may register.  A variable credit course cannot be taken again unless it is clearly designated as repeatable. </P>

<P>Class Attendance </P>

<P>Regular attendance at classes is expected of all students.  There is no system of allowed absences or class cuts.  Special attendance regulations are the responsibility of the faculty member, who will announce the policy to the students at the beginning of each course. </P>

<P>Students incurring absences due to participation in off-campus experiences and trips approved by the provost and vice president for academic affairs or director of graduate studies have the responsibility of clearing such absences with faculty whose classes they will miss and arranging for any make-up work prior to being absent.  Because approved trips are considered to be supportive of the total University program, faculty are strongly encouraged to allow students to make up work that has been missed.  Final permission to make up work because of absence for ANY reason rests with the individual faculty member. </P>

<P>Even though the attendance policy is up to the discretion of each faculty member, non-attendance is monitored in the classroom as required by federal regulation (34 CFR 668.22).   </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Students are responsible for submitting the Change in Registration form to drop any class they are not attending. </P>

<P>Once a student has attended one class meeting for a semester, the student has committed to maintaining his/her entire registration for the semester, including the charges associated with those decisions.  It is the personal responsibility of the student to know the University’s registration policies, to follow those policies when adjusting registration, and to verify through their record in myView that requested schedule changes have been made.  Registrants who do not attend a single class during the first week of the semester will be administratively dropped from all of their classes for the semester; however, it is the personal responsibility of the student to complete the appropriate admission deferment or withdrawal process. </P>

<P>Penalties for Grade Point Deficiencies </P>

<P>Academic Probation </P>

<P>Graduate students will be placed on Academic Probation if they fail to attain a 3.0 cumulative grade point average necessary to be in Good Academic Standing.  Students will be notified by the University in writing of their probationary status. </P>

<P>Students on Academic Probation will be limited to a course load of 7 semester hours.  It is the students’ responsibility to contact their advisors so that their course loads can be adjusted to the 7 hour limit.  Students on Academic Probation may lose financial aid. </P>

<P>If students do not earn a 3.0 cumulative grade point average during a probationary semester, their continued enrollment at Grand View University will be subject to review by the Graduate Council.  This review could lead to either Academic Suspension or admission to additional probationary semester. </P>

<P>Academic Suspension </P>

<P>school, the Graduate Council may suspend a student after an initial semester of graduate study. </P>

<P>Graduate students suspended will need to reapply to the Graduate Council and demonstrate the ability to be successful in graduate school.  They must speak to the reasons they were suspended and how they have rectified their situation at the time of re-admission. </P>

<P>Academic Responsibility/Academic Honesty Policy </P>

<P>In accordance with the mission statement, Grand View University is dedicated to the development of the whole person and committed to truth, excellence, and ethical values. The University strives to promote an appreciation of the dignity and worth of each individual and open interaction among student, faculty and staff. Personal integrity and academic honesty are essential to building a campus of trust. Thus, honesty in all aspects of the college experience is the responsibility of each student, faculty, and staff member. </P>

<P>This expectation is reflected in the Grand View University Code of Integrity which states: As a member of the Grand View University community, and in accordance with the mission of the University and its Lutheran identity, I agree to appreciate and respect the dignity and worth of each individual. I will honor and promote a community of open interaction, personal integrity, active and intellectual engagement, and academic honesty with students, faculty and staff. </P>

<P>Academic Dishonesty Defined </P>

<P>Academic dishonesty is any deliberate misrepresentation by a student of the following: </P>

<P> academic record or status; </P>

<P> ability to perform in any course with regard to </P>

<P>writing papers; taking examinations, and/or </P>

<P>doing assignments; and  personal efforts and work accomplished toward </P>

<P>the fulfillment of course requirements; and  the honest work of a fellow student.  That is, </P>

<P>any dishonest action performed or statement </P>

<P>made with the intention of impeding or </P>

<P>discrediting said honest work. </P>

</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Plagiarism: The use of another’s ideas, words, or results and presenting them as one’s own. To avoid plagiarism, students are expected to use proper methods of documentation and acknowledgement according to the accepted format for the particular discipline or as required by the faculty in a course. Some common examples are: </P>

<P> Copying word for word from an oral, printed, or electronic source without proper acknowledgement or citation. </P>

<P> Paraphrasing, or presenting in one’s own words another person’s written words or ideas as if they were one’s own, without proper acknowledgement or citation. </P>

<P> Submitting a downloaded or purchased paper or other materials to satisfy a course requirement. </P>

<P> Incorporating into one’s own work, graphs, drawings, photographs, diagrams, tables, spreadsheets, computer programs, or other non-text material from other sources without proper citation. </P>

<P>Cheating: The use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, notes, study aids, or other devices in any academic exercise. Cheating also includes submitting papers, research results and analyses, etc. as one’s own work when they were, in fact, prepared by others. Some common examples are: </P>

<P> Receiving research, programming, data collection, or analytical assistance from others or working with another student on an assignment where such help is not permitted. </P>

<P> Copying another student’s work or answers on a quiz or examination. </P>

<P> Collaborating with another student(s) when completing any assignment or examination, unless the faculty explicitly states otherwise. </P>

<P> Using or possessing books, notes, calculators, cell phones, or other prohibited devices or materials during a quiz or examination. </P>

<P> Submitting the same work or major portions of a work to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the faculty involved. </P>

<P> Preprogramming a calculator or other electronic device to contain answers, formulas, or other unauthorized information for use during a quiz or examination. </P>

<P> Acquiring a copy of an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination.  Having a substitute take an examination for one.  Having someone else prepare a term paper or other assignment. </P>

<P>Fabrication and Falsification: The invention or falsification of sources, citations, data, or results, and recording or reporting them in any academic exercise. Some examples are: </P>

<P> Altering the record of data or experimental procedures or results.  False citation of the source of information or citing a source that does not exist. </P>

<P> Altering the record of or reporting false information about internship or practicum experiences. </P>

<P>Facilitation of Dishonesty: Facilitation of dishonesty is knowingly or negligently allowing one’s work to be used by another student without prior approval of the instructor or otherwise aiding another in committing violations of academic integrity. A student who facilitates a violation of academic honesty/integrity can be considered as responsible as the student who receives the impermissible assistance, even if the facilitator does not benefit personally from the violations. Some examples are: </P>

<P> Knowingly allowing another student to copy answers on a quiz or examination or assisting others to do so. </P>

<P> Distributing an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination.  Distributing or selling a paper to another student.  Taking an examination for another student. </P>

<P>Academic Interference: Academic interference is deliberately impeding the academic progress of another student. Some examples are: </P>

<P> Intentionally destroying or obstructing another student’s work. </P>

<P> Altering computer files that contain data, reports, or assignments belonging to another student. </P>

<P> Removing posted or reserve material or otherwise preventing another student’s access to it. </P>

<P>Procedure for dealing with an incident of academic dishonesty </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Any instance of academic dishonesty requires action involving both the student and the faculty member directly involved and the submission of an Academic Dishonesty Report to the Office of the Academic Deans.  If the instructor is unsure how to proceed, she/he may consult with the Student Academic Life Committee at any point in the process.  </P>

<P>The faculty member must also provide the student with a copy of the Academic Dishonesty Report. The report form should identify the following series of consequences. </P>

<P>If it is the student’s first incident of academic dishonesty, the instructor can impose a range of sanctions from the following, depending on the nature and degree of seriousness of the incident: </P>

<P> A warning with opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the assignment with no opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the course. </P>

<P>The student will receive a letter from the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs about the incident, the University’s expectations regarding academic honesty/integrity, and future possible consequences should the student commit another act of academic dishonesty during their enrollment at Grand View. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student’s academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar. </P>

<P>Following a second incident of academic dishonesty, the student minimally will fail the course and be placed on academic dishonesty probation. Upon receiving notification from the instructor of a violation, and determining that it is a second violation, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs must notify the student about the incident. This letter will inform the student of her/his failing grade and placement on probation. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student’s academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar.  </P>

<P>When a student is reported for a third incident of academic dishonesty, the student will be suspended from the University and the suspension for academic dishonesty will be noted on the student’s transcript. Upon receiving notification from the instructor of a violation, and determining that it is a third violation, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs must notify the student about the incident. This letter will inform the student of her/his suspension. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student’s academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar. Should the student choose to appeal the decision, he/she would be allowed to complete the term during which the appeal is heard; if upheld, the suspension will occur during the regular term following the appeal. </P>

<P>Students suspended for Academic Dishonesty must follow the same procedures for readmission as those listed for students who have been academically suspended, with the exception that they will not be required to enroll elsewhere during their suspension. </P>

<P>When a student has returned to Grand View after being suspended for a third violation and is subsequently reported for a fourth incident of academic dishonesty, the student will fail the course and be suspended immediately from the University, and the suspension for academic dishonesty will be noted on the student’s transcript. The suspension will remain in force during the appeal process; if the suspension is upheld, the student will be expelled from the University. </P>

<P>Procedure for Initiating an Appeal </P>

<P>A student who wishes to appeal a decision regarding academic dishonesty must initiate that process within 14 calendar days of the postmark of the letter from the Provost regarding the incident. The first section of the Academic Appeal Form, which identifies the reason for the appeal must be completed and hand delivered to the Executive Administrative Assistant of the Provost in the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. This form and the complete appeal process can be located on myView &gt; Academics &gt; Registrar’s Office &gt; Forms &gt; Academic Dishonesty Appeal Form. </P>

<P>Student Complaints and Grievances </P>

<P>Student Complaints </P>

<P>A student complaint is limited: 1) to a dispute or difference regarding the interpretation of application of established Grand View University policies or procedures OR 2) to addressing an issue for which the University does not have an established policy or procedure.  A student complaint must be in writing and must set forth all of the relevant facts upon which it is based, the policy or procedure involved, and the relief sought.  A student complaint must be submitted to the appropriate member of the President’s Council (vice president or his/her designee) no later than 21 calendar days after the actual incident giving rise to the complaint. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Student Grievances </P>

<P>Procedures to appeal or reexamine a previously made decision have been established by several administrative units of the University.  Formal grievance procedures exist: </P>

<P>To appeal a final course grade or instructor’s final academic disciplinary action (Office of the Provost).  Students who wish to appeal a final course grade or other final academic disciplinary action of an instructor must complete and file the first section of an Academic Appeal form electronically within 14 calendar days after the end of the academic term in which the issue of disagreement occurred. </P>

<P>To appeal decisions regarding admission, progression, or graduation in the nursing program (Office of the Chair of the Nursing Department).  Students who wish to appeal a previously made decision must submit a Letter of Intent to File a Grievance to the Chair of the Nursing Department within 14 days after the incident.  The student must subsequently complete a Statement of Grievance within 48 hours after the Letter of Intent is received in the Chair’s office. </P>

<P>To appeal decisions regarding admission, progression, or graduation in the education program (Office of the Chair of the Education Department). The student must submit a written letter and schedule a meeting with the Education Department Chair within 14 calendar days after the end of the academic term in which the issue of disagreement occurred. </P>

<P>To appeal a parking ticket (Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs).  Students who wish to appeal a parking ticket must complete and submit a Parking Appeal Form to the Office of Student Life within 10 days after receiving a citation. </P>

<P>Graduation Requirements </P>

<P>Students must complete the graduation requirements listed in the Grand View catalog in effect at the time of initial registration.  These requirements are in effect unless the students have been out of Grand View for over four years.  Then the requirements for graduation become those in effect at the time of re-entry into the program. </P>

<P>Applying for Graduation </P>

<P>Students must submit an application for graduation through their academic advisor to the Registrar’s Office no later than one year before their intended graduation date.  This is not an automatic process; one must apply to graduate. </P>

<P>Students who are within six semester credits of completing all requirements for April graduation may petition the Registrar, in writing, to participate in the commencement ceremony.  This petition must include a plan to earn the remaining credit hours throughout the summer terms which follow the April commencement ceremony. </P>

<P>Any changes made to a graduation application after it has been granted, including the intended graduation date, must be submitted in writing to the Registrar’s Office in order for the changes to be accepted by the University.   </P>

<P>Graduation Requirements for a Master of Science, Master of Science in Athletic Training, Master of Science in Nursing, or Master of Education Degree </P>

This class will not be about making digital games, though.
