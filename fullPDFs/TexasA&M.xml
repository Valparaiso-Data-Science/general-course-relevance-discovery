<P> </P>

<H3>Student Responsibility </H3>

<P>Each student is responsible for knowing the academic regulations in the Catalog. Unfamiliarity with these regulations does not constitute a valid reason for failure to fulfill them. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Equal Opportunity Policy </H3>

<P>In compliance with Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Executive Order 11246, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville is open to all persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or veteran’s status who are otherwise eligible for admission as students.

<P> </P>

<P>Contact the Compliance Office, Lewis Hall, Room 130 - (361) 593-4758 for additional information. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and Amendments Thereto </H3>

<P>This act is designated to protect the privacy of education records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review their education records and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings. Students have the right to file complaints with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA) concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the act. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville accords all rights under the law to all students. No one outside the institution shall have access to nor will the institution disclose any information, other than directory information, from a student’s education records without the written consent of the student, except to personnel within the institution, to officials of other institutions in which the student seeks to enroll, to persons or organizations providing student financial aid, to accrediting agencies carrying out their accreditation function, to persons in compliance with judicial order and to persons in an emergency in order to protect the health or safety of students or other persons. All these exceptions are permitted under the Act. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, information classified as &quot;Directory Information&quot; may be released to the general public without the consent of the student. The following is designated as directory information: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Student’s name, a local and home address, telephone number, major or minor, enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time), classification, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees, honors, and awards received, and most recent educational agencies or institutions attended. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students reserve the right to suppress any information from being released without their consent. Any student wishing to withhold any or all of this information should notify the Office of the Registrar. The university assumes that failure on the part of any student to specifically request the withholding of directory information indicates individual approval for disclosure. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Standards of Campus Conduct </H3>

<P>Members of the university community assume full responsibility for compliance with Texas laws and for proper self-conduct. In addition to behaving according to the ordinary conventions of adult society, members of the university community are bound by university rules and regulations conducive to creating a positive campus atmosphere and general academic well-being. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The code for student conduct is set forth in the Student Handbook. Specific attention is given there to rules addressing academic misconduct, hazing, sexual harassment and substance abuse, including alcohol abuse and the illicit use of drugs. Grievance procedures and guidelines for sanctions are outlined. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Standards of conduct for university employees are detailed in the Texas A&amp;M University System Policies. The Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville Faculty Handbook sets forth rules and regulations governing academic freedom and responsibility, sexual harassment, substance abuse, conflict of interests, research policies and other professional issues. Grievance procedures are set forth there. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In order to create a healthy and pleasant atmosphere, a campus-wide smoking policy designates only certain areas for smoking. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Hazing </H3>

<P>The Education Code defines hazing as “any intentional, knowing, or reckless act occurring on or off the campus of an educational institution, by one person or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in an organization.” The statute contains a list of conduct which constitutes hazing. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Hazing is a criminal violation under Texas law. A person may be found guilty of criminal conduct for hazing, encouraging hazing, permitting hazing, or having knowledge of the planning of hazing incidents and failing to report in writing his/her knowledge to the Dean of Students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Both failing to report hazing and hazing that does not result in serious bodily injury are Class B misdemeanors. Hazing that results in serious bodily injury is a Class A misdemeanor. Hazing resulting in a death is a state jail felony. An organization found guilty of hazing may be fined $5,000 to $10,000 or, for incidents causing personal injury or property damage, an amount double the loss or expenses incurred because of the hazing incident. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>It is not a defense to prosecution that the person hazed consented to the hazing activity. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Any person reporting a specific hazing incident to the Dean of Students or other appropriate institutional official is immune from civil and criminal liability unless the report is in bad faith or malicious. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>This state law does not limit or affect the right of an educational institution’s right to enforce its own penalties against hazing. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act, Public Law 101-542  </H3>

<H3>and Amendments Thereto </H3>

<P>This act is designed to provide prospective or entering students with information concerning (a) campus security policies and procedures, security services available, campus crime statistics and alcohol and drug use policies; (b) completion or graduation rate of full time certification-seeking or degree-seeking undergraduate students; and (c) graduation rate of student athletes who receive athletic scholarships. This information is contained in an annual report available in the library. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3>University Assessment </H3>

<P>Students enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville are required to participate in university assessment activities for the evaluation and improvement of university programs and curricula. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2612">HISTORY </H3>

<P>Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville had its origin as a public institution in the teacher college movement that swept Texas in the early 1900s. Shortly after the institution's inception as South Texas State Teachers College in 1925, its role was expanded to embrace a wider array of programs typically authorized for comprehensive universities, including the graduate program that began in 1935. The historical expansion of the university's role was reflected in the change of its name to Texas College of Arts and Industries in 1929 and to Texas A&amp;I University in 1967. The university became the nucleus of the University System of South Texas in 1972. In 1989, the university, along with other USST institutions, became a member of The Texas A&amp;M University System. The System Board of Regents in 1993 voted to change the name of the university to Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, effective September 1, 1993. </P>

<P>The Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requires students to be assessed in reading, writing and mathematical skills before enrolling in a Texas public college or university. Texas Education Code, section 51.3334, provides institutions of higher education a means of determining students’ readiness to enroll in freshman-level course work. Students are required to complete the TSI Assessment before enrolling at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville unless they meet one of the exemptions listed below.  </P>

<H1> </H1>

<P>The TSI Assessment is an examination designed to help determine if you are ready for college-level course work in the general areas of reading, writing and mathematics. This examination will also help determine what type of course or intervention will best meet your needs to help you become better prepared for college-level course work if you are not ready. Based on how you perform, you may either be enrolled in a college-level course that matches your skill level or be placed in the appropriate transitional course to improve your skills and prepare you for success in college level courses.  </P>

<H1> </H1>

<P>Exemptions </P>

<P>Students are exempt from the TSIA if a qualifying score has been made on the ACT, the SAT, specified STAAR EOC exams or the 11th grade exit-level TAKS. It is the responsibility of the student to provide official ACT, SAT, STAAR EOC or TAKS scores to Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville to qualify for an exemption before enrollment in college level courses. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>These exemptions are effective for five years from the date of testing. Students enrolling for the first time in a Texas public institution of higher education after those periods have elapsed must be treated as though they had not been tested. </P>

<P>5. When processing transfer credit for repeated courses, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville will take the most recent credit and grade, not the highest grade earned.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>6. The university permits students to transfer lower division (freshman and sophomore) courses from a community college as long as the coursework is academic in nature, not technical or workforce. No work taken at a community college can be transferred as an upper-division (junior or senior) level course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>7. The transfer course work grade point average is based on all transferred course and will be counted toward the overall GPA. Transfer grades cannot be used to raise institutional the grade point average at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>9. Courses that are vocational or technical in nature are not automatically accepted by Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. These courses must be approved by the appropriate academic departments and resubmitted to the Office of Admission for articulation. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>10. Students who are seeking a second baccalaureate degree are not automatically articulated. The student will need to meet with an academic advisor to determine which previous courses will be applicable in the student’s new degree plan. These courses must be approved by the appropriate academic departments and resubmitted to the Office of Admissions for articulation.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>11. International students must submit course descriptions with an official copy of their transcript. All international transfer course work will be articulated with no Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville equivalencies until course descriptions are provided and have been reviewed by either the Office of Admissions or by the academic departments. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Resolution of Transfer Disputes for Lower Division Courses </P>

<P>The following procedures shall be followed by Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville in the resolution of credit transfer disputes involving lower division courses: </P>

<P>1. If Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville does not accept course credit earned by a student at another institution of higher education, the university shall give written notice to the student and to the sending institution that transfer of the course credit is denied. Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville shall provide written notice of the </P>

<P>reasons for denying credit for a particular course or set of courses at the request of the sending institution. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>2. A student who receives notice as specified in number one above may dispute the denial of credit by contacting a designated official at either the sending institution or Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>3. Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, the sending institution and the student shall attempt to resolve the transfer of the course credit in accordance with Coordinating Board rules and guidelines. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>4. If the transfer dispute is not resolved to the satisfaction of the student or the sending institution within 45 days after the date the student received written notice of denial, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville shall notify the Commissioner of its denial and the reasons for the denial. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>5. The Commissioner of Higher Education or the Commissioner’s designee shall make the final determination about a dispute concerning the transfer of course credit and give written notice of the determination to the involved student and institutions. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Coordinating Board shall collect data on the types of transfer disputes that are reported and the disposition of each case that is considered by the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>If Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville has cause to believe that a course being presented by a student for transfer from another school is not of an acceptable level of quality, it will first contact the sending institution and attempt to resolve the problem. In the event that Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville and the sending institution are unable to come to a satisfactory resolution, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville may notify the Commissioner of Higher Education, who may investigate the course. If its quality is found to be unacceptable, the Board may discontinue funding for the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Undergraduate Students Subject to Senate Bill (SB) 1231 </P>

<P>Undergraduate students who completed a high school program, or the equivalent, and entered a Texas public institution of higher education for the first time on or after the fall semester of 2007 are subject to the requirements of SB 1231. Students subject to SB 1231 will be permitted only six (6) non-punitive drops during their undergraduate studies. Therefore, drops falling under SB 1231 annotated on official transcripts received from other colleges and/or universities, will be transferred to Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville for the purpose of maintaining the number of drops accumulated by the student. For additional information on drops subject to SB 1231, refer to the section of the catalog titled “Academic Regulations” under the sub-title of “Dropping a Course.” </P>

<P>Entrance Examination Credit – Transfer Students </P>

<P>Credit by examination secured through another college or university must be clearly indicated on the official transcript from that institution for credit to be accepted by Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. </P>

<P>Credit by Local Examination (Departmental) </P>

<P>Local examinations are available to students for organized class courses not designated for credit by the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). The student should contact the department in which the course is offered for information about the examinations. Eligibility will be determined by the department and will be dependent on a student’s particular qualifications due to study or work experience. The department will also determine whether or not the student’s performance on the local examination merits university credit and whether any further requirements for credit are to be met. Students may not receive credit by local examination in a subject in which they have already received a grade in the same course or in a more advanced course. No fee is charged for these examinations. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_3839">REQUIRED ON CAMPUS RESIDENCE POLICY </H3>

<P>The University requires all students with less than 30 completed semester credits hours or under 20 years of age to reside in university residence halls. Students under the required residence policy, however, will be automatically exempted if they live with a parent or legal guardian within a 40 mile radius of Kingsville which will be verified by the Department of Housing and Residence Life. All other students wishing to reside off campus who live outside the 40 mile radius must complete a Housing Exception Request Form which is available at the Department of University Housing and Residence Life or the 
<Link>University Housing and Residence Life</Link>
 webpage. Submission of an exemption form does not guarantee approval, so students are advised not to make housing arrangements until approval is received. Registered students required to live on campus who do not receive approval for exemptions will be billed for on-campus housing. A specific residence hall and meal plan can be requested by completing the housing agreement/deposit application form which can be obtained from the Department of University Housing and Residence Life, MSC 108, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX 78363-8202; 361-593-3419, or go online at

All commuting students (outside the 40 mile radius) must complete this form. A committee will review the request. Simply turning in a request does not mean an exemption is given. Applicants should not make other housing arrangements until they are notified in writing as to the status of their request. Exceptions to the policy may be granted to those students who are (a) living with a parent or legal guardian and commuting within 40 miles, (b) transferring in with 30 or more acceptable credit hours, (c) 20 years of age or older or (d) married. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Meal Plans </H4>

<P>Students who are under 21 years old are required to purchase a meal plan in addition to housing. During the fall and spring semesters, the student may select from a variety of meal plans on the housing agreement. Any changes to the student's initial meal plan selection must be made within seven days after check-in. (This does not include the block plan, which cannot be changed.) Requests for changes to the meal plan are handled at the University Housing and Residence Life Office. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Room and Meal Plan Payment Procedures </H4>

<P>Upon being assigned to a residence hall, the room and meal plan fees will be added to the student's account (which includes tuition and other student fees). It shall be the student's responsibility to make prompt arrangements for payment by one of the following two options: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>PAYMENT OPTION 1. The student may choose to pay and/or use financial aid to pay student account balance in FULL on or before the payment due date. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>PAYMENT OPTION 2. TUITION, FEES, ROOM &amp; BOARD - FALL and SPRING SEMESTERS ONLY (excluding mini intersession terms) – The student may choose to pay balance on the Installment Payment Option by the payment deadline. TAMUK offers a Deferred (4–Payment) Installment Plan that covers the cost of all outstanding tuition, room, board, and mandatory fees. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> The student can enroll for this option online through 
<Link>MoneyConnect</Link>
 and $100.00 down payment must be made at the time of enrollment in the plan. The student can pay and/or use financial aid award to cover the first installment of 25% of balance. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The non–refundable payment plan setup fee of $30.00 will be calculated into the installment payments. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The student will pay the remaining installment payments on or before the due date specified for each installment. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> A $15.00 late fee will be assessed for each installment payment that is late. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> INSTALLMENT AMOUNTS MAY CHANGE over time to account for any new charges, payments, or financial aid adjustments. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>If a scheduled payment becomes delinquent, notification will be forwarded to stop meals. The student will still be responsible for paying for meals that have been stopped because of non-payment. Students who have their meals stopped for non-payment are encouraged to meet with the business services manager, whose office is located in the Business Office at College Hall, to discuss payment arrangements. No credit will be allowed for nights not spent in the hall or meals missed. Meal plans are not transferrable from one person to another. Students who purchase a meal plan will be issued meal privileges on their student ID card. It is the student's responsibility to promptly make arrangements to pay room and board fees in order to obtain and maintain meal privileges. Failure to obtain an ID card/meal privileges does not exempt the student from the obligation to pay the full amount for room and board fees due. The student will be charged a replacement fee for the loss of the ID card. Replacements are </P>

<P>obtained at the ID Center located in the Memorial Student Union. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A &quot;hold&quot; will be placed on the student's records for delinquent payments. A student will not receive his/her grades, transcript or be allowed to register for future semesters until such hold is cleared. Non-payment will also result in loss of future housing privileges. Failure to pay account in full by the end of each contracted semester or session will result in the student’s account being referred to the University Collection Department to begin collection procedures. The student will be responsible for all collection fees and enforcement, in addition to the original student account balance due that is sent to collections.  </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Miscellaneous Housing Information </H4>

<P>a. The university will make all residence hall and room assignments and reassignments as necessary. The university cannot guarantee assignment to a particular hall or a specific roommate. First priority of residence hall assignment is given to students who have resided in university housing the preceding long semester and contracted to return to the halls. Second priority of residence hall assignment is given to new applicants based on the date that the housing agreement, housing deposit and bacterial meningitis record are received in the University Housing and Residence Life Office. All applicants must be accepted to the university before a housing assignment can be made. In the event that hall reservations reach capacity, overflow students will be assigned to temporary assignments in other areas as long as space is available. Students will be reassigned as regular housing becomes available. Not placing a deposit or submitting incomplete agreement forms can also delay the assignment process. </P>

<P>b. All students are initially assigned a roommate at the beginning of the semester. Should a student’s roommate not check-in to the hall, that student will be requested to consolidate with another person.  </P>

<P>c. Specific roommate requests are accommodated as possible. Students with roommate preferences must mutually request each other on the housing agreement, request the same hall and include their prospective roommate’s ID number. Both agreements must also be received by the May 1 priority deadline (for fall semester assignment). Not being admitted to the university, not placing a deposit or submitting incomplete forms can also delay assignment. </P>

<P>d. Due to space limitations, private rooms cannot be reserved in advance. Private rooms are assigned from a waiting list after the 12th class day if space is available. There is an additional charge for a private room. The university does reserve the right to place two people in a room that has been assigned as a private room if space is needed. A refund will be made to the person who has paid for a private room (prorated from date the private room is relinquished). </P>

<P>e. In signing a housing agreement, the student agrees to reside in that room for the time specified in the agreement. This agreement is personal and may not be transferred or assigned to another person. If the student fails to enroll at the university, advance notice of residence hall cancellation must be provided in writing. Under the terms of the housing agreement, moving from the residence hall without an authorized release from the agreement will not terminate the student's fiscal obligations. </P>

<P>f. Residence halls and dining halls are closed between the fall and spring semesters and during university holidays. The residence hall calendar and the housing and food service contract show the specific times that the residence halls are open and when meals are served. During periods when classes are not in session, housing may be made available if the university determines there is sufficient demand. In such instances, additional rent may be required of each student desiring accommodations. The amount will be determined by the University Housing and Residence Life Office, and students will be consolidated into one hall. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Residence Hall Association </H4>

<P>Composed of student representatives from each residence hall, the association represents the entire residence hall population. Its purpose is to provide effective lines of communication among the house councils and with the University Housing and Residence Life Office; to coordinate the programs, activities and government of the individual residence halls; to arbitrate any disputes pertaining to house council operating procedures; and to recommend policies affecting all residence halls. Each residence hall has its own house council. </P>

<P>Financial Obligations </P>

<P>Students are expected to pay all financial obligations to the university when due. Failure to meet such obligations will result in a student's record being placed on a hold status and may result in the student not being able to receive official transcripts or enroll for another semester. Failure to make room and board payments on time may result in the loss of meal privileges and eviction from the university residence hall. In all cases, the student will be duly notified and given a reasonable length of time to clear the obligation before the enforcement of disciplinary action. If account is not paid when due, the institution has the right to forward past due accounts to a collection agency and referral to the State of Texas to be put on State Hold. The student will be responsible for any and collection costs necessary for the collection of any amounts not paid when due. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students receiving university sponsored financial aid are expected to pay all financial obligations owed the university at the time they receive the financial aid. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>NOTE: Census day of the semester is the day that all tuition and mandatory fees must be paid in full. If all tuition and mandatory fees are not paid in full, a class or classes will be dropped for non-payment. The census day of the long semesters (fall and spring) is the 12th class day. The census day for the summer terms is the 4th class day. Census day is a drop day, if all tuition and mandatory fees are not paid in full. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Mandatory Tuition and Fees </P>

<P>Students who do not pay mandatory tuition and fees in full by established deadlines will be dropped from one or more classes, according to the unpaid balance due. Students who establish and make the required initial payment of the installment payment plan will not be dropped. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Installment Payment of Tuition and Fees </P>

<P>Students selecting the installment payment plan may pay tuition and fees in four payments. There is a $15/$30 processing fee for choosing the installment payment plan. Students who select a installment payment plan need to be absolutely sure of all the classes/expenses, as only one plan is allowed. They are subject to the following provisions: </P>

<P>a. Students receiving university sponsored financial aid equal to or greater than their tuition and fees must pay in one payment. All financial aid funds received after selection of deferred payment plan will be applied to account balance until paid in full. </P>

<P>b. A late payment penalty of $25/$50 will be assessed for each installment payment not made on or before the due date. </P>

<P>c. A student who fails to make full payment of tuition and fees, including any incidental fees, by the due date may be prohibited from registering for classes and receiving future financial aid until full payment is made. A student who fails to pay in full prior to the end of the semester may be denied access to see semester grades. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Charge Card Privilege </P>

<P>Students may pay tuition and fees, including room and board, with an American Express, MasterCard, Discover and VISA. Credit card payments may be made over the web using the Money Connect PayPath service and are charged a 2% (or $3.00 minimum) convenience fee. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Concurrent Enrollment at Another Public Institution of Higher Education </P>

<P>Students must present to the Registrar on the day they register evidence of previous enrollment for the same semester, number of hours enrolled and receipt showing the total tuition and other registration fees paid at another public institution in order to be eligible for provisions of Senate Bill 250 &quot;Tuition Limit in Cases of Concurrent Enrollment.&quot; </P>

<H1> </H1>

<P>Dual Enrollment </P>

<P>(High School Students Enrolled at an Institution of Higher Education) </P>

<P>Students from contracted high schools dually enrolled at perspective high school and at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville are assessed at a reduced fee structure. This Dual Enrolled student fee table is available through the Dual Enrollment Office, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Returned Item Policy </P>

<P>When a bank returns an unpaid item (i.e., check, credit card, money order), for any reason, which has been submitted to the university, the following procedure will apply: </P>

<P>1. The Business Office will mail a notification by certified mail within 3 business days to the individual who submitted the returned item to the university. This notice will indicate the amount of the item, the $30 returned item charge, and the reason the item was rejected by the student’s bank or credit card company. The individual is given 10 days from receipt of notification to clear the returned item using cash, cashier's check or money order. Only payment in full will be accepted. The university will not accept a personal check or a credit card in payment for a returned item. In the event the certified mail is unaccepted and returned to the university, the university will attempt to deliver the notification to the student through one of his/her classes. The university will also attempt to reach the individual by phone. The individual will be given 10 days from this contact to clear the item. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>2. A registration and transcript hold will be placed on the individual's record. After an individual has one items returned to the university, checks will no longer be accepted as payment for that individual. If an individual stops payment on a check presented to the university, the university reserves the right to refuse acceptance of future checks for payment of university charges. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>3. In those instances where the returned check and charge have not been redeemed after two notification attempts, the university may take the check to the district attorney (or county attorney) and file a complaint with that office. Any further action on the matter will follow the legal process as prescribed by the respective attorney’s office.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Resident vs. Nonresident Student Status </P>

<P>All students attending Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville who are nonresidents of Texas will be charged additional tuition in accordance with state law. The responsibility of registering under the proper residence is placed upon the student. If there is any possible question of the right to legal residence in Texas under state law and university rules, the student must raise the question with the Office of Admission and have such question settled prior to registration. There can be no change of residence unless authorized by the Registrar. Students must pay the correct fee at the beginning of each semester or term for which they register. An attempt on the part of a nonresident to evade the nonresident fee may lead to expulsion from the university. Legal resident information forms to assist students in determining their proper legal status are available in the Registrar's Office. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Military Residence </P>

<P>Military persons stationed in Texas who wish to avail themselves or their dependents of military residence provisions of state law must submit during their first semester of enrollment in which they will be using the waiver program, a statement from an appropriately authorized officer in the service certifying that they (or a parent) will be assigned to duty in Texas on the census date of the term they plan to enroll, and that they are not in Texas only to attend training with Texas units. Such persons shall pay resident tuition so long as they reside continuously in Texas or remain continuously enrolled in the same degree or certificate program (enrollment in summer semester is not required to remain continuously enrolled).  </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_5805">REFUND OF FEES </H3>

<P>The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (HEA98) represent a major shift in the return of Title IV Federal Financial Aid when a student withdraws from the university. The policy governs all federal grant and loan programs (Pell, SEOG, Direct Loans, Perkins and PLUS loans), but does not include the Federal Work-Study program. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In general, the law assumes that a student “earns” approved (verified) federal financial aid awards in proportion to the number of days in the term prior to the student’s complete withdrawal. If a student completely withdraws from school during a term, the school must calculate, according to a specific formula, the portion of the total scheduled financial assistance that the student has earned and is therefore entitled to retain, until the time that the student withdrew. If a student receives (or the university receives on the student’s behalf) more assistance than he/she earns, the unearned funds must be returned to the Department of Education or to the Federal Direct Loans or parent’s Federal PLUS loan lenders. If a student’s charges are less than the amount earned, and a refund is due, the student may be able to receive those additional funds. Students who have not completed the verification process are ineligible to receive any financial aid. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The portion of the federal grants and loans that the student is entitled to receive is calculated on a percentage basis by comparing the total number of days in the semester to the number of days that the student completed before he/she withdrew. The policy governs the earned and unearned portions of the student’s Federal Title IV Financial Aid only. It determines how much, if any, the student and/or the school may need to return. This policy does not affect the student’s charges. The university’s withdrawal policy will be used to determine the reduction, if any, in the student’s tuition and fee or room and board charges. The student is responsible for paying any outstanding charges to the university. </P>

<P>  </P>

<H4>Withdrawal Policy </H4>

<P>When a student withdraws from the university, he/she is authorized a refund of tuition and fees based on the date of the withdrawal and the number of weeks of the enrolled semester/term/session. The refund policy is based on legislative law found under the Texas Education Code, Chapter 54, Article 54.006. The code outlines the following refund policy: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>All Semesters/Terms/Sessions </P>

<P>Prior to the 1st Class Day, the refund percentage – 100% </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Semesters/terms of 10-weeks or Longer (i.e., Fall/Spring Semesters; 10-week Summer Term) </P>

<L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>a. 1st, 2nd and 3rd class day, the refund percentage - 80% </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>b. 4th, 5th and 6th class day, the refund percentage - 50% </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>c. after the 6th class day, the refund percentage – 0% </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Terms/Sessions of 5 weeks or Less (i.e., Fall/Spring or Summer Intersessions; 5-week Summer Session) </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody>a. 1st class day, the refund percentage - 80% </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>b. 2nd class day, the refund percentage - 50% </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody>c. after the 2nd class day, the refund percentage – 0% </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>The “first class day” is determined by the beginning of a semester, summer session or intersession. The “first class day” is not defined by individual courses. Please refer to the academic calendar for the first class day date. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The refund will be wholly returned to the student only if he/she did not receive financial assistance from Federal Title IV programs. A Return to Title IV calculation must be performed to determine if the student is eligible to retain any of the Federal funds received. 
<Link>Return of Title IV Funds Webpage</Link>
  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>If the student receives less Federal Student Aid than the amount earned, the university will make a disbursement of the earned aid that was not received (Post-withdrawal disbursement.) </P>

<P> </P>

<P>If it is determined that the university must return to the Title IV programs monies in excess of any tuition and fees or room and board, the student will be responsible for those monies. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Any grant funds that the student is required to return to the federal programs are considered an overpayment. The student must either repay the amount in full to the university within 45 days of notification of the overpayment or make satisfactory payment arrangements with the Department of Education Collections that the student owes an overpayment. At that point, until the student pays the amount in full to the Department of Education or makes repayment arrangements with the Department of Education, the student will lose his/her eligibility to receive future federal financial aid at any institution. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Upon Dropping a Course or Courses </P>

<P>A 100% refund difference of applicable tuition and fees collected will be made for courses from which students drop (not withdraw) within the first 12 days of a semester or within the first four days of a summer term. There will be no refunds for courses dropped after the first 12 days of a semester or after the first four days of a summer term. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Refund Policies </P>

<P>The following policies are used for refunds: </P>

<P>a. Refunds are processed through Bank Mobile. Students receive their My One Card in the mail. Once </P>

<P>received, student must activate the card to select their refund preference; they will have three options to select from (1) direct deposit to their personal bank account (2) direct deposit to their One Account (3) paper check. </P>

<P>b. Any financial obligations owed the university will be deducted from the refund before it is processed. </P>

<P>c. Fees paid for correspondence and/or extension courses will not be refunded after the student receives the lesson outline in correspondence courses or after the first meeting of the extension center course. </P>

<P>d. No refunds will be made on visitors' fees. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>More information may be viewed by following the Tuition and Fees Quicklink on the TAMU-K Homepage. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_5879">TUITION REBATE FOR CERTAIN UNDERGRADUATES </H3>

<P>The purpose of this program is to provide tuition rebates that will provide a financial incentive for students to prepare for university studies while completing their high school work, avail themselves of academic counseling, make early career decisions and complete their baccalaureate studies with as few courses outside the degree plan as possible. Minimizing the number of courses taken by students results in financial savings to students, parents and the state. To be eligible for rebates under this program, a student must: (1) have enrolled for the first time in an institution of higher education in the fall 1997 semester or later; (2) request a rebate for course work related to a first baccalaureate degree received from a general academic teaching institution, (3) have been a resident of Texas as set forth under Chapter 21, Subchapter B of this title (relating to Determining Residence Status) and have been entitled to pay resident tuition at all times while pursuing the degree, (4) if enrolled for the first time in fall 2005 or later, graduate within four calendar years for a four-year degree or within five calendar years for a five-year degree if the degree is in architecture, engineering or any other program determined by the Board to require more than four years to complete, and (5) have attempted no more than three hours in excess of the minimum number of semester credit hours required to complete the degree under the catalog under which they were graduated. Hours attempted include transfer credit, course credit earned exclusively by examination (except that, for the purposes of this program, only the number of semester credit hours earned exclusively by examination in excess of nine semester credit hours is treated as hours attempted), courses that are dropped after the official census date, optional internship and cooperative education courses and repeated courses. For students concurrently earning a baccalaureate degree and a Texas teaching certificate, required teacher education courses shall not be counted to the extent that they are over and above the free electives allowed in the baccalaureate degree program. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The rebate for eligible students is a maximum of $1,000. Eligibility requirements and application forms are available in the offices of the academic deans. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_5987">SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS POLICY </H3>

<P>To receive funds administered by the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville (TAMUK), students must be making measurable academic progress toward completion of an eligible degree program. Accordingly, the following Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy for students who receive financial aid is in place. These standards require that a student make academic progress during all periods of enrollment, including periods when a student did not receive financial aid. TAMUK will be consistent in applying the SAP policies to full &amp; part time, independent and dependent students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students enrolling at TAMUK for the first time (including transfers) are initially considered to be meeting SAP. The measurement of academic progress will be made at the conclusion of the first enrollment term and will include all acceptable transfer credits that the TAMUK academic record contains. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Minimum Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards </H4>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Maintain required cumulative Grade Point Average(GPA) based on matrix below, or higher (a qualitative measure) and </LBody>

<LBody> Successfully complete at least 67% of the cumulative attempted credit hours (a quantitative measure) and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Make positive progress toward a program of study within 150 percent of the average published program length (credits needed to earn a degree). </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<H4>Financial Aid Eligibility Statuses </H4>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Eligible – Student is meeting the minimum academic standards or has no academic history. Fully Eligible for financial aid. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Warning – Student did not meet the minimum standards for cumulative GPA and/or 67% completion rate in the previous evaluation period. Student is still Eligible for financial aid, but must reach all minimum standards by the end of the next evaluation period to maintain eligibility. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Ineligible – Student has failed to meet minimum standards for cumulative GPA and/or 67% completion rate SAP at the end of the evaluation period. Student is Ineligible for financial aid.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Timeframe – Student has attempted more than 150% of the published program length toward a Bachelor’s Degree. For example, majors requiring 120 credit hours will be allowed up to 180 attempted hours (120 x 1.5 = 180).  </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>How is the 67% completion rate calculated? The calculation is made as follows: earned credit hours divided by attempted credit hours = completion rate (result will be rounded to closest whole number).  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Successful completion of a class is defined as earning a grade of A, B, C, D, or Pass (plus and minus grades may be attached to letter grades) and will be used to determine cumulative GPA, Completion Rate and Timeframe. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Non-Passing Grades: Unsuccessful grades of E, F, W, WD, WF, WP, NG, X or I will be used in determining completion rate and timeframe. Letter grades of E and F are used toward the completion rate and cumulative GPA. Courses with grades of S are included as both hours attempted and earned but will not factor into the GPA. In the case of X and I grades, students are responsible for notifying the OSFA if these grades changes so that SAP can be recalculated. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Withdrawals: All institutional withdrawals are factored into the completion rate and the maximum timeframe. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>When is Academic Progress Evaluated? A student’s satisfactory academic progress will be evaluated at the end of each semester (Fall, Spring and Summer). Students will not be eligible for federal funding during this time if in an ineligible SAP status.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>New Financial Aid Students with prior academic history: TAMUK students with prior academic history will be evaluated at the time they apply for financial aid. They will receive one of three financial aid statuses. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Eligible – Student is meeting the minimum academic standards or has no academic history. Fully Eligible for financial aid. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Warning – Student is below minimum standards in his/her previous academic history. Student is still Eligible for financial aid, but must reach the minimum standards at the end of the next evaluation period to maintain eligibility. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Maximum Timeframe – Student has attempted more than 150% of the published program length toward a Bachelor’s Degree. For example, majors requiring 120 credit hours will be allowed up to 180 attempted hours (120 x 1.5 = 180). Student is Ineligible for financial aid. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Transfer Students and Transfer credit hours: Students transferring to TAMUK are required to have all prior college transcripts evaluated for transfer credits. All credit hours accepted by TAMUK will be used to determine 67% completion rate and maximum timeframe of 150%. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Repeat Courses: Students repeating courses, for the first time only, can receive aid for that repeated course. All repeat courses will be used in determining completion rate and timeframe. Actual letter grades are included in the cumulative GPA. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Audited Credit Hours: Courses taken on an audit basis are not counted when determining the completion percentage or for purposes of determining your cumulative GPA. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Second Degree/Double Majors: Undergraduate students seeking second degrees and students with double majors are monitored like any other students under this policy. If the OSFA determines that the student will exceed maximum timeframe or when the students exceed the maximum timeframe allowed for their respective programs, the student will not be eligible for additional aid.  Students can appeal for additional time as outlined below. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Likewise, when determining eligibility for graduate and doctoral students who complete one graduate degree program at TAMUK and begin another graduate degree program, hours from the prior degree are calculated toward maximum time frame. If the OSFA determines that the student will exceed maximum timeframe or when the students exceed the maximum timeframe allowed for their respective programs, the student will not be eligible for additional aid. Students can appeal for additional time as outlined below. If the appeal is approved, the hours from the prior graduate degree will be removed from the maximum timeframe calculation. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>How to Re-establish Eligibility?  </H4>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> A student must bring his/her GPA and completion rate up to the minimum standards of the required cumulative GPA, and 67% completion rate. A student will be Ineligible for financial aid and cannot be reimbursed during this time. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Mitigating Circumstances: If a student has experienced mitigating circumstances (illness, family illness, change of major) during the most recent evaluation period, they may submit an Appeal to reinstate financial aid eligibility. A deadline for appeal submission will be published each semester. Appeals received after the deadline will not be reviewed until the next semester. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>The student must explain, in the appeal, what has changed that will now allow them to meet the SAP requirements. The student must also submit supporting documentation with the appeal. The following may be considered acceptable documentation to support reason for appeal: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Statement from physician or health professional reflecting condition, dates of occurrence, treatment and resolution </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Copy of death certificate, obituary or statement from physician </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Other documentation that support circumstances and resolution </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Appeals that are incomplete, and/or lack supporting documentation are not reviewed and the student is notified. If the request is granted, the student will be placed on one of two Financial Aid Eligibility Statuses: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Probation – The student is expected to improve to minimum standards by the end of the next evaluation period. The student is Eligible for financial aid, but must meet minimum standards by the next evaluation period. A student cannot be on probation for two consecutive semesters. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Academic Plan – The student cannot be expected to improve to minimum standards by the next evaluation period. The student and TAMUK have agreed to an academic plan to allow the student to meet minimum standards within a fixed number of evaluation periods. The student is fully Eligible for financial aid as long as they are strictly following the academic plan. If at any time the student stops following the plan and they are not meeting minimum standards they will become Ineligible for financial aid. If a student meets minimum standards at any time while on an academic plan their Financial Aid Eligibility Status will be updated to Eligible. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6100">GRANTS </H3>

<P>Various grant programs are funded by the federal and state governments, the university or a combination of these agencies. Grant awards may be limited due to availability of funds. Grants DO NOT have to be repaid. General requirements for grant programs stipulate that the student must be in good standing (a 2.0 overall grade point average), must be maintaining academic satisfactory progress, must not be in default on any loan made from a student loan fund at any institution and must not owe a refund on any grant previously received. </P>

<P> </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Federal Pell Grant: The Pell Grant is a federal program designed to provide financial assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The amount of the grant is based on the computed expected family contribution, the level of funding and the cost of education. Students enrolled for less than full-time will receive a reduced grant award. Pell Grant eligibility is limited to undergraduate students. Eligibility must be re-established each year by completing the FAFSA. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG): FSEOG provides grants to students who demonstrate the greatest financial need. Eligible students must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. who are accepted for admission or are enrolled at least half-time as undergraduate students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Aid for Dependent Children (AFDC-TANF) Grant: Exemption program provides an exemption from the payment of tuition and fees for up to one year for eligible college students. </P>

<P>Texas Excellence Access and Success (TEXAS) Grant Program: This program was established to provide need-based grants to eligible persons to enable them to attend an institution of higher education. Students who have completed the recommended or distinguished high school curriculum may be eligible for this program. More information is available at 
<Link>College of Texans Webpage</Link>
.  </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>INSTITUTIONAL GRANTS </H4>

<P> </P>

<P>TASFA </P>

<P>As specified by Senate Bill 1528, state law permits students that are neither US citizens, nor permanent residents to be classified as Texas residents for admissions and financial aid purposes, thus making them eligible for state aid. Since funding is limited, not all eligible students who apply will be awarded State Grants. We encourage all students to apply and complete their financial aid paperwork as soon as possible in order to maximize their chances of receiving an award. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6133">LOANS </H3>

<H4>General Requirements </H4>

<P>The Office of Student Financial Aid administers a number of loan programs for students whose needs cannot be fulfilled in any other manner. The university participates in several low-interest, long-term loans sponsored by the federal and state governments. Applicants for all loans must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as part of the application process. Instructions for completing and submitting the FAFSA are included with the form. The loans are administered in adherence with accepted business practices in an effort to provide borrowers with an educational experience in personal finances as well as to ensure the continuance of existing loan funds through prompt repayment. Loan funds administered by the university vary somewhat in qualifications required, amounts that may be borrowed and terms of repayment. Specific details concerning each loan fund, including the rights and responsibilities of a borrower and the repayment schedule, may be obtained from the Office of Student Financial Aid. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The personnel in the Office of Student Financial Aid are available as financial advisers to all students whether or not they are qualified to borrow from one of the university's student loan funds. Through interviews and realistic </P>

<P>examination of expenses and income, students often discover that borrowing is only one of the possible solutions to financial problems. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>General requirements stipulate that the student must be accepted for enrollment or, if a continuing student, must be maintaining satisfactory academic progress, must not be in default on any loan made from a student loan fund at any institution, must not owe a refund on any grant previously received and must attend a Loan Entrance Counseling session before receiving the first disbursement and must attend a Loan Exit Counseling session whenever the student’s enrollment status falls below half-time, the student withdraws or graduates from the university. Loan funds will not be disbursed until a student is registered for at least half-time status. Late registration will result in delayed financial aid disbursement. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Federal Direct Student Loan Program (Subsidized/Unsubsidized) </H4>

<P>The Federal Direct Loan is designed to assist students who are maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress toward a degree. Federal Direct Loans are a major form of self-help aid. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>There are two types of Student Loans: Subsidized and Unsubsidized. Subsidized loans are when the government pays the interest during the time in which the student is attending school. Unsubsidized loans are when the student is responsible for paying the interest for the duration of his or her college career. The student also has the option to have the interest capitalized or added on to the total amount of the loan. The payments on the Federal Direct loans must be started six months after you graduate, leave school or drop below half-time enrollment. Currently, the interest rate is 4.45% on these loans. Listed below are the maximum annual loan limits by grade level. However, students may not qualify for the entire yearly loan amount.  </P>

<H4>Federal PLUS Program for Parent Borrowers </H4>

<P>A Federal PLUS (Parent loan for undergraduate dependent students) is a low interest rate loan for parent borrowers to assist them in paying for a dependent student's education. The amount a parent may borrow will be determined by the Office of Student Financial Aid. The loan may not exceed the student’s cost of education minus other financial aid awarded. Presently, the interest rate is 7.00% </P>

<P> </P>

<P>As with the Unsubsidized Stafford loan, there are no interest benefits paid by the federal government. The parent borrower must submit for a credit check as part of the application process. More information on PLUS and other federal loans is available at 
<Link>StudentLoans.gov</Link>
. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Texas B-On-Time Loan Program </H4>

<P>The Texas B-On-Time Loan Program was established by the 78th Texas Legislature. The purpose of this state-funded program is to provide non-need based, non-interest bearing loans to eligible Texas students to attend </P>

<P>colleges/universities in Texas. At this time, the State has authorized Renewal Awards only. More information is available at: 
<Link>Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Student Loan Program</Link>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6264">RETURN OF FEDERAL TITLE IV FUNDS </H3>

<P>The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (HEA98) represent a major shift in the return of Title IV Federal Financial Aid when a student withdraws from the university. The policy governs all federal grant and loan programs (Pell, SEOG, Stafford Loans, Perkins and PLUS loans), but does not include the Federal Work-Study program. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In general, the law assumes that a student “earns” approved (verified) federal financial aid awards in proportion to the number of days in the term prior to the student’s complete withdrawal. If a student completely withdraws from school during a term, the school must calculate, according to a specific formula, the portion of the total scheduled financial assistance that the student has earned and is therefore entitled to retain, until the time that the student withdrew. If a student receives (or the university receives on the student’s behalf) more assistance than he/she earns, the unearned funds must be returned to the Department of Education or to the Federal Stafford or parent’s Federal PLUS loan lenders. If a student’s charges are less than the amount earned, and a refund is due, the student may be able to receive those additional funds. Students who have not completed the verification process are ineligible to receive any financial aid. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The portion of the federal grants and loans that the student is entitled to receive is calculated on a percentage basis by comparing the total number of days in the semester to the number of days that the student completed before he/she withdrew. The policy governs the earned and unearned portions of the student’s Federal Title IV Financial Aid only. It determines how much, if any, the student and/or the school may need to return. This policy does not affect the student’s charges. The university’s withdrawal policy will be used to determine the reduction, if any, in the student’s tuition and fee or room and board charges. The student is responsible for paying any outstanding charges to the university. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>If it is determined that funds must be returned to Title IV programs, funds will be returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan, Pell Grant, ACG Grant, SMART Grant and FSEOG Grant. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The refund will be returned to the student only if the student did not receive financial aid assistance from either Title IV programs or state programs. In the cases where the student did receive assistance from these programs, the refund will be returned to the programs in the following order: Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan, Pell Grant, FSEOG Grant, TPEG Grant, RPEG Grant, NPEG Grant and Texas Grant. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The student’s official withdrawal date will be determined by the university as: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> the date the student began the university’s withdrawal process. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> the midpoint of the semester if the student withdraws without notifying the university. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> the student’s last day of attendance at an academically-related activity as documented by the university. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>If the student receives less Federal Student Aid than the amount earned, the university will make a disbursement of the earned aid that was not received (Post-withdrawal disbursement.) </P>

<P> </P>

<P>If it is determined that the university must return to the Title IV programs monies in excess of any tuition and fees or room and board, the student will be responsible for those monies. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Any grant funds that the student is required to return to the federal programs are considered an overpayment. The student must either repay the amount in full to the university within 45 days of notification of the overpayment or make satisfactory payment arrangements with the Department of Education Collections that the student owes an overpayment. At that point, until the student pays the amount in full to the Department of Education or makes repayment arrangements with the Department of Education, the student will lose his/her eligibility to receive future federal financial aid at any institution. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6290">STUDENT EMPLOYMENT </H3>

<P>Student employment is available for students who want to supplement their educational resources through part-time employment; two types of services are offered. The Federal/State College Work-Study program is for those students who qualify for financial aid and is administered through the Office of Student Financial Aid. The Part-Time program is for students who do not qualify or apply for financial aid. The Part-Time program is administered through the Career Services Center. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Federal/State College Work-Study </H4>

<P>Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville receives allocations from the federal government and the State of Texas to provide employment opportunities on campus. Work-study students work anywhere between 12-15 hours per week depending on their awarded allocation. Students who request work study on their FAFSA and meet the established deadlines are given priority to receive the award. Students who are enrolled at least half-time status, are citizens or permanent residents of the United States, have demonstrated financial need, are maintaining satisfactory progress, are not in default on any student loan made through or approved by an institution and who do not owe a refund on any grant previously received are eligible to receive. When the semester term begins and during the school year, jobs are posted on the Career Services Center website (
<Link>javelinacareers.com</Link>
). Students will be able to register as a job seeker and search the available job postings to find work-study employment. Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville recommends that students secure a job which will compliment and reinforces their student's professional and personal maturity goals. Students must have been awarded and accepted the Work-Study award before being referred for an interview. Acceptance of the Work-Study award is not a promise of a job; it establishes eligibility.  Once students provide a copy of their financial aid award letter and meet the job requirements (if any), can apply for the job. At that time the department will contact the student for an interview. Continuation in the job depends on funds available and the student’s job performance. Previous work-study employment does not guarantee continued employment in the program.  </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Part-Time Student Employment </H4>

<P>The university offers part-time employment to a number of students in various offices and departments. Student employment on a part-time basis is limited to 19 hours per week. At this time, part-time employment is administered through the Career Services Center, where students register as a job seeker to be able to search for available jobs on/off campus. </P>

<H4>TAMUK Council for Undergraduate Research (TCUR) </H4>

<P>The TAMUK Council for Undergraduate Research (TCUR) is encouraging all TAMUK faculty and students to get involved in undergraduate research. Undergraduates who aid graduate students, work with a professor on his/her research, or perhaps are just interested in furthering their knowledge in a certain area are much more likely to finish their bachelor’s degree, go on to graduate school, and tend to have a better idea of what they want to do as a career. Freshmen and higher undergraduates are eligible, and are encouraged to apply in conjunction with faculty. Fifty thousand dollars have been allocated by the office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies for undergraduate research. The funds are to support undergraduate student wages, research material and supplies for the student to conduct the research. Proposals will be funded between $2,000 to $5,000 each, for approximately 10 to 15 grants total. Each undergraduate student will have to conduct a presentation, or poster, and each faculty mentor </P>

<P>will have to provide simple periodic status reports, and will need to submit a final report indicating how the TCUR project assisted the goal of undergraduate research. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6884">TEXAS SUCCESS INITIATIVE (TSI) </H3>

<P>The Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requires students to be assessed in reading, writing and mathematical skills before enrolling in a Texas public college or university. Texas Education Code, section 51.3062, provides institutions of higher education a means of determining students’ readiness to enroll in freshman-level course work. Students are required to complete one of four assessment tests before enrolling in course work at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville unless they meet one of the TSI exemptions explained under “Admission to the University” (TEXAS SUCCESS INITIATIVE (TSI). </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6887">ONLINE SERVICES </H3>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6892">ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT </H3>

<P>Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville places very strong emphasis on developing a one-to-one individual academic advisory relationship between each student and an adviser. This relationship is essential when a student participates in the registration process. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic colleges and their departments have specific academic advising procedures, requirements and schedules for students’ degree plans and for procedures to register for classes. A student’s adviser is normally in the department offering the field in which the student is majoring. The Office of the Registrar will assist a student who needs help in locating an appropriate academic adviser. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A student who remains unsure of a major would profit by discussing this with an academic adviser or by going to the university counseling center or the Career Services Center to receive career counseling and testing or other appropriate referral. Some vocational aptitude tests and tests designed to help a student select a major are available. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Timely Completion of Developmental Education Course Work </H4>

<P>Timely completion of required developmental education courses will improve the likelihood of student success. Therefore,  </P>

<L>
<L>
<L>
<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. new freshmen at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville (defined as having completed 0-30 semester hours prior to their first full-time enrollment) must complete all developmental education requirements within their first 45 completed hours on our campus; </LBody>

</LI>
</L>
</L>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>Failure to achieve the freshmen or transfer student standard will result in the student being placed on scholastic probation, regardless of grade point average. At this point, the student will have one semester to achieve Texas Success Initiative (TSI) compliance. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Continued failure in achieving TSI compliance as described above will result in the student being placed on enforced withdrawal (or its equivalent), regardless of grade point average. The students may return to the university after completing required developmental education elsewhere or the student may request approval for readmission from the Associate Vice President for Student Success. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Degree Plan </H4>

<P>DegreeWorks is an automated system available online to assist a student in planning and monitoring progress towards degree completion. Information concerning DegreeWorks is available from your academic advisor, the Office of the Registrar, or on the Registrar’s website.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Requirements for degree completion are reflected in DegreeWorks which will serve as the official degree plan for all students. Exceptions: Upon initial registration at this institution, Student Athletes and Student Veterans will require a department chair signed copy of their degree plan to ensure compliance with Federal regulations.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Final degree requirements must be approved by the dean of the college in which the major is taken. All undergraduate degrees must conform to &quot;General Requirements for Graduation with a Baccalaureate Degree&quot; set forth in this catalog. The registrar will be the final authority for graduation requirements. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Course Listings </P>

<P>The term &quot;course&quot; means a definite unit of work in a subject. Courses are offered on a semester basis. University course offerings are listed in this catalog by college and by department or program within that college according to the following method: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Letter Code: A four letter code at the beginning identifies the department or program that offers the course. A list of these letter codes is provided just after the index to the catalog (last page). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Number Code: The four digit code distinguishes each course in that department or program and identifies the level at which it is offered. The first and second digits in the course number hold specific meanings. The first digit indicates the course level (1000 freshman; 2000 sophomore; 3000 junior; 4000 senior; 5000 graduate; 6000 doctoral) and the second digit indicates semester credit hours for the course. Courses numbered at the 1000 and 2000 level are lower division courses that are normally introductory in nature. Upper division courses numbered 3000 and 4000 are advanced undergraduate courses that normally require junior or senior standing and/or the completion of a preceding course or courses. Courses numbered 5000 and 6000 are open only to students with graduate standing. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Title: The identification code is followed by the course title. The identification code and a shortened form of the course title are used to list courses in the Class Schedule (available view the Blue and Gold Connection) each semester for registration purposes and on a student's permanent transcript. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Two-Year College Equivalency: Courses commonly taught at two year colleges in the State of Texas are identified immediately following the title of the equivalent course by a four-letter, four-number code in parentheses. When such an entry appears, the university accepts those courses as the equivalent. No work taken at a two year college can be transferred as an upper division course.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Credit Hours: The final information given on a course listing's entry line indicates the semester credit hours of the course. When the letter V appears, the course is offered for variable credit, to be determined at the time of registration. The two digits in parentheses following the semester credit hours are the number of hours of lecture and the number of hours of laboratory required each week respectively. When a course includes a recitation, three digits appear in parentheses following the semester credit hours indicating the number of hours of lecture, the number of hours of laboratory and the number of hours of recitation required each week respectively. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Course Description and Special Conditions: Below the entry line is a brief description of the course and a notice of any special restrictions for registration in the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_6941">REGISTRATION </H3>

<P>The university has a computer-assisted registration system. It is designed to provide individual academic advising between faculty or academic adviser and student. This gives students an opportunity to review their academic programs and select the specific sections of the courses desired for the next semester. For specific dates and information on registration, the student should consult the university website and/or the Academic Calendar. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Priority Registration </H4>

<P>Currently registered students will register for classes according to a priority registration schedule. The schedule will provide the time and date for registration. Students need to schedule an appointment with their academic or faculty adviser prior to registering for courses. The schedule will be posted on the Registrar’s website with information about the rules governing the process. New freshmen and transfer students will register during their university orientation session. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Web Registration </H4>

<P>The university has a computer-assisted registration system which allows students to register over the web. Web registration is available for eligible students only and requires academic advising prior to registration. Specific registration dates, instructions and information are provided on the university website (Academic Calendar). </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Normal Load </H4>

<P>The normal load for a semester is usually one-eighth of the total number of credit hours required for the degree toward which the student is working. That load is normally 15-18 hours per fall and spring semesters. The normal load for a summer session is two courses (6-7 semester hours). The normal load for an intersession is 3 hours. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A full-time student, defined as one carrying a minimum of 12 semester hours, is expected to register each semester for a normal load of work. A student registered for fewer than 12 semester hours is considered a part-time student. Only hours for which a student is currently enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville can be used toward certification of enrollment. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A freshman may not register for more than the normal load during the first semester. Any succeeding semester or term, a student may register for more than the normal load (an &quot;overload&quot;) only on the approval of the respective college dean. If a student is concurrently enrolled at other institutions of higher education in the same semester, the total course load at all institutions is to be considered in applying these policies. It is the responsibility of the student to inform his/her dean of any concurrent enrollments.  </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Prerequisites </H4>

<P>No student shall be allowed any credits for a course before credit in its prerequisite is obtained, except on the written approval of the chair of the department offering the course and the dean of the college in which the student is majoring. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>All students must have successfully completed ENGL 1301 and ENGL 1302 during their first 75 semester hours of credit. No additional 3000- or 4000-level courses may be taken or transferred in until this requirement is met. </P>

<H4>Schedule Changes </H4>

<P>Adding a Course </P>

<P>A course may be added by a student using the online registration system without approval of university officials, as long as departmental approval is not required. (See regulation for “Normal Load.”) It is highly recommended that a student consult with his/her academic adviser before attempting to add a course. After the online registration system is closed, written permission is required from the academic adviser and professor (of the course being added) to add the course. These requests must be processed by the Office of the Registrar. The student may only add classes during the time specified in the official academic calendar. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Dropping a Course </P>

<P>A course may be dropped by a student without approval from his/her academic adviser or other university official. However, athletes must have approval from the athletic adviser and one other athletic administrator to insure eligibility requirements. Transitional (developmental) courses can only be dropped with the approval of the </P>

<P>Associate Vice President for Student Success or his/her representative. It is highly recommended that a student consult his/her academic adviser before dropping a course because of the impact on financial aid, graduation, etc. After the online registration system is closed, all drops must be processed by the Office of the Registrar. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A student who, by dropping a course, becomes registered for less than 12 hours will be reclassified as a part-time student. </P>

<P>Senate Bill 1231 (Texas Education Code Section 51.907) and the University’s Drop Policy for Undergraduate Students  </P>

<P>Senate Bill 1231, passed during the 80th Texas Legislative Session, limits the number of drops that certain undergraduate students may accrue without a punitive grade. Undergraduate students who completed a high school or equivalent program and enrolled in an institution of higher education prior to the Fall Semester of 2007 are exempt from the requirements of Senate Bill 1231. Undergraduate students who complete a high school program, or the equivalent, and enter a Texas public institution of higher education for the first time on or after the Fall Semester of 2007 are subject to the requirements of Senate Bill 1231. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Drop Policy for Undergraduate Students Exempt from Senate Bill 1231 </H4>

<P>A student exempt from Senate Bill 1231 may drop a course with an automatic grade of Q if the drop is processed on or before the date to receive an automatic grade of Q (approximately the 10th week of the semester or the 60% point of the summer session) as indicated on the official university academic calendar, regardless of the student’s academic performance in the course at the time of the drop. The grade of Q is a non-punitive grade that will not affect the student’s grade point average. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A course may not be dropped after the automatic Q date (set by the university’s academic calendar). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Drop Policy for Undergraduate Students Subject to Senate Bill 1231 </P>

<P>Beginning with the 2007-2008 Academic Year, undergraduate students subject to Senate Bill 1231 will be permitted only six (6) non-punitive drops during their undergraduate studies. Non-punitive grades included in the maximum number of drops will be identified on the transcript with a grade of QI. Once a student has accumulated 6 (six) QI grades, the only grade that may be awarded for a dropped course is a grade of QF (which is an F for GPA purposes), regardless of the student’s academic standing in the class. Drops processed while withdrawing from the university will not be included in the maximum number of non-punitive drops.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A course may not be dropped after the automatic Q date (set by the university’s academic calendar). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Drops Policy for Course with Concurrent or Corequisite Enrollment Requirements for Undergraduate Students Subject to Senate Bill 1231  </P>

<P>In determining the number of non-punitive course drops by a student subject to Senate Bill 1231 when concurrent or corequisite courses are involved, the following regulations will apply. (Concurrent and corequisite courses are courses with different course numbers such has a lecture course with its own course number and a lab course with a different course number that must be taken at the same time.)  </P>

<L>
<L>
<L>
<L>
<LI>
<LBody>1. If the student is required to drop both courses when dropping either course, then both course drops will be calculated as one drop.* </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</L>
</L>
</L>

<P> </P>

<P>2. If the student is not required to drop both courses at the same time, then each course will be treated as a separate drop.*  </P>

<P>___________ </P>

<P>*Each drop will be subject to the maximum number of non-punitive drops allowable under Senate Bill 1231. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Exceptions to the Maximum Number of Non-Punitive Drops for Undergraduates Subject to Senate Bill 1231  </P>

<P>A non-exempt student may drop a course with a non-punitive grade that is not included in the maximum number of non-punitive drops if extenuating circumstances are involved. In such cases, a grade of QE will be posted as the student’s official grade for the course. A grade of QE may only be awarded if one or more of the following </P>

<P>circumstances are involved and the drop is approved by the appropriate college dean.  </P>

<P>1. The student has a severe illness or other debilitating condition that affects the student’s ability to satisfactorily complete the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>2. The student is responsible for the care of a sick, injured or needy person that affects the student’s ability to satisfactorily complete the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>3. The student has suffered the death of a person who is considered to be a member of the student’s family or person who is otherwise considered to have a sufficiently close relationship to the student* that the person’s death is considered to be a showing of good cause for dropping the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>4. The student is a member or dependent of a member of the Texas National Guard or the armed forces of the United States and the active military service is considered to be a showing of good cause for dropping the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>5. The student has a change of work schedule that is beyond the control of the student and the change affects the student’s ability to complete the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>6. The student has other extenuating circumstances that prevent the completion of the course and the circumstances are approved by the dean of the college. </P>

<P>___________ </P>

<P>*A “member of the student’s family” is defined to be the student’s father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, first cousin, step-parent, or step-sibling; a “person who is otherwise considered to have a sufficiently close relationship to the student” is defined to include any other relative within the third degree of consanguinity, plus close friends, including but not limited to roommates, house mates, classmates, or other persons identified by the student for approval by the institution, on a case-by-case basis. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Appeals to the Maximum Number of Non-Punitive Drops for Undergraduates Subject to Senate Bill 1231 </P>

<P>A student who wishes to request an exemption to the maximum number of non-punitive drops must submit a letter of appeal with appropriate documentation to the dean of the college within five (5) business days of the drop. If the student cannot provide the supporting documentation within five business days of the drop, the student must request an extension with the dean of the college within five business days of the drop.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Transitional (Developmental) Courses and the 6-Drop Policy </P>

<P>Transitional courses are exempt from the 6-drop policy. A student may drop a transitional course with the approval of the Associate Vice President for Student Success or his/her representative. If the course is dropped on or before the date to receive an automatic grade of Q the student will receive grade of Q, regardless of the student’s academic performance in the course at the time of the drop. The grade of Q is a non-punitive grade that will not affect the student’s grade point average. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A course may not be dropped after the automatic Q date (set by the university’s academic calendar). </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Withdrawal from the University </H4>

<P>If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from the university, the student must contact the Office of the Registrar and process a written withdrawal form. A student exempt from Senate Bill 1231 who is withdrawing (dropping all active courses) from the university prior to the automatic Q date (see the academic calendar for exact date) of the semester/term will receive an automatic grade of Q in each course being dropped at the time of the withdrawal. In the case of a student subject to Senate Bill 1231, a grade of QE will be awarded in each course. Students may not withdraw from the university after the automatic Q date (set by the university academic calendar). (Also see regulations entitled &quot;Refund of Fees.&quot;) </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Withdrawal of Students Ordered to Military Active Duty </P>

<P>If a current student is called to active duty, and the duty will exceed 25% of the total number of class meetings or contact hour equivalents, the student has several options for courses in which he/she is enrolled. The student must provide a copy of military orders to the Office of the Registrar to receive one of the following: 1) full refund of tuition and fees paid by the student for the semester in which the student withdraws; 2) with instructor approval, </P>

<P>incomplete grade(s) for the semester in which the student withdraws; or 3) with instructor approval, assignment of an appropriate final grade(s) or credit(s). Upon the student’s request, pre-registered classes will be dropped. If the student returns prior to the beginning of a semester he/she will be reinstated into this institution. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>If a current student, including one enrolled in distance education, self-paced and other asynchronous courses, is called to active military service for a period of time not to exceed 25% of the total number of class meetings or contact hour equivalents, and chooses not to withdraw from the university, the student shall be excused from attending classes or engaging in other required activities, including examinations, during that period of time. The student shall be allowed to complete (an) assignment(s) or take (an) examination(s) within a reasonable time after the absence. The student’s course work previously completed will be retained and the student will be able to complete the course without prejudice and under the same course requirements that were in effect when the student enrolled in the course. If the course requirements are not completed by the end of the semester in which the student is called to active military service, the grade of I will be awarded. Normal academic regulations relating to grades of I will apply, as well as normal grade dispute resolution processes, in the event of such disputes. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Excess Undergraduate Credit Hours (45 Hour Rule vs 30 Hour Rule) </H4>

<P>Affected Students </P>

<P>Effective with students initially enrolled in the fall 1999 semester and subsequent terms, hours attempted by a resident undergraduate student that exceed more than 45 hours of the number of hours required for completion of the degree plan in which the student is enrolled, students attending Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville will be assessed $100 per credit hour for repeated and/or excessive hours. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Effective with students initially enrolling in the fall 2006 semester and subsequent terms, hours attempted by a resident undergraduate student that exceed more than 30 hours of the number of hours required for completion of the degree program in which the student is enrolled, students attending Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville will be assessed $100 per credit hour for repeated and/or excessive hours. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>For the purpose of excess hours, resident undergraduate student includes a nonresident student who is permitted to pay resident tuition. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Limitation on Formula Funding for the 45-Hour Rule* </P>

<P>Funding of excess undergraduate semester credit hours is limited as follows: </P>

<P>(a) Institutions may not submit for formula funding semester credit hours attempted by an undergraduate student who has previously attempted 45 or more semester credit hours beyond the minimum number of hours required for completion of the baccalaureate degree program in which the student is enrolled. </P>

<P>(b) An undergraduate student at a four-year institution who is not enrolled in a degree program is considered to be enrolled in a degree program requiring a minimum of 120 semester credit hours. </P>

<P>(c) Students who enroll on a temporary basis in a Texas public institution of higher education, and are not seeking a degree or Level-Two certificate, and are also enrolled in a private or independent institution of higher education or an out-of-state institution of higher education are considered to be enrolled in a degree program requiring a minimum of 120 semester credit hours. </P>

<P>(d) For the purposes of the undergraduate limit, an undergraduate student who has entered into a master’s or professional degree program without first completing an undergraduate degree is considered to no longer be an undergraduate student after having completed the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree or all of the course work normally taken during the first four years of undergraduate course work in the student’s degree program. </P>

<P>(e) The following types of semester credit hours are exempt and do not count toward the limit: </P>

<P>(1) semester credit hours earned by the student before receiving a baccalaureate degree that has been previously awarded to the student; </P>

<P>(2) semester credit hours earned through examination or similar method without registering for a course;  </P>

<P>(3) semester credit hours from remedial and developmental courses, technical courses, workforce education courses or other courses that would not generate academic credit that could be applied to a baccalaureate degree and is within the 18-hour limit at the institution; </P>

<P>(4) semester credit hours earned by the student at a private institution or an out-of-state institution; </P>

<P>(5) any semester credit hours not eligible for formula funding; and </P>

<P>(6) credit earned prior to high school graduation. </P>

<P>*Limitation on formula funding for the 30-hour rule -- same as the 45-hour rule. </P>

<P>An institution of higher education may charge a higher tuition rate, not to exceed the rate charged to nonresident undergraduate students, to an undergraduate student whose hours can no longer be submitted for formula funding because of the funding limit defined in section (a) above. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Concurrent Enrollment </P>

<P>Another University: </P>

<P>Credits earned by a student at another institution while also enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville will be transferred to Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville only if the student has received prior written approval from the college dean. Prior approval will be granted consistent with the university's normal load regulations. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Home Institution: </P>

<P>Concurrent enrollment, by an undergraduate with senior status, to enroll in a graduate course may be allowed only in the final year in which the undergraduate student is completing all undergraduate requirements for graduation to receive a bachelor’s degree. In such concurrent enrollment, the student must not enroll in excess of a total of 15 SCH in a fall/spring semester and no more than 6 SCH in a summer term. The graduate course(s) can be used to satisfy either the baccalaureate degree or the master’s degree requirements. Once a graduate course is used towards a baccalaureate degree, it cannot be used to satisfy graduate degree requirements. In addition, the student is limited to a maximum of nine (9) SCH of 5XXX courses. The student must have an overall minimum GPA of 2.60 or better. The concurrent enrollment form must be submitted to the Graduate Office with approved signatures, transcripts, and registration form on or before census class day of a semester or summer term.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Visiting a Course (Auditing a Course) </P>

<P>Any person may request permission of the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs to visit a course. Individual instruction courses are not open to visitors. Visitors do not have the privilege of submitting papers, taking part in class discussions or participating in laboratory or field work. Visitors pay fees according to the published credit hour fee schedule, except that no additional fee will be required of a full-time student. A visitor's name will not be entered on the class rolls or permanent records. The notice of approval of a request to visit a course, properly receipted after fees are paid, will serve as a permit to attend a class. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Course Attendance by Senior Citizens </P>

<P>A senior citizen (age 65 or older) may visit courses offered by this university without payment of a fee if space is available. Laboratory courses or individual instruction courses cannot be opened to visitors. Visitors do not have the privilege of submitting papers, taking part in class discussions or participating in laboratories or field work. The names of visitors will not be entered on the class rolls or permanent records. The visiting of courses by senior citizens will be subject to restrictions as may be determined by the chief administrative officer or designated representative on campus. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_7077">CLASS POLICIES </H3>

<P>A student has the right to expect competent, well-organized instruction for the full number of clock hours allotted for a course; to sufficient written assignments, graded fairly and with reasonable promptness to show the student's academic standing in the course at least before mid-semester; to have ample opportunity to confer with the instructor at published office hours and to review graded written work; to freedom from ridicule, discrimination, harassment or accusations in the presence of other students or faculty members; and to an avenue for appealing to higher academic authority in case of alleged unfairness by an instructor. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Cheating and Plagiarism </P>

<P>Students are expected to do their own course work. Simple cases of first offense cheating or plagiarism by an individual student may be handled by the instructor after consultation with the department chair. When the evidence is indisputable, the usual penalty is a grade of F on the particular paper or in the course. The student is usually confronted with the evidence in private and advised of the penalty to be assessed. The evidence will be retained for at least one full year. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>For more serious cases, such as those involving repeated offenses, conspiracy with other students or the theft and selling of examination questions, a report should be made by the instructor via the department chair and dean of the </P>

<P>college to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs for disciplinary action. Expulsion from the university is a normal penalty for such offenses. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Class Attendance  </P>

<P>A vital part of every student's education is regular attendance of class meetings. Every faculty member is encouraged to keep a current attendance record on all students. Any absences tend to lower the quality of a student's work in a course, and frequent or persistent absences may preclude a passing grade or cause a student to be dropped from one or more courses upon the request of a faculty member to the Registrar’s Office through appropriate channels. Courses will be officially dropped on the day the request is received by the Registrar’s Office (as long as the request is received no later than 5 p.m. on the last day to drop with an automatic Q (set by the university academic calendar). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Absences for Religious Holy Days </P>

<P>The university will allow students who are absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time before or after the absence. The student should notify each faculty member of this proposed absence as early in the semester as possible. The instructor may appropriately respond if a student fails to complete the assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the absence.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>&quot;Dead Week and Study Day&quot; </P>

<P>To support the learning environment, the university will adhere to a four school day period of student study before the first scheduled final examinations each term. During this time, no required quizzes, tests or examinations (except for make-up tests) shall be administered. The latter does not preclude the introduction of new material in class or the administering of laboratory final examinations, nor does it create any implication that class attendance is not expected during this period. The day before final examinations are scheduled to begin will be designated as a study day. No classes will be held on this day to allow preparation time for students and faculty. Scheduling of other university events or functions that involve students is discouraged and should be limited during this period. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_7099">GRADES </H3>

<P>Grades, with numerical values corresponding to these letters, are recorded as follows: </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A Excellent, 90-100. </P>

<P>B Good, 80-89. </P>

<P>C Average, 70-79. </P>

<P>D Passing, 60-69. </P>

<P>F Failure, below 60. </P>

<P>CR/NC Credit/Non-credit: used for courses that do not meet the normal or traditional framework of course scheduling and do not lend themselves to letter grading.  </P>

<P>I Incomplete: given to a student who is passing but has not completed a term paper, examination or other required work. The instructor and the student are required to complete the standard university contract form for each course in which the temporary grade of I has been assigned. A copy of the contract must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office by the instructor no later than the date grades are due. The grade of I will be used only to allow a student who has encountered some emergency such as illness or an accident an opportunity to complete the requirements for a course. A grade of I reverts to a grade of F one year from the close of semester/term in which the grade was originally recorded if the course requirements have not been satisfied. Grade of an I will be assigned by the Office of the Registrar upon receipt of the I Contract. </P>

<P>Q Dropped: given when a student has officially dropped or withdrawn from the university before or on the date indicated on the official university academic calendar for an automatic Q, regardless of student's standing in class. </P>

<P>QE Dropped: given when a student impacted by SB1231 has officially dropped a course and extenuating circumstances are involved (refer to “Exceptions to the Maximum Number of Non-Punitive Drops for Undergraduates Subject to Senate Bill 1231.” Also applies to students impacted by SB1231 who officially withdraw from the university. </P>

<P>QF Dropped: given when a student impacted by SB1231 has officially dropped a course after the accumulation of six (6) QI grades regardless of the student’s academic standing in the class. </P>

<P>QI Dropped: given when a student impacted by SB1231 has officially dropped a course before or on the date indicated on the official university academic calendar for an automatic Q, regardless of student's standing in class. Students are allowed a total of six (6) drops during their entire undergraduate studies.  </P>

<P>S Satisfactory: used to report 5-week grades for 1000, 2000 and transitional developmental courses. </P>

<P>U Unsatisfactory: used to report 5-week grades for 1000, 2000 and transitional developmental courses. </P>

<P>X No grade posted by instructor: used to indicate that no grade was posted by the instructor teaching the course. Grade of X reverts to a grade of F at the end of the next semester.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Removing the Grade of I </P>

<P>The grade of I must be removed within the time specified by the instructor, not exceeding 12 months from the date the I was recorded. When the student completes the work in the course, the instructor submits a request for a grade change through the chair of the department and the college dean to the Registrar’s Office. The grade of I may be changed only to A, B, C, D or F. Should the instructor not submit a Request for a Grade Change, the I will become an F. Extension of time, when merited, may be granted by the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs after consultation with the dean of the college concerned. I grades must be completed prior to graduation. I grades not completed by the end of the semester in which the student is scheduled to graduate will turn into F's and will be calculated into the cumulative grade point average. Extensions must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office by the instructor. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students should not register again for a course for which they have received an I grade. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Removing the Grade of X </P>

<P>The grade of X must be removed by the end of the next semester or it will be changed to an F. The instructor must submit a Request for Grade Change to the Office of the Registrar and the X can only be changed to an A, B, C, D or F. The student should contact the instructor if a grade of X appears on his/her transcript. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Change of Grade </H4>

<P>After being reported to the Registrar, grades other than I or X may not be changed unless an error has been made by the instructor. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students should review their end of semester final grades closely to ensure their accuracy. If an error or discrepancy should occur, the student should contact the appropriate professor and/or the Office of the Registrar immediately for resolution. It is recommended that those changes occur no later than the beginning of the next semester. Under no circumstances will grades be changed after one calendar year. Under no circumstances will grades be changed after one calendar year.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Repetition of a Course </P>

<P>If a student repeats a course that may not be taken for additional credit, it is the policy of the university to count as part of a student's cumulative grade point average only the last grade received in the course, whether passing or failing, other than a grade of Q. However, for purposes of grade point average calculation on course work for graduation, grades stand as recorded unless the same course is repeated at this university. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Starting with 2015 Fall Semester, all new admits, including transfers, can only exclude a grade one time. Any courses taken for the third time, cannot be excluded and will be averaged in the student’s GPA. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who have received their first bachelor’s degree from this institution cannot repeat courses that were used to earn the first degree for purposes of grade point average calculation. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>It is the responsibility of the student, after repeating a course, to file a special request form in the Office of the Registrar, so that the adjustment in the grade point average, when applicable, can be entered on the permanent </P>

<P>record. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Repeated Grade Notation </P>

<P>Repeated course(s) and grade(s) are not removed from the official or unofficial transcript. The repeated grade and grade points will be removed from the cumulative grade point average only. The repeated course will be identified with the letter E next to the quality points on the transcript. Repeating a course after graduation will not change your graduation grade point average. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_7145">ACADEMIC STANDING </H3>

<P>Classification of Students </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Freshman: fewer than 30 semester hours of credit. </P>

<P>Grade Point Average (GPA) </P>

<P>The grade point average accumulated on the permanent record of a student at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville will be based on course and grade points earned by a student on work taken at this university. Transfer courses will be accepted as credit only. Such credit may be used for fulfilling degree requirements and graduation requirements. (For information on specific college admission, certification and graduation requirements, refer to the appropriate section of this catalog.) </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A student's grade average on this university's work is expressed in grade points. Each semester hour of A counts four points, B three points, C two points, D one point and F zero points. The cumulative, or overall, grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total quality POINTS earned by the total number of quality hours (GPA HRS). Transferred and credit only hours are not computed in the cumulative Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville grade point average. Passed Hours are credits where a passing grade was earned (including courses graded as credit (CR) only. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Grade Point Summary </P>

<P>All official and unofficial transcripts will include some of the following items (institution and transfer course work will be listed on separate lines under the TRANSCRIPT TOTALS): </P>

<P> Attempted Hours: all hours attempted whether passed or failed </P>

<P> Passed Hours: only the hours where a passing grade was received </P>

<P> Earned HRS: number of hours earned (does not include failing grades, excludes grades Q, QE or QI) </P>

<P> GPA HRS: hours used to compute GPA (including failing grades; does not include excluded grades Q, QE or QI) </P>

<P> Points: (Quality Points) grade points from the following grades: A, B, C, D &amp; F </P>

<P> GPA: POINTS divided by GPA HRS </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Honor Roll, Dean's List and President’s List </P>

<P>Full-time undergraduate students of highest academic rank will be honored each semester by the publication of their names on the President’s List, Dean's List or the Honor Roll List. The President’s List requires a grade point average of 4.00 on all work attempted for a particular semester, with a minimum of 15 semester undergraduate hours completed, exclusive of credit only (CR) courses. The Dean's List requires a grade point average of 3.65 on all work attempted for a particular semester, with a minimum of 13 semester undergraduate hours completed, exclusive of credit only (CR) courses. The Honor Roll requires a grade point average of 3.5 on all work attempted for a particular semester, with a minimum of 12 semester undergraduate hours, exclusive of credit only (CR) courses. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Minimum Grade Requirements </H4>

<P>The minimum grade point requirement for students who are considered to be making satisfactory academic progress is a 2.0 cumulative institution grade point average and a 2.0 GPA is required for graduation. All transfer students must have a cumulative 2.0 GPA to transfer into Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Extracurricular Good Academic Standing  </P>

<P>The university defines good academic standing as an institutional cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above. Student clubs, honors societies, student-athletes—in short, ALL extracurricular activities—may choose a GPA higher than 2.0 for its members to qualify as being in good academic standing. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A student is considered in good academic standing to participate in University extracurricular activities for the entire academic year if the student was in good academic standing at the beginning of the fall semester of the academic year in question. Students who were not in good academic standing at the beginning of the fall semester, but who have brought their institutional cumulative GPA up to 2.0 or greater by the end of the fall semester may ask to be recertified as in good academic standing for the remainder of the academic year in question. Students who were not certified in fall semester because their participation in extra-curricular activities began later in the academic year may ask to be certified at the time their activity begins. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Certification and recertification will be performed by the Office of the Registrar for student-athletes, and by club/organization advisors for students participating in extracurricular clubs/organizations recognized by the Office of Student Activities. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Scholastic Probation </P>

<P>Students will be placed on scholastic probation any time their cumulative institution grade point average at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville falls below 2.0. Such students are required to participate to the fullest in academic support programs and to seek academic advising. Students who have been placed on scholastic probation will be removed from such probation at the conclusion of the semester or summer term at this university when they have achieved a 2.0 cumulative institution grade point average. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Enforced Withdrawal </P>

<P>Students who have been placed on scholastic probation, and who fail to achieve the minimum cumulative institution grade point average during the next long semester, will be placed on enforced withdrawal. Students who have been placed on enforced withdrawal may return after an absence of one semester; however, students placed on enforced withdrawal for a third time may return only after an absence of one year. Students who have been placed on enforced withdrawal for a third time must obtain an approval letter from the appropriate college dean. In either case, the required absence period may be shortened or eliminated upon approval of the college dean and/or associate vice president for student success. Students who remain out for two or more years must submit a readmission application to the Office of Admissions. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students will start the above process by making an appointment with their academic adviser to complete the necessary form for approval to return to the university. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Removal of Enforced Withdrawal Status by Summer Study </P>

<P>Students placed on enforced withdrawal at the end of the spring semester are eligible to attend the subsequent summer session. If the student achieves a cumulative institution grade point average of 2.0 or higher at the conclusion of the summer terms, the enforced withdrawal status will be removed.  </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_7192">THE STUDENT'S PERMANENT RECORD </H3>

<P>Transcripts </P>

<P>Official transcripts of the student's academic record may be requested at no cost in writing from the Office of the Registrar or online. The student should provide his/her complete name as recorded while attending the university (or the name changed to after leaving the university), student identification number or last four digits of his/her social security number, date of birth, first and last enrollment, contact phone number, number of transcripts requesting (up to the maximum number allowed) and the address where the transcript(s) are to be mailed. All transcript requests must be signed by the student. Failure to sign the request will void the request and the request will not be processed. Transcript requests may be faxed or e-mailed but must have all required information and signature to be processed. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A student must provide identification at the Javelina Enrollment Services Center when picking up a copy of a transcript in person. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, and amendments thereto, states that </P>

<P>parents, spouse, legal guardian or others are not authorized to pick up transcripts of students unless written authorization by the student is provided. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Holds </P>

<P>All students, including continuing education students, should clear any holds they have on their records immediately. Failure to clear a hold causes delays and inconvenience when trying to obtain copies of transcripts through the mail or in person. Since a hold on the record may affect a student from obtaining/viewing grades at the end of the semester, students should be sure they do not have any holds before final examinations start. Students with a registration hold on their record will not be permitted to register.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Change of Name, Address or Social Security Number </P>

<P>Students who wish to change their name in the student information system (which will appear on their transcript and diploma) must provide original legal documentation of the change to the Office of the Registrar. Not advising the Office of the Registrar of a legal name change may cause transcript requests and registration problems. Social Security Number (SSN) must be changed by providing the original SSN card with the new/correct number. Students who change their address should notify the Office of the Registrar, Financial Aid Office and the Business Office. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Death of a Student </P>

<P>The death of a currently enrolled student should be reported to the Office of the Registrar immediately. After confirming the death, the Office of the Registrar notifies the appropriate faculty and academic dean, closes all student records and codes the student information system to block mailings to the deceased. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_7208">GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION WITH A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE </H2>

<P> </P>

<P>The university has established General Education requirements for all baccalaureate degrees. A general education results in the acquisition of a common body of essential knowledge and skills that together facilitate the development of students as individuals and as members of communities. Students are strongly advised to consult their individual degree plans and academic advisers for any specific requirements for their majors within the General Education curriculum. Students are also advised to consult the online catalog for any additions to the course offerings. Some courses are listed in two areas; a student may count such a course in either area, but not both.  </P>

<P>These year-round programs are geared towards students currently attending grades K-12th in a public or private institution. The Center provides afterschool and weekend programs that include Academic Tutoring and the STAAR Preparation programs that give one-on-one attention to the registered participants from trained Academic Tutors in the specific field or subject needing improvement. During the summer, the Center holds the annual “College for Kids” program which is a 3-week summer camp on the TAMUK campus. The camp allows participants to build a schedule from the selected academic and enhancement courses offered for their daily activates. The participants gain a feel of the college lifestyle as they changes classes around campus, engage with other participants on daily activities, and enjoy interactive presentations by different academic departments.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville places very strong emphasis on developing a one-to-one individual academic advisory relationship between each student and an advisor. Academic advising is a process of information exchange that empowers students to realize their maximum educational potential. The advising process is student-centered and will result in the student gaining a clearer understanding of himself/herself, and the experience of higher education. Center for Student Success personnel evaluate the academic background of incoming freshmen and assess student readiness for college course work. Advisors work with all undergraduate students to define and develop realistic goals, help students recognize their abilities and interests, identify any special needs and/or match students to available resources that may be required to aid in their journey to be successful. All students are encouraged to meet with their advisors on a regular basis to monitor their progress toward their educational and career goals. Advising provides a linkage between academic preparation and career goals and provides the foundation for students to pursue their educational and career goals. </P>

</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> The PAAC, located in Jernigan Library, Room 220, houses centralized academic support for students: </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Academic Tutoring – Tutors understand that students encounter the learning process with different degrees of strength and comfort; therefore, a collaborative approach guides our practice. Tutors and students engage in one-on-one and/or peer conversations about the subject area while sharing knowledge and granting authority to both the tutor and student. We recognize that differences in proficiency, linguistic and cultural background need to be taken into consideration when helping students to become efficient learners. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Supplemental Instruction (SI) provides a series of weekly review sessions for students taking historically difficult course. Each SI section is guided by an undergraduate SI leader, a peer mentor who has previously taken the course and has received training in note-taking, study skills and test-taking strategies.  </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody> Academic Career Literacy Students have the opportunity to meet with professional career experts and peer educators as often as needed. During these appointments, the student can expect to explore their strengths and passions in connection to the world-of-work. The exploration process begins with a questionnaire and a computer assessment. Students also have the opportunity to interview university professions and peer educators pursing their field of interest. In addition, they may participate in campus events, complete online research, or attend a class lecture in a prospective major to help narrow down their choice of study. After self-assessment, students explore options and decide on a major, identify resources that will help reach educational career goals, and are connected with information about scholarships and professional development opportunities.  </LBody>

<P>Department curriculum is designed to provide students with foundation knowledge in basic and applied Animal Science (ANSC), Range and Wildlife Management (RWSC) and Veterinary Technology (VETT). The department emphasizes development of creative thinking and communication skills that are crucial for success. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The curriculum balances presentation of theory in the classroom with hands-on experience in the field. The Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville Farm provides Animal Science majors experience in swine, beef and goat management. Wildlife majors have the opportunity to work and study on the South Pasture Wildlife Research Area, a facility dedicated to wildlife management and research just south of Kingsville, Texas. The faculty are involved in research that keeps them abreast of current thinking in the animal and wildlife sciences to provide students with up-to-date information. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The department assesses its program by administering comprehensive examinations to undergraduates when they enter the program and during their last semester before graduation. Also, the department chair interviews graduating seniors to determine their impressions on strengths, weaknesses and needs of the program. Results from these activities are used to continually update and improve undergraduate education. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students majoring in Range and Wildlife Management (RWSC) must have a minimum GPA of 2.5 within the College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Human Sciences in order to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree. Range and Wildlife Management students must receive a grade of C or better in College of AGNRHS courses and upper division (3000 and 4000 level) biology courses in order to graduate with a bachelor of science degree. Students majoring in Veterinary Technology (VETT) must receive a grade of C or better in all VETT courses. Failure to receive a C or better in any VETT course may result in immediate withdrawal from the Veterinary Technology program. Students would need to reapply to the program the following year. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Graduates from the department find employment with state and federal agencies or with ranches, farms and other private businesses. The undergraduate curriculum also prepares students for continued education at the master of science level. </P>

<P>The mission of the profession is to improve the quality of life for individuals, families and communities. The department prepares students for careers in business, Texas AgriLife Extension Service, dietetics, community nutrition and foodservice management, fashion merchandising, family and consumer sciences education, child care, elder care and family services. The major in human sciences has a strong liberal arts/general education foundation. The common body of knowledge that comprises human sciences is drawn from the conceptual areas of human nutrition, clothing, shelter, human development, relationships and resource management. Emphasis is placed upon the development of leadership, research, critical thinking and problem solving skills. The department is a member of the Family and Consumer Sciences Alliance and has an accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Undergraduate Programs Leading to the Bachelor of Science in Human Sciences </H4>

<P>The Department of Human Sciences offers the Bachelor of Science in Human Sciences degree with majors in Human Science and Human Nutrition. Students selecting the major in Human Sciences can select a concentration in Family and Consumer Sciences Education leading to Teacher Certification, Fashion Merchandising or Human Development and Family Studies. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Family and Consumer Sciences Education. The curriculum prepares students to meet the requirements for certification as family and consumer sciences teachers as well as for employment with the Texas AgriLife Extension Service and other education agencies. Demand for graduates in this major is high. Graduates also may be employed in business settings such as retail establishments, newspaper organizations and magazine publishing. Additional prescribed course work can be completed to support certification in early childhood education. The program requires knowledge of nutrition and foods; clothing, textiles and merchandising; human development and family studies; consumer economics and family resource management; housing and interiors; curriculum development; occupational programs; and classroom management. The Human Sciences Department is a member of the Family and Consumer Sciences Alliance. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Fashion Merchandising. Fashion Merchandising students are prepared for a variety of careers in retail management, fashion buying, visual merchandising, retail and wholesale sales, product development and merchandise coordination. Students are required to take specialized courses in retail buying, apparel construction, flat pattern, fashion illustration, apparel product development, promotional strategies and visual merchandising, textiles, historic costume, global issues, fashion entrepreneurship, residential analysis, and historic structures and interiors. Opportunities are provided for students to gain valuable hands-on experience through participation in field trips, interaction with industry representatives, class assignments designed to include community service, travel study and practicum. To enhance preparation for entering the fashion industry, students may elect to complete courses required for a minor in Business Administration or other related areas, such as Art. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Human Development and Family Studies. The need for quality child care and a growing elderly population have created an increasing demand for professionals educated in human development and family studies. The curriculum is flexible enough to plan a program that will prepare the student to work in a child care or elder care facility as a caregiver or administrator or in a child and family services agency as a counselor. The program provides a developmental approach to understanding human growth from prenatal development to old age. Study of the family </P>

<P>as a system and as the basic unit of society undergirds the curriculum. Concepts covered include marital adjustment, sexual relationships, prenatal development and birth of children, parenting, child care and development, aging and the life cycle of the family. A practicum is required. The Marc Cisneros Center for Young Children provides opportunities for students to gain experience in working with preschool age children and their parents in a closely supervised setting.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Human Nutrition. The major in Human Nutrition prepares students for careers in dietetics, food systems management and community nutrition. Students may find jobs in hospitals, community nutrition programs, wellness programs, school lunch programs, restaurants, hotels, catering establishments and a variety of management positions in the foodservice industry. Concepts studied include food principles, nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, experimental foods, community nutrition, quantity food preparation and food service management. The Human Nutrition program is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) accredited by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). This program is designed to meet the educational requirements for acceptance into an accredited dietetic internship program. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Didactic Program in Dietetics Verification Statement Policy </H4>

<P>A verification statement is required in order to apply to dietetic internship programs. To be eligible to receive a verification statement, students in the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 overall in required DPD courses and hold a baccalaureate degree. Receipt of a verification statement, alone, does not guarantee acceptance into an ACEND accredited dietetic internship as programs are highly competitive. Students who do not meet the grade point requirement for a verification statement, but satisfy graduation requirements, remain eligible to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Human Sciences. For more detailed information please see the 
<Link>Didactic Program in Dietetics Student Handbook</Link>
 available online.  </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Internships/Practica </H4>

<P>Most of the programs in the department require completion of an internship or practicum in a setting that enhances and expands the knowledge and skills gained through course work. Students who plan to take the exam to become a registered dietitian should apply for an internship in an Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) approved site following the completion of their degree. The department offers a fully accredited dietetic internship. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Grade Policy </H4>

<P>Students majoring or minoring in human sciences must make at least a C in every human sciences course taken toward their degree. </P>

<P>Marc Cisneros Center for Young Children. MSC 138. Extension 2219. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Marc Cisneros Center for Young Children is the laboratory in which students observe and gain practical experience working with young children and their parents. Several courses in the Department of Human Sciences require observation and/or participation at the Center. Students from other disciplines, such as early childhood education, psychology, speech communications and kinesiology, are also provided opportunities to observe and interact with young children.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Marc Cisneros Center for Young Children was established in 1941 and is housed on the corner of University Boulevard and Santa Gertrudis Avenue. It meets the needs of 60 children ages three months through five years. Fenced playgrounds provide a large assortment of play structures and equipment, shade and sun areas and open play space. Learning centers are provided in each room to stimulate and encourage exploration and discovery. The philosophy that young children learn through creative play is evident in planned activities that enhance the children's emotional, social, physical and cognitive development. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A highly qualified staff works with the children. The school's close proximity to campus and its high quality program make it especially attractive to the university community. Parents are encouraged to register their children early since there is a waiting list. Prospective parents are welcome to visit at any time.  </P>

<P>The Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute was established in 1981 by a grant from the Caesar Kleberg Foundation for Wildlife Conservation to enhance our understanding of wildlife conservation and management in South Texas and related environments. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The institute has embarked on many programs to help accomplish its goal. Focus is on developing four broad areas of research: (1) management of sensitive species and ecosystems; (2) understanding wildlife biology and ecology; (3) management strategies for enhancing wildlife habitat; and (4) wildlife diseases, parasitology and toxicology. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In the study and testing of native plants for future use by wildlife and livestock, the USDA/NRCS Kika de la Garza Plant Materials Center was established in 1981. The center is closely linked to the Institute through projects called South Texas Natives and Texas Native Seeds. Other centers that are under the umbrella of the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute include the Richard M. Kleberg, Jr. Center for Quail Research, the Meadows Center in Semi-arid Land Ecology and the Feline Research Center. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4 id="LinkTarget_13717">SOUTH PASTURE </H4>

<P>The South Pasture is a 250-acre property located approximately five miles south of the main campus. It is a research and demonstration area owned by the university and managed by the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute and the Department of Animal, Rangeland and Wildlife Sciences that exemplifies range and wildlife management techniques commonly used in southern Texas. It is used as a field laboratory for various wildlife and range courses in which students actively participate in plant collections, vegetation sampling, habitat management and wildlife surveys. South Pasture provides students with the opportunity to observe and apply theory learned in courses. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4 id="LinkTarget_13720">TIO AND JANELL KLEBERG WILDLIFE RESEARCH PARK </H4>

<P> </P>

<P>The Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville Citrus Center, which opened in 1948 to support the citrus industry, is located northeast of Weslaco in the subtropical Lower Rio Grande Valley, where the commercial citrus industry of Texas is located. The Citrus Center’s 60-acre main campus is situated on FM 1015 (International Blvd.), on the north side of I-2 (Expressway 83). There is also a 250-acre research farm 2 miles south of the Center, and a 50-acre farm is leased from Rio Farms in Monte Alto where the soils are more typical of the Valley. The orchards are used for research in all aspects of citriculture, while in the research laboratories cutting-edge technologies are used to benefit the citrus growers of Texas. While the Center is best known for the creation of the dark red grapefruits, it has also been the source of many other products and programs which have helped the growers, including new integrated pest and disease control strategies (both chemical and biological), improved disease detection methods, water saving methodologies, and new breeding techniques. The Center manages the state’s certified budwood program, and provides citrus nurseries pathogen-free budwood. It also houses a USDA-certified diagnostic laboratory dedicated to detect exotic diseases which could threaten the industry. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The research results are disseminated through publications, presentations to growers and other scientists, news media and grower consultations. The scientists cooperate with other researchers in Texas, as well as other states and countries, and the Center has hosted visiting scientists and students from around the world. </P>

<P>  </P>

<P>Faculty also teach classes and guide graduate students’ research projects, all of which are designed to help growers. Over 90 students, who increasingly come from families in the Valley, have graduated with masters and doctorate degrees, and have established successful careers. </P>

<P>The King Ranch Institute for Ranch Management was inaugurated in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the King Ranch in 2003. In keeping with their long history of leadership and philanthropy, the King Ranch and its family and friends endowed the King Ranch Institute for Ranch Management for its operation and in support of its students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The vision of the institute is to educate leaders who will make a positive difference in ranching and ensure that our hard earned heritage is not lost. Its mission is to teach graduate students using a multi-disciplinary, systems approach to ranch management, and provide the highest quality lectureships and symposia to stakeholders in the ranching industry. We serve the ranching industry by empowering graduate students and outreach attendees with skills that will enable them to strategically manage complex ranching operations and successfully lead our industry.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The program is designed for a higher level of study, and emphasizes the recruitment of mature and experienced students, who will be trained for the complexities of managing ranches. A system approach is used to provide students with a broad background in business, animal science, wildlife management and range management. The curriculum is enhanced with a series of lectureships on special topics such as the oil and gas industry, wildlife habitat management, law and current issues. An annual symposium with world class speakers is presented that will further students’ education and training. King Ranch and other large ranches are used as teaching laboratories. Each student is given the opportunity to spend extended time on two internships with cooperating ranches. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_13929">APPLIED ARTS AND SCIENCES (B.A.A.S. Program) </H3>

<P> </P>

<P>The purpose of the Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences (B.A.A.S.) is to offer students with formal training in a vocational-technical studies area the opportunity to obtain a baccalaureate degree without the significant loss of credits that normally occurs in pursuing a traditional degree. This program is especially appropriate for graduates of an Associate of Applied Science program. The degree is designed to afford both academic and professional depth to individuals who possess recognized competence in an occupational or technical field. It is designed to offer flexibility that will permit tailoring the program to the student's background and educational objectives. The B.A.A.S. is not available as an online degree.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Limitations of the B.A.A.S. Degree </P>

<P>The B.A.A.S. degree is not designed to accommodate students seeking teacher certification while completing the bachelor’s degree. Students who wish to teach in state of Texas should contact the College of Education and Human Performance for Certification requirements.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The B.A.A.S. degree is not intended to prepare students for graduate or professional school. Students who plan to apply to law school, medical school, or a graduate program in academic disciplines should consult with an advisor in the discipline of interest before applying for the B.A.A.S. program.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Degree Requirements </P>

<P>The student must complete a baccalaureate degree plan (120 semester hours minimum) consisting of 36 residence hours, plus transfer credit. </P>

<P>A. General Education and Electives (minimum 42 semester hours): The General Education component of 42 hours is made up of freshman and sophomore-level courses which meet each of the criteria identified by the university as important aspects of a general education as described under “General Requirements for Graduation with a Baccalaureate Degree” in an earlier section of this catalog. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>B. Area of Specialization (18-48 semester hours): Credits toward the area of specialization may be earned from junior or community colleges, vocational or technical schools, and armed forces schools whose work can be equated to vocational/technical schools. Courses will be transferred from these entities to TAMUK at the first-year (BAAS 1300) or second-year (BAAS 2300) level.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>C. Professional Development (30 semester hours): The courses taken in this area are to be chosen to provide academic depth and breadth to the area of specialization and, in addition, afford substantive developmental knowledge in the student's professional career goals. The component focuses on areas of learning directly related to upward mobility and further extends a student's knowledge, skill and expertise.

The social work program is committed to promoting professional social work values, ethics and practice in the development of social work knowledge and responsive social service delivery systems. In Texas and other states, jobs with the title of social worker can be filled only by individuals with a professional license to practice social work at the BSW, MSW, or clinical licensing level. </P>

<P>The department offers several programs designed to give the student an insight into the structure and applications of mathematics and statistics necessary for industrial or governmental employment, teaching or pursuit of an advanced degree in mathematics and statistics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The faculty members are committed to educating students in the scientific and engineering environment. Through mathematics courses, students will develop their logical reasoning, critical thinking, technical communication and computational skills. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The department serves students from other disciplines, students in the science, education, engineering and mathematics, as well as the community, by offering a wide range of interdisciplinary courses. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students are allowed to register for freshman mathematic and statistic courses appropriate to their high school mathematics preparations and/or entrance examination scores as determined by the department. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Undergraduate Certificate in SAS Programming and Data Analysis </H4>

<P>Admission Requirements </P>

<P>The certification is open to all degree-seeking undergraduate students as well as those registered as non-degree-seeking (transient) students. A student must be in good academic standing in pursuit of his or her current degree and may not be on academic probation of any kind. A student must have earned a grade of B or higher in a 1000-level introductory statistics course or its equivalent (must receive approval of the certificate director). The course offered at TAMU-K that meets this requirement includes STAT 1342. Students who have not taken a 1000-level statistics course or equivalent may enroll in one of two courses, STAT 4301 or STAT 4303, as a prerequisite to the certificate program. Students who have earned a grade of B or higher in STAT 4301 or STAT 4303 will also have that course counted toward one of the three elective courses for SAS certification, provided the instructor of these two courses also covers the corresponding SAS material appropriate for these courses. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Application Procedure </P>

<P>Students apply to the certification program via an online form accessible on the department’s website. The form is automatically sent to the program director no later than four weeks after the start of the last class in the certificate sequence. A student’s standing relative to the certificate requirements will be evaluated and, if the student is qualified, he or she will be sent specific instructions on required evaluation materials to complete certification. In case the student is not qualified or is deemed to be making insufficient progress toward the certificate, he or she will be notified accordingly. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Program of Studies </P>

<P>The undergraduate certificate requires 12 credit hours consisting of one 4000-level core course and three elective courses selected from the list below with a minimum of a B grade in each course. All elective courses are at the 4000 level and have a SAS component. Courses in the certificate program are shown below.

<P>The department serves three purposes: to provide training to qualified students for the music profession, to supply an area of artistic enrichment for nonmusic majors and to create a genuine musical influence on the entire university family. Students wishing to follow careers in professional teaching or performance should pursue the appropriate program. Students completing the degree with a major in music with teacher certification will qualify to receive the All-level Provisional Certificate, vocal or instrumental. This latter program will qualify successful candidates as teachers of music for all grades in Texas under certification regulations established by the Texas Education Agency. The department is an institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Department of Music Admissions </H4>

<P>In addition to being admitted to the University, all potential music majors (including transfer students) must schedule and perform an entrance audition and interview to be considered for admission to the Department of Music. Students should contact the applied music professor in their instrumental/vocal area to schedule the audition/interview. Acceptance to the university does not guarantee acceptance into the Department of Music. </P>

<P>The Department of Physics and Geosciences serves the needs of three types of students: those majoring in geology or physics and those minoring in geography, geology or physics; technical or pre-professional students; and students who take physics and geoscience courses out of interest or to satisfy science requirements. The department seeks to prepare students who are majoring in geology or physics minoring in geography, geology or physics to compete with graduates from other institutions for industrial and governmental positions, follow a career in science education or pursue a higher level degree. It does this through fundamental courses in the respective disciplines and through specialized programs in geographic information sciences (GIS), energy, hydrogeology, groundwater modeling, certification in GIS sciences, certification in Geophysics, and certification in nuclear power plant (NPP) operations. For students in technical areas, the department endeavors to provide the background necessary for success in their chosen profession. For non-technical majors, the department strives to enlighten students concerning some of the basic realities of our universe and to instill in them an appreciation of the methods of scientific inquiry and the impact of science on our modern world.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students majoring or minoring in the Department of Physics and Geosciences should plan the course work so that it will best support their career and educational goals. This should be done in consultation with their faculty adviser. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Department offers minors in Geography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Geology, Geophysics, and Physics. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The minor in GIS consists of five 4-SCH courses, three required and two chosen from among alternatives. The required courses are GEOG 2472, GEOG 4429 and GEOG 4435. The remaining two courses shall be selected from GEOG 3450, GEOG 3460, GEOG 4436 and GEOG 4441. Courses counted in this minor may not also be counted toward a minor in Geography. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Department offers an undergraduate level certification in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Students will receive the certificate upon completing all courses (C or better) stated in the course requirements. In order to get the certificate, students need to take four courses, three required and one chosen from among electives. The required course are GEOG 2472, GEOG 4429, and GEOG 4435. The elective shall be selected from the following: GEOG 3450, GEOG 3460, GEOG 4441, or any advanced GIS course offered within individual colleges that is approved by the University GIS Curriculum Committee and has GEOG 2472 or GEOG 4435 listed as a prerequisite.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Department of Physics and Geosciences offers an undergraduate Geophysics certificate program. The certificate in Geophysics consists of 15 credit hours in Geology and Geophysics. The required courses are GEOL 3370, GEOL 3431, 4375/4175 and GEOL 4441. Students will receive the certificate upon completing all required courses with a C or better.  </P>

<P>The Department of Psychology and Sociology is committed to the goals of a liberal education emphasizing human growth and intellectual development through an understanding of individual behavior, social interaction and cultural awareness. The various programs in the department are geared specifically toward the professional preparation of social scientists and practitioners in the areas of human development, gender and minority relations, families and children, Mexican American culture and folklore, U.S.-Mexico borderlands studies, abnormal and deviant behavior, counseling and criminology. Opportunities for undergraduate research and service learning are provided.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The department promotes critical analyses and creative approaches surrounding the well-being of South Texas. It provides a comprehensive level of quality instruction, research and community involvement. By doing so it supports the academic, research and service goals of the College of Arts and Sciences and the mission of the University. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The department offers majors and minors in Criminology, Psychology, Sociology; and minors in Anthropology, Mexican American Studies and Southwest Borderlands Studies. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>For the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, students are required to pass an exit exam before graduation. The exam is scored on a pass/fail basis. A score of 70% or higher is passing. Students will not be allowed to take the exam until the semester they expect to graduate. Students failing the exam will have the option of retaking the exam in the following semester or taking an essay style examination. The essay exam will be designed by the undergraduate psychology faculty to address those core areas needing remediation and must be completed prior to graduation. The essay exam is administered and evaluated by the undergraduate psychology faculty. The exam is graded on a pass/fail basis and students must receive a pass from a majority of the faculty in order to graduate. </P>

<P>The National Natural Toxins Research Center (NNTRC) at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville was established in 2002. The mission of the NNTRC is to provide global research, training and resources that will lead to the discovery of medically important toxins found in snake venoms. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The NNTRC is a unique animal and biological material resource center organized to support basic and translational research on venomous snakes and their venoms. The NNTRC is dedicated to the advancement in the understanding of the therapeutic value of venom molecules and the training of research scientists in the field of toxinology. The NNTRC has grown to become the only federally funded (NIH/ORIP) viper resource center in the U.S. providing high-quality venom and snake-related research materials to national and international biomedical and biological research programs. The NNTRC also is recognized for its elaborate John C. Perez Serpentarium with 4,383 square feet of space housing over 450 venomous snakes. The goal of the NNTRC is to provide snake venoms, purified venom components, cDNA clones, and recombinant venom proteins of the highest quality to support biomedical research. To achieve this goal, the NNTRC 1) operates as a resource center that provides high quality venom and products that support biological and biomedical research for National and International research programs, 2) develops and expands the collection of snakes, specialized services, education and outreach programs to support growth of venom-related research in the U.S., and 3) supports a state-of-the-art applied research program using high-throughput genomic, proteomic, recombinant DNA and screening technologies that will support an information-based approach to the discovery of snake venom components with potential therapeutic and/or diagnostic applications. </P>

<P>When the Texas Legislature enacted the original law providing for the South Texas Teachers College, which ultimately became Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, one of the primary purposes was to prepare an adequate number of students for teaching and administrative positions in South Texas. Since the beginning, the university has functioned in this capacity. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Mission </P>

<P>The College of Education and Human Performance prepares professionals for positions of responsibility and leadership in a global society. Faculty and staff are committed to enabling students to attain high academic, professional and ethical standards that promote student achievement and lifelong learning. The programs prepare students to be successful in their professional careers by integrating technology, valuing diversity and promoting authentic applications of knowledge. The College strives to offer the highest quality in teaching, research and service. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Conceptual Framework </P>

<P>We, the community of learners in the College of Education and Human Performance, demonstrate professional knowledge, skills and dispositions expected of leaders in our respective fields. We are sensitive to diversity and inclusive of all learners. We design and deliver engaging, research-based, technology-integrated curricula and promote lifelong learning. We strive to be ethical, reflective, compassionate and fair when interacting with all learners, colleagues and communities. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The College houses three departments: Department of Educational Leadership and Counseling, Department of Health and Kinesiology and Department of Teacher and Bilingual Education </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Department of Educational Leadership and Counseling offers the Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership. Master of Science degrees are offered in Guidance and Counseling, leading to certification as a School Counselor or a Licensed Professional Counselor; and in Educational Administration, leading to certification as a Principal or Superintendent. The Master of Science in Instructional Technology and the Master of Education in Adult Education prepare students for employment in both the public and private sector. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Department of Health and Kinesiology offers the Master of Science in Kinesiology where students may pursue a kinesiology generalist degree or emphasize their graduate studies in sport management/kinesiology pedagogy or health/exercise science. The Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology can prepare students for kinesiology-related careers in either a school setting or the public sector. Student select from emphases in EC-12 physical education (teacher certification), exercise science, exercise science/performance psychology, exercise science/pre-physical therapy, sport and leisure studies or sport business. </P>

<H1> </H1>

<P>The Department of Teacher and Bilingual Education offers a Doctor of Education in Bilingual Education, the oldest Bilingual doctorate in the United States, the Master of Science in Bilingual Education, Master of Science in Reading leading to certification as a Reading Specialist, a Master of Education in Special Education that may lead to </P>

<P>certification as an Educational Diagnostician and a Master of Education in Early Childhood Education. The Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies prepares candidates for Texas Teacher Certification in Core Subjects EC-6, and Core Subjects EC-6 with a Bilingual Supplemental endorsement; also for Social Studies, Science, Mathematics, and English Language/Arts and Reading in Grades 4-8; for Science and English Language Arts and Reading in grades 7-12; for Business and Finance in grades 6-12; and for certification in Technology Applications and Special Education grades EC-12. Candidates earning bachelor’s degrees in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business and Agriculture, Natural Resources and Human Sciences who want to become secondary level content teachers study pedagogy and complete their student teaching through the College of Education and Human Performance. Also, persons who hold bachelor’s degrees from accredited institutions may be able to pursue teaching credentials through the Alternative Certification Program housed in the Department of Teacher and Bilingual Education. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Academic Advising </P>

<P>Each undergraduate major is assigned a professional adviser upon entering the university. Students meet with their adviser on a scheduled basis to plan their program and at any time there is a need to discuss questions of concern. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who are interested in changing majors into any of our elementary, middle school or secondary certification programs are responsible for meeting with an adviser in the College of Education and Human Performance Advising Office prior to doing so. Advisers have available specific information regarding all program options. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Accreditation </P>

<P>Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The educator preparation program is fully accredited by the Texas State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC), based on the combined performance of all our candidates on the Texas Examinations of Educator Standards (TExES). Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville has received ACCREDITED status from SBEC for each year that the Texas system has been in effect. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Title II Report Card </P>

<P>Title II of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 requires an annual reporting from states and universities based upon the pass rates of their students on the tests required for completing programs leading to their initial teaching certificates. The pass rates for the Department of Education can be found on the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville Education web site as soon as the information is released by the Texas State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>NOTE: The following sections provide general information about programs in the College of Education and Human Performance. Additional regulations for educator certification may take effect during the years of this catalog and may require changes that could not be foreseen at the time of printing. Changes that become effective in response to rulings by the State Board for Educator Certification and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board may apply to current and prospective students. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Educator Preparation Program </P>

<P>Lydia Landin-Ortiz, Coordinator, Student Services </P>

<P>Rhode Hall 117. MSC 195. Extension 4313.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Educator Preparation Program at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville is administered through the College of Education and Human Performance Center for Educator Preparation Services (CEPS). The program is field-based and is conducted at least 50% of the time at public or private school sites. Students interested in elementary certification may seek certification in early childhood (EC) through grade six or certification in grades four through eight in the specialization areas of mathematics, science, social studies, or English Language Arts and Reading. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The elementary program is divided into four semesters of study starting in the first semester of the junior year (60 semester hours) and upon acceptance into the teacher education program. Application packets for the educator preparation program are available in the Center for Educator Preparation Services along with a listing of assigned advisers. Field experiences include assignments for two semesters in EC-8 public and private school classrooms, according to the certification levels selected (EC-6 or 4-8). Fields experience assignments are in pre-arranged </P>

<P>collaborating area schools. Student teaching is done the final semester and involves working full days for one semester. Student teaching begins the day school begins, spring or fall, rather than when university classes begin. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The secondary (6/7-12)/all-level (EC-12) certification program usually begins in the second semester of the junior year and is a three semester field-based program. The first semester students are placed in a middle school or high school and the second semester students are placed in a high school. During the first and second semesters, several courses are field-based approximately 60% of the time. The student teaching experience in the third semester is 100% field-based. All EDED and EDSE courses (other than student teaching) must be successfully completed before the student teaching experience. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Degree Plans </H4>

<P>Students declaring EC-6, 4-8, 6/7-12 or EC-12 Interdisciplinary Studies as a major should schedule an appointment with a College of Education and Human Performance adviser to plan and develop a draft degree plan. After appropriate College of Education and Human Performance personnel (adviser, certification officer, and dean) sign the degree plan, it then becomes the official plan that students follow to graduation. Changes and course substitutions to the plan must be approved by the student’s adviser, certification officer, dean of education and dean of other colleges (when changes involve courses from other colleges). Changes may also occur when the State Board for Educator Certification mandates changes in the teacher preparation program or certification areas. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Other secondary/all level degree plans may be obtained from the department of the student’s major field, and students should also meet with the secondary/all level education coordinator by the sophomore year. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Educator Certification in Texas </P>

<P>Daniella G. Varela, Certification Coordinator III </P>

<P>Rhode Hall 112. MSC 195. Extension 2894. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The college maintains an Educator Certification Office to assist individuals with eligibility for educator credentialing. The present certification rules in Texas became effective September 1, 1999. The Standard Certificate, issued by the State Board of Educator Certification, replaces the lifetime Provisional and Professional certificates for all certificate programs completed after September 1, 1999. It is a renewable credential which must be renewed every five years to remain valid. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>The Initial Standard Certificate </H4>

<P>The initial certificate for beginning teachers may be obtained by completion of an appropriate undergraduate program culminating in a baccalaureate degree. A student seeking initial certification is required to have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.75 plus a minimum 2.75 average in courses constituting the teaching field(s) and delivery system(s) (Bilingual Education, Early Childhood Education, Special Education). </P>

<P> </P>

<P>In order to be recommended for initial certification or for additional teaching fields or areas of specialization, or for supplemental certificates, all persons are required to achieve a satisfactory level of performance on the Texas Examinations of Educator Standards (TExES). All persons seeking certification in Bilingual Education must also pass the Bilingual Supplemental Test and Bilingual Target Language Proficiency Test (BTLPT).  </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Areas and Levels of Certification </H4>

<P>The State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) approves subject areas and grade levels for certification. Standards describing the knowledge and skills that a beginning teacher must demonstrate prior to certification have been developed for each certificate. For the years covered by this catalog, beginning teachers will be certified under the certification structure described below. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Standard Certificates for Early Childhood-Grade 6 and Grades 4-8 </P>

<P>An undergraduate student seeking a certificate to teach in the elementary schools must complete the work for a Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Requirements include approximately two years of course work in academic foundations courses; a minimum of 12 semester hours of science, 9 semester hours of mathematics and 6 semester hours of reading; 48 semester hours in an interdisciplinary academic major consisting of subjects taught in the elementary grades with 24 semester hours in one or more subject areas or 18 semester hours </P>

<P>in a delivery system (Bilingual Education-Spanish, Early Childhood Education, Special Education), 18 semester hours of field-based professional development courses; and 6 semester hours of student teaching. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville offers the Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies for the following specializations and delivery systems: </P>

<P>Llacuna </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The department's objective is the development of selected men and women with potential to serve as commissioned officers in the active Army, National Guard or Army Reserve. A student who completes the program will have developed leadership and managerial potential; have a basic understanding of military fundamentals and the requirements of national security; have acquired an understanding of the fundamental concepts of military art and science; have developed a strong sense of personal honor, integrity and individual responsibility; and have developed a better understanding of human relationships. The leadership and management experience gained through Army ROTC and service as a commissioned officer will benefit the student in civilian as well as in military science and national defense pursuits. </P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Minor </H4>

<P>A student may pursue an interdisciplinary minor in Military Science. Courses for a total of 18 semester hours should be selected in consultation with the Professor of Military Science.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Army Scholarship Program: Any student who meets prerequisites may compete for nationally awarded US Army scholarships which pay for tuition, books, fees and other purely educational costs and a tax-free monthly subsistence allowance for 10 months of each year the scholarship is in effect. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Army Training-Airborne and Air Assault or Other Training: Selected cadets may be eligible to compete for attendance at Airborne, Air Assault or other training as available. Selection is based upon motivation, physical condition and academic Military Science performance. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Veteran's Assistance: Veterans who enroll in upper level Military Science receive a tax-free monthly subsistence allowance for 10 months each of two years in addition to benefits provided by the Veterans' Administration, Veteran's Education Assistance Program or the GI Bill/Army College Fund. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Leadership Laboratory: Required for Military Science courses. Designed to give the student an opportunity to practice hands-on lessons learned in class. Students are placed in leadership roles executing scenarios that challenge their organizational skills through the use of small-unit tactics. Scenarios may involve survival, water safety, rappelling, map reading and land navigation and patrolling using paint ball equipment. </P>

<P> </P>

(Coursework must include MATH 1348 or higher and CHEM 1111/CHEM 1311 except for students that transfer to the industrial management and technology program.) </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who fall below the minimum pre-engineering test scores will not be allowed entry into the College of Engineering before completing 36 or more credit hours with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 and a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 in all included mathematics and science coursework. Once these criteria have been met, the student may reapply for admission to the College of Engineering. (Coursework must include MATH 1348 or higher and CHEM 1111/CHEM 1311 except for students that transfer to the industrial management and technology progarm.) </P>

<H1> </H1>

<P>Transfer Students </P>

<P>Transfer students will be accepted in the college unconditionally if their overall grade point average from the previous institution(s) is 2.5 or greater. Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville students desiring to change their major to engineering must also meet this requirement. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Non-engineering majors may take one lower-level (1000-2000) engineering course a semester. Upper-level engineering courses (3000-4000) may not be taken by non-engineering or pre-engineering majors. Exceptions to the above policy must be approved in writing by the dean of the student's college and the dean of engineering. Students who enroll in engineering courses without approval will be dropped from the course. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who transfer into the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering having attempted 60 credit hours or less and that have a cumulative GPA of 2.0-2.49 on a 4.0 grading system will be placed into the Pre-Engineering (PPEN) major. After one semester, the student will be re-evaluated by his/her adviser. If the student has maintained satisfactory progress, the student will be transferred out of PPEN and placed into a permanent engineering major. A change of major form will be completed and signed by the chair of the department and the dean of the college. Students who do not achieve satisfactory progress will remain in PPEN and will be re-evaluated after the completion of one (1) academic year. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Candidates for a bachelor’s degree in engineering or computer science must have a minimum of 45 semester hours required for the degree completed in residence at the university. Of the 45 hours earned at the university, 36 hours must be earned within the College of Engineering. Exceptions to the above policy require permission of the department chair and dean. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students planning to transfer to the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering from another four-year university should apply for admission as early as possible. Once accepted, the student is encouraged to contact the appropriate department chair during the semester prior to enrolling at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. Course transferability and course prerequisite requirements can be determined to allow a smooth transition into the program at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. </P>

<P>Community college transfer students should complete English, mathematics and science courses as early as possible. The basic engineering courses required for a specific degree should also be completed. If some of these courses are not available at the college the student is attending, early transfer or a summer session at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville may be advisable to enable the student to stay on schedule. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Specific articulation and joint admission agreements are available for several community colleges. These agreements can be viewed at 
<Link>College of Engineering Homepage</Link>
.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Transfer of Credit </P>

<P>The university has established course equivalencies from the majority of Texas community colleges and universities. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has established guidelines on course transferability from two-year colleges to four-year universities in engineering. In addition to the university policies controlling the granting of credit for course work taken at other institutions where equivalency has not been established, the following policies apply to students entering the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering from such institutions: </P>

<P>a. All courses taken at another institution are subject to approval by the dean of the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering and the chair of the degree granting department. Courses are approved on a course-by-course basis to ensure their acceptability in fulfilling requirements for a degree. In making this evaluation, the student may be required by the dean and/or department chair to produce catalogs and other supporting material from the institution from which the student is transferring. </P>

<P>b. Degree credit will not be granted for any mathematics, science, engineering, or other technical course taken at another institution in which the student’s grade in that course was not the equivalent of at least a C and an overall 2.0 on a 4.0 grading system. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A maximum of 72 semester hours may be transferred from institutions that do not have engineering programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. Advanced (3000- or 4000-level) engineering courses from four-year institutions that do not have ABET accredited programs may be applied toward degree requirements only if approved by the department chair and the dean. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The student is responsible for timely processing of all course substitutions. This action should be completed during the first semester of work at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville. </P>

<H1> </H1>

<P>Academic Counseling </P>

<P>Students are assigned to an academic adviser in their major department upon entering the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering. Academic counseling and preregistration sessions are scheduled each semester to allow students to review their academic progress and plan their schedule for the next semester. All pre-engineering and engineering students are assigned an adviser. Students are required to see their adviser before they will be permitted to register. Students should also consult their adviser for approval of academic matters such as choice of electives, course substitutions, course overloads and adding or dropping courses. The dropping of key courses in a curriculum may delay the student's progress toward the desired degree. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Policy on Electronic Devices During Examinations </P>

<P>It is the policy of the TAMUK College of Engineering that no electronic devices are permitted in course examinations without the permission of the instructor.  </P>
