<P>Mission Statement</P>

<P>We educate our community to ask reflective questions, apply critical thought, and act with purpose.</P>

<P/>

<P>Accreditation</P>

<P>William Jewell College is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission (
<Link>www.hlcommission.org</Link>
). The following departments are also accredited: Education by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education; Music by the National Association of Schools of Music; and Nursing by the Missouri State Board of Nursing and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.</P>

<P/>

<P>Non-Discrimination/Equal Opportunity Notice</P>

<P>William Jewell pursues a non-discrimination policy with regard to its educational programs and employment. As such, William Jewell does not discriminate on the basis of age, disability, gender, genetic information, national origin, race/color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status or any other status protected by law (collectively “protected statuses”) in matters of admissions, housing or services, or in the educational programs and activities it operates. William Jewell’s prohibition on discrimination based on protected statuses also extends to all aspects of the employment relationship, including hiring, promotion, termination, compensation, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment. Harassment, whether verbal, physical or visual, that is based on any protected status is a form of discrimination and prohibited by William Jewell’s Anti-Harassment Policy. This notice is issued in compliance with federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination Act.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell has designated its Director of Human Resources (the “Non-Discrimination Coordinator”) to handle all inquiries regarding its efforts to carry out this policy, to comply with federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination and to receive complaints of discrimination.

<P/>

<P>FERPA</P>

<P>William Jewell College complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended. FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. These rights include the following:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to inspect and review, within a reasonable time after the College receives a written request for access, the student’s educational records that are maintained by the College. Students should contact the College office that is responsible for the record(s) they wish to inspect.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to request the amendment of the student’s educational records that are believed to be inaccurate, misleading or inappropriate. A student who wishes to ask for the amendment of a record should write to the official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record that the student wants changed and explain why it should be changed. If the College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student in writing and advise the student of the right to a hearing on the matter. The student also has the right to place with the educational record a statement commenting on the information in question.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to provide written consent before the College discloses personally identifiable information from the student’s educational records. One example of an allowed exception to this right is the disclosure of records to authorized individuals associated with the College who have legitimate educational interests. (A person has a legitimate educational interest if the information will be used in conjunction with the fulfillment of his/her official responsibilities for the College.) Records may also be disclosed, without prior consent, to entities or individuals designated by a state or federal agency to conduct audits or evaluations of the College in connection with legal requirements.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to be notified annually of the rights granted under FERPA.
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>	The right to file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office of the United States Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>It is the College’s policy to require that all students provide specific written consent before confidential information is disclosed to anyone (including parents and/or legal guardians) besides school officials, except as required by law. Examples of confidential information are academic records (grades, transcripts, etc.), current class schedules and disciplinary records. However, federal law permits us to release disciplinary records to parents when a student who is under 21 has been found in violation of federal, state, local or College laws or rules related to the use of alcohol or a controlled substance. A student may choose to allow disclosure of specified educational records to named individuals with a FERPA Waiver Form that can be completed online.</P>

<P/>

<P>FERPA permits disclosure and verification of directory information, without prior notification of the student, unless the student has submitted a written request to the Office of the Registrar for this information to be kept confidential. Examples of directory information are name; Jewell ID number; local and permanent addresses; telephone listings; email addresses; likeness (e.g., photographs) to be used in college publications; country of citizenship; major and minor fields of study; enrollment status and classification; dates of attendance; participation in officially recognized activities and sports; weight and height of members of athletic teams; degrees, honors and awards received; and educational institutions attended before Jewell. When a student has submitted to the Office of the Registrar a signed request for privacy (nondisclosure of directory information), the College assumes no subsequent responsibility for contacting the student to obtain permission to release information in response to a request. Students may not opt-out of disclosure of their name or institutional email address to other students in their classes.</P>

<P/>

<P>Any student who has been “in attendance” at William Jewell College has rights under FERPA. Thus, a student’s rights under FERPA at the College begin on the first day of the first term in which the student is enrolled in any course at William Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>Disability Accommodations Notice</P>

<P>William Jewell College pursues a non-discrimination policy with regards to all education programs and employment. William Jewell is committed to the full inclusion of students, faculty and staff in the life of the Jewell Community in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (including the ADA Amendments Act of 2008) and the Fair Housing Act. </P>

<P/>

<P>Under Section 504 and the ADA/ADAAA, a person has a disability if he/she: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities. These activities can include but are not limited to walking, standing, seeing, eating, speaking, hearing, sitting, breathing, reading, learning, performing manual tasks, caring for oneself. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>has a record or history of such impairment; or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>is regarded as having such impairment. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Students, Faculty and Staff </P>

<P>To prevent discrimination on the basis of disability, reasonable and appropriate accommodations, academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids and services are determined on a case-by-case basis for otherwise qualified individuals who have a demonstrated need for these services and can provide appropriate documentation. Information concerning eligibility for accommodations, required documentation and the application process for students, faculty and staff is set forth in William Jewell’s Policies and Guidelines for Individuals with Disabilities at 
<Link>www.jewell.edu/disability-services</Link>
.</P>

<P/>

<P>Any additional requests or questions regarding programs, services and activities accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, should be directed to the 504 and Compliance Coordinator:

<P/>

<P>Official Communication with Students</P>

<P>William Jewell College communicates a variety of information to its students. Some of the information is time-sensitive, related to matters such as registration dates and procedures, deadlines for refunds and dropping courses, academic standing and requirements and College 
housing policies. It is essential that all such communications 
be received by students in a timely manner.</P>

<P/>

<P>As a result, William Jewell College has designated certain addresses as our official means of communicating with students. These official addresses are the student’s college-issued email address, the local address for the semester (the college-assigned mailbox if the student lives on campus) and the permanent home address as shown in the College’s records.</P>

<P/>

<P>The College will consider that it has communicated successfully with a student as long as the communication has been sent to any one of those addresses. Therefore, it is the student’s responsibility to assure access to all of these addresses, to check them regularly for any communications from the College and to respond promptly. It is critical for the student to inform the Registrar’s office immediately of any changes in an address. </P>

<P/>

<P>Catalog Accuracy and Changes</P>

<P>It is each student’s responsibility to be familiar with the rules, policies and procedures outlined in this catalog. Every effort is made to ensure that this catalog is accurate and reflects properly the curriculum and academic policies of William Jewell College as of the date of its publication. However, the course offerings, requirements and policies of the College are under continual examination, and the College has a right to modify those offerings, requirements and policies. This catalog is not a contract and in no way guarantees that course offerings, requirements and policies will not change during a student’s time at the College.

<P>Admission</P>
</Story>

<Story>
<P>Admission of first-year undergraduates to William Jewell College is selective and is based on the evaluation of grades on secondary school coursework, scores on college admission tests, co-curricular activities, attempted college coursework, as well as other indicators of ability and character. Applications are evaluated on a rolling basis; however, due to the limited number of spaces in the first-year class, students are encouraged to apply for admission early in their senior year of high school. Transfer applicants are also evaluated on a rolling basis. (Admission requirements for transfer students are shown below.)</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College requires first-year applicants to complete a minimum of 15 college preparatory academic units (as distributed below) at an accredited high school to be eligible for admission. The College further recommends at least an additional four academic electives, particularly one each in math and foreign language.</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>4 units of English – Two units must emphasize composition or writing skills; one unit may be in speech or debate.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>3 units of mathematics – Algebra I and higher units must be used to meet this requirement.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>

</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Applications are encouraged from any student meeting these standards regardless of age, disability, gender, national origin, race/color, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status. Individual consideration is given to veterans and other mature applicants who may not meet all requirements. The College reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant whose academic history or personal qualifications are judged to be unsuitable for college work or living at William Jewell College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Application Procedure for First-Year Admission</P>

<P>Candidates for admission are required to submit the following:</P>

<L>

</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students may submit an optional academic recommendation from a teacher or professor in support of the application. Students also may submit a 250-500 word personal statement or graded essay.

(If all such transcripts are found not to have been submitted, enrollment at William Jewell beyond one semester will not be permitted.)</P>

<P/>

<P>Candidates for the Oxbridge Honors Program should be aware that additional requirements for applying to the Oxbridge Honors Program are as follows:</P>

<P>1.	The Oxbridge essay (should be substituted for the personal statement or graded essay)</P>

apply. Because the nature of the home-school environment presents difficulties in determining the rigor of curriculum and academic engagement, home-schooled students must submit a standardized test score.</P>

<P/>

<P>Home-Schooled Applicants</P>

<P>William Jewell welcomes applications from home-schooled students. Such students who wish to apply for admission should fill out the Application for Admission in addition to providing the following items: </P>

In addition, official transcripts must be submitted from any two- or four-year colleges where a student has been enrolled in courses, even if credit was not awarded. (If all such transcripts are found not to have been submitted, enrollment at William Jewell beyond one semester will not be permitted.)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Official standardized test score reports (ACT and/or SAT). Home-schooled students do not need to take the GED. </LBody>

</LI>
</L>

<P>1.	Are you going to receive a state-recognized high school diploma?</P>

<P>2.	What formal curriculum do you use (if any)? </P>

<P>3.	Please include any additional comments or information that will increase our understanding of your home-schooling experience.</P>

<P/>

<P>High School Equivalency Diploma</P>

<P>A high school equivalency diploma will be accepted in place of high school graduation if scores meet the standards set for admission to the College. Contact the Office of Admission for additional information. An official score report from the exam must be submitted.</P>

<P/>

<P>Conditional Admission</P>

<P>Applicants who do not meet the regular admittance criteria may be admitted conditionally. The Admission Committee reviews all pending decisions for regular or conditional admittance based on GPA in core academic coursework, submission of essays, and other academic résumés. Conditionally admitted students are required to work with the Director of the Academic Achievement Center throughout the first year of enrollment at William Jewell College and to enroll in COL 110 (Study and Learning Strategies, one credit hour) and COL 120 (Career Planning, one credit hour) during their first semester. </P>

<P/>

<P>Requirements for Transfer Admission</P>

<P>William Jewell College welcomes undergraduate transfer students from regionally accredited two- and four-year colleges. Students should be aware that degree requirements vary from institution to institution; thus, they should examine the academic program requirements at William Jewell early in the college experience in order to arrange the most efficient course articulation. A transfer student is defined by William Jewell as a person who, after having been graduated from high school, has earned at least 12 hours of transferable credit at other regionally accredited institutions and who seeks to earn a degree from William Jewell College.</P>

<P/>

<P>The following guidelines and policies apply to undergraduate transfer admission:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>	To be considered for admission, students must normally present a GPA of 2.5 (on a 4.0 scale) for transferable courses.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>	Credit will be considered for transfer to William Jewell College, and for potential use toward a degree from William Jewell College, only for courses that are consistent with the curriculum of the College and on which the student has earned grades of C- or higher.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>	Generally, credit for undergraduate courses that are technical or vocational in nature, that are based upon participation in intercollegiate athletics or that are otherwise inconsistent with the liberal arts curriculum of William Jewell College will not be accepted in transfer. Credit for courses that are judged to be remedial will not be accepted.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>	Courses that cannot be used toward a degree at the original institution will not normally be accepted in transfer to William Jewell. Credit granted by another institution on the basis of an examination or through advanced standing will not be accepted in transfer to William Jewell.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>	Up to two hours of credit will be granted, and recorded as transfer credit of physical activities, upon the receipt of an official military transcript showing successful completion of basic military training. No other credit will be awarded on the basis of a military transcript or on the basis of experiential learning.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>	A course for which only a “passing” or “satisfactory” grade is recorded by another institution is not normally considered for transfer, unless the corresponding class at William Jewell is also graded on a pass/fail basis for all students.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody> Accepted courses that are determined to result in duplication of credit will increase the minimum hours required for graduation from William Jewell.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody> The final determination concerning whether credit is transferable is made by the College Registrar, who may consult with department chairs. The student is welcome to provide additional materials (descriptions, syllabi, assignments, etc.) from courses whose transferability is questioned.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Credit from other institutions that is presented for possible transfer to Jewell will be examined in chronological order. Once a total of 64 hours of transfer credit has been recorded, then any subsequent hours transferred from a two-year college will increase the total number of hours required for graduation from Jewell. (However, transfer work from a two-year college that is done beyond the 64-hour mark can still be employed to meet prerequisites or some requirements at William Jewell.)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>A minimum of 30 semester hours, aside from any courses that are graded pass/fail, must be completed in residence at William Jewell, including at least 12 hours (with a grade of C– or better) in any major and at least 9 hours (with a grade of C– or better) in any minor, by any student who intends to earn a degree from the College.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Transfer students with fewer than 26 transferable college credit hours that have been earned since finishing high school will be expected to complete William Jewell’s Core Curriculum in its entirety through William Jewell courses. Exceptions are made for 100-level CTI courses, aside from CTI 100 and 150.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Transfer students with 26 or more transferable hours that have been earned since finishing high school are allowed to follow rules for meeting the requirements of the Core Curriculum that are found at 
<Link>www.jewell.edu/join/transfer-applicants</Link>
. The rules apply only at the time of the first enrollment at William Jewell. Credit awarded by William Jewell on the basis of examinations (e.g., AP and IB credit) does not count toward the 26 hours.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Since William Jewell operates on a semester basis, credit hours earned at an institution that is on a quarter system will be multiplied by two-thirds before they are recorded on a William Jewell transcript.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Application Procedure for Transfer Admission</P>

<P>Candidates for transfer admission are required to submit the following:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>A completed Application for Admission and Scholarship. (www.jewell.edu/apply)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Official copies of transcripts from each college at which the student was enrolled in courses, attended classes or received financial aid, even if credit was not awarded.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>A copy of the high school transcript if fewer than 26 hours of transferable college credit have been earned since finishing high school. Other students who will be seeking a BA degree at William Jewell may benefit from supplying the College with a copy of the high school transcript.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Official ACT or SAT scores if fewer than 26 hours of transferable college credit have been earned since finishing high school.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Before they begin classes at William Jewell, transfer students must submit official copies of final transcripts from all post-secondary institutions at which they have been enrolled in courses or received financial aid, even if credit was not awarded. (If all such transcripts are found not to have been submitted, enrollment at William Jewell beyond one semester will not be permitted.)</P>

<P/>

<P>Requirements for Returning to Jewell</P>

<P>William Jewell students who have been away from the College for only one or two semesters without enrolling in courses elsewhere must contact the Office of Admission concerning reactivation of their records as they return to the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who have been away more than two semesters, or who have enrolled elsewhere during their time away, are required to apply for re-admission to the College. This may be accomplished by completing the Application for Admission and Scholarship online (
<Link>www.jewell.edu/apply</Link>
) and supplying official copies of transcripts from all post-secondary institutions at which the student being re-admitted has been enrolled in courses or has received financial aid, even if credit was not awarded. Students are strongly encouraged to file a FAFSA in order to attempt to qualify for available financial aid.</P>

<P/>

<P>Before they begin classes at William Jewell, re-admitted students must submit official copies of final transcripts from all post-secondary institutions at which they have been enrolled in courses or received financial aid, even if credit was not awarded. If all such transcripts are found not to have been submitted, enrollment at William Jewell beyond one semester will not be permitted.)</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who is re-admitted to Jewell, even if credit has been earned elsewhere, is not categorized as a transfer student. Rules that govern the use of credit earned elsewhere by transfer students to meet CTI requirements cannot be expected to apply to the credit earned while away from Jewell. However, a student who has matriculated at Jewell and who subsequently leaves Jewell and is a full-time student at other institutions for at least three semesters (not counting work done overseas or in the summer) before returning to Jewell will be allowed, at the time of re-admission to Jewell, to substitute transfer work for CTI courses according to the rules for transfer students.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who returns after an absence should expect to be required to change to the requirements set forth in the catalog in effect at the time of rejoining the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Visiting and Unclassified Students</P>

<P>A student who has been attending another institution and who wishes to attend William Jewell only temporarily is classified as a visiting student. Other persons who do not seek to earn a degree from William Jewell but who desire to enroll in an occasional class are considered to be unclassified students. Persons admitted in either of these categories who wish to remain at William Jewell as degree-seeking students must go through the regular admission processes outlined above.</P>

<P/>

<P>Transcripts from Other Institutions</P>

<P>Official transcripts that students arrange to have sent to the College from other institutions become the property of William Jewell College and a part of a student’s educational record. They are considered official only at the time of receipt. Copies of transcripts received by William Jewell from other institutions will not be provided to the student. (Under the provisions of FERPA, students are allowed to inspect such records.)</P>

<P/>

<P>In order to be certain of obtaining accurate information and assuring that no protocol of the issuing institution is circumvented, a student must contact the originating school for additional copies of his/her transcript. </P>

<P/>

<P>Students who are found not to have submitted the transcripts required as a part of the admission process will have a hold placed on their educational records and will not be able to obtain an official transcript that reflects any work done at William Jewell College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Enrollment Deposit</P>

<P>Students who are admitted to the College are required to submit a $300 enrollment deposit to reserve a space in the incoming class. $200 of this deposit is applied to first-semester charges; $100 is held on account. First-year students are expected to submit their enrollment deposit by the National Reply Date on May 1. Deposits received after May 1 are non-refundable. First-year, transfer and re-admitted students will not be allowed to schedule an advising appointment for registration in first-semester classes without having first submitted their $300 enrollment deposit.</P>

<P/>

<P>Credit Earned During High School and Test Credit</P>

<P>The College imposes no limit on the amount of credit a student may earn while still enrolled in high school or by examination, although a minimum of 30 graded credit hours in residence (through William Jewell courses) is required to earn a degree from William Jewell College. Credit by examination is normally recorded on the student’s transcript with the letter grade “CR,” which is not included in grade-point-average calculations.</P>

<P/>

<P>Advanced Placement (AP) Credit</P>

<P>William Jewell College offers Advanced Placement (AP) credit in cooperation with The College Board. Official score reports from AP examinations for students seeking admission to the College should be sent to the Office of Admission. A minimum score of 4 on any exam is required to be eligible for AP credit. A listing of courses for which credit can be earned in this manner is available on the College’s website (
<Link>www.jewell.edu/apply</Link>
). </P>

<P/>

<P>International Baccalaureate (IB) Credit</P>

<P>The College recognizes credits earned through strong performances on examinations administered by the International Baccalaureate Organization. A minimum score of 5 on any higher-level (HL) exam is required to be eligible for credit. Some departments will also grant credit for standard-level (SL) exams, with a score of 6 generally being the minimum score that is accepted. A listing of tests and the scores required for credit at William Jewell is available on the College’s website (
<Link>www.jewell.edu/apply</Link>
).</P>

<P/>

<P>Credit and Placement by Examination</P>

<P>Credit may be granted through departmental examinations. The actual awarding of academic credit is at the discretion of the individual departments. For associated fees, see the Summary of Charges in the Financial Cost Information section of the catalog. Advanced placement (with no associated credit or fee) may also be granted through departmental exams or at the discretion of the department.</P>

<P/>

<P>Dual Credit (High School/College)</P>

<P>Credit earned from a regionally accredited college or university, through courses taken while in high school, will be considered for transfer toward a William Jewell College degree. An official college or university transcript is required for evaluation and granting of credit. Credit toward graduation will not be awarded for courses with a grade lower than C-. Credit will not be granted on the basis of the high school transcript. The final determination concerning whether credit will be accepted will be made by the Registrar, who may consult with department chairs. (Refer to the guidelines for acceptance of transferred credit that are listed above.) Students should arrange to have these post-secondary transcripts sent to William Jewell before they begin classes at the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Concurrent Enrollment/Summer Credit</P>

<P>Students who satisfy the College’s admission requirements after their junior year in high school may be granted permission to take one course concurrently (i.e., while finishing high school) at a reduced tuition rate during the fall semester and/or spring semester of the senior year in high school. Students must submit an Application for Admission, an official high school transcript, official copies of ACT or SAT scores and a letter of support from a high school counselor or principal. Early admission to the College as a concurrent student does not guarantee admission to the College as a full-time student after the completion of high school. High school students demonstrating exceptional academic ability may enroll for classes during Jewell’s summer session following their junior year but should expect to be charged tuition at the regular summer rate. </P>

<P>Students who are attending the Kansas City Metropolitan Community Colleges (MCC) and who intend to enroll at William Jewell after the completion of an associate degree are encouraged to participate in the A+Jewell Dual Admission Program. Students in this program are expected to apply for admission at William Jewell and to complete the A+Jewell application supplement within the first four weeks of their second semester at MCC.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who are enrolled in the A+Jewell Dual Admission Program and who have completed a minimum of 30 credit hours at MCC with a GPA of 3.0 or better are eligible to take select courses at Jewell at a reduced tuition rate while they continue their work at MCC. (Refer to the concurrent student rate in the Summary of Charges in the section on Financial Cost Information.) Students in this program are given special assistance by the transfer counselor in the Office of Admission and are assigned a faculty academic advisor in their area of interest at Jewell. Credit earned at William Jewell through this program is allowed to count toward both the Associate Degree from MCC and the Bachelor’s Degree from William Jewell. Articulation agreements indicating how credit from MCC will apply to a degree from Jewell have been approved by the two institutions.</P>

<P/>

<P>International Students</P>

<P>All admission policies, documents, credentials, timetables and requirements for domestic students apply to international undergraduate students.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students in the U.S. on any type of visa other than F1 must take the necessary steps to apply for and obtain an F1 visa before enrolling at the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College recognizes credits and diplomas from properly accredited international colleges and universities once appropriate official documentation is received and (if necessary) translated. Students who have earned college-level credit at institutions outside the United States must normally submit a transcript for such work for evaluation (see below) with results to be forwarded directly to William Jewell. The Registrar, who may consult with department chairs, will determine the nature of the courses and the number of credits granted once translations and evaluations of syllabi, catalogs and credentials are complete.</P>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Certificate of Financial Support. International student applicants requiring a visa to study at William Jewell College must certify that there are sufficient monetary resources to satisfy the costs of attendance. A Certificate of Eligibility (I-20) will not be issued until a current (within the last three months) bank statement, award letters and affidavits are signed, dated and received by the Office of Admission at William Jewell College. An I-20 “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status” form will be mailed to all admitted international students by the International Student Advisor upon receipt of the $300 enrollment deposit.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>The College will provide support and direction to international students throughout their tenure at William Jewell, ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations and helping with adjustments to living in the United States.</P>

<P/>

<P>International students are expected to live in a campus residence facility and to be paired initially with American roommates. This arrangement provides for a unique living environment and proves to be valuable for all parties.</P>

<P/>

<P>Admission with Prior Academic Probation or Dismissal</P>

<P>Students applying for undergraduate admission to the College who are on academic probation at another college or university or have been academically dismissed from another college or university are subject to a thorough review by the Admission Committee and the Provost of the College. Students who have been academically dismissed from another college or university may not be considered for admission to William Jewell until one year (two semesters) after their dismissal.
</P>

<P>Accelerated Track in Nursing</P>

<P>As college graduates, students may enter the College seeking to complete in an accelerated manner the requirements for a major in nursing and the Bachelor of Science degree from William Jewell College. In addition to the Application for Admission, each applicant must write a personal statement using 250–500 words. The topics of the essay are: Why do you want to be a nurse? Why is Jewell the place to earn your Bachelor’s degree in nursing?</P>

<P/>

<P>Students already holding a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution who enter the Accelerated Track program in nursing are exempt from all Core Curriculum requirements at the College if at least 90 semester hours of their previous undergraduate work is applicable toward a bachelor’s degree at William Jewell. (For an explanation of what transfer work can count toward a degree at Jewell, refer to the earlier section on “Requirements for Transfer Admission”. Note that credit transferred from a community college can be included only in the first 64 hours of the 90 hours needed for a student to be exempted from Jewell’s Core Curriculum.)</P>

(If all such transcripts are found not to have been submitted, enrollment at William Jewell beyond one semester will not be permitted.)</P>

<P/>

<P>In order to comply with terms of affiliating agreements between William Jewell College and clinical agencies, any student who has contact with patients (or residents) must disclose any criminal convictions and agree to be subject to a criminal background check and drug screening by state or private investigative agencies. The College has implemented a background-check policy whereby a conditional offer of acceptance will be revoked if any of the following are found during the required pre-enrollment background check process: criminal convictions, pending charges and/or negative information on a Family Care Safety Registry (FCSR) report from the State of Missouri. Please see the Nursing Program website for more details concerning the background check and drug screen policies.</P>

<P/>

<P>RN to BS in Nursing Degree Program</P>

<P>Because of the commitment of the Department of Nursing to excellence in professional nursing and the desire to assist those persons who are licensed as a registered nurse (RN) but who lack a bachelor’s degree, William Jewell College offers a track in its nursing program through which a BS degree, with a major in nursing, can be completed. This track maintains the course requirements and structure of the major in nursing (described later in the catalog) while also providing experiences tailored to the qualifications of the student who has already earned an associate degree and has a state license to practice as an RN. The majority of courses needed to complete the bachelor’s degree will be available through online delivery.</P>

<P/>

<P>Consult the section above on “Requirements for Transfer Admission,” and note that students will enter the program with differences in backgrounds, since requirements will have been different at the institutions where associate degrees were earned. Thus, each student’s requirements for completing a bachelor’s degree will have to be determined through consultation between the Registrar and the Department of Nursing. </P>

<P>The Academic Program</P>
</Story>

<Story>
<P/>

<P>The Curriculum</P>

<P>The undergraduate curriculum of the College includes the following three parts:</P>

<P/>

<P>I. Academic Core Curriculum: Critical Thought and Inquiry</P>

<P>All undergraduate students graduating from William Jewell College must complete our core curriculum program. For a complete description of the program, its requirements, policies and courses, please see Academic Core Curriculum in the Programs of Study section of this catalog.</P>

<P/>

<P>II. Majors and Minors</P>

<P>Each undergraduate student must complete the requirements of at least one major, with no course grade lower than C- in the major. (The credit associated with the requirements of a major varies greatly but is always at least 24 hours.) Students who transfer credit into the College must complete in residence (through William Jewell coursework) a minimum of 12 hours (with a grade of C– or better in each course) in the major. For specific requirements of each major, please see the listings in this catalog under Programs of Study. The information provided in this catalog may be supplemented by further information in departmental checklists, handbooks and postings on the College’s website.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students may choose one of the traditional academic majors or may devise an interdisciplinary or non- traditional major from the several hundred courses offered by the College. Instructions for proposing a self-designed major are available through the Office of the Registrar. A student interested in creating a self- designed major must send a letter of intent to the Chair of the faculty’s Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee (CEPC) by the beginning of the second semester of the student’s sophomore year or by the tenth week of the student’s first semester at William Jewell, whichever is later. Full proposals for these self-designed majors must then be submitted for review by the CEPC no later than the third week of the junior year (i.e., four semesters before graduation) or the third week of the student’s second semester at William Jewell College, whichever is later. (No proposal will be accepted during a student’s final semester at the College). A self-designed major proposal must be approved by the CEPC, signed by the CEPC Chair and the Provost, and filed with the Office of the Registrar before it becomes an official part of the student’s academic record.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students may choose to pursue more than one major. A second, or subsequent, major, with the exception of 
ACT-In, must involve a minimum of 16 hours of requirements beyond those of the Academic Core and of other majors.</P>

<P/>

<P>Minors permit students to explore in depth a subject of interest, but with fewer requirements than a major. Requirements for minors normally total between 15 and 24 hours, with a minimum of 9 hours in residence (through William Jewell coursework). A grade of C- or higher is required in each course in the minor. A student may earn a minor in a subject even if the student’s major or a different minor requires some of the same courses, subject to the following general rules: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Only those courses specifically required for both programs will apply toward both.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>A minor must contain at least three courses totaling a minimum of nine hours not counting toward a major or another minor.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Many minors are short introductions to majors, including Chemistry, Economics, Spanish and Mathematics. Other minors concentrate on an area in which a major is not available, such as Entrepreneurial Leadership and Premedicine. Finally, minors can be interdisciplinary, such as Nonprofit Leadership and Women’s Studies.</P>

<P/>

<P>A department may allow a student to use a course that is cross-listed under both Critical Thought and Inquiry (CTI) and a departmental prefix to satisfy both the requirement of the CTI category and a requirement of a minor or of a second major. Students wishing to meet a CTI requirement with such a cross-listed course must enroll in the section with a CTI prefix.</P>

<P/>

<P>After having been graduated from the College, a student may return to complete a minor or another major through additional coursework. Transfer work from other institutions will not normally be accepted to meet the requirements of the additional minor or major. If the student’s enrollment at the College is not continuous, the student should expect to have to meet requirements for the additional major or minor that are in effect at the time of the student’s return. The additional major or minor must be one that is offered at the College at the time of the student’s return.</P>

<P/>

<P>III. Elective Courses</P>

<P>A liberal arts education allows students to grow and develop by exposure to a varied curriculum, taught by faculty with a wide range of intellectual and research interests. During their time at Jewell, students may take electives to explore areas about which they might like to learn or to engage in intellectual experimentation. As they work to meet the credit requirements for graduation (a minimum of 124 hours for most undergraduate programs), many students will use elective courses to supplement their experiences in the core curriculum and in their academic majors and minors.</P>

<P/>

<P>Learning Outcomes</P>

<P>The following learning outcomes for all undergraduate students were adopted by the faculty. The educational goals and objectives of the Core Curriculum and of each academic program are linked to these college-wide outcomes.</P>

<L>
<LI>

<LBody>Comprehensive knowledge – Jewell graduates demonstrate a breadth and depth of knowledge that prepares them for lifelong learning.</LBody>

<P>The Student’s Responsibility</P>

<P>All students are responsible for knowing their academic status and for awareness of the academic requirements, policies and procedures as stated in this catalog. While students receive assistance and guidance from advisors, instructors and staff members, proper completion of requirements for graduation is ultimately each student’s responsibility.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Honesty</P>

<P>At William Jewell College, concepts of freedom and personal responsibility are inextricably bound. The College community functions on the principle that each member respects and protects the rights of his/her fellow citizens. Students are expected to possess the values of mature, self-disciplined persons who appreciate the privilege of education and are willing to accept its responsibilities.</P>

<P/>

<P>Although high expectations of honor and integrity apply to the entire College community, the Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct in the Student Handbook specifically address the expected conduct of students. While affirming the highest standards of honor and integrity in all pursuits, the Honor Code for students specifically addresses lying, cheating and stealing. It provides for adjudication of alleged infractions of the Honor Code in the academic sphere through an Honor Council, which is composed of students, faculty and staff.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students attending William Jewell College are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity and individual conduct and to hold one another accountable. Consequently, persons who possess factual knowledge of any violations of the Honor Code are honor-bound to report them.</P>

<P/>

<P>Absences</P>

<P>William Jewell College, while prioritizing academics, believes in the education of the whole person and affirms the value of activities beyond the classroom such as participation in athletics, music, debate and theater performance and attendance at professional/scholarly meetings. The faculty of William Jewell College work together with sponsors of such activities to reach a compromise that respects both the need for students to attend classes and the benefits of participation in co-curricular activities.</P>

<P/>

<P>It is the responsibility of students to:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>attend classes;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>complete all assignments according to the expectations of their instructors;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>

</LI>

<LI>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>arrange to make up missed work.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>It is the responsibility of sponsors of College events to:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>work with faculty members to prevent scheduling conflicts whenever possible;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>schedule events in such a way as to minimize absences from class as much as possible;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>inform the faculty in advance of any planned group absences;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>offer their assistance in accommodating the needs of students who must hand in assignments or take exams; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>recognize that students may not miss unlimited numbers of classes and that faculty members have the right to set limits on absences, even if such absences result from participation in college-sponsored events.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>It is the responsibility of faculty members to:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>set policies that recognize the value of participation in college-sponsored activities, which might include allowing students to hand in assignments or take exams at alternative times with advance notification, as well as distinguishing between excused and unexcused absences; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>set flexible policies, rather than rigid ones, regarding absences.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Late Assignments</P>

<P>Students are expected to complete assigned class work on time. A student anticipating absence from class on a day when work is due is normally expected to submit the work in advance of the due date. If unexpected circumstances such as illness or a personal or family emergency make meeting a due date or attending an examination impossible, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor, in advance of the due date or exam, to explain the situation and request alternate arrangements. Documentation regarding the situation may be requested by the instructor. Failure to contact the instructor in advance may result in a penalty, as determined by the instructor’s judgment and the policy stated in the course’s syllabus.</P>

<P/>

<P>Grading and Credit</P>

<P>Students should obtain their semester grades from their individual online MyJewell account, which is accessible with the student’s network username and password, since no grade reports are printed or distributed. Since Fall 2003, William Jewell’s grade scheme has been as follows:
</P>

<P>A/A+	= 4.0 points per credit hour </P>

<P>A-	= 3.7 points per credit hour</P>

<P>B+ 	= 3.3 points per credit hour</P>

<P>B 	= 3.0 points per credit hour </P>

<P>B- 	= 2.7 points per credit hour</P>

<P>C+ 	= 2.3 points per credit hour</P>

<P>C 	= 2.0 points per credit hour </P>

<P>C- 	= 1.7 points per credit hour</P>

<P>D+	= 1.3 points per credit hour</P>

<P>D 	= 1.0 point per credit hour </P>

<P>D-	= 0.7 points per credit hour</P>

<P>F	= 0 points per credit hour (No completed 
	credit is recorded on the transcript.)</P>

<P>AU	= Audit (No completed credit and no grade 
	points are recorded on the transcript.) </P>

<P>CR	= Credit by examination (No effect on grade 
	point average)</P>

<P>FA	= Failed under the Pass/Fail option (No effect 
	on grade point average)</P>

<P>I	= Incomplete</P>

<P>IP	= In Progress toward Oxbridge senior 
	comprehensive examinations </P>

<P>NR	= Not Reported</P>

<P>P	= Pass (No effect on grade point average)</P>

<P>PR	= Progress (extended Incomplete) </P>

<P>W	= Dropped the course (No effect on grade 
	point average)</P>

<P>WD	= Withdrew from all courses at the College 
	(No effect on grade point average)</P>

<P/>

<P>Grade point averages are computed on the basis of graded hours attempted and the total number of grade points earned. For graduation with a bachelor’s degree, the total number of grade points must be at least two times the number of graded hours attempted at the College; that is, the minimum institutional grade point average must be 2.0.</P>

<P/>

<P>All references herein to “hours” or “credit hours” shall be interpreted to mean semester hours, since William Jewell College operates on a semester basis.</P>

<P/>

<P>Different sets of grade point averages may appear on the student’s transcript.</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Transfer grade point average (includes grades for any transferable courses from other institutions)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Institutional grade point average (includes grades for courses taken through William Jewell College, including approved study-abroad courses)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Cumulative Transfer &amp; Institutional grade point average (includes grades for both categories)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Undergraduate and graduate work will be shown in separate sections of the transcript, and grade point averages will be calculated separately.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Decisions about graduation, honors, academic probation and some financial aid are based solely on institutional grade point average, which does not include grades for transferred credit.</P>

<P/>

<P>Incomplete Grades</P>

<P>An instructor may choose to award a grade of I (for Incomplete) in any course in which, owing to extenuating circumstances such as serious injury or lengthy illness, a student has been unable to complete the requirements of the course. The decision about whether a grade of Incomplete is appropriate is made by the instructor, who may request documentation regarding the student’s circumstances. The assignment of an Incomplete requires a contract in which the instructor specifies reasons for the Incomplete grade, summarizes the work to be completed and indicates the student’s grade for the course if no additional work is submitted. The contract, including the student’s acknowledgement of the instructor’s expectations, must reach the Office of the Registrar by the date on which grades for the semester are due from the faculty.</P>

<P/>

<P>The student who is given a grade of Incomplete must complete the requirements of the course by the end of classes in the succeeding fall or spring semester, or sooner if an earlier deadline is imposed by the instructor in the contract. Failure to do so results in a change of grade to an F (or to a higher grade, if specified by the instructor in the contract). The student is still considered to be a part of the class until the deadline specified in the contract; however, this continued participation in a course from a previous term is not reflected in official reports of enrollment or recognized for purposes related to financial aid. An instructor can permit a student to drop a course in which an Incomplete grade has been recorded only before the deadline for submission of a grade to replace the Incomplete.</P>

<P/>

<P>An extension of the deadline for the student’s submission of additional work requires an amended contract between instructor and student and the approval of the Provost of the College. An Incomplete grade whose deadline has been extended is changed to a PR (Progress) on the student’s record.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who receives an Incomplete in the last semester before graduation must finish all requirements for graduation prior to the beginning of the next semester/term or else conferral of the degree will be delayed.</P>

<P/>

<P>Repeating a Course</P>

<P>Students must repeat courses in which the grade earned is below C- before such courses can satisfy requirements for a major or minor. When such courses are repeated at William Jewell and satisfactory performance is recorded, only the repeat grade will be used in determining the grade point average. However, the original grade remains a part of the permanent record (the transcript) without being included in the grade point computation. On the transcript, the credit hours earned for the repeated course will replace the original credit hours. When such courses were taken originally at Jewell but then are repeated at another institution, the original course is unchanged on the permanent record and the original grade continues to be a part of the institutional GPA. If a grade above F was earned originally and the course is repeated at another institution, then the number of hours required for graduation is increased because of the duplication of credit.</P>

<P/>

<P>Courses not required for a major or minor but in which a grade of below C- is earned may be repeated, if the student chooses and the course is still available. When such a course is repeated at William Jewell and satisfactory performance is recorded, the original grade remains a part of the permanent record (the transcript) without being included in the computation of the grade point average. On the transcript, the credit hours earned for the repeated course will replace the original credit hours. When such courses were taken originally at Jewell but then are repeated at another institution, the original course is unchanged on the permanent record and the original grade continues to be a part of the institutional GPA. If a grade above F was earned originally and the course is repeated at another institution, then the number of hours required for graduation is increased because of the duplication of credit.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who repeat a course for which the original grade is below C-, and who do not earn a grade of C- or better on a subsequent attempt, will normally have only the grade from the latest attempt included in the grade point average.</P>

<P/>

<P>If a student repeats a course in which the original grade is C- or better, the additional credit hours earned will increase the number of hours required for graduation and both grades will be included in grade point computation on the transcript.</P>

<P/>

<P>In order to ensure that the transcript is updated properly, students must submit a Repeat of Course form to the Office of the Registrar when repeating a course. A course may not be repeated using the Pass/Fail option.</P>

<P/>

<P>Pass/Fail Option</P>

<P>The Pass/Fail option encourages undergraduate students to attempt courses of interest that might have been avoided because of a lack of background or heavy course load. Grades of P (Pass) or FA (Fail) received under this option will not be included in the computation of the grade point average, but credit earned when the course is passed will apply toward graduation. The Office of the Registrar does not routinely notify instructors when their students have chosen the Pass/Fail option.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who elect the Pass/Fail option must submit a 
Pass/Fail Option form to the Office of the Registrar by the end of the first week of the semester’s classes, and no changes can be made after that deadline. Students electing the Pass/Fail option must abide by the following restrictions and requirements:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students must be classified as a sophomore or higher and must be in good academic standing.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Only one course per semester is permitted under the Pass/Fail option.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>No more than 20 hours that have been taken under the Pass/Fail option can be counted toward graduation.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>The following types of courses may not be taken under the Pass/Fail option:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>No course in a major or minor, including prerequisites to required courses.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>No other course specifically required for graduation (including core curriculum requirements and world language requirements).</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>No prerequisites to courses meeting the world language requirement.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>No course being repeated.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>No course required for teacher certification or pre-professional preparation.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>No course required for the Pryor Leadership Studies Program or other certificate programs.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>There are a small number of courses that are graded on a pass/fail basis for all students who are enrolled. The restrictions above do not apply to courses for which all enrolled students are graded on a pass/fail basis.</P>

<P/>

<P>Eligibility for the Dean’s List may be affected when one uses the Pass/Fail option, since one must complete at least 
14 graded hours in a semester to be eligible for the Dean’s List.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>Audit Option</P>

<P>On a space-available basis, students may elect to audit a course (i.e., participate in a course without receiving credit). When a course is audited, no credit is awarded and no grade points are earned, but the course will appear on the transcript with a notation of AU in place of a grade. Audited courses do not affect the GPA in any way.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student may subsequently enroll in a course for credit after having audited it or may audit a course after having taken it for credit. A student may not subsequently earn credit for a course through a departmental examination after having audited the same course.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who elect the Audit option must submit an Audit Option form to the Office of the Registrar by the end of the first week of the semester’s classes, and no changes can be made after that deadline. The following conditions and requirements apply to the Audit option:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students will not be charged an audit fee if their enrollment without the audited class is at least 12 hours and their enrollment with the audited class is not over 18 hours.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students whose enrollment without the audited class is under 12 hours will be charged an audit fee according to the currently posted Summary of Charges for that semester.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students whose enrollment with the audited class is over 18 hours will be charged an audit fee for the extra hours according to the currently posted Summary of Charges.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students may not audit a course that requires physical participation (e.g., applied music study, science laboratories, etc.).</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students who audit a course are not required to take examinations or to submit assignments that are required of regularly enrolled students. They are, however, expected to attend classes regularly. If a student auditing a course is absent excessively, the instructor may request the withdrawal of the student from the class.
A student may not change a course from audit to credit status after the first week of classes in a semester.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The instructor must agree, by indicating approval on the Audit Option form, to allow a student to audit a course.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Grade Appeal Procedure</P>

<P>Students who wish to appeal a grade in a course are encouraged first to contact the instructor of the course to attempt to resolve the problem informally.</P>

<P/>

<P>The instructor, and only the instructor, has the prerogative and responsibility for assigning a grade in a course. The only basis on which an administrator has the right to intervene in the grading process is when there is clear and compelling evidence of unfairness. A student’s dissatisfaction with a grade or with an instructor’s teaching methods or grading standards does not in itself constitute evidence of unfairness. </P>

<P/>

<P>To appeal a grade formally, the student makes the case in writing to the Provost of the College that the grade is unfair. The Provost forwards a copy of that statement to the instructor and asks for a response, also in writing. Once the Provost has had an opportunity to compare the student’s statement with the instructor’s response and to consider all the evidence carefully, a decision will be communicated in writing. </P>

<P/>

<P>Students have a maximum of three weeks after the posting of a grade to begin a formal appeal of that grade. A faculty member who wishes to change a grade (besides an Incomplete grade) on his/her own initiative has a maximum of six weeks after the posting of a grade to ask for the grade to be changed.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Good Standing</P>

<P>A full-time student must meet each of the following standards for academic performance and progress to qualify as a student in good standing:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student’s overall institutional grade point average must meet or exceed the following thresholds:
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>˚˚</Lbl>

<LBody>1.75 at the end of the first or second semester at Jewell; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>˚˚</Lbl>

<LBody>1.90 at the end of the third semester at Jewell; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>˚˚</Lbl>

<LBody>2.00 at the end of the fourth or later semesters at Jewell.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student must have earned at least 6 credit hours during the previous semester at Jewell.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student must have earned at least 20 credit hours at Jewell per academic year, which is understood to begin with the fall semester and to conclude after the summer term.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student must exhibit integrity and personal honesty in the classroom and in other campus affairs.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Academic Probation</P>

<P>Full-time students who have not met the above standards for academic good standing are placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation are at risk for losing their eligibility for financial aid and for being dismissed from the College for academic deficiency and may be asked to take certain steps that are designed to assist in improving academic performance. A student who has been placed on academic probation will have this fact noted permanently on the academic record (transcript). A student will be removed from academic probation when he or she meets each of the minimum academic performance standards defined above. The Provost will notify in writing any students who are placed on academic probation.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Dismissal</P>

<P>A student whose institutional GPA falls below the minimum GPA listed below may be dismissed for academic deficiency. Students must maintain the following minimum institutional grade point average in order to remain at the College:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Overall institutional grade point average of 1.50 at the end of the first and second semesters at Jewell</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Overall institutional grade point average of 1.75 at the end of the third semester at Jewell</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Overall institutional grade point average of 2.00 at the end of the fourth semester at Jewell and thereafter</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Dismissal for academic deficiency is noted on the student’s permanent record (transcript). See the section of this catalog on Financial Aid Information for further statements of standards for maintaining eligibility for financial aid.</P>

<P/>

<P>Appeal Procedure</P>

<P>A student who is dismissed from the College for academic deficiency will receive notification of the dismissal in writing from the Provost. The student may appeal the dismissal to the Academic Standards Committee. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Office of the Provost by the date specified in the letter sent to the student. The Provost will subsequently notify the student of the committee’s decision in writing.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Warning</P>

<P>A student will receive an academic warning when the institutional grade point average (GPA) for a term is below 2.00 even though the overall institutional grade point average remains at or above the required minimum cited above for placement on academic probation. Academic warning is a notice of unsatisfactory academic progress during a given term. An academic warning is advisory in nature, and receipt of an academic warning does not place a student on probationary status or in poor academic standing, nor is it noted on the student’s permanent record.</P>

<P/>

<P>Leave of Absence</P>

<P>In recognition of the effects that childbirth, adoption, serious illness and caring for incapacitated dependents (such as children, ill or injured partners, or aging parents) may have on the time and energy that students have to devote to their educational programs, the College allows students in such circumstances to apply for a leave of absence of up to two semesters during which time they do not intend to make progress toward the completion of their degree (by earning credit at William Jewell or at any other institution).</P>

<P/>

<P>Length of Leaves</P>

<P>Application for a leave of absence may be made on a one- or two-semester basis. A leave of absence for more than one academic year will be approved only in exceptional circumstances. An approved leave for one semester may be extended to two semesters, if so requested by the applicant prior to the expiration of the approved one-semester leave of absence and if approved by the Provost. </P>

<P/>

<P>Application Procedures</P>

<P>A leave of absence for childbearing, adoption, illness or dependent care normally must be requested and approved prior to the beginning of the academic term for which it is being requested. A letter of request should be addressed to the Provost and should provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances leading to the request and a justification of the time requested (one semester or one year). Prior to submission to the Provost, the request must be approved by the student’s faculty advisor and the chair of the department of the student’s primary major. The student should provide a supporting doctor’s statement if it is requested by the faculty advisor, department chair or Provost. </P>

<P/>

<P>Additional Regulations</P>

<P>Students on approved leaves of absence are not registered at the College and, therefore, do not have the same rights and privileges as registered students. Incompletes from previous semesters are not automatically extended if a leave of absence is granted. A student returning from a leave of absence should contact the Office of Admission to arrange for the reactivation of the student’s record. A student who does not return as scheduled from a leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn from the College at the last date of attendance at the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>An official leave of absence will be noted on a student’s transcript; the student, after returning to classes, may ask to have this notation removed. A student who returns after an approved leave of absence should expect not to be required to change to the requirements set forth in the catalog in effect at the time of rejoining the College (as would a student who has been absent without an approved leave).</P>

<P/>

<P>Impact on Financial Aid</P>

<P>Students with outstanding educational loans need to consider the effect of taking a leave of absence on their loan status. For some student loans, a grace period for repaying the loan begins once the student stops registering for courses. If the leave period is longer than the grace period, then the student may have to begin repaying the loan while on a leave of absence. Prior to taking a leave, students should arrange to meet with a Student Financial Aid officer and/or contact their lenders. </P>

<P/>

<P>Student Accounts</P>

<P>Students are advised to check with the Business Office prior to taking an approved leave of absence in order to determine the status of their student accounts. Students are advised that accounts that are overdue will be subject to regular procedures in accordance with established guidelines, notwithstanding any approved leave of absence. </P>

<P/>

<P>Change of Name</P>

<P>The College expects the student’s official record to reflect the student’s full legal name. If a student’s legal name has changed, the student should complete a form indicating the new name to the Office of the Registrar and should provide a copy of a government-issued photo ID or passport that shows the new name.</P>

<P/>

<P>Registration Policies and Procedures</P>

<P>It is the student’s responsibility to comply with regulations in this catalog and other posted registration policies and to enroll in courses appropriate for meeting degree requirements. All students must read and agree to abide by the Registration Policies and Procedures set forth by the Office of the Registrar each semester in order to register for courses. Course credits cannot be earned unless a student is officially registered, through the Office of the Registrar, for courses actually taken. </P>

<P/>

<P>Registration for semester and summer courses is completed by the student according to specific procedures set forth by the Office of the Registrar. These regulations, including specific dates and times of registration, are posted online in advance of periods set aside for registration.</P>

<P/>

<P>Student Classification</P>

<P>Students are classified on the basis of the number of cumulative (transfer plus institutional) completed credit hours shown on the Jewell transcript.</P>

<P>First-Year	0 to 25.5 completed hours	Sophomore	26 to 57.5 completed hours</P>

<P>Junior	58 to 89.5 completed hours</P>

<P>Senior	90 or more completed hours</P>

<P/>

<P>Completed hours do not include hours in which the student is currently enrolled or for courses graded with I (Incomplete) or PR (Progress). Courses with grades of IP for Oxbridge majors are included in the calculation of completed hours for the sake of determining classification; however, the credits for Oxbridge tutorials with grades of IP are not shown on the transcript as having been completed.</P>

<P/>

<P>Eligibility for Registration</P>

<P>Students must meet the following criteria to be considered eligible for registration each semester:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student’s account must show a balance of zero (0) by the final payment deadline (November 1 for fall semester; April 1 for spring semester). A financial hold is placed on accounts with any remaining balance, prohibiting students from registering until financial obligations are paid in full.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody> The student must have met with the assigned academic advisor to be cleared for registration in courses as advised. All students have an advising restriction prohibiting registration until cleared by the advisor.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student’s record must be free of any holds placed by administrative offices (Office of the Registrar, 
Office of Student Life, etc.) when obligations of the student were not met in a timely manner.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students may not register until the date and time specified by the Office of the Registrar for their classification. (See Student Classification above.)</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Cancellation of Courses</P>

<P>The College reserves the right to discontinue any section of any course in which the enrollment is not sufficient to justify its being offered. This decision rests with the Provost of the College but, generally, course sections with fewer than six registered students will not be maintained. Students enrolled in a course that is canceled will be dropped from that course and notified as soon as possible, so they may choose another course if they wish.</P>

<P/>

<P>Definition of the Credit Hour</P>

<P>The College expects, in order for a student to earn the credit associated with a particular course, that the student will spend a certain amount of productive time in activities associated with the course. Such activities often include face-to-face instructional time but are likely also to include studying and completing assignments of the course (e.g., reading, research, writing, laboratory work, individual projects, group projects, etc.). Regardless of the method of delivery or of the types of learning activities or experiences involved, the amount of time involved should average, for a semester-long course, the equivalent of at least three hours per week per credit hour. A course offered over a shorter term requires proportionally more hours per week. For a course that involves a traditional classroom setting, approximately one third of the total time is usually spent in face-to-face instruction.</P>

<P/>

<P>Method of Delivery</P>

<P>In order for a class to be labeled according to one of three categories listed below, traditional face-to-face instructional time must be replaced by online activities (e.g., chats, forums, exams, etc.)
Web-Enhanced – 5% to 24% of the course instruction occurs digitally; may include both synchronous and asynchronous components, the former disclosed in the syllabus and course schedule.</P>

<P>Hybrid – 25% to 74% of the course instruction occurs digitally; may include both synchronous and asynchronous components, the former disclosed in the syllabus and course schedule.</P>

<P>Online – 75% to 100% of the course instruction occurs digitally; may include both synchronous and asynchronous components, the former disclosed in the syllabus and course schedule.</P>

<P/>

<P>Registration Changes</P>

<P>Adding Courses</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students may add courses to their registration through the end of the first week of classes in a semester. The period for adding courses during a shorter term (e.g., in the summer term) will be adjusted according to the length of the course. The permission of the Provost of the College is needed for students to add courses after the deadline.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>A drop/add form, available online, must gain the approval of the academic advisor and the instructor in order for a student to add a course. Prior to the beginning of a term, students may add courses via MyJewell as long as an overload is not involved, consent of the instructor is not required and the class is not closed.	</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The permission of the Provost of the College is required for a student to enroll in more than 18 hours in fall or spring or in more than 9 hours in the summer. Consult the section of this catalog entitled Summary of Charges for overload charges. The permission of the Provost of the College is also required if an unbalanced selection of half-term courses results effectively in an overload.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>A student whose circumstances require registration for two classes that overlap to any degree must submit a Resolution of Scheduling Conflict form. The document requires an explanation of the situation and of the manner in which the conflict will be resolved, as well as the approval of all instructors involved. The Provost must give final approval in this situation.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The placement of a student’s name on a wait list to enroll in a closed section, whether a formal part of the registration process or an informal arrangement between student and instructor, does not constitute a promise that the class will be opened to additional registrations. A student at the top of a wait list who is given permission to join a class must still go through the formal process of adding the class through the Office of the Registrar. (This permission to join a class may expire after a limited period of time.)</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Dropping Courses</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>If a full-semester course is dropped during the first four weeks of a semester, no record will appear on the student’s transcript. After the fourth week, a grade of W will appear on the transcript and hours from the dropped course will be included in the total of attempted hours for the semester. (Grades of W will not affect the GPA.) Consult the Calendar of Important Dates posted by the Office of the Registrar for specific deadlines for both full-semester and seven-week courses. A Calendar of Important Dates is also available for use during the summer term, as deadlines are adjusted based on the length of courses.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students may drop a course anytime through the last scheduled day of class meetings prior to the final examination period, unless an earlier deadline is specified by the instructor in the course syllabus. Students should be aware, however, that dropping a course may have financial aid implications, depending on the number of enrolled credit hours that remain.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>A drop/add form, available online, must gain the approval of the academic advisor and of the course’s instructor, before a student can drop a course. When a student stops attending a class but does not submit a properly completed form to the Office of the Registrar in a timely manner, the instructor must submit an appropriate grade (but not a W) at the end of the course.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Undergraduate students dropping below 12 hours in a semester (the minimum for full-time undergraduate status) must have the approval of a Financial Aid officer before the drop form can be processed by the Office of the Registrar. A student-athlete dropping below 12 hours must also have the approval of the Athletic Compliance Officer before the drop form can be processed.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The drop form does not reach the Office of the Registrar until it has received all necessary approvals; however, the date on which a course will be recorded as having been dropped will be the date on which the student initiates the processing of the drop form. The recorded date for dropping a class is not necessarily the same as the student’s last date of attendance in the class.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students who wish to drop ALL courses for the semester, once classes have begun, must go through the official withdrawal process as indicated below.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Withdrawal from the College</P>

<P>Dropping all courses within a semester constitutes official withdrawal from the College. Students wishing to withdraw from the College for any reason must notify the Office of Student Life to initiate the withdrawal process. A student who undergoes the official withdrawal process will receive a (neutral) grade of WD in all classes that are not already complete at the time of withdrawal. Leaving the college without undertaking the official withdrawal process may result in a grade of F for courses that have not already been completed. A student who receives federal financial aid and who fails to complete courses will be subject to federal refund regulations; see Failure to Complete Courses (under Refund Policies) and take note of short- and long-term implications. The deadline for withdrawal from the College is the last day of regularly scheduled classes in a semester. Hours for courses in which a grade of WD is recorded will be included on the transcript in the total of attempted hours for the semester, but a grade of WD does not affect the institutional GPA.</P>

<P/>

<P>Transfer to Another Institution of Higher Education</P>

<P>Many institutions of higher education welcome transfer students; however, students should be aware that actual requirements for degrees vary considerably from institution to institution. This factor makes it particularly important that students who plan to transfer make contact very early in their academic career with the campus from which they wish eventually to be graduated. By arranging in advance for appropriate courses to be taken prior to transfer, a student can minimize problems. A student considering a transfer to another school is advised that all decisions about the acceptance of credit are made by the receiving institution, that work reflected on a William Jewell transcript may or may not be accepted by another institution as bearing the same (or any) credit, and that credits earned at William Jewell may or may not be applicable to the academic credential the student wishes to pursue at another institution.</P>

<P/>

<P>Taking Courses at Other Institutions</P>

<P>Undergraduate students who have matriculated at Jewell and who desire to take courses at another institution should discuss their plans in advance with their academic advisor. An Approval for Non-Jewell Coursework form, obtained from the Office of the Registrar and completed in advance with proper approvals, is necessary to assure acceptance of transfer credit by William Jewell College. Once a student has completed 64 hours, transferring credit from a two-year institution (often a community or junior college) will increase the total number of hours required for graduation by the number of hours transferred from that two-year college.</P>

<P/>

<P>Completed transferable courses from other institutions will be recorded on the Jewell transcript, but no credit toward graduation will be awarded when the grade in the transferred course is below C-. A course for which only a “passing” grade is recorded by another institution is not normally considered for transfer, unless the corresponding class at William Jewell is also graded on a pass/fail basis. Credit for transfer work does not affect the institutional (Jewell) GPA.</P>

<P/>

<P>Certain study-abroad programs have been reviewed and approved by William Jewell faculty and staff for academic rigor. (Refer to the “Study Abroad” section below.) Credit earned through these approved programs in fall and/or spring semesters is recorded on the transcript as institutional credit, rather than as transfer work, and the students in these approved programs are considered still to be enrolled at Jewell. Grades for courses in approved study-abroad programs contribute to the institutional GPA.</P>

<P/>

<P>General policies governing the acceptance of courses in transfer from other institutions are provided earlier in the catalog in the section of the catalog on “Requirements for Transfer Admission.”</P>

<P/>

<P>Kansas City Area Student Exchange</P>

<P>As a member of the Kansas City Area Student Exchange (KCASE), William Jewell offers full-time undergraduate students the opportunity to take one course per semester tuition-free in the fall or spring at another participating institution, including The University of Missouri – Kansas City and The Kansas City Art Institute. Students must simultaneously be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours of William Jewell courses to be eligible for a KCASE course. Students may incur charges by the other institution, such as technology, parking, lab or course fees. Restrictions on visiting students may vary among the participating institutions.</P>

<P/>

<P>This program provides students the opportunity to take courses of interest not offered at William Jewell. Further information and KCASE forms are available from the Office of the Registrar. Students must get approvals on the KCASE forms from William Jewell and from the other institution in order to gain the waiver of tuition. Prior approval for transferring credit back to Jewell must also be obtained using an Approval for Non-Jewell Coursework form, which is also available from the Office of the Registrar. If the student is within 30 hours of completing a degree, approval of the Provost is necessary.</P>

<P/>

<P>Journey Grant Program</P>

<P>Full-time undergraduate students are eligible to apply for a Journey Grant to fund a life-enhancing hands-on experience. Journey Grants, awarded competitively, will normally be a minimum of $2,000, with the opportunity for additional funds, also awarded on a competitive basis, to support grant proposals. Journey Grants are intended to be an opportunity to make a student’s college experience unique. More information about Journey Grants, including rules concerning eligibility and deadlines for applications, can be found at legacy
<Link>.jewell.edu/journey-grants</Link>
.</P>

<P/>

<P>Study Abroad</P>

<P>Undergraduate students desiring to study abroad for a semester or full academic year must first obtain 
Jewell’s approval to study off-campus and then apply for acceptance by the study-abroad program provider. To obtain Jewell’s approval, applicants must meet the following criteria:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Completion of a minimum of 42 credits before departure.</LBody>

<P>In addition to these criteria, the proposed study-abroad program should represent a well-defined continuation of the William Jewell liberal arts education and the individual student’s academic program. The student’s record (e.g., GPA, relevant coursework) should demonstrate clear evidence of college-level preparation and academic achievement appropriate to the proposed study-abroad program and the specific course of study on that program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Please note that each study-abroad program has its own entrance requirements and criteria, which may exceed the above minimum criteria and which must be met for acceptance to that program. For a current list of approved study-abroad programs with descriptions of each program and its entrance requirements, please contact the Center for Global Studies and Journey Grants.</P>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The last 30 hours toward graduation must be done in residence (through William Jewell coursework), with the following exception: Any student who has completed all requirements for graduation except eight or fewer semester hours may seek permission from the Provost of the College to complete these hours in absentia. This must normally be done through an accredited four-year college or university. A properly completed Approval for Non-Jewell Coursework form must be submitted on which the student indicates that she/he is within 30 hours of graduation. The form will be routed to the Provost for approval before it can be processed by the Office of the Registrar.</LBody>
</LI>

<LBody>Students will normally complete the requirements for graduation in the catalog in effect on the date of their matriculation at Jewell. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>If a subsequent decision is made to follow a later catalog through a bona-fide change in major or
minor or for other causes, this decision must be approved by the Registrar and requirements in effect at that time for all majors and minors must be met. (The same provision does not normally apply to requirements of the core curriculum.)</LBody>

Every effort is made, however, to achieve fair and reasonable adjustments for students affected by curricular change.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Declaration of Majors and Minors</P>

<P>Undergraduate students are expected to declare their elected major(s) and minor(s) through the Office of Academic Advising, if they were not selected by the student when entering the College through the Admission Office. Changes to the declared academic program must also be made through the Office of Academic Advising. Students are expected to keep current the information about their academic program; they should notify promptly the Office of Academic Advising of any discrepancies or changes. If the student has received a Graduation Checklist, the Office of the Registrar should also be notified of discrepancies or changes to the academic program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Student athletes may wish to consult the Athletic Compliance Officer concerning the effect of changes in their academic program on athletic eligibility.</P>

<P/>

<P>Applying for Graduation</P>

<P>Undergraduate students should submit an Application for Graduation to the Office of the Registrar by the time they reach 75 cumulative hours, typically during the junior year. When a student applies for graduation, if not earlier, an individual Graduation Checklist is prepared by the Registrar and sent to the student, with copies for the student’s advisors. A student is expected to use the Graduation Checklist as a guideline for completion of requirements in order to plan remaining semesters.</P>

<P/>

<P>Acceptance of an Application for Graduation from the student does not constitute a guarantee by the College that the student will graduate at a particular time; it merely indicates the student’s intent to graduate by a certain date. Students who change their anticipated graduation date must promptly re-apply for graduation for the newly anticipated date by submitting a new Application for Graduation to the Office of the Registrar.</P>

<P/>

<P>The determination of the actual date of graduation is based upon completed coursework and upon the official records of the student’s declared major(s); graduation cannot be delayed by deliberate failure to submit an application for graduation.</P>

<P/>

<P>Commencement
Undergraduate students who are permitted to participate in Commencement exercises in May include:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>those who finished the requirements for graduation the preceding December,</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>those who are on track with their spring enrollment for finishing the requirements for graduation in May and who have applied for graduation in May; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>those who will be within 8 hours of finishing the requirements for graduation at the end of the spring semester and who have applied for graduation in July.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Eligible students who choose not to participate in Commencement exercises must notify the Office of the Registrar no later than April 1. Students are eligible to participate in Commencement exercises only once, unless an additional degree is earned at a later time.</P>

<P/>

<P>Actual diplomas are not awarded at the Commencement exercises, since degree checks and graduation processes must be completed after the ceremony. Diplomas, which are written in Latin (with a translation provided in English), are mailed approximately three weeks after graduation is verified.</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional Degrees</P>

<P>Students can earn two different bachelor’s degrees (both a BA and a BS) with the completion of at least 30 additional hours beyond the minimum credit that is required for the degree associated with the primary major, the Core Curriculum requirements for both degrees and a second major that is a part of the second degree program. Otherwise, a student earning multiple majors will receive only the degree that is associated with the primary major.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who enter William Jewell with the intent of earning a bachelor’s degree and who already hold a bachelor’s degree from a different regionally accredited institution are exempt from all Core Curriculum requirements, if at least 90 semester hours of their previous work is applicable toward a bachelor’s degree at William Jewell. (For an explanation of what transfer work can count toward a degree at Jewell, refer to the earlier section on “Requirements for Transfer Admission”. Note that credit transferred from a two-year college can be included only in the first 64 hours of the 90 transferrable hours needed by a student to be exempted from Jewell’s Core Curriculum.)</P>

<P/>

<P>A graduate from William Jewell with a Bachelor of Arts degree who subsequently enters the Accelerated-Track nursing program is also exempt from Core Curriculum requirements in the pursuit of the BS degree with a major in nursing.</P>

<P/>

<P>Honors</P>

<P>All honors awarded for grade point averages are based only on coursework completed through William Jewell College (institutional GPA). Grades for transfer credit are not included when calculating grade point averages for honors.</P>

<P/>

<P>Dean’s List</P>

<P>The Dean’s List for each semester will include the names of undergraduate students who have accomplished all of the following by the end of the semester:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>completed a program of 14 or more graded semester hours (excluding any Pass/Fail or audited courses)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>earned no grade lower than B- in any subject,</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>received no grade of Incomplete; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>achieved a minimum institutional grade point average of 3.70 for the given semester.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Citations for High Grade Point Averages</P>

<P>A student who completes coursework for the bachelor’s degree with an institutional grade point average of 3.900 or higher on a minimum of 60 credit hours at Jewell is graduated summa cum laude. This honor is cited with the degree and noted on the permanent record (transcript).</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who completes coursework for the bachelor’s degree with an institutional grade point average of at least 3.800, but less than 3.900, on a minimum of 60 credit hours at Jewell is graduated magna cum laude. This honor is cited with the degree and noted on the permanent record (transcript).</P>

<P/>

<P>Phi Epsilon Honor Society</P>

<P>Undergraduate students whose institutional GPAs place them in the top 10% of the members of the graduating class with a minimum of 60 credit hours at Jewell are automatically inducted into the Phi Epsilon Honor Society and will receive a certificate upon graduation. Membership in Phi Epsilon Honor Society for the academic year is determined after the end of the fall semester for December graduates as well as for prospective May and July candidates for graduation and is based on institutional grade point averages at the end of the fall semester. </P>

<P/>

<P>Graduation with Honors or Distinction</P>

<P>Students who want added challenges of academic excellence may seek graduation with honors in their major fields or graduation with distinction in a field other than their major fields.</P>

<P/>

<P>To graduate with honors or distinction, students must have a minimum institutional grade point average of 3.5 both at the time of both project proposal submission and at the time of graduation and must have completed a research project over a period of two or more semesters that exceeds the departmental graduation requirements. Graduation with honors may be sought in any field in which students will have satisfied the department’s requirements for a major. Graduation with distinction may be sought in any field in which students are interested, provided that students work with a project advisor in that field.</P>

<P/>

<P>If students are majoring in more than one field, they may graduate with honors in each of those fields only if a separate honors project is completed for each major field.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students planning to pursue an honors project should declare that intent in writing to the chair of the </P>

<P>Honors Project Committee no later than the end of February of the second semester of the junior year. </P>

<P/>

<P>Additional information may be obtained by contacting the Provost of the College or the chair of the Honors Project Committee.</P>

<P>Payment Policies</P>

<P>All charges for undergraduates’ tuition, fees, room and board are due and payable the first day of class each semester unless a student enrolls in a semester installment plan. Students utilizing an installment plan must have their accounts paid in full by November 1 and April 1 for the fall and spring semesters, respectively.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students with unpaid tuition and fees will not be eligible to register for courses in subsequent semesters. The College will also refuse to release official transcripts on behalf of students who have unpaid tuition or fees or other educational debt or who have failed to repay an educational grant overpayment, except in response to orders of a court. (However, FERPA provides that a student who is unable to inspect his/her educational records in person may request one unofficial copy of an academic transcript.) </P>

<P/>

<P>Semester Installment Plans</P>

<P>William Jewell College offers the Four-Payment Plan, as outlined below. A $50 origination fee for the plan is assessed each semester. Past due accounts are subject to a fee of $50 each semester.</P>

<P/>

<P>Four-Payment Plan: Payments, less verified financial aid, are due as follows:</P>

<P>	Fall Semester:	Spring Semester:</P>

<P>	August 1	January 1</P>

<P>	September 1	February 1</P>

<P>	October 1	March 1</P>

<P>	November 1	April 1</P>

<P/>

<P>Matriculation</P>

<P>In order to validate student ID cards each semester, students must matriculate through the Business Office. A validated student ID card is required to use many of the campus facilities and services (e.g., library, dining hall, computer labs, fitness facilities, etc.). During the matriculation process, College employees will review each student’s account and confirm financial arrangements. Matriculation dates for each semester are posted by the Business Office. Matriculation ends with the completion of the first week of classes. Failure to matriculate may ultimately lead to administrative withdrawal from the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Requirements/eligibility for matriculation: Students must be enrolled, must have a valid student ID card and must review and accept their financial aid package and/or complete their William Jewell College Installment Plan Application.</P>

<P/>

<P>Refund Policies</P>

<P>Refund policies vary, depending on the term and program involved. Details are provided below. Any student who withdraws due to extenuating circumstances may submit a letter of appeal to the Director of Accounting and Finance.</P>

<P/>

<P>Traditional Undergraduate Program (Fall and Spring Semesters)</P>

<P>If a student withdraws from the College after classes begin, applicable credits for tuition, room, meals and fees will be computed according to the following schedule. Credits for classes are based upon the date the student notifies the Office of Student Life in writing or in person. Credit for room and meals are based upon the date the student notifies Student Life in writing or in person. The following percentages apply to full semester courses:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Change of Course: Prior to the close of the registration period for each semester, the College will credit any tuition charges made for courses dropped by the student when an equivalent number of hours is added. After the close of registration, the credit will be calculated using the same rates as shown above.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Room Deposits: After June 30, room deposits for returning students may be refunded only if the applicant is physically unable to enroll or the College cannot provide residence hall space. Once students occupy a residence hall room, the deposit becomes a reservation/damage deposit held in escrow until the student graduates or moves off campus. Students will forfeit the room deposit if they do not notify the Office of Student Life of their intention not to return by June 30 or December 1 for the fall and spring semesters, respectively.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Summer School</P>

<P>Undergraduate students withdrawing from summer courses (excluding those in the AT Nursing Program) will be credited tuition and fees according to the following schedules:</P>

<P/>

<P>Accelerated Track Nursing Program</P>

<P>The AT Nursing Program at Jewell is cohort based, offering either a 12-month (May cohort) or 16-month (January cohort) curricular path. Once the College commits to the number of students in any cohort, the costs associated with that program are fixed. Therefore, refunds are limited except as provided below.</P>

<P/>

<P>The January cohort is billed in four terms: spring 1, summer, fall and spring 2. The May cohort is billed in three terms: summer, fall and spring.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who withdraw:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>without having attended the first term will forfeit their enrollment deposit.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>on or before the first day of class for any term will not be charged tuition or fees for that term or subsequent terms.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>during the first week of class of the first term will receive a 90% refund of tuition charges for that term. Any fees assessed are not refundable, but the student will not be billed for the subsequent terms.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>after the first day of class during the second, third or fourth term will be responsible for paying 100% of the tuition and fees billed for that term. They will not be billed for subsequent terms.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>In the event that an Accelerated Track Nursing student is unable to persist with his/her original cohort and is permitted by the department to finish the major in nursing by taking courses in the College’s traditional nursing program, the student will be billed at a rate per credit hour set specifically for former Accelerated Track Nursing students. Contact the College’s Business Office for additional information.</P>

<P/>

<P>Student Financial Planning</P>

<P>There are a number of resources available to students to help pay for college. Eligibility for financial aid is determined on the basis of need, outstanding academic ability and/or special abilities. For most students, William Jewell College offers a financial plan composed of one or more forms of financial aid to help meet the financial need. These are scholarships, grants, loans and work programs.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students seeking financial aid on the basis of financial need must complete the William Jewell College Application for Admission and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). It is recommended that all applicants file the FAFSA (Jewell School Code: 002524) by February 1 each year.</P>

<P/>

<P>Limited college aid may be available to students beyond eight semesters. Graduates who return for a second degree will not qualify for college aid. Transfer students will be evaluated individually by the financial aid staff to determine the number of semesters that aid will be available. Various state and federal aid programs operate with established eligibility limits that are available at their respective websites, 
<Link>dhe.mo.gov</Link>
 and 
<Link>studentaid.gov</Link>
.</P>

<P/>

<P>Forms of Financial Assistance</P>

<P>Scholarship and grant assistance, which does not have to 
be repaid, may be awarded based on financial need, academic merit, talent or a combination of these factors 
and may be provided by the College, the federal government (Department of Education and Department of Veteran Affairs), state governments and private donors. Institutional scholarships and grants require a student to be enrolled full-time each semester and maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP).</P>

<P/>

<P>Loan assistance, which must be repaid, also is available in the form of Direct Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Student Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Nursing Student Loans, Federal Direct Parent Loans (PLUS), private student loans and the William Jewell College semester installment plan.</P>

<P/>

<P>Work opportunities are provided through Federal Work Study that may include community service positions. A non-federal work program, Workship, is also available on a limited basis. In addition, the Office of Career Services assists students interested in off-campus employment opportunities.</P>

<P/>

<P>Current student financial aid and scholarship programs and procedures are available on the William Jewell College website and should be consulted for additional details. Student consumer information is found in the official student handbook, in the financial aid award letter and on the William Jewell College website.</P>

<P/>

<P>Employer Tuition Assistance</P>

<P>Students who receive tuition assistance from an employer may have the costs of educational expenses paid by their employer through direct billing or through reimbursement. Students should check with their employers to determine which plan is appropriate for them.</P>

<P/>

<P>Direct Billing: A student whose employer offers direct payment to the College must ensure that the College receives a letter from the employer that authorizes and describes the conditions of such an arrangement. The letter must be on file in the Business Office.</P>

<P/>

<P>Reimbursement: A student attending under employer reimbursement is required to follow the standard payment policy and then receive reimbursement following guidelines established by his/her employer. Under either form of tuition assistance, students are responsible for any portion of the educational fees not paid by their employers. Students whose employers have contingencies on payments (such as attaining a certain grade) are required to pay as if they did not have employer tuition assistance and will be reimbursed after the employer makes payment.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Progress and Financial Aid</P>

<P>Standards of satisfactory academic progress (SAP) must be maintained to remain eligible for financial assistance. William Jewell evaluates progress annually to correspond with the end of a payment period. For most students this evaluation coincides with the conclusion of the spring semester. There are two requirements for SAP: hour completion requirement and grade point average requirement.</P>

<P/>

<P>Hour Completion Requirement for 
Financial Aid Eligibility</P>

<P>Students are encouraged to plan their course loads in order to complete approximately one-fourth of the graduation requirements each academic year. A student enrolled as full-time (12 credit hours or more per term) must complete a minimum of 24 credit hours or 67% of attempted coursework per year; three-quarter time students (9-11 credit hours) must complete a minimum of 18 credit hours or 67% of attempted coursework per year; half-time students (6-8 credit hours) must complete a minimum of 12 credit hours or 67% of attempted coursework per year.</P>

<P/>

<P>Federal regulations require that the maximum timeframe to complete an educational objective (pace of progression) cannot take longer than 150 percent of the published length of the educational program for a full-time student. A program consisting of 124 credit hours, therefore, must be completed within 186 credit hours for financial aid eligibility. The pace of progression is measured at each evaluation to ensure that the student completes degree requirements within the maximum timeframe. The pace is calculated by dividing cumulative hours successfully completed by cumulative hours attempted.</P>

<P/>

<P>The following table indicates the minimum number of credit hours required at the end of each academic year for financial aid eligibility for full-time students (excluding transfer credits at time of entry to the College unless the student is classified as a transfer student):</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>After first academic year (two semesters) – 
24 minimum hours or 67% of attempted coursework</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>After second academic year (four semesters) – 
48 minimum hours or 67% of attempted coursework</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>After third academic year (six semesters) – 
72 minimum hours or 67% of attempted coursework</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>After fourth academic year (eight semesters) – 
96 minimum hours or 67% of attempted coursework</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Three-quarter and half-time student credit hour requirements are adjusted proportionately.</P>

<P/>

<P>Grade Point Average Requirement for 
Financial Aid Eligibility</P>

<P>All students must maintain a minimum overall institutional GPA for financial aid eligibility as follows:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>After first academic year (two semesters) – GPA of 1.5</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>After second academic year (four semesters) and beyond – GPA of 2.0
</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Federal law specifies that by the end of the second academic year (regardless of how many credits the student has accrued), the student must have an academic standing consistent with the requirement for graduation (i.e., minimum institutional GPA of 2.0).</P>

<P/>

<P>Letter Grades and Financial Aid Eligibility</P>

<P>The following letter grades will count for determining eligibility for financial aid: F (Failure); PR (Progress); W (Withdrew from the Course); WD (Withdrew from the College); FA (Failed under Pass/Fail Option); NR (Not Reported). The letter grade AU (Audit) will not count. Hours for repeated courses will count toward the full-time student status in determining financial aid eligibility as follows: (1) a previously passed course may be repeated once; (2) a failed course may be repeated until it is passed. For part-time enrollment, a repeated course may be counted in the total number of hours in assessing the enrollment status as long as the student has never passed the course.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Status and Financial Aid</P>

<P>A student re-admitted to the College after academic dismissal from Jewell is not eligible for College, state or federal financial aid until the minimum overall institutional GPA of 2.0 is met and the required number of credit hours is satisfactorily completed.</P>

<P/>

<P>A transfer student must have a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA to be eligible to apply for financial aid. All transferable credit hours attempted and completed must be used to determine whether student has met the minimum standard for academic progress to receive financial assistance.</P>

<P/>

<P>Failure to Complete Courses</P>

<P>Financial aid is awarded with the expectation that the student will attend school for the period in which the assistance is awarded. If a student does not attend all of his or her classes, the aid must be recalculated based on actual attendance. Students who do not attend a course or courses are not eligible to receive financial aid for the course(s).</P>

<P/>

<P>The decision to withdraw from classes is an academic decision that may have both short- and long-term implications on the student’s ability to receive federal aid. A student may wish to consult both with the Office of Financial Aid and with the academic advisor before making a final decision.</P>

<P/>

<P>The long-term implication of not completing courses is that course withdrawals may result in a loss of federal aid eligibility. For a complete explanation, please refer to Academic Progress and Financial Aid.</P>

<P/>

<P>The short-term implication is that William Jewell College is required by federal regulations to complete a Return of Title IV Funds calculation for students who receive federal aid but do not complete more than 60% of the enrollment period for which they have received federal aid. For more information, see William Jewell College’s Return of Title IV Federal Student Aid. A balance will be created in the student’s account if financial aid funds are returned. A student cannot register for subsequent courses with a balance due. Future financial aid cannot be used to pay a past balance; it must be paid by the student.</P>

<P/>

<P>If a Return of Title IV Funds is calculated and federal aid is reduced, the return of financial aid to the Federal Government will be completed within 45 days.</P>

<P/>

<P>Return of Title IV Federal Student Aid</P>

<P>The account of the student who has federal aid and withdraws before completing 60% of the semester will be evaluated according to U.S. Department of Education guidelines and formula.</P>

<P/>

<P>This policy conforms to federal regulations governing federal financial aid programs. Title IV programs affected by this provision are Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Direct PLUS (Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students), Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) and Federal TEACH Grants.</P>

<P/>

<P>Federal aid is earned by the percentage of the payment period the student completes. To figure the percentage of aid earned, divide calendar days completed in the semester by total days in the semester. Weekends are included, but scheduled breaks that are at least five (5) days in length are excluded. If the student completes more than 60% of the semester, 100% of the aid is earned for the semester and an immediate repayment obligation is not incurred. If the student completes 60% or less of the semester, the portion of federal aid determined to be unearned must be repaid to the federal aid programs.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College will return Title IV aid from the student’s account according to the federal formula. A student may be required to return a Title IV aid overpayment. If the College notifies the student to return an overpayment, the student has 45 days to return the funds to the College. If the 45-day requirement is not met, the U.S. Department of Education will be notified to begin collection. The student will be ineligible for further Title IV assistance until the overpayment is paid in full or satisfactory repayment arrangements have been made with the U.S. Department of Education.</P>

<P/>

<P>Institutional refunds and the formula used to determine the required return of federal and other student aid will be finalized within 30 days of the withdrawal date. An adjusted billing will be mailed by the Business Office to the student’s permanent address on record.</P>

<P/>

<P>Federal student aid programs will be returned in the following regulated order: </P>

<P>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan</P>

<P>Subsidized Federal Direct Loan </P>

<P>Federal Perkins Loan</P>

<P>Federal Direct PLUS (Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students) </P>

<P>Federal Pell Grant</P>

<P>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) </P>

<P>Federal TEACH Grant</P>

<P/>

<P>Return of Non-Federal Student Aid/
Personal Payments</P>

<P>If the student received federal aid, the return of federal funds is the first priority. If the student received state or institutional aid or made personal payments, the state and institutional aid are repaid proportionally according to the source of the payment. Repayment of aid programs may result in a balance due on the student’s institutional account. A copy of the calculation used to apportion repayment will be mailed to the student’s permanent address.</P>

<P/>

<P>Questions about individual circumstances may be directed to the Business Office.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Scholarships</P>

<P>In order to maintain academic scholarships, the student must complete a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester with a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 2.5. Scholarship renewal eligibility is reviewed at the end of the academic year. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.5 will be allowed one semester to raise the cumulative GPA to 2.5. A student who fails to raise the GPA will not be eligible for the academic scholarship. A student whose academic scholarship is not renewed will be ineligible for an academic scholarship until a cumulative GPA of 2.5 is achieved.</P>

<P/>

<P>Recipients of a full-tuition William Jewell College merit scholarship must complete a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester with a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 3.5. Scholarship renewal eligibility is reviewed at the end of the academic year. A probationary semester is provided as well.</P>

<P/>

<P>Only one probationary semester will be permitted for academic scholarship recipients.</P>

<P/>

<P>Financial Assistance for Study-Abroad Programs</P>

<P>The Office of Financial Aid will award aid based upon the estimated cost of a student’s study-abroad program according to the following guidelines:</P>

<P/>

<P>Non-Institutional Support</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Most non-institutional financial aid (federal, state, corporate, etc.) will apply to all approved programs; 	however, most grants and scholarships are unavailable for summer study.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Non-institutional aid, such as student and parent loans, may be adjusted if the cost of the study-abroad 	program is different than the cost of William Jewell.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Federal work-study aid does not apply to study-abroad, but may be replaced by loans for eligible students.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Non-institutional aid may apply to only one study-abroad experience.
</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Institutional Support</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>William Jewell academic and talent scholarships do not apply to study abroad; however, students may apply for institutional support through the Journey Grant program.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Additional institutional need-based support may also be available. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Appeal Procedure for Financial Aid</P>

<P>A student whose assistance is terminated in accordance with this policy may appeal the termination to the Financial Aid Committee. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarship Services at least two weeks prior to the commencement of the semester in which financial aid is requested. A student may reestablish eligibility to receive financial aid, including Title IV aid programs, with a successful appeal. An appeal may be submitted on the basis of a relative’s death, injury or illness of the student, or other special circumstance. The appeal must provide an explanation for failure to make standards of satisfactory academic progress as defined by this policy and indicate what factors have changed that will allow the student to make standards of satisfactory academic progress at the next evaluation. The committee will notify the student of its decision.</P>

<P>Academic Core Curriculum</P>

<P/>

<P>Associate Dean: Professor Gary Armstrong</P>

<P/>

<P>&gt;&gt; www.jewell.edu/core-curriculum</P>

<P/>

<P>The aim of the Academic Core Curriculum program is to prepare students to be both successful and reflective citizens of a global community. Such reflective citizenship demands a broad base of learning skills, a depth of intellectual perspective and ample opportunities to apply both the skills and the knowledge to meaningful and relevant questions that shape modern civilization. Throughout the Core, three important questions are imbedded within most, if not all, of the courses and provide a unifying theme for inquiry: What is real? What can we know? How should we live? William Jewell’s Academic Core Curriculum, entitled “Critical Thought and Inquiry (CTI),” seeks to equip students in an integrated curriculum that moves through three levels for about 34 credit hours.</P>

<P/>

<P>Goals for Student Learning</P>

<P>The Core Curriculum aims to accomplish the following goals for student learning:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>To provide a common experience of learning;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>To engage students – by teaching skills of reading and research, communication and language, quantitative reasoning, critical and ethical thinking, personal judgment and fitness and by facilitating on-going experiences in the fine arts – to become lifelong learners;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>To enable students to apply liberal arts knowledge, skills and attitudes to evaluate authentic problems of human experience in terms of varied cultural and social perspectives; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>To challenge students to grapple with the meaning and implications of the Christian faith and other perspectives on how life ought to be lived and understood.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>The following programmatic objectives provide a guideline for assessing, through student performance, the achievement of the above goals. A liberally educated William Jewell College student will:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>acquire knowledge of, apply and show some mastery of: reading, research, communication, mathematical reasoning, technological applications and the fine arts;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>evaluate the crucial issues of human experience by a course of investigation that brings the academic disciplines together through interdisciplinary approaches;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>think critically about several Christian traditions as well as other vital religious expressions available to humanity;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>understand a holistic concept of wellness that includes the physical, spiritual, mental and social; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>understand the concept of servant leadership and have had opportunities for application.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>The Core faculty use these learning outcomes in their common assessment of student learning:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>written and oral communication;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>critical thinking;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>inquiry and analysis, including quantitative reasoning;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>intercultural knowledge and competence; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>ethical reasoning.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Critical Thought and Inquiry </P>

<P>The Core Curriculum offers students a learning experience that builds through three stages (levels): an introductory/skills level (Level I), an intermediate interdisciplinary level (Level II) and an advanced capstone level (Level III). The following statements provide more information about the requirements at each stage of the program. </P>

<P/>

<P>Normally, a student must complete the four CTI courses in Level I before beginning the first Level II course. Students must seek permission from the Associate Dean to co-enroll in Level I CTI and Level II CTI courses.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who completes successfully a course in mathematics at the 200-level or higher will be considered to have met the Level I mathematics requirement. </P>

<P/>

<P>Level II</P>

<P>The courses at Level II are designed to be interdisciplinary, with the purpose of encouraging learning in reference to relevant questions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. There are four categories of study (Culture and Traditions; Power and Justice; Sacred and Secular; and Science, Technology and Human Experience) in this level from which a student chooses one course in each of three areas. Students are exempt from taking a course in the category to which their first major at the time of graduation is assigned. (See the list that follows, and realize that changing primary majors late in one’s tenure may mean enrolling in an additional Level II class.) </P>

<P/>

<P>For purposes of determining the requirements of Level II of the Core Curriculum, the following assignments of departments and majors to divisional areas apply:</P>

<P/>

<P>Social Sciences </P>

<P>World Language Requirement</P>

<P>Students who earn a Bachelor of Arts degree are required to complete the William Jewell world language requirement.</P>

<P>
Students who have studied two or more years of a language, or its equivalent, while in high school and who wish to continue study in that language must complete the first intermediate-level course (the 211 course at William Jewell) or its equivalent. Students who have less than two years of high school study in a language, or the equivalent, or who wish to study a new language must complete a second introductory-level course (the 112 course at William Jewell).</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who have studied Spanish or French for two or more years in high school and who wish to continue studies in the same language must take a placement test before enrolling in a language course at William Jewell and must enroll at the level determined by the placement test. Students who place at the 212 level or higher in French and Spanish will be offered the opportunity to take an equivalency exam. Passing this exam means that the student will be deemed to have satisfied the College’s world language requirement.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who transfer a second introductory-level world language course from another institution will be considered to have done the equivalent of a 112 course at William Jewell provided that the introductory language course is the culmination of a sequence representing a minimum of 6 hours of study over two semesters. Students who transfer a first intermediate-level world language course from another college will be considered to have done the equivalent of a 211 course at William Jewell and to have met the requirement for a world language, provided that the intermediate language course is the culmination of a sequence representing a minimum of 11 hours of study. </P>

<P/>

<P>American Sign Language can be used to satisfy the world language requirement only by transfer students who have completed their study of ASL as described above before matriculation at William Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>The world language requirement will be waived for a foreign national who has grown up in a culture in which English is not the primary language and who has successfully completed secondary school work taught primarily in a language other than English. Official certification from the secondary school of the language of instruction will be required.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who wish to earn a major in any of the disciplines listed below will be required to meet the above requirement for a world language, even if their primary major leads to a BS degree: 	</P>

<P>	Biochemistry	International Relations</P>

<P>	Biology	Philosophy</P>

<P>	Chemistry	Physics</P>

<P> </P>

<P>Diversity and Inclusion</P>

<P>All undergraduate students who are graduated in Fall 2020 or later are required to have completed two approved Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) intensive courses that total at least 6 credit hours. The approved courses may be from any department, including CTI. </P>

<P/>

<P>These courses may also satisfy requirements of an academic program or other requirements of the core curriculum. Students must complete at least one course in each of the following categories:</P>

<P>•	D&amp;I US – A course that deals with race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age and/or ability within the United States or for U.S. citizens in their interactions with cultures outside the United States. (Sections of courses certified to meet this requirement will appear in the official schedule and on the student’s transcript with a “DU” suffix on the course number.)</P>

<P>•	D&amp;I Global – A course that focuses on the culture, economics, politics, or ecology of societies and nations other than the United States and that will emphasize power, privilege and marginalization or a critical analysis of how these cultures define and express themselves or a course that will deal with general philosophies of power, privilege and marginalization encountered in race, ethnicity, gender, orientation, religion, age and/or ability. (Sections of courses certified to meet this requirement will appear in the official schedule and on the student’s transcript with a “DG” suffix on the course number.)</P>

<P/>

<P>Option for students earning a BS degree</P>

<P>Students who complete a BS degree by summer 2020 have two choices:</P>

<P>1)	Meet the Diversity and Inclusion requirement as outlined in the section above or</P>

<P>2)	Meet the College’s previous cross-cultural requirement in one of the following ways: (a) completing a foreign language course at the intermediate level or higher, (b) taking one of the following courses: COM 358, HIS 103, HIS 104, HIS 229, POL 100, POL 325, REL 115, REL 272 or (c) taking an extra Level II CTI course that satisfies the cultural requirement (CTI 200-224 [Culture &amp; Traditions courses] or CTI 239). Selecting option (c) will result in some students’ taking two classes from a single category in Level II, since a course that is used to fulfill the cross-cultural requirement cannot be used to meet any other requirement of the Core Curriculum.</P>

<P/>

<P>Transcript</P>

<P>Students who have met all of the requirements of the Core Curriculum (the type of program often referred to by other institutions as “general education”) may request to have a notation added to their official transcript that indicates completion of the CTI program. Such a request should be directed to the Office of the Registrar.</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 230 Religious Diversity in</P>

<P>Early Modern Drama	 (4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>In the late sixteenth century, “the Islamic world overlapped with Christendom, and the Ottoman Empire included a huge Jewish population. The Turkish empire was a porous body politic, allowing the entry and exit of various Christians, Jews and Muslims who participated in its economic life” (Daniel Vitkus, Turning Turk, 18). In the early modern period, international commerce introduced England to the Mediterranean world and thus shaped English identity not only through firsthand contact with but also through representation of different cultures and religions. This course will investigate early modern representations of three major faith traditions – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – through the study of literary texts and contemporary critical methodologies. Because international trade informed and shaped much of the early modern experience with the Muslim world, economic contexts will inform the study of literary texts. (Interdisciplinary humanities/religion course).</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 232 Relationships: Psychological, Religious and Societal Perspectives 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 239 Judaism, Christianity and Islam 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>The course offers a comparative overview of Judaism, Christianity and Islam in their comparative histories, varying theological and ethical centers and scriptures. While the course examines all three religions from a single disciplinary perspective (i.e. religious studies), the comparative method invites questions that may only be appreciated by imposing methods and assumptions from other disciplinary (i.e., non-religious studies) perspectives. (Interdisciplinary humanities/religion course)</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 240 Reading the Bible: Then and Now	 (4 cr. hrs.)</P>

(Interdisciplinary humanities/religion course)</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 244 The Epics of Heaven and Hell 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>A study of two significant works of world literature: The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost. Students will appreciate two examples of the heroic epic and understand how each author reads and reinterprets earlier epic literature and the Christian tradition. They will explore the two cultural worlds represented by the poems (high middle ages and early modern) and reflect on how the works provide two different readings of the Christian theological tradition and the Bible (Thomist Roman Catholic and Protestant). (Interdisciplinary humanities/religion course) </P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 245 Evil and Suffering in</P>

<P>Religious and Literary Traditions	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>This course considers how the distinct issues of evil and suffering have been addressed by thinkers who represent significant religious (Christian and Jewish) theological perspectives: From classical theism, to modern philosophical theism, to modern and contemporary theologies of liberation and compassion. Throughout the course, in order to provide a richer, more grounded context for reflecting on evil and suffering, theological and literary texts will be considered. The course ends with a particular literary account of suffering that calls into question various theological responses, in order to stretch the questions of the course even further: What does religion genuinely have to offer us when we are faced with evil and suffering? (Interdisciplinary humanities/religion course)</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 246 God, Nature and Science 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>Students will learn essential features of the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution, as well as religious, primarily Christian, arguments both challenging and affirming the theory. Evolution grounds human existence interdependently with nature, not over and above nature, a status that religion can either endorse or challenge. The course explores biblical responses to the issue of human ecological responsibility, including the study of both “green-friendly” and “not-so-green-friendly” texts. </P>

The ethics and values of philanthropy rooted in the evolution of the third sector, primarily in the United States, will be analyzed. Attention will be given to legal and philosophical issues associated with philanthropic endeavors, including the social responsibility of the corporation, looking at how profit motive interacts with social causes. We will discuss models of philanthropic and charitable organizations, their operational practices and issues arising from their existence and activities. In order to frame our discussion on philanthropy, each semester a major global issue currently being impacted by private philanthropy will be addressed, such as climate change or the global AIDS epidemic.</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 411 Well-being by Design? 	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>This course will explore what structural attributes are needed to make a community strong and sustainable. We will survey some influential social justice philosophies while asking if it is possible to plan for the equitable, sustainable well-being of the members of an urban community. How can these philosophies be practically applied in actual communities in a way that protects individual happiness, community values and environmental capital? We will examine real-world proposals for community planning that attempt to answer questions such as: How are the values of that community translated into a healthy development plan for that community? What factors must be considered in designing the infrastructure that underlies healthy neighborhoods and communities within the urban context? </P>

<P>Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry (ACT-In)</P>

<P/>

<P>Associate Dean: Professor Gary Armstrong</P>

<P/>

<P>&gt;&gt; www.jewell.edu/act-in</P>

<P/>

<P>Goals for Student Learning</P>

<P>Students seeking a major in Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry (ACT-In) will couple the requirements for the Academic Core Curriculum, Critical Thought and Inquiry (CTI), with applied learning experiences from three areas: Disciplinary Scholarship, Reflective Citizenship and Active Engagement. The learning goals for the Academic Core Curriculum are listed in the previous section of the catalog. The goals of the applied learning experiences are:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>to enable students to integrate interdisciplinary intellectual skills and studies with practical activities beyond the CTI classroom;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>to strengthen campus engagement by encouraging individual and collective partnerships, careful reflection and sustained impact on our community; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>to allow students to demonstrate successfully through action the benefits of a high quality liberal arts education by purposefully and specifically making connections between the classroom and the world.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>The required applied learning experiences complement the Core experience by providing opportunity for students to “do” critical thought and inquiry in three additional settings valued by the College. Students will be required to ACT-In the discipline, ACT-In the world and ACT-In the community (campus and local). The major is constructed to strengthen the relationship between (1) the Academic Core Curriculum and the academic majors by connecting the two through applied learning in disciplinary scholarship, (2) the Academic Core Curriculum and programs that lead toward reflective citizenship via the second applied learning experience and (3) the Academic Core Curriculum and experiential learning opportunities via the third applied learning experience. The intent is to reinforce the value-added nature of these experiences in contributing to the overall educational experience of a William Jewell College student.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Major</P>

<P>(ACT-In cannot be a student’s primary major.)</P>

<P>Requirements:</P>

<P>To obtain a major in Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry, a student is required to:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Complete the curricular requirements in the Critical Thought and Inquiry Core Curriculum with a grade of C- or better in each course,</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Complete a minimum of 16 CTI hours in residence (through William Jewell courses), and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Complete successfully three applied learning experiences, one from each of the following categories:</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Disciplinary Scholarship:</P>

<P>Evidenced by completion of an upper-level seminar or research course in the student’s program of study (other than ACT-In) that offers the opportunity for inquiry through discovery, integration or application using the appropriate intellectual tools for the discipline or program of study. This requirement can also be fulfilled by completion of a college Honors Project or of an appropriate undergraduate research project funded by a Journey Grant.</P>

<P/>

<P>Reflective Citizenship:</P>

<P>Evidenced by a student’s actively engaging another culture or issues/challenges of our contemporary world, which may include but are not limited to challenges associated with racial and ethnic differences, social inequities (gender, sexuality, economic), global concerns, environmental or sustainability concerns, or other contemporary citizenship issues through completion of a service-learning project, mission trip, study away, or of an appropriate project funded by a Journey Grant.</P>

<P/>

<P>Active Engagement:</P>

<P>Evidenced by sustained engagement with one’s community (local or college), including activities such as a leadership experience (multiple options), an internship, a practicum (e.g., nursing clinical or student teaching), participation in college- sanctioned co-curricular endeavors, completion of an appropriate project funded by a Journey Grant, etc. The intent of this category is to provide students with the opportunity and encouragement to apply the abstract in settings that have meaning and motivation for them, thus strengthening the learning that occurs in the academic setting of the core curriculum.</P>

<P/>

<P>A complete list of approved activities can be found on the Moodle page for ACT-In or by contacting the Associate Dean. Students’ completion of the applied learning experiences in the three categories is recorded in the office of the Associate Dean for the Core Curriculum. </P>

<P/>

<P>The department offers two majors (Biology and Oxbridge Science: Molecular Biology) and contributes to courses required for the Biochemistry major. For further information on the majors other than biology, refer to other sections of the catalog. Those who select biology as a second major must complete all requirements for the BA degree.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Major</P>

<P>BIOLOGY</P>

<P>The major in biology leads to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Upon completion of a biology major, a student will have been exposed to a broad background in biology while having had the opportunity to explore specific areas of interest through a senior thesis project. A degree in biology allows a student to pursue careers in education, research, medicine, biotechnology, conservation and industry either through immediate entry into the career or after further study at the graduate level. For biology majors, formal admission into the degree program requires the completion of three biology courses of at least 4 credit hours each, including BIO 133 and 134 or the equivalent; a GPA minimum of 2.5 in biology and 2.5 overall; and a formal application including a self-assessment form. Only after admission into the program can students enroll in BIO 360 and begin their four-semester Senior Thesis.</P>

<P/>

<P>The department also offers opportunities for study outside the traditional major. Those interested in careers in a health-related field may pursue a premedicine minor or may add courses appropriate for preparation for graduate work in the biomedical field of interest. Further information is available in the pre-professional section of the catalog.</P>

<P/>

<P>For those interested in applied professions relating to the environment, William Jewell offers a three-two program with Duke University leading to a Master of Forestry degree or a Master of Environmental Management degree. Applicants for this liberal arts/environment program should indicate their intentions at the time of enrollment in college, since careful curricular planning will be necessary. Further details of the program are available in the pre- professional section of the catalog.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who wish to receive certification to teach biology in grades 9-12 in the state of Missouri must complete a major in secondary education along with either a major in biology or a minor in premedicine. Additional course requirements and procedures to be followed in obtaining teacher certification are included in the Student Handbook for Teacher Certification. Specific course requirements for all certification programs may be obtained from the Education Department.</P>

<P/>

<P>The mission of the Communication and Theatre Department is to prepare students to be knowledgeable, versatile and confident in responsibly meeting the complex communication challenges of a dynamic world.</P>

<P/>

<P>The department offers five majors and two minors. Four of the majors — communication, digital media communication, musical theatre and theatre — lead to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. The major in public relations leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. The department also offers two minors, one in communication and one in theatre. A grade of C- or higher is required in each course for a major or a minor. In those courses with prerequisites, a student must have completed the prerequisite with a C- or better before taking the requisite course. Those students whose primary major leads to a Bachelor of Science degree and who wish to add one of the above BA programs as an additional major may follow the core requirements for the BS degree. Students may not double major in Communication, Digital Media Communication or Public Relations, nor may students major in both Musical Theatre and Theatre.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students may receive certification to teach in grades 9-12 in the State of Missouri by majoring in secondary education and minoring in both communication and theatre. Procedures to be followed in obtaining teacher certification are included in the Student Handbook for Teacher Certification. Specific course requirements for all certification programs may be found on check sheets available in the education department office.</P>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>advance equity and justice.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Teacher education is a professional program of study that leads to teacher certification and acquisition of the skills and knowledge required for intentional, effective teaching. Teachers prepared at William Jewell College view teaching as a moral activity that requires reasoned teaching practice including reflection about multiple factors that influence the learning of K-12 students. To produce effective, intentional teachers, the Department of Education collaborates with other academic departments in the College and with schools in the community to provide an integrated sequence of high-quality courses and developmental fieldwork experiences in K-12 schools. This program of study thus produces the following outcomes in students who complete the program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Learning Outcomes</P>

<P>Teachers who graduate from William Jewell College’s Elementary teacher education program will:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>design coherent, standards-based instruction (lesson plans, unit plans, assessments) using high leverage teaching strategies (as indicated by research) that consider the needs of students and is likely to promote student learning;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>implement and deliver clear, effective coherent, standards-based instruction (lesson plans, unit plans, assessments) using high leverage teaching strategies with accurate content that considers the needs of their K-12 students and is likely to promote student learning;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>design and implement effective assessments which produce useful data about their K-12 students’ performance and use that evidence to inform instructional modification and future instructional planning and implementation;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4.	</Lbl>

<LBody>manage the classroom environment to create a respectful productive classroom that promotes effective learning; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5.	</Lbl>

<LBody>become reflective practitioners by gathering and using information about their own performance from colleagues, and from the literature and professional organizations, and collaborate with other professionals to improve their own practice and the institutions in which they teach.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell teacher education programs have been approved by the Missouri State Board of Education in the following fields:</P>

<P>Biology 9-12	</P>

<P>Chemistry 9-12</P>

<P>Elementary 1-6</P>

<P>English 9-12 </P>

<P>Mathematics 9-12</P>

<P>Music K-12 (Vocal &amp; Instrumental)</P>

<P>Physics 9-12</P>

<P>Social Studies 9-12 </P>

<P>Spanish K-12 </P>

<P>Speech/Theatre 9-12</P>

<P/>

<P>Successful completion of any of these programs of study leads to Missouri teacher certification in that field/ grade level and a Bachelor’s degree. Elementary teacher education requires completion of the elementary education major plus content area instruction applicable to the elementary school curriculum and consistent with Missouri DESE certification requirements. Secondary and K-12 teacher education majors must complete a primary major in the content field in which they intend to teach and a second major in secondary education if their teaching field is English, Spanish, music, or social studies. Students whose teaching field will be mathematics or one of the sciences have the option of either completing a primary major in the specific content field and a second major in secondary education or having a primary major in secondary education with a minor in the teaching field. Students who wish to be certified in Speech and Theatre Education must select a primary major in secondary education and minors in both communication and theatre. Advisors in education can provide more information on these options.</P>

<P/>

<P>Because teacher education is a professional program of study, there are many policies and procedures with which students must comply. The Student Handbook for Teacher Education, which contains those policies and procedures, can be found on the Department of Education’s website. State teacher certification requirements change frequently and the Student Handbook contains the most current and accurate information about requirements. Due to the frequent changes in the profession, all education courses must be taken within seven years prior to applying for teacher certification. In addition, courses in education that are more than seven years old will not normally count toward a major. Specific “Requirements for Initial Teacher Certification” check sheets are available in the Education Department.</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional specific course requirements from other disciplines (including specific content courses in the content major or minor teaching field) are required for certification. For further information, refer to the Student Handbook for Teacher Education.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>Pursuing a Teacher Education Program</P>

<P>Because of the two layers of requirements (completion of a degree as well as certification as a teacher), the Department of Education asks prospective students to contact them as soon as possible so that they can receive the most timely, accurate advising. As soon as a student decides to pursue teacher certification, the student should declare a major in education and request an academic advisor from education. Any student can declare the major at any time but, in order to enroll in upper division education course work, the student must first be admitted to a teacher education program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Admission to Teacher Education Programs </P>

<P>Because teacher certification is regulated by the state, teacher education students must be admitted to a teacher education program in addition to declaring a major in education. Procedures for teacher education admission are found in The Handbook for Teacher Education. If students are not admitted to a teacher education program by the end of the second semester of their sophomore year, they will be unable to complete teacher education within a four-year degree program.</P>

<P/>

<P>To be admitted to teacher education, the student must meet multiple standards for admission including grade point average requirements, Missouri state examination requirements and positive recommendations from faculty and field experiences. Students may not enroll in 300-level education coursework until they are admitted to a teacher education program. Students who fail to complete all requirements for certification within a seven-year period must re-apply for admission under the policies and regulations that are in effect at the time of the new application.</P>

<P/>

<P>Transfer Students/Change of Major</P>

<P>Because teacher education is a professional program, education majors are governed by Missouri teacher education program approval and certification requirements (in addition to William Jewell College requirements and our department policies).Thus, there are program requirements beyond what most college majors are required to meet. Students changing majors or transfer students planning to pursue teacher education should declare an education major and see an academic advisor in education immediately. Those students who transfer into or change their major to include teacher education will often need one or more additional semesters beyond a traditional course of study to complete teacher education.</P>

<P/>

<P>The acceptance of courses taken at other institutions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Decisions about transferred courses will be made in such a way that upholds the integrity, quality and rigor of the William Jewell College teacher education program.</P>

<P/>

<P>General Requirements for all Teacher Certification Programs</P>

<P>All teacher education students must meet the requirements of the William Jewell College Core Curriculum. In addition, please note the following certification requirements:</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional Content Courses: Elementary education (1-6) students are required to complete content courses related to the elementary curriculum consistent with Missouri certification requirements. See the Student Handbook for additional information on current requirements.</P>

<P/>

<P>Writing Standard: All teacher education students must demonstrate competence in English composition. The student must successfully complete CTI 102, Written Communication, or the equivalent. If a student does not demonstrate writing competence, the department will require the student to seek services from the Academic Achievement Center and file a Care Team form (see Handbook), and the student will be counseled.</P>

<P/>

<P>Oral Communication Standard: All teacher education students must demonstrate oral communication competence. This requirement can be met either through successful completion of COM 100, Fundamentals of Speech Communication (2), or the equivalent. Each student must continue to exhibit strong oral presentation skills in education course work. If a student does not demonstrate such skills, the instructor will file a Care Team form, and the student will be counseled.</P>

<P/>

<P>Numeracy Standard: All teacher education students must demonstrate basic mathematical competence. In addition to successful completion of the math requirement in the college’s Core Curriculum, the student must continue to exhibit knowledge and accurate use of mathematics in education course work. If the student does not demonstrate those skills, the department will file a Care Team form and the student will be counseled.</P>

<P/>

<P>Advising for Elementary and Secondary Teacher Education Students</P>

<P>All elementary teacher education majors must be advised by an elementary education advisor each semester. K-12 and secondary (9-12) teacher education majors must be advised by both content area and education advisors each semester.</P>

<P/>

<P>Entering education students should enroll in 200-level education courses as soon as is practicable. Teacher education students may not enroll for 300-level education courses until they are admitted to a teacher education program. Please see the Student Handbook for current admission requirements and procedures.</P>

<P/>

<P>Teacher education students will complete a number of fieldwork experiences in schools during their teacher education program. There are varying background checks that must be completed in order to do fieldwork in K-12 schools. At two points during the teacher education program students will be required to undergo background checks, for which there are fees.</P>

<P/>

<P>Formal admission to the teacher education program is a prerequisite to applying for student teaching. Students must submit the Application for Student Teaching form by December 15 for student teaching in the following academic year. Student teacher applicants will receive instructions about how and when to have the background check done as part of the admission process. The criteria for admission to student teaching are stated in the Student Handbook. As noted in the Student Handbook, some state testing requirements must be met prior to student teaching. Student teaching application forms are available in the Education Department office and on the Department’s internal website. A student must be approved for student teaching before enrolling in any of the following courses:</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 401	Reflective Student Teaching Seminar (4) </P>

<P>EDU 410	Student Teaching I for </P>

<P>	Elementary School Teachers (6)</P>

<P>EDU 420	Student Teaching I in Secondary School (6)</P>

<P>EDU 425	Student Teaching I in Grades K-12 (6) </P>

<P>EDU 501 	Introduction to Differentiated Instruction (4)</P>

<P/>

<P>Application for Missouri Teacher Certification</P>

<P>Students must complete the official Application for Missouri Teachers Certificate form on the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website during the last semester of their teacher education program. Students must also provide official transcripts from all colleges that they have attended, as well as evidence of a passing score on the required teaching content test(s) and the required teaching performance assessment as required by the State of Missouri. In addition, the state requires an FBI background check. One of these screenings will be done prior to student teaching, but the process is different for certification, so the student will have to submit to another background check at application for teacher certification.</P>

<P/>

<P>Test Information</P>

<P>The State of Missouri requires multiple examinations and protocols to be successfully completed prior to completion of teacher education/certification. Each teacher education student must attain a qualifying score on each of these instruments in order for William Jewell College to recommend him/ her for teacher certification. Failure to pass early examinations or protocols may prevent a teacher education student from progressing in the program. Failure to pass late examinations or performance instruments may prevent William Jewell College’s Department of Education from recommending a graduate for teacher certification.</P>

<P/>

<P>Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification</P>

<P>The Post-Baccalaureate Certification Program allows those persons who already possess a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university in a secondary teaching field to complete the education coursework required for teacher certification. Applicants to the post-baccalaureate certification program must have already passed required state content examinations and completed required protocols. Specific requirements for admission can be found in the Student Handbook. Post-baccalaureate candidates meet the same requirements and do the same course work as regular teacher education students but can be given credit for requirements met during work on their earlier baccalaureate degree as long as satisfactory grades were achieved, any completed education field work was done successfully, the overall academic record is strong and the course is not mandated to be done in residence at Jewell. The following courses must be completed at Jewell (rather than being transferred from another institution) for post-baccalaureate teacher certification: EDU 270, 275, 280, 299, 305, 308, 311, 315, 316, 401, 410/411, 420/421, 425/426 and 501.</P>

<P/>

<P>Participants in the Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification program should be aware that students who enter William Jewell with the intent of earning a bachelor’s degree and who already hold a bachelor’s degree from a different regionally-accredited institution are exempt from all Core Curriculum requirements, if at least 90 semester hours of their work is applicable toward a bachelor’s degree at William Jewell. (For an explanation of what transfer work can count toward a degree at Jewell, refer to the earlier section on “Requirements for Transfer Admission”. Note that credit transferred from a community college can be included only in the first 64 hours of the 90 transferrable hours needed by a student to be exempted from Jewell’s Core Curriculum.)</P>

<P/>

<P>PRE-ENGINEERING PROGRAM DUAL DEGREE OPTIONS</P>

<P>Advisor: Patrick Bunton, Professor of Physics</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College is one of a limited number of liberal arts colleges that have entered into an agreement with Washington University in St. Louis for a “three-two” dual-degree program in engineering. After three years in residence at William Jewell College and two years at the Washington University School of Engineering, the student can achieve both the BA degree from Jewell and the BS degree in engineering. William Jewell College also maintains similar dual-degree plans with Vanderbilt University, Columbia University in New York, Missouri University of Science and Technology and (only for electrical engineering) the University of Kansas. While in residence at Jewell, students should consider a major in physics, chemistry or mathematics, with the choice depending upon the type of engineering program in which they plan to complete their studies. Since the semester-hour load is heavy, students are advised to plan their work very closely with the official advisor for this specialized program. Care is needed since the student must meet all of Jewell’s core requirements and most, if not all, of the requirements of a major while still in residence at Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>In order to be eligible to use credit from an affiliated engineering program toward graduation from Jewell, the pre-engineering student must complete—before leaving Jewell—the following:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>all requirements of Jewell’s core curriculum;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>at least 90% of the hours required in the primary major; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>a total of 90 or more hours that count toward completion of a bachelor’s degree, at least 30 of which must have been earned while at Jewell.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Any exceptions must be approved by the Registrar, who may consult with the Provost and appropriate department chairs. The student, with the assistance of the advisor, should plan to include in the work at Jewell the prerequisites needed for the particular engineering program the student desires to enter.</P>

<P/>

<P>The student must arrange, while in the engineering program at the other institution, to take courses that can be used to meet all remaining requirements of the student’s academic program at Jewell. The student must check with officials at the engineering school to determine whether credits that are going to be counted toward any requirements remaining at Jewell can also be employed toward the engineering degree.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students contemplating entry into an engineering program following a period at Jewell should be aware that admission to and/or financial aid for the engineering program may depend on whether a degree has or has not been completed at Jewell. For further information, contact the pre-engineering advisor.</P>

<P/>

<P>Pre-Engineering Program of Studies </P>

<P>Courses that are required for entry into an engineering program vary by partner school and by field of engineering. Hence, it is essential that you meet with an advisor who is knowledgeable about preparation for engineering to be sure that you are on track for meeting the requirements. However, most fields of engineering will require the following courses:</P>

<P>CHE 121	General Chemistry I (4)</P>

<P>CHE 121L	General Chemistry Lab (1)</P>

<P>CHE 122	General Chemistry II (4)</P>

<P>CHE 122L	General Chemistry II Lab (1)</P>

<P>CTI 109	Calculus I (4)</P>

<P>DTS 190	Introduction to Programming (4) </P>

<P>MAT 200	Calculus II (4)</P>

<P>MAT 201	Calculus III (4)</P>

<P>PHY 213	General Physics I (4)</P>

<P>PHY 213L	General Physics I Lab (1)</P>

<P>PHY 214	General Physics II (4)</P>

<P>PHY 214L 	General Physics II Lab (1) </P>

<P/>

<P>Additional work will be required or recommended, depending on the field of engineering in which the student is interested and the program that the student desires to enter. Courses from the following list are normally involved:</P>

<P>EGR 120	Engineering Graphics (2)</P>

<P>EGR 230	Statics (3)</P>

<P>MAT 202	Differential Equations (4)</P>

<P>MAT 281	Applied Linear Algebra (4)</P>

<P>PHY 306	Applied Electronics (3)</P>

<P>PHY 306L	Applied Electronics Lab (1)</P>

<P>PHY 316	Modern Physics (4)</P>

<P>PHY 318	Heat and Thermodynamics (3)</P>

<P/>

<P>Students wishing to declare an English major should consult with their advisor. Formal admission to the major requires completion of a minimum of two college-level literature courses or one college-level literature course and one college level writing course, at least one of which must be ENG 330,Introduction to Textual Study. The minimum acceptable GPA in the courses presented for admission to the major is 2.75.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students majoring in English may receive certification to teach English in grades 9-12 in the State of Missouri by majoring in both English and secondary education and by fulfilling all requirements of a certification program in English that has been approved by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Procedures to be followed in obtaining teacher certification are included in the Student Handbook for Teacher Certification. Specific course requirements for all certification programs may be obtained from the Education Department.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Curriculum</P>

<P>Introductory courses: 200-level courses</P>

<P>200-numbered literature courses (225, 245, 255) are suitable for any student with an interest in literature. They cover a wide range of readings and provide instruction in methods of critical analysis and interpretation of written and other texts. They are divided into three categories: Types, Periods, and Topics. Typically, one of these courses is offered each semester and is open to English majors and non-majors. Students may take more than one of the courses within each category if the content differs. These courses do not meet a requirement of the English major.</P>

<P/>

<P>The core: 300-level courses</P>

<P>300-level creative writing courses offer workshops in fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction. The introductory courses are open to anyone; the advanced courses in fiction and poetry are open to students who have completed the introductory courses in those genres. Two creative writing courses are required for English majors.</P>

<P/>

<P>300-level critical theory courses offer the study of contemporary literary theory. ENG 330 is open to all students and is required for English majors; ENG 390 is open to students who have completed 330 and is required for English majors.</P>

<P/>

<P>300-level literature courses emphasize extensive reading within a broad historical span. Their common purpose is to develop the ability to analyze and contextualize literary works within characteristics of historical periods and literary movements, informed by an understanding of critical methodologies. English majors must complete three literature courses at the 300 level, one each in British, U.S., and World literatures. English majors are expected to complete ENG 330, Introduction to Textual Study, before enrolling in any other 300-level literature course, although course instructors may waive this prerequisite under certain circumstances. Non-majors wishing to take any 300-level literature course must have successfully completed at least one 200-level literature course at Jewell or the equivalent at another college or have the instructor’s permission, before enrolling.</P>

<P/>

<P>Advanced literary studies: 400-level courses </P>

<P>400-level courses offer seminar-type intensive study of a specific topic, writer or theme, founded in the practice and methods of literary theory and primary research. Intended primarily for English majors, these courses provide opportunities for students to complete an independent research project in collaboration with a member of the English Department faculty. English majors must have been formally admitted to the major and have completed ENG 330, Introduction to Textual Study, and at least two other 300-level courses before enrolling in any advanced studies course. Typically, 400-level advanced studies courses are open only to seniors; however, any qualified English major who has the instructor’s consent may take an advanced studies course as an English elective during the junior year, in addition to the two required advanced studies courses to be taken during the senior year. Non-majors may occasionally be admitted to 400-level courses under special circumstances, with the consent of the instructor.</P>

•	understand the beliefs, motives and interests
	of individuals and groups in the past and draw
	meaningful conclusions about them;
•	demonstrate a careful appreciation of historical
	context when judging historical figures and avoid
	viewing the past solely from the perspective of
	present-day values; and
•	evaluate cause-and-effect relationships and 
	competing historical narratives, noting the 
	importance of individuals, larger historical forces 
	and contingency in driving historical change.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student conducts historical research. Therefore, the student is able to:
•	formulate historical questions from encounters 
	with primary historical sources and secondary
	scholarly accounts of the past;
•	obtain historical data from a variety of sources, 
	including: library and museum collections, online 
	databases, libraries, historic sites and oral 
	testimony from living witnesses; and
•	interrogate historical data by uncovering the 
	social, political and economic context in which it 
	was created; evaluating the source for its credibility, 
	authority, authenticity, internal consistency and 
	completeness; and detecting and evaluating bias, 
	distortion and propaganda by omission, 
	suppression, or invention of facts.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student presents the results of his/her analysis and research in written and oral formats that conform to the standards of the discipline. Therefore the student is able to:
•	support interpretations with primary and 
	secondary historical evidence in closely reasoned 
	arguments, reaching a persuasive conclusion;
•	present the results of analysis and research in 
	written essay(s) that use correct English and the 
	Chicago notes and bibliography style for citations; 
	and
•	deliver an oral presentation to his/her peers that 
	is well organized, appropriate for the audience and 
	clearly delivered in the allotted time.</LBody>

<P>The department offers majors and minors in both mathematics and data science. Both majors lead to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Students whose primary major leads to a Bachelor of Science degree and who wish to add either of these programs as a second major may follow the core requirements for the BS degree. A grade of C- or higher is required in each course for a major or minor.</P>

<P/>

<P>The program in data science first became available to students at William Jewell in fall 2018. Students in this program all take the same core courses but then must choose an area of emphasis from among five possibilities.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who wish to receive certification to teach mathematics in grades 9-12 in the State of Missouri must complete a major in secondary education and a major or minor in mathematics. Additional course requirements and procedures to be followed in obtaining teacher certification are included in the Student Handbook for Teacher Certification. Specific course requirements for all certification programs may be obtained from the Education Department.</P>

<P/>

<P>All six majors in Oxbridge lead to the Bachelors of Arts (BA) degree and require the successful completion of OXA 100 before the rest of the major is officially entered. Extensive explanations of the policies of the Oxbridge program are provided in the Oxbridge Handbook, which is available from the Oxbridge Administrative Assistant. Under certain conditions, Oxbridge students who do not fully meet the requirements for an Oxbridge honors major may be graduated with a BA degree, a major in Liberal Arts and a reference on the transcript to the discipline they emphasized while in the Oxbridge program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Course Descriptions</P>

<P>OXA 100 Introductory Seminar	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>An introduction to reading, interpretation, critical analysis, writing and discussion at the college honors level and in preparation for tutorial study. The subject matter may vary, but students will in all cases be engaged intensively, with significant critical analysis and writing. OXA 100 may substitute for CTI 102 in the College’s core curriculum. Prerequisite: acceptance into the Oxbridge Honors Program. Successful completion of the seminar is a prerequisite to tutorial study.</P>

<P/>

<P>Tutorial Credits</P>

<P>The number in the first set of parentheses following each tutorial’s title indicates the credit hours that will be awarded following the successful completion of the course (i.e., by participation in the tutorial sessions and through activities described in the syllabus). Upon successful completion of the activities of a tutorial, an equal number of credit hours will be included on the transcript with the (neutral) grade of IP (In Progress) to indicate that further credit can be awarded after successful completion of the comprehensive exams at the end of the senior year. Ultimately, the total credit shown in the second set of parentheses is expected to be earned by the student who completes all aspects of the major successfully.</P>

<P/>

<P>Full credit for a tutorial, including a tutorial taken elsewhere during the Junior-year studies in the major subject, is achieved only when the collection (special examination) paper or related comprehensive examination papers have been successfully completed. A student who for any reason, including transfer out of the college or withdrawal from the program, satisfactorily finishes syllabus assignments and participates in tutorial sessions but does not finish the complete work of the tutorial by satisfactory performance on the collection or examination will have earned only the first number of credit hours shown. Any tutorial included in a student’s Oxbridge major must be related to the comprehensive examination fields of the major.</P>

<P/>

<P>Oxbridge studies in the junior year are in tutorials at a college of Oxford University or in alternative studies, all of which will involve rigorous and challenging academic activities, with a preference for depth over breadth, with the expectation for substantial independence and significant complexity of reading and writing, and with affiliation at an institution of established excellence. Studies in the junior year other than in established programs in Oxford must be approved by the Oxbridge Committee after application by a student and the coordinator of the student’s Oxbridge major.</P>

<P/>

<P>OXS 247 Protein Structure and Function	(2 cr. hrs.) (4) </P>

<P>Protein Structure and Function is an in-depth survey of proteins. Cells are comprised of molecules, and macromolecules called proteins that perform cell functions. Thus, proteins had to adapt to the special properties of water. The conversations will be directed toward addressing the following major question: “What determines the “Native” state of protein in its natural cellular environment?” Accordingly, we will begin the tutorial with a review of the properties of water. Then we will review the structures and properties of amino acids that are the “building blocks” of proteins. Proteins perform most cell functions. Hence, we will focus on protein structure and how changes in protein structure cause changes in protein function. We will emphasize interactions between protein molecules and small water-soluble molecules called ligands. Importantly, these interactions lead to changes in protein and therefore cell function. The laboratory section of the tutorial will cover techniques of protein visualization and protein function. Students will get a broad overview of laboratory techniques to monitor protein/protein interactions and how the correct structure and function are critical for cellular function and survival (Gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, Immunofluorescence techniques).</P>

<P>Pre-Professional Programs of Study</P>
</Story>

<Story>
<P>William Jewell College offers a number of pre-professional courses of study leading to programs at various graduate and professional schools. Admission to these programs at other institutions requires separate application procedures in addition to completion of the types of curricula suggested below. Students interested in these programs of study should contact the chair of the appropriate William Jewell department or program.</P>

<P/>

<P>PRE-DENTISTRY</P>

<P>See Premedical Study later in this section.</P>

<P/>

<P>PRE-ENVIRONMENTAL</P>

<P>MANAGEMENT OR FORESTRY</P>

<P>Rose Reynolds, Associate Professor of Biology</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College is a member of the Cooperative College program at the Nicholas School for the Environment at Duke University. This program (hereafter referred to as the Duke 3-2 Program) allows for qualified William Jewell College students to attend 3 years at William Jewell and 2 years at Duke University and emerge with a BA degree from William Jewell College and a professional Master’s degree in either Environmental Management or Forestry from Duke University. While there is no requirement for the student to be enrolled in a particular undergraduate major, there are certain prerequisites for the program that must be met prior to matriculating at Duke. In order to qualify, students must communicate to the Department of Biology their intention to enter into this track during their first year (preferably first semester) so the Program Advisor can assist the student’s curricular planning and can help to ensure that the student has prepared adequately for the transition to graduate study.</P>

<P/>

<P>The expectation is that the student will complete all requirements of the core curriculum and of an academic major before leaving William Jewell and that hours earned at Duke will count as electives toward graduation. Any exceptions must be approved by the Registrar.</P>

<P/>

<P>The basic prerequisites of the program are listed below:</P>

<P>PRE-LAW</P>

<P>Gary Armstrong, Professor of Political Science</P>

<P/>

<P>The Pre-Law Advising Program at William Jewell aims to assist students who seek admission to law school and a career in the law. Students interested in the legal profession must obtain admission to law schools after successfully taking the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). Any student from any major may seek admission to law school. Most law schools strongly recommend taking a rigorous undergraduate program that builds skills in reading complex material and high quality writing. The Pre- Law Program:</P>

<P/>

<P>PREMEDICAL STUDY</P>

<P>Jason Morrill, Professor of Chemistry</P>

<P/>

<P>Students interested in the study of allopathic medicine (M.D.), dentistry (D.D.S., D.M.D.), optometry (O.D.), osteopathic medicine (D.O.) or veterinary medicine (D.V.M.) should consult with the director of the Premedical Advisory Program. The purpose of the program is not only to help students prepare for graduate study in the health professions, but also to support the College’s mission of providing a sound liberal arts education. The Premedical Advisory Committee encourages students to take advantage of the opportunities available to them, not only on-campus but also off- campus. The challenge to the student is to become a thoughtful and self-disciplined person, who is responsive and sensitive to the needs of society.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Premedical Advisory Program provides advising for students interested in preparing for doctoral work in the health professions. This guidance typically begins in the first semester of study at William Jewell through a course entitled “So, You Want to Be a Premed Student?” (BMS 111). This course is designed to help students better understand their intended career, as well as how to prepare a compelling application for professional schools. All first-year students interested in becoming medical professionals are encouraged to enroll in this class. Regardless of having taken BMS 111 or not, all students interested in the health professions are supplied additional information about their chosen career path, as well as alternatives.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students normally apply for formal admission to the advisory program during their second year of college. Only students who have been admitted to the program are offered a letter of recommendation sent under the auspices of the Premedical Advisory Committee. The committee also provides these admitted students with mock interviews when the time approaches for interviews at the professional schools.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who expect to be admitted to a professional school must maintain a strong scholastic record. The typical course requirements are as follows: chemistry, 20 to 25 semester hours including labs; biology, 10 to 20 semester hours including labs; physics, 10 semester hours including labs; English, 4 to 10 semester hours; math, 4 to 8 semester hours. Students should consult catalogs for the schools that they expect to attend for more specific lists of prerequisites.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Minor</P>

<P>PREMEDICINE</P>

<P>Students who are interested in pursuing graduate- level studies in medicine or related fields take core science classes to help them prepare for the admission process of professional programs. The courses in biology and chemistry that most frequently are recommended make up the premedicine minor.</P>

<P/>

<P>Required Courses </P>

<P>CHE 122	General Chemistry II (4)</P>

<P>CHE 301	Organic Chemistry I (4)</P>

<P>CHE 302	Organic Chemistry II (4)</P>

<P>BIO 233	Cell and Molecular Biology (4)</P>

<P>BIO 234	Genetics (4)</P>

<P>BMS 250	Human Physiology (4)</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional coursework, and not just the classes required for the minor, will be necessary for students to be prepared to begin the competitive application process. (For example, a two-semester sequence in physics is required by most professional schools, and courses like biochemistry, histology, microbiology, human anatomy and psychology are likely to be recommended – if not required – by some programs.) It is also important to note that, while only lecture components of courses are required for this minor, students at William Jewell are normally required to enroll in both lecture and laboratory components. Furthermore, professional schools will expect lab components to be present in these courses.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students with majors in biochemistry or Oxbridge molecular biology are not eligible for the premedicine minor because the requirements overlap too extensively.</P>

<P/>

<P>Coordinated Programs in Medicine</P>

<P>Partners Program through KCUMB (Osteopathic) </P>

<P>William Jewell College, in cooperation with the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences (KCUMB) offers a seven-year coordinated program in medicine (three years at William Jewell and four years at KCUMB) leading to both the bachelor of arts and doctor of osteopathic medicine degrees. Participation in this Partners Program is competitive and is meant to recognize the academic potential of students pursuing a career in medicine. Students who are interested in this program should seek a BA with a major in chemistry, biochemistry or biology in order to be able, in three years, to meet the prerequisites for medical study while taking all courses needed to meet specific requirements for a degree from Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Premedical Advisory Committee, in cooperation with KCUMB, will select up to two students per year for this program. Interested students are required to participate in an application process during the beginning of the sophomore year. A competitive candidate must have a minimum composite ACT score of 28. The committee will also consider a student’s first-year academic performance, community service, college and high school activities and knowledge of and dedication to the field of osteopathic medicine. The Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) will not be required for admission through the Partners Program. In order to remain in the program, students must maintain an overall GPA of 3.25 and a science coursework GPA of 3.5. Failure to maintain such an average will result in the dismissal of the student from the program. Students selected for the Partners Program must complete a minimum of 90 semester hours of coursework at William Jewell College before matriculation at KCUMB.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students can pursue professional study at KCUMB after completing a biology major or a biochemistry major or a chemistry major at Jewell. All requirements of the major and the Core Curriculum must be completed while at William Jewell College, with the first year at KCUMB counting as elective credit toward completion of the BA degree. (Any exceptions to this plan must be approved by the Registrar.) </P>

<P/>

<P>Still Scholars Early Acceptance Program through ATSU/KCOM (Osteopathic)</P>

<P>The Still Scholars Program is designed to provide admission opportunities to outstanding students of William Jewell College who aspire to become Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine. The program is conducted under the joint collaboration of William Jewell and A.T. Still University, Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine (ATSU/KCOM).</P>

<P/>

<P>Under this program, William Jewell students apply to ATSU/KCOM toward the end of the sophomore year. A maximum of two students from Jewell will be awarded reserved admissions to ATSU/KCOM at the beginning of their junior year. Students complete their junior and senior years and earn a bachelor’s degree prior to matriculating at ATSU/KCOM. The advantage for those students accepted into the program is to have a reserved seat (without being required to take the MCAT) in ATSU/KCOM’s entering class upon graduation from Jewell. Still Scholars will be awarded an academic scholarship from A.T. Still University, Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell students may enroll in any major. Applications are available from the Premedical Advisory Program at Jewell and must be submitted to the Premedical Advisory Committee by April 1 of the sophomore year. Eligibility criteria for the program include a minimum of a B in all prerequisite courses for ATSU/KCOM and a minimum GPA of 3.4 overall and 3.4 in the sciences. A minimum of 75% of ATSU/KCOM’s prerequisites must be completed before beginning the Still Scholars Program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Selection will be based upon fulfillment of all academic and course requirements, commitment to osteopathic medicine, community service/leadership positions held and a successful interview at ATSU/ KCOM. All prescribed courses in the baccalaureate program of the applicant’s choice must be taken at William Jewell College. Any deviation from the required courses requires written approval from the William Jewell College Premedical Advisor and from ATSU/KCOM. Participants must complete graduation requirements for William Jewell College in the four years prior to matriculating to ATSU/KCOM. ATSU/ KCOM reserves the right, at any time, to reject a student deemed unsuitable for the program. In addition, acceptance will be withdrawn if application is made to another medical/osteopathic school, if an academic, ethical or moral violation occurs, or if a personal change in career choice is made.</P>

<P/>

<P>Medical Scholars Program through UMKC (Allopathic)</P>

<P>The University of Missouri – Kansas City School of Medicine provides a Medical Scholars program that offers early and guaranteed admission to undergraduates interested in applying to medical school.

<P>Maggie Sherer, Professor of Physics</P>

<P/>

<P>Students interested in pursuing a degree in physical therapy after graduation from William Jewell should consult with the pre-physical therapy advisor in the Department of Physics. The requirements for physical therapy programs vary, but the advisor can assist in the selection of courses that meet the requirements of a specific school or in the selection of courses that meet a composite list of requirements derived from reviewing the requirements of many different schools. The typical prerequisites are as follows: General Chemistry I and II with labs, General Biology (such as BIO 134 and lab), Human Anatomy with lab, Human Physiology with lab, Physics I and II with labs, Psychology (usually 2 courses), Statistics (e.g., PSY 320 or DTS 218), English and Mathematics. Students should consult catalogs for the physical therapy schools that they expect to attend for more specific lists of prerequisites.

<P>Goals for Student Learning</P>

<P>Students who graduate with a major in psychological science will be able to:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>demonstrate a working knowledge of psychology’s content domains;</LBody>
</LI>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>exhibit effective communication for different purposes in psychology.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>The department offers one major, which leads to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. A maximum of 40 hours of psychological science courses may be applied toward graduation requirements. A grade of C- or higher is required in each course in the major. Students whose primary major leads to a Bachelor of Science degree and who wish to add psychological science as an additional major may follow the core requirements for the BS degree.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Major
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE</P>

<P>Introductory courses lay the groundwork for an understanding and overview of psychological science’s major areas. Higher-numbered courses typically delve into one or two key areas introduced in the entry course. The Capstone in Psychological Science returns to a unified and integrated perspective.</P>

<P/>

<P>Because a number of psychological science majors continue their education in graduate school, working toward masters’ or doctoral degrees, the department strives to prepare students for the rigors of graduate study. The psychological science curriculum strives to balance theoretical and practical dimensions by providing the opportunity for more specialized experiences through independent studies or internships. Students have the option of participating in a community mental health intervention program.</P>

William Jewell’s prohibition on discrimination based on protected statuses also extends to all aspects of the employment relationship, including hiring, promotion, termination, compensation, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment. Harassment, whether verbal, physical or visual, that is based on any protected status is a form of discrimination and prohibited by William Jewell’s Anti-Harassment Policy. This notice is issued in compliance with federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination Act.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell has designated its Director of Human Resources (the “Non-Discrimination Coordinator”) to handle all inquiries regarding its efforts to carry out this policy, to comply with federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination and to receive complaints of discrimination.

<P/>

<P>FERPA</P>

<P>William Jewell College complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended. FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. These rights include the following:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to inspect and review, within a reasonable time after the College receives a written request for access, the student’s educational records that are maintained by the College. Students should contact the College office that is responsible for the record(s) they wish to inspect.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to request the amendment of the student’s educational records that are believed to be inaccurate, misleading or inappropriate. A student who wishes to ask for the amendment of a record should write to the official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record that the student wants changed and explain why it should be changed. If the College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student in writing and advise the student of the right to a hearing on the matter. The student also has the right to place with the educational record a statement commenting on the information in question.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to provide written consent before the College discloses personally identifiable information from the student’s educational records. One example of an allowed exception to this right is the disclosure of records to authorized individuals associated with the College who have legitimate educational interests. (A person has a legitimate educational interest if the information will be used in conjunction with the fulfillment of his/her official responsibilities for the College.) Records may also be disclosed to entities or individuals designated by a state or federal agency to conduct audits or evaluations in connection with federal legal requirements.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to be notified annually of the rights granted under FERPA.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The right to file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office of the United States Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>It is the College’s policy to require that all students provide specific written consent before confidential information is disclosed to anyone (including parents and/or legal guardians) besides school officials, except as required by law. Examples of confidential information are academic records (grades, transcripts, etc.), current class schedules and disciplinary records. However, federal law permits us to release disciplinary records to parents when a student who is under 21 has been found in violation of federal, state, local or College laws or rules related to the use of alcohol or a controlled substance. A student may choose to allow disclosure of specified educational records to named individuals with a FERPA Waiver Form that can be completed online.</P>

<P/>

<P>FERPA permits disclosure and verification of directory information, without prior notification of the student, unless the student has submitted a written request to the Office of the Registrar for this information to be kept confidential. Examples of directory information are name; Jewell ID number; local and permanent addresses; telephone listings; email addresses; likeness (e.g., photographs) to be used in college publications; country of citizenship; major and minor field(s) of study; enrollment status and classification; dates of attendance; participation in officially recognized activities and sports; weight and height of members of athletic teams; degrees, honors and awards received; and educational institutions attended before Jewell. When a student has submitted to the Office of the Registrar a signed request for privacy (nondisclosure of directory information), the College assumes no subsequent responsibility for contacting the student to obtain permission to release information in response to a request. Students may not opt-out of disclosure of their name or institutional email address to other students in their classes.</P>

<P/>

<P>Any student who has been “in attendance” at William Jewell College has rights under FERPA. Thus, a student’s rights under FERPA at the College begin on the first day of the first term in which the student is enrolled in any course at William Jewell College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Official Communication with Students</P>

<P>William Jewell College communicates a variety of information to its students. Some of the information is time-sensitive, related to matters such as registration dates and procedures, deadlines for refunds and dropping courses, academic standing and College housing policies. It is essential that all such communications be received by students in a timely manner. As a result, William Jewell College has designated certain addresses as our official means of communicating with students. These official addresses are the student’s College-issued email address, the local address for the semester (the College-assigned mailbox if the student lives on campus) and the permanent home address as shown in the College’s records.</P>

<P/>

<P>The College will consider that it has communicated successfully with a student as long as the communication has been sent to any one of those addresses. Therefore, it is the student’s responsibility to assure access to all of these addresses, to check them regularly for any communications from the College and to inform the Registrar’s office immediately of any changes in an address.</P>

<P/>

<P>Disability Accommodations Notice</P>

<P>William Jewell College pursues a non-discrimination policy with regards to all education programs and employment. William Jewell is committed to the full inclusion of students, faculty and staff in the life of the Jewell Community in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (including the ADA Amendments Act of 2008) and the Fair Housing Act.</P>

<P/>

<P>Under Section 504 and the ADA/ADAAA, a person has a disability if he/she:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities. These activities can include but are not limited to walking, standing, seeing, eating, speaking, hearing, sitting, breathing, reading, learning, performing manual tasks, caring for oneself.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>has a record or history of such impairment; or</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>is regarded as having such impairment.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Students, Faculty and Staff</P>

<P>To prevent discrimination on the basis of disability, reasonable and appropriate accommodations, academic adjustments and/ or auxiliary aids and services are determined on a case-by-case basis for otherwise qualified individuals who have a demonstrated need for these services and can provide appropriate documentation. Information concerning eligibility for accommodations, required documentation and the application process for students, faculty and staff is set forth in William Jewell’s Policies and Guidelines for Individuals with Disabilities at 
<Link>www.jewell.edu/disability-services</Link>
.</P>

<P/>

<P>Any additional requests or questions regarding programs, services and activities accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, should be directed to the 504 and Compliance Coordinator:</P>

<P>Academic Policies</P>
</Story>

<Story>
<P>The Student’s Responsibility</P>

<P>Students are responsible for knowing their academic status and for awareness of the academic requirements, policies and procedures as stated in this catalog. While students receive assistance and guidance from advisors, instructors and staff members, proper completion of requirements for graduation is ultimately each student’s responsibility. </P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Honesty</P>

<P>At William Jewell College, concepts of freedom and personal responsibility are inextricably bound. The College community functions on the principle that each member respects and protects the rights of his/her fellow citizens. Students are expected to possess the values of mature, self-disciplined persons who appreciate the privilege of education and are willing to accept its responsibilities.</P>

<P/>

<P>Although high expectations of honor and integrity apply to the entire College community, the Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct in the Student Handbook specifically address the expected conduct of students. While affirming the highest standards of honor and integrity in all pursuits, the Honor Code for students specifically addresses lying, cheating and stealing. It provides for adjudication of alleged infractions of the Honor Code in the academic sphere through an Honor Council, which is composed of students, faculty and staff.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students attending William Jewell College are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity and individual conduct and to hold one another accountable. Consequently, persons who possess factual knowledge of any violations of the Honor Code are honor-bound to report them.</P>

<P/>

<P>Grading and Credit</P>

<P>Students should obtain their semester grades from their individual online MyJewell account, which is accessible with the student’s network username and password, since no grade reports are printed or distributed.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell’s grade scheme is as follows: </P>

<P>	A/A+	= 4.0 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	A-	= 3.7 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	B+	= 3.3 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	B	= 3.0 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	B-	= 2.7 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	C+	= 2.3 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	C	= 2.0 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	C-	= 1.7 points per credit hour</P>

<P>	D+	= 1.3 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	D	= 1.0 point per credit hour</P>

<P>	D-	= 0.7 points per credit hour </P>

<P>	F	= 0 points per credit hour</P>

<P>	I	= Incomplete </P>

<P>	NR	= Not Reported</P>

<P>	PR	= Progress (extended Incomplete) </P>

<P>	W	= Dropped the course</P>

<P>	WD	= Withdrew from all courses</P>

<P/>

<P>Grade point averages are computed on the basis of hours attempted and the total number of grade points earned. For graduation with any master’s degree or completion of a graduate certificate, the total number of grade points must be at least three times the number of graduate hours attempted at the College; that is, the minimum institutional graduate grade point average must be 3.0. A higher standard may be set by an individual graduate program.</P>

<P/>

<P>All references herein to “hours” or “credit hours” shall be interpreted to mean semester hours, since William Jewell College operates on a semester basis.</P>

<P/>

<P>Different sets of grade point averages may appear on the graduate student’s transcript.</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Transfer grade point average (includes grades for any transferable graduate courses accepted from other institutions)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Institutional grade point average (includes grades for graduate courses taken through William Jewell College)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Cumulative transfer and institutional grade point average (includes grades for both categories of graduate work)</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Decisions involving grade point average (e.g., graduation and academic probation) are based solely on the institutional GPA, which does not include grades for transfer credit.</P>

<P/>

<P>Incomplete Grades</P>

<P>An instructor may choose to award a grade of I (for Incomplete) in any course in which, owing to extenuating circumstances such as serious injury or lengthy illness, a student has been unable to complete the requirements of the course. The decision about whether a grade of Incomplete is appropriate is made by the instructor, who may request documentation regarding the student’s circumstances. The assignment of an Incomplete requires a contract in which the instructor specifies reasons for the Incomplete grade, summarizes the work to be completed and indicates the student’s grade for the course if no additional work is submitted. The contract, including the student’s acknowledgement of the instructor’s expectations, must reach the Office of the Registrar by the date on which grades for the semester are due from the faculty.</P>

<P/>

<P>The student who is given a grade of Incomplete must complete the requirements of the course by the end of classes in the succeeding fall or spring semester, or sooner if an earlier deadline is imposed by the instructor in the contract. Failure to do so results in a change of grade to an F (or to a higher grade, if specified by the instructor in the contract). The student is still considered to be a part of the class until the deadline specified in the contract; however, this continued participation in a course from a previous term is not reflected in official reports of enrollment or recognized for purposes related to financial aid. An instructor can permit a student to drop a course for which an Incomplete grade has been recorded only before the deadline for submission of a grade to replace the Incomplete.</P>

<P/>

<P>An extension of the deadline for the student’s submission of additional work requires an amended contract between instructor and student and the approval of the Provost of the College. An Incomplete grade whose deadline has been extended is changed to a PR (Progress) on the student’s record.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who receives an Incomplete in the last semester before graduation must finish all requirements for graduation prior to the beginning of the next semester/term or else conferral of the degree will be delayed.</P>

<P/>

<P>Repeating a Course</P>

<P>In order for students to employ credit from a course toward a graduate degree or certificate, the grade earned cannot be lower than B-. Individual graduate programs may set higher standards. If a grade below the program’s standard is earned and the course is repeated at Jewell with a grade high enough to meet the standard for the program, only the repeat grade will be used in determining the grade point average. However, the original grade remains a part of the permanent record (the transcript) without being included in the grade point computation. On the transcript, the credit hours earned for the repeated course will replace the original credit hours.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who repeat a course for which the original grade is below the standard for the program but who earn another grade below the standard on the second attempt will normally have only the grade from the latest attempt included in the grade point average.</P>

<P/>

<P>If a student repeats a course in which the original grade already meets the standard for the program, those credit hours will increase the number of hours required for graduation and both grades will be included in grade point computation on the transcript.</P>

<P/>

<P>In order to ensure that the transcript is updated properly, students must submit a Repeat of Course form to the Office of the Registrar when repeating a course.</P>

<P/>

<P>Grade Appeal Procedure</P>

<P>Students who wish to appeal a grade in a course are encouraged first to contact the instructor of the course to attempt to resolve the problem informally.</P>

<P/>

<P>The instructor, and only the instructor, has the prerogative and responsibility for assigning a grade in a course. The only basis on which an administrator has the right to intervene in the grading process is when there is clear and compelling evidence of unfairness. A student’s dissatisfaction with a grade or with an instructor’s teaching methods or grading standards does not in itself constitute evidence of unfairness.</P>

<P/>

<P>To appeal a grade formally, the student makes the case in writing to the Provost of the College that the grade is unfair. The Provost forwards a copy of that statement to the instructor and asks for a response, also in writing. Once the Provost has had an opportunity to compare the student’s statement with the instructor’s response and to consider all the evidence carefully, a decision will be communicated in writing.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students have a maximum of three weeks after the posting of a grade to begin a formal appeal of that grade. A faculty member who wishes to change a grade (besides an Incomplete) on his/ her own initiative has a maximum of six weeks after the posting of a grade to ask for the grade to be changed.</P>

<P/>

<P>Acceptable Progress</P>

<P>The enrollment of all graduate students is continued at the discretion of the directors of their graduate programs and the Provost, consistent with the policies and practices of the individual graduate programs. A student must make acceptable progress in meeting programmatic requirements, must demonstrate the ability to succeed in his or her course of studies or research and must attain performance minima specified by the graduate program in all courses; otherwise, his or her enrollment may be terminated. Determinations of acceptable progress occur at the level of the graduate program. Please contact the director of a specific program for more information about conditions for acceptable progress.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Good Standing</P>

<P>In order to maintain good academic standing, every graduate student must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for all graduate courses taken at the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Probation and Dismissal</P>

<P>A student whose overall institutional graduate</P>

<P>GPA falls below 3.0 will be placed on academic probation by the Provost. When a student is placed on probation, the Provost will notify in writing both the student and the director of the student’s graduate program. Permission of the academic advisor and the director of the graduate program will be required for a student on probation to register for courses. A student who has been placed on academic probation will have this fact noted permanently on the academic record (transcript). Probation will be lifted when the student achieves an overall institutional graduate GPA of 3.0 or better.</P>

<P/>

<P>Decisions about placing a student on probation will not be made until after s/he completes 12 hours or two semesters in the graduate program, whichever comes first. A student on probation who has completed fewer than 15 hours must raise the overall institutional graduate GPA to 3.0 or above by the end of the semester in which the student completes 15 hours or risk being dismissed from the graduate program. A student who has completed 16 or more hours of graduate course work and whose overall institutional graduate GPA falls below 3.0 will be placed on probation and will have one semester in which to raise his or her GPA to at least 3.0 or risk being dismissed from the graduate program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Appeal Procedure</P>

<P>A student who is dismissed from the College for academic deficiency will receive notification of the dismissal in writing from the Provost. The student may appeal the dismissal to the Academic Standards Committee. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Office of the Provost by the date specified in the notification letter sent to the student. The Provost will notify the student of the committee’s decision in writing.</P>

<P/>

<P>Time Limitations</P>

<P>With the exception of any hours of graduate-level course work accepted in transfer to be applied to a master’s or certificate program, all requirements for the master’s degree or graduate certificate must be completed within a five-year period.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who has failed to complete all requirements by the prescribed deadline may petition his or her graduate program for a one- year extension of time in which to complete the outstanding requirements. This extension may be granted by the graduate program, which must then notify the Provost in writing of its decision. The Provost will confirm this decision in writing to the student.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who has failed to complete all requirements for the degree following the granting of an initial time extension by his or her graduate program, but who wishes to continue to pursue the degree, must seek an additional extension by petitioning the graduate program. If the graduate program supports the request, the request must be forwarded to the Provost for review with a letter of support from the program’s director that includes a statement indicating the graduate program has approved the request and with a timetable listing specific goals to be accomplished at various points during the extension period. The letter should also include a request for revalidation of courses that will be more than five years old at the time of graduation. Typically, this extension will be for a maximum of one year. The Provost’s decision will be communicated in writing to the petitioner and a copy will be sent to the student’s graduate program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Leave of Absence</P>

<P>In recognition of the effects that childbirth, adoption, illness and caring for incapacitated dependents (such as children, ill or injured partners, or aging parents) may have on the time and energy that graduate students have to devote to their educational programs, the College allows students in such circumstances to apply for a leave of absence of up to two semesters during which time they do not intend to make progress toward the completion of their degree (by earning credit at William Jewell or at any other institution). The time taken on an approved leave of absence is not included in the time limitations for degree completion.</P>

<P/>

<P>Length of Leaves</P>

<P>Application for a leave of absence may be made on a one- or two-semester basis. A leave of absence for more than one academic year will be approved only in exceptional circumstances. An approved leave for one semester may be extended to two semesters, if so requested by the applicant prior to the expiration of the approved one-semester leave of absence and if approved by the Provost.</P>

<P/>

<P>Application Procedures</P>

<P>A leave of absence for childbearing, adoption, illness or dependent care normally must be requested and approved prior to the beginning of the academic term for which it is being requested. A letter of request should be addressed to the Provost and should provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances leading to the request and a justification of the time requested (one semester or one year). The request must be approved by the student’s faculty advisor and the director of the student’s graduate program prior to submission to the Provost. The faculty advisor, program director and/or Provost may request a supporting doctor’s statement.</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional Regulations</P>

<P>Students on approved leaves of absence are not registered at the College and, therefore, do not have the same rights and privileges as registered students. Incompletes from previous semesters are not automatically extended if a leave of absence is granted. A student who does not return as scheduled from a leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn from the College at the last date of attendance at the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>An official leave of absence will be noted on a student’s transcript; the student, after returning to classes, may ask to have this notation removed. A student who returns after an approved leave of absence should expect not to be required to change to the requirements set forth in the catalog in effect at the time of rejoining the College (as would a student who has been absent without an approved leave).</P>

<P/>

<P>Impact on Financial Aid</P>

<P>Students with outstanding educational loans need to consider the effect of taking a leave of absence on their loan status. For some student loans, a grace period for repaying the loan begins once the student stops registering for courses. If the leave period is longer than the grace period, then the student may have to begin repaying the loan while on a leave of absence. Prior to taking a leave, students should arrange to meet with a Student Financial Aid officer and/or contact their lenders.</P>

<P/>

<P>Student Accounts</P>

<P>Students are advised to check with the Business Office prior to taking an approved leave of absence in order to determine the status of their student accounts. Students are advised that accounts that are overdue will be subject to regular procedures in accordance with established guidelines, notwithstanding any approved leave of absence.</P>

<P/>

<P>Change of Name</P>

<P>The College expects the student’s official record to reflect the student’s full legal name. If a student’s legal name has changed, the student should complete a form indicating the new name to the Office of the Registrar and should provide a copy of a government-issued photo ID or passport that shows the new name.</P>

<P/>

<P>Registration Policies and Procedures</P>

<P>It is the student’s responsibility to comply with regulations in this catalog and other posted registration policies and to enroll in courses appropriate for meeting degree requirements. All students must read and agree to abide by the</P>

<P/>

<P>Registration Policies and Procedures set forth by the Office of the Registrar each semester in order to register for courses. Course credits cannot be earned unless a student is officially registered, through the Office of the Registrar, for courses actually taken.</P>

<P/>

<P>Registration for semester and summer courses is completed by the student according to specific procedures set forth by the Office of the Registrar. These regulations, including specific dates and times of registration, are posted online in advance of periods set aside for registration.</P>

<P/>

<P>Eligibility for Registration</P>

<P>Students must meet the following criteria to be considered eligible for registration each semester:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student’s account must show a balance of zero (0) by the opening of the registration period, unless the student has enrolled in an optional payment plan. Otherwise, a financial hold is placed on the student’s account, prohibiting the student from registering until financial obligations are paid in full.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student’s record must be free of any holds placed by administrative offices (e.g., Office of the Registrar) when obligations of the student were not met in a timely manner.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Refer to information about specific programs for more information about requirements for admission. A graduate program may prohibit enrollment of students who have not been formally admitted to that program.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Continuous Registration Requirements</P>

<P>All graduate students must register for courses and pay associated tuition and fees each semester, not including summer and winter sessions, until the degree is awarded. A student who fails to register and who has not requested and received a leave of absence is in jeopardy of termination. If the student does not register, he or she will be dismissed from the institution at the end of the semester for failure to comply with the continuous registration requirement.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who is dismissed for non-registration may appeal dismissal up to 30 days following the end of the semester of non-registration. If the student does not appeal, or if the appeal is denied, and the student wishes to continue in the graduate program, the student must apply for re-admission. In this case, re-admission does not alter the initial requirements for time to complete the degree or advance to candidacy.</P>

<P/>

<P>Full-time or Part-time Status</P>

<P>A graduate student who is registered for at least 6 hours is considered to be enrolled full-time. A graduate student who is enrolled for 3-5 hours is considered to be enrolled half-time.</P>

<P/>

<P>Definition of the Credit Hour</P>

<P>The College expects, in order for a student to earn the credit associated with a particular course, that the student will spend a certain amount of productive time in activities associated with the course. Such activities often include face-to-face instructional time but are likely also to include studying and completing assignments of the course (e.g., reading, research, writing, laboratory work, individual projects, group projects, etc.). Regardless of the method of delivery or of the types of learning activities or experiences involved, the amount of time involved should average, for a semester- long course, the equivalent of at least three hours per week per credit hour. A course offered over a shorter term requires proportionally more hours per week. For a course that involves a traditional classroom setting, approximately one third of the total time is usually spent in face-to- face instruction.</P>

<P/>

<P>Method of Delivery</P>

<P>In order for a class to be labeled according to one of three categories listed below, traditional face- to-face instructional time must be replaced by online activities (e.g., chats, forums, exams, etc.).</P>

<P/>

<P>Web-Enhanced – 5% to 24% of the course instruction occurs digitally; may include both synchronous and asynchronous components, the former disclosed in the syllabus and class schedule.</P>

<P/>

<P>Hybrid – 25% to 74% of the course instruction occurs digitally; may include both synchronous and asynchronous components, the former disclosed in the syllabus and class schedule.</P>

<P/>

<P>Online – 75% to 100% of the course instruction occurs digitally; may include both synchronous and asynchronous components, the former disclosed in the syllabus and class schedule.</P>

<P/>

<P>Registration Changes</P>

<P>Adding Courses</P>

<P>Students may add courses to their registration through the end of the first week of classes in a semester. For courses offered during a shorter term, the deadline for adding a course will be adjusted accordingly (and could, for a class on a highly compressed schedule, occur as early as the first day of the course).</P>

<P/>

<P>A drop/add form, available online, must gain the approval of the academic advisor and the instructor in order for the student to add a course. Prior to the beginning of a term, students may add courses via MyJewell as long as an overload is not involved, consent of the instructor is not required and the class is not closed.</P>

<P/>

<P>Dropping Courses</P>

<P>If a full-semester course is dropped during the first four weeks of a semester, no record will appear on the student’s transcript. After the fourth week, a grade of W will appear on the transcript and hours from the dropped course will be included in the total of attempted hours for the semester. (Grades of W will not affect the GPA.). Consult the Calendar of Important Dates posted online by the Office of the Registrar for specific deadlines for both full-semester and seven-week courses. A Calendar of Important Dates is also available for use during the summer term.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students may drop a course anytime through the last scheduled day of class meetings prior to the final examination period, unless an earlier deadline is specified by the instructor in the syllabus of the course.</P>

<P/>

<P>A drop/add form, available online, must gain the approval of the academic advisor and of the instructor before a student can drop a course. When a student stops attending a course but does not submit a properly-completed drop form to the Office of the Registrar in a timely manner, the instructor must submit an appropriate grade (that is, a grade besides a W) at the end of the course.</P>

<P/>

<P>The official date on which a student is considered to have dropped a class is the date on which the Office of the Registrar receives a properly completed drop form with all necessary approvals. The official date of dropping a class is not necessarily the same as the student’s last date of attendance in the class or the date on which the student begins the process of gaining approvals on the drop form.</P>

<P/>

<P>Once classes have begun, students who wish to drop all courses for the semester must go through the official withdrawal process as indicated below.</P>

<P/>

<P>Withdrawal from the College</P>

<P>Dropping all courses within a semester constitutes official withdrawal from the College. Students wishing to withdraw from the College for any reason must notify the Office of Student Life to initiate the withdrawal process. A student who undergoes the official withdrawal process will receive a grade of WD in all classes that are not already complete at the time of withdrawal. Leaving the college without undertaking the official withdrawal process may result in a grade of F for courses that have not already been completed. A student who receives Federal financial aid and who fails to complete courses will be subject to Federal refund regulations. The deadline for withdrawal from the College is the last day of regularly scheduled classes in a semester. Hours for courses in which a grade of WD is recorded will be included on the transcript in the total of attempted hours for the semester, but a grade of WD does not affect the GPA.</P>

<P/>

<P>Taking Courses at Other Institutions</P>

<P>Policies concerning transfer of graduate credit from other institutions may differ in individual graduate programs. Credit for a course taken elsewhere must be approved by the chair of the student’s graduate program and by the Registrar in order for it to count toward a graduate degree from Jewell. Generally, any opportunity to apply credit from another school toward a graduate degree or certificate from William Jewell will be strictly limited and will normally not be permitted once a student has matriculated at Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>Completion of Requirements</P>

<P>Each student will normally complete the requirements for graduation in the catalog in effect on the date of entrance into a graduate program. However, the maximum amount of time allowed for completion of degree requirements following a particular catalog is seven years. A student who leaves a program and is later re-admitted must expect to follow the requirements in effect on the date of re- entry.</P>

<P/>

<P>A given catalog cannot be considered to constitute a contract with the student, since the course offerings, requirements and policies of the College are under continual examination and revision. Every effort is made, however, to achieve fair and reasonable adjustments for students affected by curricular change.</P>

<P/>

<P>Notification of Intent to Complete a Program</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students who expect to complete a master’s degree should submit an Application for Graduation to the Office of the Registrar no later than their next-to-last term at the College. Similarly, students who expect to earn a graduate certificate must submit to the Office of the Registrar a Notification of Intent to Complete a Graduate Certificate no later than their next-to-last term at the College.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Acceptance of one of the above documents from a student does not constitute a guarantee by the College that the student will complete a program at a particular time; it merely indicates the student’s intent to finish by a certain date.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Upon the submission by a master’s candidate of an Application for Graduation, if not earlier, an individual graduation checklist is prepared by the Registrar and sent to the student, with a copy for the student’s advisor. A student is expected to use the checklist as a guideline for completion of requirements in order to plan remaining semesters.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Students who change their anticipated completion date must promptly re-apply so that the Office of the Registrar is aware of the newly anticipated date.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Commencement</P>

<P>Students who are permitted to participate in Commencement exercises in May include:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>those who finished the requirements for a master’s degree the preceding December, </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>those who are on track for finishing the requirements for a master’s degree in May and who have applied for graduation in May, and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>those who will be within 8 hours of finishing the requirements for a master’s degree at the end of the spring semester and who have applied for summer graduation.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Eligible students who choose not to participate in Commencement exercises must notify the Office of the Registrar no later than April 1. This can be done using the form entitled Request to Graduate in Absentia, which is available at the Office of the Registrar. Students are eligible to participate in Commencement exercises only once, unless an additional degree is earned at a later time.</P>

<P/>

<P>Actual diplomas are not normally awarded at the Commencement exercises, since degree checks and graduation processes must be completed after the ceremony. Diplomas, which are written in Latin (with a translation provided in English), are mailed approximately three weeks after graduation has been verified.</P>

<P>Financial Cost Information</P>
</Story>

<Story>
<P>The cost of an education at Jewell is of concern to students and to the College. We provide a variety of options to assist students in meeting their financial obligations to the College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Summary of Charges</P>

<P>Charges for tuition and fees may vary in different graduate programs. See below for details. Other fees, not specific to a student’s program, may be incurred for violations of College policy. (Refer to the undergraduate section of the catalog).</P>

<P/>

<P>Master of Science in Education or Graduate Certificate in Education</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>for students beginning the program in Summer 2018: </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>	Tuition is charged for each individual course at a rate of $400 per credit hour.</P>

<P/>

<P>Payment Policies/Procedures</P>

<P>Tuition payments are due in full the first day of class unless the student has enrolled in a payment plan. (See below). Students may be assessed a late payment fee of $50 per term (summer, fall and spring) if their accounts are not paid in full when due. The student is responsible for securing any needed financial aid by the end of the first week of each term.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students with outstanding balances at the end of each term will not be allowed to register for subsequent terms unless they have enrolled in a payment plan and are current with their payments.</P>

<P/>

<P>Optional Payment Plans</P>

<P>Payment plans may be available for different graduate programs. See below for details. If a student’s course of study is disrupted, the balance of the student’s account is due in full. If a student enrolled in a payment plan falls behind in their payments, they may be assessed a late payment fee of $50 per term.</P>

<P/>

<P>Master of Science in Education – for students beginning the program in Summer 2018</P>

<P>Students attempting to complete the Master’s of Education degree in one or two years may enroll in a payment plan that allows them to make monthly payments over the term of the program. The projected total cost of the 30 credit-hour program at $400 per credit hour is $12,000. Students in the one-year program would make 12 monthly payments of $1000 each. Students in the two-year program would make 24 monthly payments of $500 each. These payments would begin on the day of the first class and continue on the first day of subsequent months. The cost of the program should be paid in full before students begin their final summer term.</P>

<P/>

<P>A payment plan is not available for students seeking the Graduate Certificate in Education.</P>

<P/>

<Story>
<P>GRADUATE STUDIES</P>
</Story>

<Story>
<P>Financial Aid Information</P>
</Story>

<Story>
<P>Forms of Financial Assistance</P>

<P>The primary source of financial assistance for graduate study is federal and private loans, although students are encouraged to seek out all available sources of assistance, including grants or scholarships from private sources. Eligibility for loans is determined on the basis of the student’s cost of attendance, other financial aid, annual and aggregate loan limits for federal loans and credit history for private loans.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students pursuing graduate study do not qualify for institutional aid or for federal and state grant programs.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students seeking federal student loans must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). It is recommended that applicants file the FAFSA (William Jewell School Code: 002524) by February 1 each year. Loan assistance, which must be repaid, is available in the form of Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Work Study and Federal Grad PLUS Loans. In addition, non-Federal private loans that are credit-based offer another option to pay for college costs.</P>

<P/>

<P>Employer Tuition Assistance</P>

<P>Students who receive tuition assistance from an employer may have the costs of educational expenses paid by their employer through direct billing or through reimbursement. Students should check with their employers to determine which plan is appropriate for them.</P>

<P/>

<P>Direct Billing: A student whose employer offers direct payment to the College must ensure that the College receives a letter from the employer that authorizes and describes the conditions of such an arrangement. The letter must be on file in the Business Office.</P>

<P>Reimbursement: A student attending under employer reimbursement is required to follow the standard payment policy and then receive reimbursement following guidelines established by his/her employer.</P>

<P/>

<P>Under either form of tuition assistance, students are responsible for any portion of the educational fees not paid by their employers. Students whose employers have contingencies on payments (such as attaining a certain grade) are required to pay as if they did not have employer tuition assistance and will be reimbursed after the employer makes payment.</P>

<P/>

<P>Failure to Complete Courses</P>

<P>Financial aid is awarded with the expectation that the student will attend school for the period in which the assistance is awarded. If a student does not attend all of his or her classes, the aid must be recalculated based on actual attendance. Students are not eligible to receive financial aid for courses they do not attend.</P>

<P/>

<P>The long-term implication of not completing courses is that course withdrawals may result in a loss of federal aid eligibility. For a complete explanation please refer to the section below on Academic Progress and Financial Aid.</P>

<P/>

<P>The short-term implication is that William Jewell College is required by federal regulations to complete a Return of Title IV Funds calculation for students who receive federal aid but do not complete more than 60% of the enrollment period for which they have received federal aid. For more information, see the following section on Return of Title IV Federal Student Aid. A balance will be created in the student’s account if financial aid funds are returned. A student cannot register for subsequent courses with a balance due. Future financial aid cannot be used to pay a past balance; it must be paid by the student.</P>

<P/>

<P>If a Return of Title IV Funds is calculated and federal aid is reduced, the return of financial aid to the Federal Government will be completed within 45 days.</P>

<P/>

<P>Return of Title IV Federal Student Aid</P>

<P>The account of the student who has federal aid and withdraws before completing 60% of the semester will be evaluated according to U.S. Department of Education guidelines and formulas. This policy conforms to federal regulations governing federal financial aid programs. Title IV programs affected by this provision are Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loans and Federal Grad PLUS Loans.</P>

<P/>

<P>Federal aid is earned by the percentage of the payment period the student completes. To figure the percentage of aid earned, divide calendar days completed in the semester by total days in the semester. Weekends are included, but scheduled breaks that are at least five (5) days in length are excluded. If the student completes more than 60% of the semester, 100% of the aid is earned for the semester and an immediate repayment obligation is not incurred. If the student completes 60% or less of the semester, the portion of federal aid determined to be unearned must be repaid to the federal aid programs.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College will return Title IV aid from the student’s account according to the federal formula. A student may be required to return a Title IV aid overpayment. If the College notifies the student to return an overpayment, the student has 45 days to return the funds to the College. If the 45- day requirement is not met, the U.S. Department of Education will be notified to begin collection. The student will be ineligible for further Title IV assistance until the overpayment is paid in full or satisfactory repayment arrangements have been made with the U.S. Department of Education.</P>

<P/>

<P>Institutional refunds and the formula used to determine the required return of federal and other student aid will be finalized within 30 days of the withdrawal date. An adjusted billing will be mailed by the Business Office to the student’s permanent address on record.</P>

<P/>

<P>Federal student aid programs will be returned in the following regulated order:</P>

<P>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan </P>

<P>Federal Perkins Loan</P>

<P>Federal Grad PLUS</P>

<P/>

<P>Return of Student Aid/Personal Payments</P>

<P>If the student received federal aid, the return of federal funds is the first priority. Repayment of aid programs may result in a balance due on the student’s institutional account. A copy of the calculation used to apportion repayment will be mailed to the student’s permanent address.</P>

<P/>

<P>Questions about individual circumstances may be directed to the Business Office.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Progress</P>

<P>Standards of satisfactory academic progress (SAP) must be maintained to remain eligible for financial assistance per federal regulations. William Jewell evaluates progress annually to correspond with the end of a payment period. For most students this evaluation coincides with the conclusion of the spring semester. There are three requirements for SAP: hour completion requirement which represents the quantitative measure, grade point average requirement as the qualitative measure and maximum time frame measure.</P>

<P/>

<P>Hour Completion Requirement for Financial Aid Eligibility (Quantitative Measure)</P>

<P>The quantitative measure used to evaluate progress is determined by dividing the hours earned by the hours attempted. Students are expected to complete 67% of attempted hours while enrolled at William Jewell College. Students who receive an I (Incomplete), F (Failing) or W (Withdrawal) for a course in a semester will have those courses included in the cumulative attempted hours to determine whether the quantitative measure has been met.</P>

<P/>

<P>Grade Point Average Requirement for Financial Aid Eligibility (Qualitative Measure)</P>

<P>All graduate students must maintain a minimum institutional overall graduate GPA of 3.0 for financial aid eligibility, which represents an academic standing consistent with the requirement for graduation.</P>

<P/>

<P>Maximum Time Frame Measure</P>

<P>Federal regulations require that the maximum timeframe to complete an educational objective (pace of progression) cannot take longer than 150 percent of the published length of the educational program for a full-time student. For example, a program consisting of 30 credit hours must be completed within 45 credit hours for financial aid eligibility. The pace of progression is measured at each evaluation to ensure that the student completes degree requirements within the maximum timeframe. The pace is calculated by dividing cumulative hours successfully completed by cumulative hours attempted.</P>

<P/>

<P>Letter Grades and Financial Aid Eligibility</P>

<P>The following letter grades will count for determining eligibility for financial aid: F (Failure); PR (Progress); W (Withdrew from the Course); WD (Withdrew from the College); FA (Failed Pass/Fail); NR (Not Reported). The letter grade AU (Audit) will not count. Hours for repeated courses will count toward the full-time student status in determining financial aid eligibility as follows:</P>

<P>1)	a previously passed course may be repeated once;</P>

<P>2)	a failed course may be repeated until it is passed. For part-time enrollment, a repeated course may be counted in the total number of hours in assessing the enrollment status as long as the student has never passed the course.</P>

<P/>

<P>Academic Status and Financial Aid</P>

<P>A graduate student re-admitted to the College after academic dismissal from Jewell is not eligible for federal financial aid until the minimum overall institutional graduate GPA of 3.0 is met and the required number of credit hours is satisfactorily completed.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student transferring into a graduate program must have a minimum 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA to be eligible to apply for financial aid. Only transferable credit hours will be used to determine cumulative GPA; however, credit hours attempted and completed must be used to determine whether the student has met the minimum standard for academic progress to receive financial assistance.</P>

<P/>

<P>Appeal Procedure for Financial Aid</P>

<P>A student whose assistance is terminated in accordance with this policy may appeal the termination to the Financial Aid Committee. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarship Services at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the semester for which financial aid is requested. A student may reestablish eligibility to receive aid, including Title IV aid, with a successful appeal. An appeal may be submitted on the basis of a relative’s death, injury or illness of the student or other special circumstance. The appeal must provide an explanation for failure to make standards of satisfactory academic progress as defined by this policy and indicate what factors have changed that will allow the student to make standards of satisfactory academic progress at the next evaluation. The committee will notify the student of its decision.</P>

<P>M.S.Ed. Program Admission Requirements</P>

<P>To be considered for admission to the M.S.Ed. program in differentiated instruction at William Jewell College, applicants must provide appropriate documentation of meeting the following requirements:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>A completed Application for Admission, available at 
<Link>www.jewell.edu/apply</Link>
.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Must be a certified educator currently employed in a school in the United States and must provide the following:</LBody>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>An official transcript from a regionally- accredited college or university showing the awarding of a bachelor’s degree, with a minimum of a 3.0 overall GPA based on a 4.0 scale.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Official transcripts from all other colleges and universities attended, whether as an undergraduate or graduate student and whether or not credit was awarded.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Two professional recommendations, one from an administrative supervisor and the second from a colleague or other supervisor.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>A professional résumé/curriculum vitae.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Applications are encouraged from any student meeting these standards regardless of age, disability, gender, national origin, race/color, religion, sex, sexual orientation or veteran status.</P>

<P/>

<P>The master’s program is designed for cohorts that begin courses in the summer. The deadline for the receipt of the application is May 1, and the deadline for the receipt of all other materials from those applying for entry into each summer’s cohort is the fourth Monday of May.</P>

<P/>

<P>The College reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant whose academic history or personal qualifications are judged to be unsuitable for graduate work at William Jewell College.</P>

<P/>

<P>Graduate Certificate in Differentiated Instruction</P>

<P>The admission requirements for the Graduate Certificate in differentiated instruction are identical to those for admission to the M.S.Ed. program. There are no deadlines for application to the Graduate Certificate option, although applicants must be admitted at least one week prior to the start of a given term and there must be space remaining in the desired courses.</P>

<P/>

<P>If a student desires to change his/her program selection (from M.S.Ed. to certificate or vice versa) after admission, the student must resubmit an application noting the changed status desired and submit a transcript of any non-Jewell coursework completed since the initial application.</P>

<P/>

<P>Transfer Admission to the Program </P>

<P>There is no transfer admission to the Master of Science in Education program in the sense that all applicants to this program are considered to be first-time graduate applicants.</P>

<P/>

<P>Applicants can request to have a maximum of 6 credits of graduate-level course work in education from another institution transferred into the program by first arranging to have an official transcript sent to the M.S.Ed. Program Coordinator. If the transfer coursework is deemed by the Education faculty to be equivalent to required work in the program, then the credit will be forwarded to the Registrar for approval. No more than 6 credits of transfer credit can apply toward the M.S.Ed. degree from William Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>Requirements for Re-admission to the Program</P>

<P>Continuous enrollment is expected in the M.S.Ed. program, the schedule for which is dependent upon the one-year or two-year or graduate- certificate option selected by the student. Refer to the College’s policy on leaves of absence for possible exceptions.</P>

<P/>

<P>A student who has been away from the College during a fall or spring semester without an approved leave of absence, or who has enrolled in coursework elsewhere during an approved leave of absence, is required to reapply for admission to the M.S.Ed. program. This can be accomplished by completing the M.S.Ed. Application for Admission. Re-admission to the program is required before the student can enroll in any additional courses.</P>

<P/>

<P>International Student Application to the Program</P>

<P>All admission policies, documents, credentials, timetables and requirements for domestic students apply to international students.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College recognizes degrees from properly accredited international schools and colleges once appropriate official documentation is received and, if necessary, translated. Students who have earned college- level credit at institutions outside the United States must normally submit a transcript for such work for evaluation on a course-by-course basis to a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (
<Link>www.naces.org</Link>
), with results to be forwarded directly to William Jewell.</P>

<P>Course Descriptions</P>

<P>EDU 501 Introduction to</P>

<P>Differentiated Instruction	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>A course in which the four essential principles of differentiated instruction (environment, curriculum, instruction and assessment) will be studied against real classroom applications. Emphasis will be given to acquisition of a growth mindset and knowledge and skills that promote growth and a growth mindset in individual K-12 students. Differentiated instruction concepts of readiness, interests and learning profile will be explored in depth including how teachers meet specific student needs, including low SES (Socioeconomic Status) and ELL (English Language Learner) students, through regular instruction. The essentials of UBD (Understanding By Design) and Standards Based instruction will be reviewed to facilitate effective instructional planning for differentiation.</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 502 Differentiated</P>

<P>Instruction Toolkit	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>A course in which teachers will acquire and apply research-based differentiated teaching methodologies and strategies. Teachers will understand how to use assessment data and contextual information to inform individualized and group instructional planning and implementation. Teachers will learn how to create flexible activities and assignments that assist every student to achieve instructional objectives and how to create a classroom environment that allows for students to work toward the same objectives in different ways.</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 503 Effective Assessment and</P>

<P>Data Use to Improve Instruction	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>This course explores how assessment informs differentiated instruction and how assessments can be adapted for a variety of learners while still helping all students to achieve the same instructional objectives. Class members will explore a variety of assessment techniques that teachers can use to obtain information to drive instructional planning and modification. The practice of standards-based teaching to mastery will be examined including how to define different, sequential, levels of student performance and strategies for helping students to direct their own learning to accomplish instructional objectives (to learn at increasingly higher levels).</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 504 Meeting the Needs</P>

<P>of Every Student	(3 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>This course builds on the basic structures of differentiated instruction to explore the readiness needs of specific populations in the classroom based on student life attributes. A variety of student needs will be examined but the course will pay particular attention to debunking stereotypes in order to consider the needs of children/adolescents whose lives are influenced by environmental factors such as poverty and homelessness and by individual characteristics such as language and diagnosed or undiagnosed learning status. Teachers in this class will refine their system for considering the needs of every student in the class and build their ability to develop challenging tasks for every learner.</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 601 Defining Research</P>

<P>in Education	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>A course in which teachers will explore how to conduct research in their own classroom in the context of differentiated instruction. The essential elements of teacher action research will be studied. Teachers will identify a classroom problem that could be addressed through differentiated instruction and explore research designs that might help them to study that practice.</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 602 Teacher Action Research	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>Teachers in this course will apply knowledge of action research to design and implement an original action research study. Teachers will identify a problem, design an action research study and collect and analyze data in order to improve their students’ learning outcomes.</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 603 Research Analysis,</P>

<P>Synthesis and Presentation	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>Teachers will analyze data from action research projects involving their own students and synthesize their results for presentation to colleagues and other education professionals. Topics studied will include: techniques for analyzing qualitative and quantitative data, strategies for representing results in a research study and methods for determining the effectiveness of interventions. Teachers will discuss the findings and implications of their research in a completed action research study fit for publication, presentation to building/ district leadership or use in professional development workshops.</P>

<P/>

<P>EDU 610 Special Topics</P>

<P>in Education	(3 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>A graduate level course providing students the opportunity to study educational topics of interest or related to the teaching profession. Topics will vary and the course may be taken more than once under a different topic. Students will engage in in-depth study and analysis of a current topic or practice in education as approved by the instructor. Study and analysis is broadly construed in order to facilitate a variety of student projects (i.e., documentary research and historical analysis; applying psychological theories to educational practice; analysis of public policy; comparative educational practices, etc.).</P>
