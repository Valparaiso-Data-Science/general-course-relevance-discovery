Sponsors may enter into a pre-established contract provided by Regis University.  For more information on the initial set-up, please contact the Sponsored Billing Representative at 303-458-4079. Students should consult with their employer or sponsor to determine if a direct billing agreement has been established with Regis University. Once the direct billing arrangement has been set-up with the University, Regis will directly bill the sponsor once proof from the sponsorship is received.  Such proof can be a financial guarantee letter from the employer that includes student name, student ID, course title(s), tuition amount, name, address, and contact information on where the bill should be sent. The financial guarantee letter should be submitted to the Office of Student Accounts by the tuition due date to be accepted.  It is the student’s responsibility to facilitate the submission of proof for each term.  If the sponsor does not pay the balance owed, the financial obligation will then be the responsibility of the student.  The student will be obligated to meet the University’s financial policies outlined in this Catalog.  If the sponsor payment is not sufficient to cover tuition and fees, the student will have to either pay their portion or make payment arrangements by the due date for that class. Sponsored Billing is NOT tuition reimbursement.  Tuition reimbursement means that the student is responsible for paying the tuition and is reimbursed at a later time by the employer.  REFUNDS Financial Aid Refunds When financial aid is disbursed into the student account, it will be applied to tuition and fees. If a credit balance exists after tuition and fees are paid, a refund check will be mailed to the student within 14 days from the date funds are credited to the student account. The student may request that funds be deposited directly into his or her bank account by electing this option via the Ranger Portal.  Information regarding the Direct Deposit option is located on WebAdvisor/Student Accounts/Banking Information. By federal regulation, PLUS credit balances are paid to the parent unless the parent authorizes Regis University in writing to release the credit balance to the student. The Parent's PLUS Refund Authorization form can be found at www.regis.edu/studentaccounts,   Withdrawal and Proration of Tuition Students who withdraw from courses after the add/drop period may qualify for a partial credit of tuition. Credits are calculated at rates established for each week. Withdrawal procedures vary depending on the student’s college and level. Information about withdrawal procedures and deadlines is available in this section of the Catalog under Academic Records and Registration ‘Withdrawal’ heading. The date the online Withdrawal Form is submitted will be used to determine the amount of credit, if applicable. Students are also obligated to return financial aid funds under the Title IV Federal Regulations. Due to this obligation, Regis University returns in accordance with Return of Title IV Funds regulations back to the Department of Education creating a chargeback on the student’s account.  The student will have to pay Regis University directly for all financial aid chargebacks that occur on the student’s account.  Please contact the Office of Financial Aid for information on how withdrawals can affect financial aid.  The following tables show the amount of credit students will receive depending on the length of the term. Variable course credit are not shown and may vary. 5 Week Courses Week 1  100% Week 2  60% Week 3  40% Week 4  0% Week 5*  0%  8 Week Courses Week 1  100% Week 2  80% Week 3  40% Week 4  20% Week 5-6 0% Week 7-8* 0% Semester Courses Week 1  100% Week 2  80% Week 3  60% Week 4  40% Week 5  20% Week 6-12 0% Week 13-16* 0% * *Students cannot withdraw from a course during these time periods.  Other Refunds If a valid credit balance exists on a student’s account because of a withdrawal from a class, adjustments, and/or over-payments, a refund will be generated or applied to future course tuition and fees. If the student paid by credit card, the refund will be returned to the credit card.   CREDIT BALANCE HOLD REQUESTS If the student wants a credit balance to be held in the student’s account, the Credit Balance Hold form must be completed and can be found at www.regis.edu/studentaccounts.  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  42  PAYMENT POLICY, DUE DATES, AND PAYMENT OPTIONS TRADITIONAL SEMESTER-BASED PROGRAMS Semester-based programs include the following:  Regis College Undergraduate College of Computer & Information Sciences Traditional Undergraduate Anderson College of Business Traditional Undergraduate Traditional Nursing Program Traditional Health Care Administration Traditional Health Exercise Science Traditional Foundations in Pharmacy Tuition and fees are due on the first day of the month prior to the start of the academic period.

TRANSFER/COMPETENCY-BASED CREDIT  Transfer credit is awarded for course work (undergraduate and graduate) completed at other colleges and universities that are accredited by a regional accrediting association. The seven regional accrediting associations are:  Higher Learning Commission (HLC)  Middle State Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE)  New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission of Institutions of Higher Education (NEASC-CHIE)  Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)  Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges (SACS-COC)  Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Senior College and University Commission (WASC-SCUC)  Western Association Of Schools and Colleges, Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (WASC-ACCJC) UNDERGRADUATE TRANSFER CREDIT An official evaluation of undergraduate transfer credit will be completed only after all admissions requirements have been met, formal admission to the University has been granted, and the student has submitted the required official credentials. Any evaluation of transfer credit completed prior to meeting all these conditions is considered unofficial. A maximum of 90 semester hours may transfer to Regis University. Quarter hours are converted to semester hours by using a 3:2 ratio. Undergraduate transfer is accepted only for courses in which a grade of “C-” or better is earned. Course work is evaluated on a course-by-course basis. Transfer course equivalency is based on a review of the course description from the originating institution and are equated to a Regis course whenever possible. Otherwise, acceptable transfer courses are assigned an appropriate department prefix and course level as assigned by the originating institution (upper division ‘UD’ or lower division ‘LD’).   Additional information such as a syllabus may be required if an equivalency cannot be established by the course description. Technical credit from a regionally accredited or some nationally accredited institution may be evaluated and accepted as general elective credit. Technical credit is defined as college-level credit in the practical, industrial or mechanical arts or the applied sciences. A maximum of 24 semester hours of Technical Occupational Specialty (TOS) credit are allowed to transfer as undergraduate general elective credit. Not all Regis University programs accept technical credit toward degree completion or accept the maximum of 24 semester hours. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  44  Courses not eligible for transfer include remedial or developmental courses and college orientation courses.   Credit through Examination Awarding of credit through exam is available through the following national standardized exams:  College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations  College Level Examination Program (CLEP),   DSST Exams  International Baccalaureate Program (IB) A complete list of exams, passing scores required, and Regis equivalencies and/or placement can be found on regis.edu/Academics/SDS-UT/Testing-Center.aspx. Minimum scores required for awarding of credit and/or placement is established by the University. NOTE: Students in Regis College require both their advisor and Dean approval to take CLEP exams. Students can replace no more than two lower division courses with CLEP credit. Since the Regis College core curriculum emphasizes prolonged classroom interaction in a semester-long format, CLEP credit earning options are not encouraged.  Military Credit Military training and Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) credit is awarded based on recommendation from the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide for Educational Experiences in the Armed Services. Students are awarded four semester hours of physical education credit for completing basic training and two semester hours of military science credit for a minimum of two years of service in any branch of the military.

Students can request a transcript through ACE Credit Registry and Transcript System.  GRADUATE TRANSFER CREDIT Graduate transfer is accepted only for courses in which a grade of “B-” or better is earned. Quarter hours are converted to semester hours by using a 3:2 ratio.  A maximum of six semester hours may be awarded based on recommendations by the American Council on Education (ACE) National Guide to College Credit for Workforce Training or by the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide for Educational Experiences in the Armed Services. The credit must be recommended for graduate-level credit and must be appropriate for graduate degree requirements.  Of the total semester hours required for any one of the graduate degree programs, no more than 20% of the total semester hours required may include transfer or competency-based course work or course work included in a previously earned graduate degree from a transfer institution or from Regis University.  After careful review of the graduate course content, transfer credit is approved by the dean or designee of each graduate program. Only credit completed within the last ten years is eligible for transfer consideration. Transferable graduate work is equated to Regis courses when possible.  Graduate degree programs may have more restrictive or more specific transfer credit policies in addition to the general policies stated above. Specific transfer policies appear in the appropriate graduate degree section of this Catalog.  UNIT OF CREDIT The unit of credit at Regis University is the semester hour. Throughout this Catalog, references to “hours” of University credit or “credit hours” are intended to denote semester credit hours unless otherwise clearly noted.

XXX(E-W)  Courses that are grouped under a broad topic or theme of study, with allowance for repeatability under different sub-topics and letter designations.  COURSE PREFIX DESIGNATION In addition to the number identifying where a course fits within a discipline, each course is assigned a prefix that identifies the appropriate discipline, field, or department. For example, the numerical designations for courses in Chemistry are preceded by CH, in English by EN, and in Religious Studies by RS.  ADD/DROP Students may add/drop courses through the end of the published add/drop period for each term/semester online through WebAdvisor, in person, by phone, or at any Regis University site. When students drop a course within the add/drop period, the course does not appear on the transcript and tuition charges are credited to the account. Course may not be added or dropped after the final day of the designated add/drop period. See withdrawal process listed below. Each student is responsible for completing, dropping, or withdrawing from all courses listed on his or her schedule. The schedule is retained in the Academic Records and Registration office on the database system and on WebAdvisor. Credit is given only for courses that appear on the schedule. Students who are registered and fail to attend receive a grade of “F” for the courses.  CLASS ATTENDANCE Students are expected to make every effort to attend all class meetings. Attendance standards for individual courses are established in writing by the instructor at the first class session. Students unable to attend the first class must contact the instructor ahead of time.   ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS/CLASS Final examinations may be given at the end of each academic period. Students who miss a final examination, or who fail to submit all required work without a justifiable excuse, are awarded a grade based on all course requirements. Students who are unable to take a final examination or complete final course requirements for a valid reason (i.e., circumstances beyond the student’s control) must request in writing to the instructor a grade of incomplete (I). The “I” grade must be removed within a specified period of time or the alternate grade is assigned. More information can be found under the “Grading” heading in this section of the Catalog.  WITHDRAWAL Students are permitted to withdraw from an individual course, from all courses for an academic period, or from their program. The official date of withdrawal is the day the withdrawal form is submitted and/or received by the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The student receives a grade of “W” in the course. The grade is reflected on the transcript but not calculated in the grade point average. The date of withdrawal is used to determine the rate of refund (if applicable). Tuition only (not fees and books) is refunded in accordance with University policy. Tuition refund policy information can be found under the “Tuition Refunds” heading in the General Information section of this Catalog. The withdraw process varies by college.  Anderson College of Business , College of Computer & Information Sciences, College of Contemporary Liberal Studies, and Regis College  Traditional Students Total Withdrawal Traditional students who withdraw before the end of the published withdraw period for a semester must inform the Dean of Students in the Office of Student Affairs, The Dean of Students has a conference with any withdrawing student and authorizes REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  46  withdrawal only after determining that the student has met financial and other obligations. Students who withdraw with proper authorization receive a grade of ‘W’ in each course for which they are enrolled at the time of withdrawal. Students who withdraw without giving proper notification of their intention to withdraw receive a grade of “F” in all courses in which they are enrolled during the semester of withdrawal.   Withdrawal from a Course The withdrawal period begins the day following the add/drop period and ends at the point at which approximately 75% of the course has been completed. A student who wishes to withdraw from a course or courses prior to the published final withdrawal date for the semester can access the on-line Course Withdrawal form on WebAdvisor. The official date of withdrawal is the day the form is submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The student should print and retain his/her copy of the withdrawal form until the grade is verified. Non-traditional/Online Students  Students are permitted to withdraw from an individual course, from all courses for an academic period, or from their program without academic penalty. Students may withdraw from a course(s) for the current term beginning the first business day following the add/drop deadline through 75% of the term. The course withdrawal form is available online through WebAdvisor. To withdraw from a program, students should contact his/her academic advisor.  Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions  Withdrawal from the Program  A student who chooses to withdraw from the program must give written notice of this decision to the appropriate program director or department director.  Withdrawal from the School of Physical Therapy is not allowed in the last three weeks before the end of semester without an override from the dean.  Overrides will only be considered for documented medical conditions. Any student who withdraws according to these procedures may be readmitted without reapplication and review if the following conditions are met:   The student was in good academic standing before the withdrawal;   The student returns to the program within one calendar year of the withdrawal;  There are no outstanding requirements from the Loretto Heights School of Nursing Student Affairs Committee (undergraduate nursing students only). If these conditions are not met, the student must reapply to the program and be accepted for readmission. Initial acceptance into the program does not guarantee readmission. Also, readmission does not guarantee an uninterrupted sequence of course work.  Students in the School of Pharmacy and the School of Physical Therapy must submit a written request for readmission to the appropriate dean.  Additionally, students may be required to pass a competency exam verifying retention of previous course material.   Withdrawal from a Course  Students may withdraw from a course with the approval of their academic advisor and/or the appropriate department director.  Traditional, Accelerated and CHOICE nursing students start the withdraw process through their academic advisor. All other students may submit the course withdrawal form available on line through WebAdvisor.  SPECIAL REGISTRATION Special registration requests are not available on WebAdvisor.  INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent Study is individually supervised research under the direction of a faculty member in a discipline or topic of study not covered in a scheduled course. Approval and registration must occur prior to the add/drop deadline. The course number generally used is 490/4900 for the undergraduate level and 690/6900 for the graduate level.  SPECIAL STUDY Special Study is defined as a normally scheduled course that is not available at a time or location feasible for timely completion of graduation requirements. The course prefix, number and title are the same as the regularly scheduled course. Course requirements are met under the supervision of a faculty member who is approved to teach the course.  EXTENDED STUDY Extended Study provides a means for students to earn one semester hour in addition to existing credit value for a course. The course prefix, number, and title are the same as the course listed in the Schedule of Courses. Extended Study requirements are met under the supervision of a faculty member who teaches the course.  UPPER DIVISION REGISTRATION Traditional freshmen and sophomores are permitted to take upper division courses only if they have completed the prerequisites for the course and if they have obtained the permission of the instructor of the course. Normally, that approval is given by obtaining the instructor’s signature on the Registration form prior to submitting the form to the Academic Records and Registration office. Juniors and seniors must also complete the prerequisites of an upper division course as listed in this Catalog before enrolling for the course.  COURSE AUDIT Prior to graduation, students desiring to participate in a course for personal enrichment and exploration are permitted to audit a course with written permission from an associate dean or designated administrative staff/program director. Students are expected to participate in the course by maintaining normal attendance and completing course assignments but are exempt from assigned tests. Students receive an “AU” grade with no credit earned and are charged the regular tuition rate. Some programs do not permit auditing. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  47  Students should contact the appropriate program for information and permission regarding the audit option. The audit option must be selected by the add/drop deadline.  GRADING INFORMATION University-Wide Course Grading System The table that follows lists grades, grade points and grade descriptions used for all courses at Regis University. When grade descriptions differ for undergraduate and graduate courses, the undergraduate grade description is listed first with the graduate grade description following the forward slash (/). Grade Grade Points Description (Undergraduate/Graduate) A 4.000 Outstanding scholarship A- 3.667   B+ 3.333  B 3.000 Superior work / Satisfactory B- 2.667  C+ 2.333  C 2.000 Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory C- 1.667  D+ 1.333  D 1.000 Unsatisfactory D- 0.667  F 0.000 Failure (no credit) P * Pass (grade of “C” or higher / grade of “B” or higher N * No Pass (no credit) AU * Audit (no credit) W * Withdrawal I / - * Incomplete -- the grade accompanying the “I” becomes the permanent grade if additional work is not completed and a different grade is submitted by the Incomplete deadline for the course. IP/N * In Progress No Pass (No Credit) IP/F * In Progress Failure (No Credit) Y * Instructor did not submit grades by deadline. *Where no grade points are indicated, the grade does not calculate into the grade point average. Pass/No Pass Grades Pass/No Pass (P/NP) grading is available for courses with regular grading for traditional undergraduate students in the Anderson College of Business, the College for Computer & Information Sciences, Regis College, and Rueckert- Hartman College for Health Professions students in the Traditional Nursing program. In some graduate programs, selected courses permit P/NP grading. All Veterans must contact the certifying official in the Academic Records and Registration office before registering for a course on a Pass/No Pass basis.  Traditional and RHCHP Traditional Nursing Students Only:  The P/NP option is available to undergraduate students who have completed 30 hours of graded coursework. Transfer students must have completed 20 hours of graded coursework at Regis University before they may exercise the P/NP option. Students on academic probation are not encouraged to take courses (with the exception of remedial courses) on a P/NP basis, but may do so with the approval of the appropriate dean.  The P/NP option may be exercised for only one course each semester, and the total number of hours that may be taken on a P/NP basis for credit at Regis is limited to 18 semester hours.  The P/NP option may be exercised for only two of the Core studies course requirements. Also, the option cannot be used for courses in the area of the major or minor, except for experiential courses such as field experience, approved by the individual departments or divisions, and for student teaching courses in the Education department.  If a student changes his or her major and has already taken a required lower division course in the new major area on a P/ NP basis, the course meets the requirement. Upper division courses are evaluated by the department or division as to whether or not the course(s) should be accepted.  To register for a course on the P/NP basis, the student must obtain a special form from Enrollment Services and return it, properly completed, no later than the last day of the withdrawal period for the semester. This required form is in addition to the regular registration forms.  After the last day of the withdrawal period, a student may not request a grading change for the course.  The minimum passing level for undergraduate courses taken on a P/NP basis is a “C.” The student receives appropriate hours of credit toward graduation for a “P” grade, but that grade is not calculated in the grade point average. The student does not earn credit hours for an “N” grade, nor is that grade calculated in the grade point average.  Students enrolled in experiential courses under the P/NP option (e.g., field experience course in accounting, business administration, economics, psychology, sociology, etc., and student teaching courses in education) are eligible for the Dean’s List provided they are enrolled for a total of 15 or more hours, of which 12 are graded hours. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  48  Grades of Incomplete A grade of Incomplete or “I” denotes that the required work for the course is incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances. Unforeseen circumstances mean, for example, that an accident, an illness, a death, or a major life transition has occurred. This grade is awarded at the discretion of the instructor and is submitted with an alternate grade (i.e., I/D, I/F). A student must submit a written request (or school form) to the instructor that an Incomplete grade be assigned. The length of time and the remaining requirements to complete the course are determined by the instructor; however, the maximum length of time for completion is the end of the following semester. Summer semester does not apply to Regis College/Traditional Nursing students. Faculty will notify students in writing of the approval/denial of their request and provide instructions and guidelines required to resolve the Incomplete grade. If coursework is not completed by the end of the next applicable semester and a grade change form submitted by the instructor, the Incomplete grade reverts to the alternate grade assigned by the instructor and is calculated in the grade point average. Some programs have restrictions on alternate grade assignment, so students should refer to the appropriate program or department section of this Catalog for specific information. Due to rare circumstances, a student may request in writing that an extension of the Incomplete grade be granted. The extension must be approved by the academic dean or his/her designee for the respective program/school.  Consequences of an Incomplete Grade  Teacher licensure/certification or any graduation completion postings cannot be recorded on the academic transcript until Incomplete grades are changed and a set grade point average is calculated.  Army regulations require that students receiving tuition assistance complete coursework within 60 days of when the Incomplete is assigned. Some corporations may not reimburse tuition monies if the grade of Incomplete is assigned.  Students already on academic probation who receive an Incomplete grade will be continued on probation.  Students who are receiving financial aid and receive an Incomplete grade will be subject to review and may be placed on Financial Aid suspension.  Grade of In Progress (“IP”) In Progress “IP” grades may be assigned to students in a graduate-level capstone project/thesis course where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the academic period provided for assignment completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an “IP” grade may be assigned. The student can be granted a period of up to 24 months to complete the required assignments. The grade recorded on the student’s record is “IP/F” or “IP/N” depending on whether the grade for the course is a letter or Pass/No Pass grade. If the student does not complete the assignment within the 24 month period, the “IP” grade reverts to the alternate “F” or “NP” grade. The decision on the completion deadline is determined by the instructor in consultation with the student; however, the final decision is made by the instructor. Some graduate degree programs may have a more restrictive maximum completion time for an In Progress grade. More specific policies may appear in the appropriate school section of this Catalog. The student is not officially registered during the period of the “In Progress” unless the student is officially enrolled in other courses and, therefore, may not be eligible for financial aid or other benefits during the “In Progress” period. “IP” grades will be assigned only for the graduate-level capstone courses where a project or a thesis is the primary output of the course. In Progress is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases the appropriate grade is Incomplete.  REPEAT GRADE IMPROVEMENT OPTION Students have the option of improving a grade earned in a course at Regis University by repeating the same course at Regis. The following guidelines apply:  Regardless of whether the repeat grade is higher or lower than the original grade, the last grade earned is the grade for which credit is awarded and grade points are calculated in the grade point average. All previous grades are replaced with an (R) notation and the hours are recorded as zero (0.00) with a repeat notation indicating that the course has been retaken.  Courses taken for grade improvement must be taken with the same grading option (i.e., letter grading versus Pass/No Pass) when repeated.  If a student withdraws from a course being taken for a repeat grade, the original grade remains on the transcript and a grade of “W” is posted to the transcript for the second course.  The Repeat Grade Improvement Option applies only to grades earned at Regis University from the fall semester 1972 to the present. The Repeat Grade Improvement Option may be exercised only while the course requested for repeat remains active in the University’s curriculum. Substitutions of similar or revised courses for the original course are not allowed. Upon graduation the Repeat Grade Improvement Option is no longer available for that educational intent.  Course Repeatability Except under the grade improvement option, courses should not be repeated. It is ultimately the responsibility of the student to assure that courses are not erroneously repeated. Should a course be erroneously repeated, the last entry is the only one for which credit hours are earned and grade points are calculated in the grade point average. There is no refund of tuition for courses erroneously repeated. If a course is repeated at another institution, it is considered duplicate credit and is not accepted in transfer. The Regis course remains on the student record.   2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  49  Appeals of Disputed Grades Students should refer to the appropriate college section for policies and procedures governing grade appeals.  Change of Recorded Grade No final grade of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, or W submitted to the Academic Records and Registration office can be changed unless the change has received the written approval of the appropriate academic dean or his or her designee. Once this form has been completed by the instructor, the form is submitted to the office of the appropriate academic dean or designee for approval. As of January 1, 1983, no grade may be changed after it has been on the permanent record for one calendar year. This does not include courses retaken for repeat grade improvement. It is expected that great care and attention is given in the awarding of grades so that the need for change is minimal. It is also expected that no instructor give a grade of “I” (Incomplete) unless unforeseen circumstances make it necessary.  Grade Reports Only final grades are official and entered on the student’s permanent record.  Grades for all current students are available online through WebAdvisor.  IGrades cannot be given over the phone or e-mailed to the student. Under federal legislation the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (hereafter “FERPA”) grades may be released to parents or other parties only with the student’s written authorization unless the parent claims the student as a dependent for federal income tax purposes and provides appropriate documentation. Release authorization is available online through WebAdvisor under the parent menu.  Calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA) Only grades and credits earned at Regis University are used to calculate the student’s grade point average. The grade point average is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of attempted credits. Grade points earned are calculated by multiplying the number of credits for a course by the grade points associated with the grade received. Appropriate grade points for each grade awarded by the University appear in this section of this Catalog under the University-Wide Course Grading System heading. When no grade points are indicated, the grade and the credits do not calculate into the grade point average.  CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDENT RECORDS Regis University maintains an educational record for each student who is or has been enrolled at the University. In accordance with FERPA the following student rights are covered by FERPA and afforded to all eligible students at Regis University:   The right to inspect and review information contained in the student’s educational records.  The right to request amendment of the contents of the student’s educational records if believed to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy or other rights and the right to have a hearing concerning such amendment request.  The right to prevent disclosure without consent, with certain exceptions, of personally identifiable information from the student’s educational records.  The right to secure a copy of the University’s policy.  The right to file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Regis University to comply with the provisions of FERPA. Each of these rights, with any limitations or exceptions, is explained in the University’s policy statement, a copy of which may be obtained from the Academic Records and Registration office or online. The point of contact within the University for the exercise of all rights and the access to all information concerning student rights under FERPA is the Academic Records and Registration office. This specifically includes, but is not limited to, the procedure for amending a student’s educational record, the procedure for filing a complaint to determine accuracy of a student’s educational record, the procedure for filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, and the policy for determining which individuals within the University are “school officials” and what constitutes a “legitimate educational interest.” The University may provide directory information in accordance with the provisions of FERPA without the written consent of an eligible student, unless it is requested in writing that such information not be disclosed. The items listed below are designated as Directory Information and may be released to any person for any purpose at the discretion of Regis University unless a written request for nondisclosure is on file:  Name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, dates of attendance, class  Photographs  Previous institution(s) attended, major/minor field of study, awards, honors, degree(s) conferred  Past and present participation in officially recognized sports and activities, physical factors of athletes (height and weight), and their date and place of birth Current eligible students may prohibit general disclosure of this Directory Information by notifying the Academic Records and Registration office in writing. Situations involving non-release of Directory Information that are deemed as “extraordinary” by the student should be brought to the attention of the director of Academic Records. Regis University honors the request for one calendar year only; therefore, the student must file the request on an annual basis. The student should carefully consider the consequences of any decision to withhold any category of Directory Information. Regardless of the effect upon a student, Regis University assumes no liability that may arise out of its compliance with a request that such information be withheld. It is assumed that the failure on the part of the student to request the withholding of Directory Information indicates the student’s consent to disclosure. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  50  Any questions concerning the student’s rights and responsibilities regarding FERPA should be referred to the Academic Records and Registration office. General information and forms pertaining to FERPA may be found at www.regis.edu.

ACADEMIC STATUS NOTATIONS Students in good standing have either no academic status notation on their transcript or an academic status of “Probation Removed” and are eligible to continue, return, or transfer elsewhere. A student with an academic status of probation (“Admitted on Probation,” “Probation New,” “Probation Continued”), suspension (“Academic Suspension”), or dismissal (“Academic Dismissal”) has the appropriate notation recorded on the transcript. A student may continue or return when in a probationary academic status, but a suspended student is not eligible to return for one calendar year. A student who is expelled from the University is not eligible to return. All transcript notations are recorded within the appropriate semester from approximately 1950 to present.  Academic Probation Academic probation is an official sanction that is applied when a student falls below the minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average for the program. Academic probation may also be applied for violations of the academic integrity policy. Refer to the appropriate College section of this Catalog for details.  Academic Suspension Academic suspension is an official sanction that is applied when a student on academic probation fails to achieve the required minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average or other conditions established under their probation. Academic suspension may also be applied for violations of the academic integrity policy. Refer to the appropriate College section of this Catalog for details.  Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal is an action taken by a School or College that renders a student ineligible to return to that School or College for any program of study. Academic dismissal may be imposed for serious violations of academic integrity or failure to meet the conditions of a prior academic suspension. In the case of academic suspension for grade point average, a student must have been suspended for low cumulative grade point average, been readmitted to the program on academic probation, and subsequently failed to achieve the required cumulative grade point average. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).  Academic Expulsion Academic expulsion is an action taken by Regis University that renders a student ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. Academic expulsion may be imposed by the Provost for serious violations of academic integrity or failure to meet the conditions of a prior academic suspension.  DISCIPLINARY STATUS NOTATIONS “Disciplinary Suspension” and “Disciplinary Expulsion” are recorded on the academic transcript within the appropriate semester. Students may petition to remove “Disciplinary Suspension” from the transcript by appealing to the Dean of Students. Notification of “Disciplinary Expulsion” appears on the transcript for five years. Following that period, a student may petition the University to have this notation removed from the transcript. A student who is expelled from the University is not eligible to return.  GOVERNING CATALOG  UNDERGRADUATE Anderson College of Business, College of Computer & Information Sciences, Regis College – Traditional Students Traditional undergraduate students must adhere to the Core Studies requirements published in the Catalog in the year in which they entered their College. Graduating students must also meet the major(s) and minor(s) requirements as stated in the Catalog in effect when the major(s) and minor(s) were declared and approved. Undergraduate traditional students who leave the University and do not complete a Leave of Absence form--or if the form has expired (after two semesters) and they return--must meet the current Core and major/minor requirements. Requests for exceptions should be made in writing to the academic dean.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  51  Anderson College of Business, College of Computer & Information Sciences, College of Contemporary Liberal Studies – Accelerated Students Accelerated students program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Undergraduate students have seven years (84 months) from the date of acceptance to complete degree requirements. During the seven year period, students are permitted to benefit from any changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirement changes) that were implemented since the date of acceptance into the program. If the seven years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission and the program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of reapplication.  Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions  Undergraduate students adhere to Core Studies and major/minor requirements as stated in the University Catalog in effect at the date of matriculation.  GRADUATE  Anderson College of Business, College of Computer & Information Sciences, College of Contemporary Liberal Studies Student program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Graduate students must complete all degree requirements within six years (72 months) from the date of the student’s acceptance into the program.  During that six-year period, students are permitted to benefit from any policy changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirements changes) that were implemented since the student’s program acceptance.  If the six years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission and the program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of reapplication.  CHANGES IN REQUIREMENTS The reevaluation of requirements listed in this section is the responsibility of University councils and the Board of Trustees, and is subject to revision. The Regis University Catalog provisions in effect at the time of acceptance will prevail. All students wishing to transfer from one major and/or minor to another must meet all degree requirements at the time the transfer is made.  MAJOR DECLARATION By the end of the sophomore year, each traditional undergraduate student must select a major area. In some majors, even earlier decisions are encouraged. The programs in accounting, business administration, computer science, economics, education, and the natural sciences require careful planning in order to meet all requirements in four years. For traditional undergraduate students, lower division requirements must be satisfied prior to submitting a Major Declaration form to the department for approval. Major Declaration forms may be obtained from the Anderson College of Business , the College of Computer & Information Sciences, and the Regis College Dean’s Office and must be filed with the appropriate department. The major indicated on the Application for Admission form and the subsequent degree plan serve as the declaration of a major for all other Regis University programs.  DEFINITION OF A MAJOR  The major consists of a minimum of 18 upper division hours (courses numbered 400 and above) in one subject area with grades of “C-” or better required. Most major areas require additional lower division coursework and/or additional upper division coursework beyond the minimum of 18 semester hours. See requirements for specific majors in each college section of this Catalog.  DOUBLE MAJOR To earn a double major, all requirements for both majors must be met (including a minor if either major has a required minor in a specific area). A written and/or comprehensive examination may be required in the majors selected. When both majors are offered within the same degree (e.g., Bachelor of Arts), that degree is awarded. When a double major consists of one major from the Bachelor of Arts and one major from the Bachelor of Science, a single degree, the Bachelor of Arts and Science, is awarded. When one of the majors is offered with the Bachelor of Applied Science or the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree (BSN), only the BASc or the BSN degree is awarded.  In all cases, both majors are recorded on the diploma and the transcript.  BACCALAUREATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS  ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS  No course in which the candidate received less than a grade of “D-” is acceptable credit for the Core Studies requirements. If a particular Core Studies course is also being used to meet departmental or major/minor requirements, the minimal acceptable grade for the course may be higher depending upon the program and whether the course is meeting lower- or upper-division requirements. Students should refer to the appropriate program or department section of this Catalog for specific grade requirement information. In addition to the completion of the academic requirements in Core Studies or major/minor requirements, the following requirements apply to each degree candidate:  Students must complete 120 semester hours of academic coursework in which the candidate has earned a minimum cumulative Regis University grade point average of 2.000.  Of the 120 semester hours required for graduation, Anderson College of Business undergraduate students must complete 33 semester hours at the upper division level; College for Contemporary Liberal Studies undergraduate students must complete 30 semester hours at the upper division level;  and Regis College undergraduate students must complete 36 semester hours at the upper division level.  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  52   No course in which the candidate received less than a grade of “D-” is acceptable credit toward fulfillment of degree requirements.  All undergraduate students are required to complete a minimum of 30 semester hours at Regis University.  Traditional undergraduate students are expected to complete their final 30 semester hours prior to graduation at Regis University.  Student must complete a major consisting of a minimum of 18 hours of upper division coursework in one subject area unless an interdivisional or flexible major is involved. A major is intended to provide organization, intensive work, and a comprehensive understanding of one field of knowledge.  A minor is optional except for majors that require a specific minor.  If a minor is chosen, the minor area is selected in consultation with the major advisor and consists of a minimum of 12 upper division hours in one subject area. Some minor areas may require additional lower division credit hours and/or additional upper division credit hours beyond the minimum 12.  No course in which the candidate received less than a grade of “C-” is acceptable credit for meeting upper division major or minor requirements. Some programs or departments require a grade of “C-” or better in the lower division requirements in the major.  A transfer student must complete a minimum of half of the upper division hours in the major area and half of the upper division hours in the minor area at Regis University. (Exceptions to this policy are noted under “Departmental Regulations” in the department sections of this Catalog.)  Any course(s) taken toward fulfillment of major requirements may also count toward fulfillment of the Core Studies requirements. A single course cannot, however, satisfy two Core Studies requirements.  Upper division courses required to meet one major or minor cannot be counted toward a major or minor in another discipline except under the following conditions: o In the event that the upper division requirements for a major exceed 18 upper division hours, those excess hours may also be applied to another major or minor. o In the event that the upper division requirements for a minor exceed 12 upper division hours, those excess hours may also be applied to another major or minor.  Courses that satisfy lower division prerequisites for more than one major or minor may be double counted.  The successful passing of a written and/or oral comprehensive examination in the major field may be required by the academic department. The senior student who declares a double major must be prepared to take a comprehensive examination in both majors. The senior student with an interdivisional or flexible major may elect to take his or her comprehensive examination in any area in which he or she has accumulated 12 or more upper division hours. The scope of the material to be covered in these examinations, including departmental reading lists, is assigned by the department chairperson or director. The examination dates, places, and times are posted well in advance. Concurrent Baccalaureate Degrees Occasionally, students are interested in earning two concurrent baccalaureate degrees at Regis University. The student must select one of the degrees as the first or primary degree. After admission to the primary program, the student must submit a written request for admission to the academic dean of the second program. If the dean approves the admission, that dean is responsible for notifying the dean of the primary degree program, the Academic Records office, and the student. Generally, the student completes the Core Studies requirements for the primary degree. If the second degree is offered from a college other than that offering the primary degree, the academic dean of the second college may require additional coursework to meet Core Studies requirements. Major requirements for both degrees must be fully met. One-half of each major and one-half of any minor (if required by the major or if one is chosen) may be transferred to Regis upon entrance. All prerequisites and lower division requirements for the chosen majors and/or minors must be satisfied. Generally, courses utilized to meet upper division major requirements of one baccalaureate degree cannot be double counted to meet upper division major hours required for another baccalaureate degree unless the upper division hours are in excess of 18 hours. If necessary, substitute courses are designated by the appropriate academic dean. Each candidate must complete a minimum of 30 hours of residence at Regis for each degree. A minimum of 158 total credit hours is required to earn two degrees concurrently. In all cases, two diplomas are awarded and both degrees are recorded on the transcript.  Additional Baccalaureate Degree Changes of professional objective or special interests occasionally require attainment of a subsequent degree for individuals who have already completed a baccalaureate degree. Applications for admission to undergraduate study for an additional bachelor’s degree must be submitted to the appropriate admissions office. The previously earned baccalaureate degree must be from a regionally accredited institution. Additional coursework in Core Studies requirements, including philosophy and religious studies, may be required. Major requirements for the additional degree must be fully met. One-half of each major and one-half of any minor (if required by the major or if one is chosen) may be transferred to Regis University upon entrance. All prerequisites and lower division requirements for the chosen major and/or minor must be satisfied. Courses utilized to meet upper division major requirements of the previously earned baccalaureate degree cannot be double counted to meet upper division major hours required for an additional baccalaureate degree unless the upper division hours are in excess of 18 hours. If necessary, a substitute course is designated. Each candidate must complete a minimum of 30 hours of residence at Regis University subsequent to completion of the previously earned degree. If the previous degree is from Regis University, the same stipulations apply, including the requirement of 30 additional hours of residency at Regis University.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  53  Additional Major Students who have already received a baccalaureate degree from Regis University and wish to complete an additional major may be readmitted for that purpose. The student must complete all requirements for the additional major. Major requirements formerly completed for a baccalaureate degree from Regis University cannot be double counted to meet the required number of upper division hours of an additional major, unless the upper division hours in the previously earned major exceed 18 semester hours. Upon completion of the major, the student is awarded a certificate of completion of an additional major. The student’s permanent academic record indicates that requirements for the second major have been met.  Undergraduate Academic Certificate Requirements Undergraduate Academic Certificates requires that students meet the following obligations in addition to a minimum of 12 specified semester hours: A grade of “C-” or higher is required for all certificate courses. Grades lower than a “C-” do not meet any requirement of the Certificate Program under any circumstance. Six (6) semester hours of credit may be transferred upon entrance to the Certificate Program, provided the course(s) meet(s) transfer credit policies/equivalencies. Refer to the appropriate college/school for academic certificates available and for specific certificate requirements  GRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS In addition to the completion of specific degree requirements, the following are also required of each graduate degree candidate:  Completion of a minimum of 30 semester hours of 600-level or 700-level academic coursework in which the candidate has earned a minimum cumulative Regis University grade point average of 3.000.  All graduate students must complete all degree requirements within six years (72 months) from the date of the signature on the Degree Plan. Some Regis University degree programs may have more restrictive time limits on degree completion.  All graduate students are required to complete a minimum of 80% of the total semester hours required for a graduate degree (600-level or 700-level coursework) at Regis University.  No course in which the candidate earned less than a grade of “C” (e.g., “C-”) is acceptable credit for fulfillment of graduate degree requirements. However, the minimal acceptable grade for coursework may be higher depending upon the program. Students should refer to the appropriate program or department section of this Catalog for specific grade requirement information.  If a “C” grade is acceptable for courses required for the degree, a maximum of two courses with a grade of “C” may count toward graduation requirements.  Of the total semester hours required for a graduate degree at Regis University, no more than 20% of the total semester hours required may include transfer coursework or coursework included in a previously earned graduate degree from a transfer institution or from Regis University. Additionally, this coursework must fulfill specific course requirements for the graduate degree.  The successful completion of a Master’s Project, Master’s Thesis or equivalent and/or written or oral comprehensive exams may be required by the degree program.  Concurrent Master’s Degree To earn and be awarded two Master’s degrees from Regis University within the same semester, all requirements for both degrees must be met (including prerequisite courses). The student must meet all admissions requirements for each degree, be accepted as a student in each degree, and assigned an appropriate advisor for each degree. The student will select one degree as the primary academic intent and the other degree as a secondary academic intent. Each program’s requirements must be satisfied with distinct courses. A capstone must be completed for each degree. For graduation requirements, a student submits two separate graduation applications, one for each degree to be awarded. Two diplomas will be issued. Each diploma will be issued separately. Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.000 in each program. Failure to do so will result in probation/suspension. The academic transcript will not separate out coursework for degrees, but both degrees will be posted when they are awarded. Students may apply a maximum of two courses with a grade of “C” to each degree. Individual programs may have more restrictive requirements. Students will have six years to complete both degrees.  Graduate Academic Certificate Requirements An Academic Certificate requires that students meet the following requirements in addition to a minimum of 12 specified graduate semester hours:  Candidates must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 or better in graduate level courses throughout the Certificate Program.  A grade of “C” or higher is required for all certificate requirements. Grades lower than a “C” do not meet any requirement of the Certificate Program under any circumstance (i.e., a grade of “C-” is unacceptable).  Any course required to complete one certificate may not be used toward fulfillment of requirements for another certificate.  All semester hours required must be earned through Regis University.   Graduate transfer credit is not accepted into the Graduate Certificate Program. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  54  Refer to the appropriate school/program for academic certificates available and for specific completion requirements.  GRADUATION PROCEDURES  APPLICATION The Application for Graduation form must be submitted to the Academic Records and Registration office before eligibility for graduation can be evaluated. Specific application deadlines and the Application for Graduation form are available online at www.regis.edu/registrar. A $50.00 Graduation Application fee is required.  Regis College: The Application for Graduation form is required at least one semester prior to the semester in which the student expects to complete graduation requirements or, for undergraduate students, after 92 semester hours have been completed. A Regis University cumulative grade point average of 2.000 is required for undergraduates to apply for graduation. A Regis University cumulative grade point average of 3.000 is required for graduate students to apply for graduation. Failing to apply by the deadline or falling below the required cumulative grade point average may delay graduation to a subsequent semester.  DEGREE AWARD/TRANSCRIPT POSTING Students graduate within the semester that all requirements are met and documentation of such is received by the appropriate college. Incomplete grades, late application for graduation, late receipt of transcripts of transfer credit, or late processing of Waiver Substitution forms will result in the degree being awarded in a subsequent semester (the degree is awarded in the semester in which all documentation is received/approved). Regis reserves the right to deny or revoke a degree or other academic credential if obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, mistake, or error. Degree awards are posted to the Regis University transcript once all documentation of completion is received by the Academic Records and Registration office from the appropriate college. Once a degree is awarded, the Repeat Grade Improvement Option or the Change of Grade Option is no longer available for that educational intent.  GRADUATION HONORS Undergraduate students who have earned 120 or more credit hours and who have completed all requirements for graduation are eligible for graduation honors. Undergraduate program students who have completed 60 regular graded semester hours of Regis University coursework are awarded graduation honors according to the following cumulative grade point average standards: Summa Cum Laude 3.900 - 4.000 Magna Cum Laude 3.700 - 3.899 Cum Laude 3.500 - 3.699 Undergraduate program students who have completed between 30 and 59 regular graded semester hours of Regis University coursework are awarded academic honors according to the following cumulative grade point average standards: Summa Cum Laude 3.950 - 4.000 Magna Cum Laude 3.850 - 3.949 Cum Laude 3.750 - 3.849 Graduate students who have completed masters or doctoral degree requirements with a cumulative grade point average of 3.850 or better for 600-level or 700-level courses are awarded graduate honors. Graduation honors are reflected on the academic transcript when the degree is posted. NOTE: Since graduation honors are based on grade point average, regular graded semester hours and graduation honors are determined only by coursework that earns grade points. (See University-Wide Course Grading System in this section of this Catalog for a listing of grades that earn grade points.)  Attendance at Commencement Ceremonies Attendance at commencement ceremonies is encouraged. The Academic Records and Registration office is notified of the student’s intent to participate in commencement through the Application for Graduation form. Undergraduate students are permitted to march in commencement if they are within 15 semester hours of completing their degree requirements.  Regis College: undergraduate students are allowed to march in commencement if they are within 12 semester hours of completing their degree requirements.  Graduate students are permitted to march in commencement if they are within six semester hours of completing their degree requirements. Graduates are listed in the commencement program for the commencement in which they march.  Diplomas Diplomas are mailed to the student upon confirmation of the completion of all degree requirements. Diplomas are not released if any financial obligation to Regis University exists.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  55  REGIS UNIVERSITY GRADUATION RATES The cohort includes students who enrolled as first-time, full-time, certificate, or degree-seeking undergraduate students for a given fall semester.

Founded in 1877 by the Society of Jesus, the College is firmly rooted in a 450-year old tradition of academic excellence and value-centered education. A main focus of the mission of the College is to educate men and women of all ages to take leadership roles and to make a positive impact in a changing society. The College serves both traditionally aged undergraduate students and graduate students. Traditional undergraduate students may choose from 30 structured areas of study or may design their own program through the interdisciplinary and thematic major plans. A low student/faculty ratio permits small classes and learning formats that encourage critical thinking, thoughtful discussion and well-developed communication skills.  THE REGIS COLLEGE CORE:  “HOW OUGHT WE TO LIVE?” Regis University recognizes that in today’s diverse and complex world, education cannot be limited to one field of study.  Instead, it is the goal of the University to give each student a full range of academic exposure.  Building upon a 450 year educational tradition, our core education is grounded in a Jesuit and Catholic vision of human development. Through its emphasis on active learning and integrated reflective thinking, the core education should broaden a student’s capacity to make critical judgments in a wide range of areas.  To this end, Regis College requires that each student completes a liberal arts core curriculum. Regis University’s mission is to develop leaders in the service of others.  Therefore, the Regis College Core Curriculum is firmly rooted in the Regis University Core Philosophy Statement.  The Core Curriculum is guided by the framework of the Characteristics of the Core Educational Experience:  Development of the Whole Person, Academic Challenge, Liberal Arts Foundation, Integration, Ethical Inquiry and Reflection, Spirituality and Religion, Concern for Justice, Global Awareness and Leadership. All Core courses will challenge students to reflect on tradition, continuity, and change while celebrating the essential goodness of the world, the compatibility of faith and reason, and the joy of learning.  Through the Foundational Core, with its emphasis on rhetorical skills (writing, speaking, reading and listening), to the Distributive Core with its focus on key modes of scholarly inquiry and discovery, to the Integrative Core, which connects new learning with prior knowledge and personal experience across disciplines, the Core encourages students to become lifelong learners in the Jesuit tradition.   Foundational Core:  The First Year Experience (6 credits) is a two course sequence taken in the fall and spring of the first year.  These courses introduce Regis College students to the idea of a Jesuit liberal arts education by foregrounding the guiding question for our core curriculum:  “How ought we to live?” within the context of the Jesuit vision of a liberated human life.  These small seminars develop competencies in writing, speaking, critical thinking and research.

Education students are actively involved in urban and diverse field experiences beginning with their introductory education courses. Regis College Undergraduate Education Programs Department offers professional licensure in elementary, secondary, and K-12 art, music, and foreign language.  A unique feature of our teaching program requires all students to complete an additional endorsement in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education in conjunction with their secondary, elementary or K-12 license.  Students also have the option to complete coursework in conjunction with a Secondary, Elementary, or K-12 license for an endorsement in Special Education Generalist. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG    2018-2019  220  Students also have an option of completing minors or concentrations of study with the education department. These minors can be earned in addition to teaching licensure or independent from a teaching license. The minors include Special Education and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education. (For details on these minors, see sections after the licensure sequences listed below.) Teaching licensure can be pursued as an undergraduate or as a graduate student in the Master of Arts in Education: Graduate Teacher Licensure Program. (For details on the Graduate Teacher Licensure Program, see Regis College Graduate Programs with Initial Licensure section of catalog.) All students enrolled in the Teacher Licensure Program at Regis College must have co-academic advisors, one in the major field and one in the Education Department. The programs leading to recommendation for licensure, either at the elementary level or in a particular subject area at the secondary level, contain their own specific requirements. These requirements are listed on the advising sheet pertinent to that subject area. The advising sheets are available from an advisor in the Education Department. It is the student’s responsibility to meet the requirements listed on that advising sheet. The Regis Education Department Teacher Licensure Program is subject to the laws and regulations mandated by the Colorado State Board of Education and by the Colorado State Legislature. Changes in these laws and regulations can occur with little notice. Resulting modifications in the Regis program are communicated to students as soon as they are mandated by law.  TEACHER LICENSURE SEQUENCE As a professional state licensure program, students may have requirements beyond those in Regis College. Performance and licensure standards can be found in the student handbook and on the Colorado Department of Education website. In addition students will adhere to the Dispositions of Teaching located in the student handbook. The professional sequence of education courses at Regis are designed to lead to licensure at either the K-6, 7-12, or K-12 grade levels in Colorado. Regis students enrolled in this sequence begin developing teacher performance, dispositions, and knowledge during their first courses and initial field experiences. This developmental process is monitored by the Regis Education Department faculty, and students are evaluated each semester on their progress in this process. Evaluations are based on their work at Regis and in their fieldwork in the actual K-6, 7-12, or K-12 classroom. Regis students who begin this sequence may be counseled to pursue a profession other than teaching if their progress in one or all aspects of the sequence is considered unsatisfactory or if they do not manifest sufficient mastery of the skills necessary for successful entry into the teaching profession.  A deficiency in one or more of these behaviors may be denied admission by the COTER, or removal, or probation from the program at any point. For students with a B.A. or B.S. seeking teacher licensure, Regis College offers the Master of Arts in Education Graduate Teacher Program. This program provides College graduates a licensure track with a master’s degree. For information about this licensure option, refer to the Master of Arts in Education Graduate Teacher Licensure Program that follows in this section of the Catalog. Private/Parochial Track Students who intend to teach in the private/parochial sector may complete a portion of their fieldwork in private or parochial school in consultation with their academic advisor. Coursework is parallel to the licensure sequences below.  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION There are two pathways for completing licensure in Elementary Education:  1.) Completing a content major and the list of required education courses, or 2.) Completing the Elementary Education: Teaching for Social Justice Major. All Elementary Education licensure candidates complete requirements for the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Endorsement as a part of their program. The two pathways are listed in the following sections.  Elementary Education: Teaching for Social Justice Major Successful completion of the following program at Regis may qualify a student to be recommended for licensure as an elementary teacher in Colorado. Students completing this major have the option to include coursework for a Special Education Generalist Endorsement and also complete required coursework for the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse endorsement.

MASTER OF EDUCATION IN EDUCATIONAL  LEADERSHIP 33 SH 1 Phone: 303-458-4135   OVERVIEW The Master of Arts in Education: Graduate Teacher Licensure Program builds on the mission and goals of the Regis College Department of Education, the Master of Arts in Education (MAE) program, and the University’s mission and graduate education philosophy statement. It is aligned philosophically and in delivery  style with the other Education programs and incorporates the many successful components of these programs, including but not limited to: a strong connection between theory and practice; classroom-based instruction that models the learning- and learner-centered, active pedagogy that the program cultivates in participating students; personalization; collaboration among learners and between the University and host schools; critical reflection, metacognition, and lifelong learning; and building and applying a belief system that values diverse students and communities. Building on the approach of the other Regis College education programs, the Master of Arts in Education: Graduate Teacher Licensure Program includes an explicit focus on issues of equity and social justice. The MAE: Graduate Teacher Licensure Program offers a way for recent college graduates to earn a professional Colorado teaching license in an accelerated, intensive format. The program targets students who earned bachelor’s degrees within the past five years, although it is open to anyone with a qualifying degree.  Teaching licenses can be earned in elementary education (23-35 semester hours), K-12 Art (17-29 semester hours), or secondary education (17-29 semester hours). Secondary content areas include science, mathematics, English, social studies, Spanish, French, German, or business/marketing.  Licensure coursework and over 800 hours in a classroom teaching internships can be completed within one calendar year, although elementary education requires an additional semester. A part-time format is also available. Courses take place on the Regis Lowell campus (generally during daytime hours, aligned with the traditional semester calendar, and integrated with undergraduate licensure students) and are taught by full-time faculty with extensive school-based experience.   The licensure coursework counts towards a master’s degree. For students who wish to continue on to complete the Master of Arts in Education and the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education Endorsement, an additional 15credits are required. This coursework can be completed in as little as one year, and the courses are held on weekends, evenings, and summers to accommodate working teachers.  COURSE LOAD The degree plan for the Master of Arts in Education: Graduate Teacher Licensure Program outlines the sequence of courses required to meet licensure requirements within a one year time period. Students (except students working toward elementary licensure) are encouraged to participate in this full-time program model, taking a full load of courses and engaging in school-based fieldwork.(Elementary education licensure requires a minimum of 3 semesters to complete). Students wishing to participate in the program on a part-time basis should speak to the program director when applying to the program to determine how long it will take to complete licensure requirements.   PROBATION POLICY Students must maintain a GPA of 3.000 in all education coursework to continue in good standing. Students may be placed on probationary status for the following reasons:  GPA falls below 3.000  Unsatisfactory performance during field work  Unsatisfactory performance during academic courses  Issues regarding professionalism (attitudes and behaviors displayed in class and in field experiences as noted in the Department of Education Dispositions of Teaching document)  EXTENSION OF SCHOOL INTERNSHIP/STUDENT TEACHING If students do not successfully complete their 800 required school internship/student teaching hours or do not demonstrate the required proficiency levels of classroom performance and professional dispositions, it may be necessary for them to extend their experience into a subsequent semester. In this case, students 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  235  will be required to register for additional sections of 1-1099 Phone: 303-964-6114  INTRODUCTION Graduate Programs in Biology in Regis College are designed to assist students with preparing for the next steps in their lives by providing high quality educational experiences in specialized areas of the biological sciences.

 The Jesuit Motto   REGIS UNIVERSITY Regis University is a coeducational university which includes the Anderson College of Business , the College of Computer & Information Sciences, the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies, Regis College, and the Rueckert- Hartman College for Health Professions, all conducted in the Jesuit tradition at the Northwest Denver Campus, Denver, Colorado, and at other institutional sites in Colorado.             THE SEAL OF REGIS  UNIVERSITY Symbols used in the seal include the following:     The Latin Universitas Regisiana Societatis Jesu translates as “Regis University of the Society of Jesus” and names the University and its sponsoring organization, the Jesuit Order.   The crown is a symbol of the University’s patron, St. John Francis Regis. The word regis in Latin means “of the King.”   John Francis Regis, Jean-Francois Regis in his native language, was a Jesuit saint who lived 1597-1640. Known as the “Father of the Poor,” he was a teacher, missionary and champion of the outcast in the Massif Central, a mountainous district of France located west of the Alps.   1877 is the founding date of the University.   The mountains are symbolic both of the Rocky Mountains and of the mountains of the Massif Central where St. John Francis Regis lived and worked.   The letters IHS are the Greek letters Iota, Eta, Sigma, the first three letters of the word “Jesus.” The letters IHS within a sunburst comprise the seal of the Society of Jesus. The Jesuit seal is found on the pediment at the front entry of Main Hall, Lowell campus.   The alternating stripes (originally red and gold) are from the shield of the Onaz-Loyola family. St. Ignatius Loyola, born in 1491, founded the Jesuits in 1540.   The motto “Men and Women in Service of Others,” in Latin Homines Ad Serviendum Aliis, is an expression used to describe the purpose of Jesuit education: to form men and women who use their knowledge and energies in the unselfish service of others. The motto also expresses the desire of Regis’ faculty and staff to be of service to students and the community. REGIS COLLEGE CHANGE TO REGIS UNIVERSITY Regis College adopted Regis University as its institutional name effective July 1, 1991 The academic structure of the institution retains Regis College as the name of the unit offering undergraduate and graduate programs in the liberal arts, sciences, and education.  The Anderson College of Business  offers traditional and accelerated undergraduate and graduate programs in Business, Economics and Management. The College of Computer & Information Sciences offers traditional and accelerated programs in Computer and Information Sciences and Health Information Management. The College Of Contemporary Liberal Studies serves adult learners through a spectrum of innovative undergraduate and graduate degrees in Humanities and Social Sciences. The Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions offers undergraduate programs in nursing, and health care administration. Graduate programs are offered in counseling, health services administration, nursing, physical therapy, and pharmacy. Regis currently serves students in both graduate and undergraduate programs through five academic units at four campuses. Current campus locations are Northwest Denver (Lowell), DTC, Colorado Springs, and Thornton.  HISTORY OF REGIS UNIVERSITY In 1540, when Ignatius Loyola founded the Society of Jesus--a community of companions and scholars resolved to serve their fellow men -- a guiding principle of the Society was that it would meet the needs of its age and would “form leaders who would carry forth into their personal and professional lives a mission of service to others.” For four centuries, the Jesuit fathers have been perfecting an educational tradition of academic excellence, value-centered education, and service to the community. The Society of Jesus (Jesuits) is an international Roman Catholic religious order of priests and brothers known for its missionary and educational work. The Jesuit education network extends to more than 2,000 institutions of various types and levels, including 177 universities and 356 high schools. Ten thousand Jesuits and nearly 100,000 lay people provide education for more than 1.8 million students in 56 countries around the world. In the United States, there are 46 Jesuit high schools and 28 Jesuit colleges and universities. Regis University has continued the Jesuit tradition since 1877, when a band of Jesuit missionaries from Naples, Italy, carved out a college on the edge of the desert in New Mexico, and named it Las Vegas College. In 1884, Bishop Joseph P. Machbeuf of the Diocese of Denver, eager to have a respected school for boys in Colorado, persuaded the Jesuits to open a new college in Morrison, Colorado, named Sacred Heart College. In 1888, when the Morrison site proved too remote, Dominic Pantanella, S.J., the first president, moved the college, now combined with Las Vegas College and known as 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG 7  College of the Sacred Heart, to its present location in northwest Denver where it included the College and an associated Jesuit high school. Through an 1888 act of the Colorado state legislature, the College was empowered to confer college degrees, and the first graduation exercises were in 1890. In 1917, the College established a four-year curriculum separate from the high school and, in 1921, the high school and College were renamed “Regis” in honor of St. John Francis Regis, an 18th  century Jesuit missionary from the mountains of France. Main Hall, built in 1887, was the only building on the campus until expansion began in 1911 with the addition of the gymnasium. Today, the Regis University Lowell campus includes 17 buildings on 90 acres. Regis was initially accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) now the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) in 1921. In 1952, Regis was accredited as a four-year, degree-granting college. Student enrollment has increased steadily, with a large expansion coming immediately after World War II as a result of the G.I. Bill. Recognizing the need for educating men and women together, the College became a coeducational institution in 1968. In 1979, because of the expanding needs of high school and college education, Regis Jesuit High School and Regis College became independent institutions. In 1977, Regis College began to offer selected programs to adult learners through classes at Fort Carson and Peterson Air Force Base and in temporary facilities at St. Mary’s High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. From 1977 through 2015, career programs (the College for Professional Studies) expanded to include master’s degree programs in business administration, computer information technology, education, counseling, management, nonprofit management, software and information systems and an individually designed program as well as a wide choice of undergraduate majors, offered at several campus and off- campus locations.  In 1981, Regis acquired a permanent location to house its Colorado Springs programs. In 2013, the counseling program moved from the College for Professional Studies to the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions. In 2014, the College of Computer & Information Sciences was launched and the computer programs from the College for Professional Studies, Regis College, and the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions moved into that College.  In 2015, the College of Business and Economics was created and the business, economics and management programs from Regis College and the College for Professional Studies moved into that college. In fall 2018, the College of Business and Economics was renamed the Anderson College of Business. Beginning spring 2016, the College for Professional Studies officially became the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies. In 1981, the Board of Trustees established “The National Commission of the Future of Regis College” to examine the College’s purposes and develop a plan for its future needs. Drawing upon the expertise of distinguished corporate, civic, religious, and educational leaders, the National Commission offered 257 recommendations, which outlined for the Board of Trustees an imaginative and vigorous vision of Regis. The result was the development, implementation, and successful completion of the College’s largest fund-raising effort in history--the $15 million “Commitment to the Future.” The Commitment to the Future was a key element in assuring the future success of Regis University. In addition to that major effort, the University is fortunate to include among its resources, the funds contributed by individuals, corporations, and foundations in general support of the University and in support of specific programs. In 1988, the Loretto Heights nursing program moved to Regis University when Loretto Heights College closed. In the same year, University Without Walls moved from Loretto Heights College to Regis University and became part of the College for Professional Studies. In 1991, the Health Care Programs became the School for Health Care Professions. The name was changed to the Rueckert-Hartman School for Health Professions in 2004. In 2007, the School was renamed the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions and the nursing department became the Loretto Heights Department of Nursing.

THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY Regis University educates men and women of all ages to take leadership roles and to make a positive impact in a changing society. Standing within the Catholic and United States traditions, we are inspired by the particular Jesuit vision of Ignatius Loyola. This vision challenges us to attain the inner freedom to make intelligent choices. We seek to provide value-centered undergraduate and graduate education, as well as to strengthen our commitment to community service. We nurture the life of the mind and the pursuit of truth within an environment conducive to effective teaching, learning, and personal development. Consistent with Judeo-Christian principles, we apply knowledge to human needs and seek to preserve the best of the human heritage. We encourage the continual search for truth, values, and a just existence. Throughout this process, we examine and attempt to answer the question: “How ought we to live?” As a consequence of Ignatius Loyola’s vision, particularly as reflected in his Spiritual Exercises, we encourage all members of the Regis community to learn proficiently, think logically and critically, identify and choose personal standards of values, and be socially responsible. We further encourage the development of skills and leadership abilities necessary for distinguished professional work and contributions to the improvement and transformation of society.   2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG 11  ACCREDITATION AND AFFILIATIONS  Regis University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), one of six regional higher education institutional accreditors in the United States.

We believe that recognizing the continuum between conceptual rigor and practical application enables our students to adapt to new situations throughout life.  Examine the dominant values that constitute society. We provide our students with the experience and understanding necessary for establishing their own framework of values within which they can make moral judgments and personal choices. In this way, we help empower students to make a positive impact on a changing society.  Investigate the theories, methods and data of academic disciplines, as well as their underlying assumptions and values.  Promote an atmosphere of personal concern for each student. This includes conscientious advising, substantial interaction between faculty and students, and close attention to each individual’s personal intellectual growth.  Concentrate our limited resources as a private and independent institution on select areas and extend these resources by forming partnerships with other organizations. In this way, the University attempts to be innovative, both educationally and technologically.  Motivate students, faculty, and staff to put their wisdom, skills, and knowledge at the service of humanity.  Expand the presence and influence of the Jesuit vision and values, which are derived from the Ignatian, Catholic, and United States traditions of education. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  13  UNDERGRADUATE CORE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE  FRAMEWORK AND GOALS From its origins in the Renaissance and Reformation, Jesuit education has provided leadership in bringing the traditions of Christianity and classical learning in fruitful engagement with new developments in thought and culture. This task remains central at Regis University, where the core educational experience seeks to provide all undergraduate students with Jesuit liberal arts education. The core educational experience challenges students to reflect on tradition, continuity, and change, and to explore the question “How ought we to live?” in terms of the development of Western thought from classical to contemporary. Inspired by Catholic tradition and Ignatian spirituality, the core educational experience at Regis celebrates the essential goodness of the world and the joy of learning. This education is grounded in the belief that faith and reason are complementary; it emphasizes the basic values of human dignity, diversity, freedom, and justice; and it promotes the formation of conscience and character through imaginative and critical discernment. The core educational experience aims to develop the whole person. It seeks not only to enable students to meet the challenges and goals of their personal and professional lives, but also to cultivate their leadership in service to others and in work for the common good. The Regis University core educational experience engages students in an academic environment that both models and nurtures the beliefs, commitments, and goals that are central to Jesuit liberal arts education. The mentoring relationship between faculty, staff, and students is central to this experience. While required core courses are essential to the core educational experience, core goals and themes inform all academic majors and professional programs, as well as campus and community activities.  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CORE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE  The specific structure of the core educational experience varies within each of the University’s five colleges because of the different student populations and instructional formats in the Anderson College of Business , the College of Computer & Information Sciences, the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies, Regis College,  and the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions. Nonetheless, the core educational experience in all five colleges is characterized by: Development of the Whole Person The core educational experience is designed to nurture the whole person: head, heart, and hands, intellect, sensibility, and skills. The whole person, however, is not understood in terms of an isolated self. Rather, Regis seeks to develop leaders whose compassion and concern for others inspires them to contribute to the common good. Academic Challenge Regis University is committed to academic excellence: the disciplined search for knowledge and the joy of discovery and understanding. The core educational experience is designed to strengthen students’ skills in critical reading and thinking, speaking and writing, research and scholarship, and the use of information technologies. Students are encouraged to become partners in a collaborative process of learning and discovery. Liberal Arts Foundation The core educational experience promotes literacy in the major academic disciplines the arts, the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. By giving students an opportunity to explore the questions, methods, and understandings of different disciplines, the core educational experience establishes a broad foundation for more specialized studies. Integration The core educational experience challenges students to integrate new learning with prior knowledge and personal experiences. It seeks to strengthen habits and skills of integration, thereby encouraging students to become life-long learners and to achieve more comprehensive understandings of truth. Ethical Inquiry and Reflection By challenging students to examine the ethical dimensions present in all of their studies, the core educational experience seeks to cultivate the habit of critical reflection on values. Students are encouraged to reflect upon crucial human concerns and to strengthen values that lead to sound decisions and just actions. Spirituality and Religion Rooted in the Roman Catholic tradition, Regis University is committed to integrating faith with learning. The core educational experience fosters a critical appreciation of religious questions and spiritual experience. While special attention is given to Catholic philosophical and theological tradition, the core educational experience also involves exposure to other philosophical and religious traditions. It encourages mutual respect and genuine dialogue in the context of a shared search for meaning. Concern for Social Justice The core educational experience seeks to nurture a life of service for the common good and a commitment to work toward a more just and peaceful world. By challenging students to develop the analytical skills necessary to understand relationships of power and privilege in contemporary society, the core educational experience strives to cultivate respect for human diversity and a special concern for the poor and the oppressed. Global Awareness While contemporary individuals operate in many different social contexts, the Jesuit tradition has always been global in its horizons and outreach. Thus, the core educational experience furthers students’ appreciation of the diversity of persons and cultures, the complexity of relationships in the new and evolving international order, and the impact of humans on the natural environment. Leadership Regis University is committed to developing leaders in the service of others. Recognizing that there are many forms of leadership, the core educational experience challenges students to strengthen their personal leadership skills through academic courses, service learning experiences, and other campus and community activities. Special attention is focused on refining students’ abilities to listen and to engage in dialogue in diverse settings. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  14  GRADUATE STATEMENT Graduate degree programs at Regis University emanate from and embody the University mission of educating men and women to take leadership roles and to make a positive impact in a changing society.

REGIS UNIVERSITY BEHAVIORAL GOALS WITH RESPECT TO “LIVING THE MISSION” At Regis University we practice what we teach by being committed to building and sustaining a culture that values the dignity, diversity, and contributions of all its members. With mutual respect and justice, the Regis community seeks to live the Jesuit mission by:  Maintaining the highest ethical relationships within the Regis community as well as with partners, suppliers and other business entities, the Catholic Church, other religious traditions, and educational institutions.  Fulfilling our obligation to society by supporting women and men in the Jesuit tradition to be leaders in their families, communities, and vocations.  Achieving a unique student experience by providing values- centered education with rigorous academic programs, a focus on life-long learning and service to others that prepares students to contribute to the transformation of society.  Reviewing and strengthening the continuing health and financial viability of the University with strategies and resources that are responsive to the Mission.  Acknowledging and affirming exceptional contributions, seeking fair and equitable rewards, and providing opportunities for self- expression and growth in the Regis community. Regis University thrives when all members of the community act to promote a culture that is congruent with the Mission.  ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY Introduction Consistent with the Regis University Mission and Jesuit principles, each College within Regis University expects its students to conduct themselves and maintain relationships in a manner that is characterized by honesty, integrity, authenticity, and dignity as well as mutual respect for the contributions of all the members of the Regis community. All Regis University students and faculty will abide by the University’s Academic Integrity Policy regardless of the program or College where the student is enrolled. All Colleges at the University will use and enforce this policy. The term integrity is derived from the Latin integritas, meaning the quality of being whole, sound and unimpaired or unbroken.  Academic integrity is built upon the values and virtues of honesty, 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  15  loyalty and trustworthiness.  A failure to observe these basic values undermines the very foundations and bonds of a learning community and impairs the most basic goals of education At Regis University, academic integrity is viewed and treated as an academic matter rather than an issue of student conduct.   In order to establish and foster an environment where incidents of misconduct are socially unacceptable, all students are expected to adhere to the Regis University Academic Integrity Policy. This Academic Integrity Policy is intended to support the shared responsibility of faculty and students in maintaining an academic environment in which the values of truth and justice prevail in all activities related to learning, teaching, research, scholarship and practice. Academic Integrity and the Academic Integrity Policy Definition: Academic Integrity means that each student acknowledges that the work represented in all assignments and all examinations is his, her, or their own or is properly cited, and that he, she, or them has neither given nor received unauthorized information.  Furthermore, each student agrees not to divulge the contents of any assignment or examination to another student in any semester or to alter or impede the work or progress of another student.  Students of Regis University are committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and assume full responsibility for maintaining those standards. All members of the Regis University community are expected to exhibit the qualities of honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness in all academic and clinical activities, holding themselves and each other accountable for the integrity of the learning community.   It is the responsibility of each student to review and abide by all aspects of the course syllabus and agree to adhere to this Regis University Academic Integrity Policy.   The Academic Integrity Policy (sometimes referred to as the Academic Honor Code) applies to any work performed by any current or former Regis University student, regardless of the student’s home college or program. The Academic Integrity Policy prohibits cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, collusion and other forms of academic misconduct.  All suspected violations, including first-time violations, will be reported via established University processes, and will be referred to the lead academic integrity officer of the college in which the offense occurred. Reporting of all offenses, regardless of the violation level, allows the University to identify repeat offenders.  All faculty have access to plagiarism detection software, which can be used with or without a student’s knowledge in any Regis University course.   Violations of Academic Integrity It is a violation of academic integrity to cheat, plagiarize, fabricate, collude, or otherwise misrepresent someone else’s work as your own.  Regis University takes very seriously violations of academic integrity, including but not limited to the following:  Cheating A form of academic dishonesty in which the person misrepresents his or her mastery of the course content or clinical experience.  Cheating applies to examinations, labs, written assignment, clinical experiences, online discussions, and any other form of student assessment Examples of cheating include, but are not limited to the following:  Using unauthorized materials such as a textbook, prepared notes, study aids or an electronic device during an examination  Unauthorized access to or use of someone else’s computer account or computer files to complete an assignment  Possessing or obtaining an examination without the instructor’s authority or prior knowledge  Submission of an assignment purchased from a commercial entity (e.g., term papers, software programs, etc.)   Unauthorized preprogramming of and/or access to electronic devices or learning management systems Plagiarism A form of dishonesty by which the person misrepresents someone else’s words, ideas, phrases, sentences or data as his or her own or otherwise fails to properly acknowledge the source of such material through complete and accurate citations and reference lists.

Violations in this category include but are not limited to giving other students false or misleading information; making library materials unavailable through stealing or defacement; deliberately misplacing or destroying reserve materials or altering and/or destroying someone else’s computer files. Levels and Sanctions The level of an offense is initially assigned by the faculty member based upon the assessment of the offense and surrounding circumstances. Faculty may consult with the lead academic integrity officer within the College, School or Division to assess the level of any academic integrity violation.  The following serves as a guideline for the assignment of offense level. The circumstances of a given occurrence may escalate any offense to the next level as determined by the course instructor and/or the academic integrity board of the College in which the offense occurred. A first time egregious Level III or subsequent violation of any level may result in both course and institutional penalties, including possible probation, suspension or expulsion from the University.  Levels of Offense Level I:  Unintentional violations of the academic integrity policy  Offenses in which there are considered to be mitigating circumstances  Any subsequent Level I violation will be considered at least a Level II violation Level II   Deliberate violations of the academic integrity policy   Subsequent Level I violations will be considered at least a Level II Level III:  Flagrant disregard for academic integrity policy, or egregious violations of the policy  Subsequent Level II violations may be considered a Level III violation Corrective Actions and/or Potential Sanctions Level I:  Course penalties including resubmission of work with penalty, OR failure of the assignment, OR failure of the course  Review of College and/or university academic integrity training modules  For violations that occur outside of an individual course, the reporting party may recommend college/department/division/school sanctions.

It is the responsibility of each individual student, faculty and other Regis University employees to be able to recognize and refrain from any violation of academic integrity and to report observed violations. All faculty are expected to use the Academic Integrity Violation reporting form on Webadvisor to report incidents of fabrication, collusion, cheating, and plagiarism. Student Awareness It is the responsibility of all students to familiarize themselves with the University’s Academic Integrity Policy. Additionally, students should complete the online tutorial on Academic Integrity during their first term at the University.  Individual Colleges may choose how they convey this information. For example, this may occur during a New Student Orientation, First-Year Seminar, or Registration/Welcome Information Packet. Appeals Process Students have the right to appeal findings of academic dishonesty, or the institutional penalty for any infractions at any level.  Findings may also be affirmed or modified by the appropriate academic dean.  All Colleges will follow the same appeals process. Note that the AIB appeal process is limited to consideration of matters that deal exclusively with academic integrity. Other aspects of student academic performance or related violations of the Student Code of Conduct must be handled according to the processes outlined in the University Catalog and Student Handbook.  The following process will be followed: 1. The student submits a written request for appeal to the AIB of the College in which the alleged violation occurred within five working days of receiving notification that there was a finding that they committed a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy. 2. The AIB of the College in which the violation occurred  provides the following information to the student and reporting faculty: a.  a summary of the policy violation   b.  an opportunity to submit any additional  information relevant to the case to the Chair of the AIB by a certain date c. a date by which the Appeals Panel’s decision will be made 3. The College AIB solicits at least one faculty representative from another College’s AIB and student representation if desired. (Representative(s) should not have been involved in the process at any point prior to serving on the Appeals Board). 4. The AIB may gather facts and evidence from the student, witnesses, and University Personnel. 5. The Appeals Board is convened for review of the case within ten working days of receiving the student appeal (The Chair of the Appeals Board will be from the College where the violation occurred). 6. The AIB renders a decision within five working days of convening: a. Student appeal is denied; the charge, the violation and/or the sanction is upheld (Note however that if academic expulsion is the recommended sanction, the Provost must also support the decision) b. Student appeal is successful; the charge, violation and/or sanction is modified or reversed.

UNIVERSITY LEARNING OUTCOMES For centuries, the Jesuits have been perfecting an educational tradition of academic excellence, value-centered education, and service to the community. As a Jesuit institution, Regis University is deeply embedded within that heritage. Central to the tradition is the fact that the mission of the University is the driving force behind all educational programs. The mission can be no less central when the issue of assessment of student academic achievement is engaged. From our mission, a set of University-wide Outcome Statements was developed. The goal of developing these statements was to transform our mission and educational goals into explicit and ultimately measurable declarations that capture the collective thinking of the faculties of the University. In effect, the University Outcome Statements have become the operational foundation for assessment of student academic achievement. These University-wide learning outcome are broad-based and address every aspect of the University mission related to student learning and academic achievement, including learning within a specific academic discipline or cross-disciplinary area and learning in general education. The statements also identify the need for graduates to be well prepared for lives of work and service. Finally, the University Outcome Statements encompass some of the critical attitudes and personal values Regis feels are important for citizenship in a global society.  The University Outcome Statements are listed below. All students graduating from Regis University should have:  In-depth knowledge of a discipline or content area.  Knowledge of diverse cultures, perspectives, and belief systems.  Knowledge of arts, sciences, and humanities.  Ability to think critically.  Ability to communicate effectively.  Ability to use contemporary technology.  Commitment to ethical and social responsibilities.  Commitment to leadership and service to others.  Commitment to learning as a lifelong endeavor. Over the past decade, the assessment of student academic achievement has gained a prominent place on the agendas of institutions of higher education. The Higher Learning Commission indicated in 1991 that a formal plan for outcomes assessment would be required to maintain accreditation.  Regis University engages in the important work of student learning assessment not to comply with our accreditor’s mandate, but to ensure that we deliver on the promises made to Regis students through the Regis Nine institutional learning outcomes and through program-specific learning outcomes.  All instructional, co-curricular and operational units at Regis University complete this work through active participation in the R.U. Learning assessment plan, which is accessible at www.regis.edu/assessment.  CREDIT HOUR DEFINITION Jesuit education is characterized as person-centered and academically rigorous in the search for truth and an understanding of justice. Any relevant definition of credit hour must be consistent with these principles.  Therefore, the definition of the credit hour is based on time spent in mentored learning activities that are directed toward student learning outcomes. All Regis University courses have designated student learning outcomes. To merit three credits, a course must have enough mentored learning activities that are directed toward achieving the learning outcomes. Three-credit courses require a minimum of 30 hours of mentored learning activities. All Regis courses require learners to complete individual studying, reading and writing in addition to mentored learning activities, but these activities are not counted toward credit hours.  To access the full Regis University policy regarding credit hours, please see https://www.regis.edu/About-Regis-University/Policies-and-Procedures/Credit-Hour-Policy.aspx 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  19  STUDENT COMPLAINT POLICY Regis University is a Jesuit Catholic University committed to excellence in its programs and services; it exists for the purposes of teaching and learning.

Regis University designates its individual departments and operational units as responsible for receiving, investigating and potentially resolving student complaints. Depending upon the nature of the complaint, there are specific policies and procedures, as detailed below. Violations of the Student Code of Conduct or the Nondiscrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy The Regis University Student Handbook describes in detail information regarding judicial affairs, student grievances, conduct hearings, appeals and related procedures.

College specific complaint processes are published on the websites of each college and/or in the annually-published University Catalog, which may be accessed at http://www.regis.edu/Academics/Course%20Catalog.aspx.

Therefore, a student with a grievance must first notify the person or office responsible to seek a resolution. Such notification should be in writing and should be submitted within thirty days of becoming aware of the grievance.  Formal Complaint In limited circumstances, a student may file a formal complaint using the policy identified below.  The formal complaint must be filed within 14 days of the student receiving a unit level decision or appeal decision, whichever is final. Alternatively, if a student does not receive a reply from the unit, the student may file a formal complaint within 30 days of the initial written notification of a grievance to the unit. The only basis for a formal complaint is that the applicable policy or procedure has not been followed or applied.  Formal Instructional Complaint Appeals of academic issues (other than grades or progression) beyond a college’s academic dean may be made in writing to the Office of the Provost within 14 calendar days of the decision of the unit’s dean or director, using the process described below.  The Office of the Provost will make the final decision and will notify the student of the decision within 14 calendar days of receipt of the complaint, as described below.  Complete records of such formal academic complaints (other than grades or progression), and records of their disposition, are maintained by the Office of the Provost. Formal Non-Instructional Complaint Appeals of a non-academic decision beyond a unit’s dean or director may be made in writing to the Office of the Vice President and Chief of Staff within 14 calendar days of the head of the unit’s decision using the process described below.

Formal Complaint Process A formal complaint must be made in writing, and include the following information: a) Student’s name, Regis I.D. number, mailing address, and telephone number. b) A detailed description of the specific actions that constitute the basis for the complaint and the names and titles of those involved. c) The dates of the alleged actions. d) A list of witnesses, if any, including their contact information and the facts known by each. e) Documentation that supports the complaint. f) Evidence that the student has already attempted to resolve the concern through the informal dialogue and unit level resolution, as described above. Upon receipt of a formal complaint, the Office of the Provost or the Office of the Vice President for Mission and Chief of Staff, as appropriate, will acknowledge receipt of the complaint within 7 working days. Normally, complaints will be investigated and resolved within 14 calendar days. The administrator in receipt of the complaint will advise the complainant if that timeline will not be met. The office in receipt of the complaint will issue a written determination of the complaint which will be provided to the student and the affected unit or other individual. If it is evident the complaint has not been previously addressed by the appropriate college/school/division/unit for investigation and proposed resolution, the complaint may be referred to the correct level for a decision. The office that receives the complaint may overturn, modify, or uphold the previous decision made by the head of the unit.

These four offices have a combined student service area located on the 4th floor of Main Hall at the Lowell Campus and student service associates situated at all campus locations to assist students with questions pertaining to financial aid, students’ accounts, and academic records and registration.  FINANCIAL AID The Office of Financial Aid strives to help as many Regis University students as funds permit. Financial aid awards are made after a student has been admitted to an eligible degree or certificate program of the University and has applied for financial aid. Most awards are based on financial need. However, a limited amount of aid is available to students without need. Students are encouraged to call 303-458-4126 or, if calling from outside the Denver Metro area, toll-free at 800-568-8932 for financial aid information. Information is also available on the Financial Aid website at www.regis.edu/financialaid.   APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID Eligibility for financial aid is determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available online at www. fafsa.gov. Students should allow ample time for the processed document to reach the Office of Financial Aid. All continuing students should submit a FAFSA annually by the April 15 priority date in order to allow sufficient time for processing and to be considered for all types of financial aid, including grants and University scholarships. The FAFSA code for Regis University is 001363. Copies of IRS federal tax return transcripts (parent and student for dependent students; or student and spouse, if married) and an Institutional Verification form may be required. In order to meet Regis’ priority funding date for the following academic year (summer, fall and spring semesters), a completed FAFSA must be received by the government processor by April 15. Returning students applying ONLY for on-campus student employment, who do not plan to complete the FAFSA, should submit a Regis Student Employment Award Application by April 15.  HOW ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is analyzed according to a need analysis approved annually by the U.S. Congress and implemented by the U.S. Department of Education. Components such as income, number in family, number of household members in college, and asset strength are integrated into the formula. The need analysis attempts to determine the amount students and their families can afford to contribute toward the student’s education for one year. This amount is called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Results of this analysis are forwarded to the Office of Financial Aid specified by students on the application. The Regis University Office of Financial Aid and the state of Colorado determines a reasonable cost of education, including tuition, fees, books and supplies, room and board (for both campus resident students and students living off campus), personal expenses, and transportation costs. The budgets are designed to permit students to live at a modest but adequate standard during the period of education. The student’s EFC is subtracted from the cost of the education budget to determine financial need or eligibility. Students who do not demonstrate financial need through this process may still be eligible for scholarships, Federal PLUS loan, Unsubsidized Federal Direct loan, or other forms of assistance offered by Regis University.  NOTIFICATION AND DISBURSEMENT When a student’s financial aid application is complete (all forms and reports received), it is reviewed by Financial Aid personnel. If a student is eligible and funds are available, an award letter is prepared and can be viewed on WebAdvisor. The student can REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  32  accept, reduce or decline their loans online.  Most aid is divided into two or three equal payments, based on the number of semesters for which the student is enrolled. Federal loans require that students complete Entrance Counseling and a Master Promissory Note and funding will only disburse once these steps are completed. Funds that have been awarded, accepted and complete are credited to the student’s account within a week after the end of the add/drop period when the student has begun enrollment for the appropriate credit hours. The student will be contacted if any funds are received by check that require personal endorsement. Any funds in excess of student expenses billed by Regis University may be used for other allowable educational expenses such as books and living expenses. These funds are not available until approximately 14 days after the appropriate add/drop period. Therefore, students should plan ahead and have sufficient resources to meet these costs.  UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS Regis University is dedicated to providing financial support to undocumented students within the limits of state and federal law. Financial aid is generally not available for undocumented students. The majority of all student aid, including Federal and Colorado student aid, requires the recipient to be a US citizen, permanent resident (green card holder), or an eligible non-citizen.  Regis University provides institutional funds to undocumented students by awarding academic and other talent-based scholarships. The majority of these scholarships are awarded at the time of admission and notice is included in the admissions letter. Students who are eligible to work in the United States can apply for on-campus student employment by completing the Student Employment Award Application at www.regis.edu/faforms. For more information visit www.regis.edu/financialaid and www.finaid.org/otheraid/undocumented.phtml.  TYPES OF NEED-BASED AID After the student’s completed need analysis has been received, Financial Aid personnel prepare an award package, to the extent that funds allow for each eligible student. An aid package may include the following types of awards.  GRANTS (GIFT ASSISTANCE)  Federal Pell Grant This is a federally funded program for undergraduate students with extreme financial need who are seeking a first baccalaureate degree. Application is made by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Federal legislation limits Federal Pell Grant funds to students who have not earned a bachelor’s degree. The Federal Pell Grant will be disbursed only if students have not already received the lifetime maximum amount which is the equivalent of awards for twelve semesters of full-time enrollment. The student’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC), estimated costs, and enrollment status determine the amount of the Federal Pell grant.   Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) This federally funded supplemental grant may be awarded to a student seeking a first baccalaureate degree. Application is made by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). These funds are limited and students must qualify for Federal Pell Grant to be considered for Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants.  TEACH Grant The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program provides up to $4,000 per year in grant funds to students who commit to 1) teach full-time 2) in high-need subject areas 3) for at least four years and 4) at schools that serve students from low-income families. Graduate students may be eligible for $4,000 per year ($8,000 total) with the same commitment to teach. If the commitment is not fulfilled, the TEACH award is converted to an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan with interest retroactive to the time of the award disbursement. Eligible applicants must meet certain academic requirements, file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and sign the required commitment statements each year.  The College Opportunity Fund (COF) COF provides an amount of money (stipend) per semester hour paid by the State of Colorado on behalf of an eligible undergraduate student. The amount of stipend is set annually by the Colorado General Assembly. The stipend for eligible private institutions is 50% of the amount set for public institutions. The maximum stipend semester hours are capped at 145 semester hours, with an additional 30 hours of undergraduate semester hour eligibility available. For eligible Regis University undergraduate students, the stipend is awarded through the financial aid process. A COF undergraduate student at Regis University is a student who:  is classified as an in-state student;  is a graduate of a Colorado high school or has successfully completed a non-public home-based education program in Colorado or received a GED in Colorado;  demonstrates financial need through the student’s eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant program (student must complete the FAFSA); and  meet any other eligibility requirements established by the Colorado Department of Higher Education. Students are required to apply for the COF stipend program through the College Assist website. This application needs to be completed only once in a student’s lifetime. The link to the College Assist application is at https://cof.college-assist.org/Apply.  Colorado Student Grant Colorado Student Grants are state funds awarded to Colorado resident undergraduate students with high financial need. Students must file the FAFSA in order to be considered for this grant. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  33  Colorado Graduate Grant Colorado Graduate Grants are state funds awarded to Colorado resident graduate students with high financial need and who major in certain fields as specified by the state. These majors include math, science, computer science, and health fields.  Regis Grant A Regis Grant is an award of Regis University funds for undergraduate students. A FAFSA is required because grants are based on demonstrated financial need.  LOANS (REPAYABLE ASSISTANCE)  Federal Perkins Loan/Schneider Perkins Replacement Loan The Federal Perkins Loan is no longer available. The Schneider Perkins Replacement Loan may be available for students who received Federal Perkins loans prior to 4/30/18, that were actively enrolled as of that same date, and for whom Regis University has offered this funding to help mitigate the loss of the Federal Perkins loan. Students who received a Federal Perkins Loan/Schneider Perkins Replacement must complete an exit interview before leaving the University at which time the loan obligations and contingencies are discussed.  Federal Nursing Student Loan The Federal Nursing Student Loan is a federally funded loan with a portion of the loan contributed by Regis University. Loans may be made directly by Regis University to nursing undergraduate students who provide evidence of financial need through the FAFSA application. Loans must be repaid to Regis University. The interest rate is 5% and the repayment period begins nine months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis. The aggregate maximum for the loan is $17,000. Descriptions of reasons for deferment and cancellation are detailed in the promissory note. Students must complete an exit interview before leaving the University at which time the loan obligations and contingencies are discussed.  Federal Nursing Faculty Loan Program The Federal Nursing Faculty Loan Program is a federally funded loan with a portion of loan funds contributed by Regis University. Loans are made directly by Regis University to nursing masters students in the education program. Financial need is not a requirement of the program and students are expected to teach nursing courses after graduation. The interest rate is 3% and portions of the loan may be cancelled after documentation of teaching employment.  Federal Direct Loan The Federal Direct Loan is a federal education loan designed to help students pay for college. To apply for a Federal Direct Loan, students must submit a FAFSA application. The FAFSA results determine a student’s financial need, which affects the amount of subsidized loan that an undergraduate student can borrow. Students may be offered a subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan, or both. If the loan is subsidized, the federal government pays the interest while the student is enrolled and through a six-month grace period after the student has graduated or ceased to be enrolled at least halftime. Students begin to pay interest on the loan when repayment begins. Graduate students are not eligible for subsidized loans. Students may be eligible for unsubsidized loans if educational costs remain after all other financial aid is subtracted within annual and aggregate loan limits. The unsubsidized loan amount is not determined by need. Students are responsible for the interest from the time the unsubsidized loan is disbursed until it is paid in full. Students can choose to pay the interest or allow it to accumulate and be capitalized, that is, added to the principal amount of the loan. Capitalizing the interest will increase the amount to repay. A federal origination fee will be deducted prior to disbursement.  Federal PLUS Loan Parents of dependent undergraduate students may borrow on the student’s behalf. The annual maximum loan limit equals the student’s cost of attendance minus any financial aid. There is no cumulative loan limit for a Federal PLUS Loan. Interest capitalization and repayment begin immediately upon loan disbursement. A federal origination fee will be deducted prior to disbursement. A FAFSA and a Federal PLUS Loan application are required. Need is not a factor. A credit check and the absence of adverse credit history are required.  Federal Graduate PLUS Loan A Federal Graduate PLUS loan is available to graduate students. To be eligible, a graduate student must be attending Regis University at least half time (3 graduate semester hours per term or 6 required undergraduate semester hours), file a FAFSA, apply for the Federal Direct Loan, and not have any adverse credit when a credit check is conducted.  A graduate student may borrow up to the full cost of education (as determined by the Office of Financial Aid) less the amount of other financial aid awarded, including Federal Direct Loans and alternative loans. The estimated cost of attendance includes tuition, room, board, books, personal, transportation, and other educationally related expenses.  The Federal Graduate PLUS interest rate is fixed annually on July 1. Federal origination fees will be deducted from the loan amount prior to disbursement. Graduate PLUS loan repayment begins within 60 days after graduation or dropping below half-time status. Students who are enrolled at least half time will be placed in deferment status. The standard repayment period is ten years.  EMPLOYMENT (EARNED ASSISTANCE)  Federal Student Employment Federal Student Employment is a federally funded work program with a portion of the funds provided by Regis University. Awards are based on need. Payment of work-study earnings is made every two weeks based on the number of hours worked. Funds are paid to the student every two weeks for work performed. A designated number of student jobs are in community service. Students must file the FAFSA and apply by April 15 in order to qualify. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  34  Colorado Student Employment Colorado Student Employment is a state-funded employment program for Colorado resident undergraduate students and may be awarded to those with or without need. Students must complete the FAFSA for need-based student employment or the Regis University Student Employment Application if they are interested in no-need student employment and apply by April 15. Payment of work-study earnings is made every two weeks based on the number of hours worked.  Regis Student Employment Student employment positions on campus are available on a limited basis. Students who are interested in student employment as well as other types of aid must complete the FAFSA. Students who are interested in only student employment should complete a Regis University Student Employment Award Application by the April 15 deadline to be considered for this award for the following fall and spring semesters. Payment of earnings is made every two weeks based on the number of hours worked.  MERIT-BASED AID Some types of assistance do not have financial need eligibility as a qualifying factor. Rather, they are based upon academic, leadership or athletic excellence. If the student receives both need-based and merit-based aid, the aggregate total may not exceed the student’s demonstrated need. Scholarship amounts vary but most do not exceed tuition and fees.  Board of Trustees and Regis Achievement Awards A limited number of Board of Trustees Scholarships are offered to entering Regis College freshmen with high scholastic achievement. The award is renewed each year for a total of four years (eight semesters) as long as the recipient maintains a 3.000 cumulative grade point average. These scholarships are not available during the summer semester. A limited number of Regis Achievement Awards are offered to entering Regis College freshmen with proven ability. The award is renewed each year for a total of four years (eight semesters) as long as the recipient maintains a 2.750 cumulative grade point average. These awards are not available during the summer semester.  Natural Science Scholarship This up to full-tuition scholarship is awarded to Regis College freshmen and transfer students who plan to major in chemistry, biology, or mathematics and who excel on a test of proficiency given at the University in February. Scholarships are renewable for up to four years of study (eight semesters for freshmen and four semesters for transfers) for students who maintain a 3.000 or higher grade point average. Recipients must remain in the field of study for which the award was made. These scholarships are not available during the summer semester.  Forensic Award A limited number of awards are offered to entering Regis College freshmen and continuing students with competitive public speaking skills. Interested students should contact the Communications Department. The award is renewable each year based on review of speech performance. These awards are not available during the summer semester.  Endowed/Annual Scholarships Regis University offers over 200 endowed and annual scholarships to students enrolled in the Anderson College of Business, the College of Computer & Information Sciences, and the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies, Regis College, the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions. These scholarships have been established through the generous support of foundations, corporations, and the University’s alumni, parents, and friends. Scholarships are an investment in the students of Regis, and the University community is grateful for the vision of our scholarship donors. Scholarships are a very meaningful way to honor families, friends, and loved ones. Criteria for each scholarship are determined by the donor, and selection is made by the Office of Financial Aid, and in some cases, a scholarship committee. Eligibility is based on merit and/or financial need. In most cases, selection is based on information provided by students in the general application process, including the FAFSA and academic records. Students are automatically considered for these scholarship awards at the time of application to the University; there is no separate application for most scholarships. On occasion, students may be asked to furnish additional information for selected scholarships. In most cases, scholarships are renewable for four years if the student maintains certain academic requirements and funding is available. Donors are interested in basic information about scholarship recipients. By accepting the scholarship, a student agrees to allow the University to share this type of information with the donor.

Students should contact the Athletic Department or coach of their sport for additional information. Additional aid may be awarded from other sources if the FAFSA is completed and further eligibility is indicated. Students who receive full athletic grants for tuition, fees, and room and board may not receive other gift aid except for Federal Pell Grants. All awards must comply with NCAA rules, including the academic eligibility prescribed. Renewal conditions are set by the athletic department.  OTHER SOURCES OF AID  Bureau of Indian Affairs Grants are available to students who are at least one-fourth Native American, Eskimo, or Aleut and who are issued an Indian Certification by their tribe. This grant is usually a supplement to other types of financial aid. Students should apply to a Bureau of Indian Affairs agency.  Dependent’s Tuition Assistance This program provides tuition assistance for dependents of National Guardsmen, law enforcement officers, or firefighters killed or disabled in the line of duty. It also assists dependents of Coloradans who were prisoners of war or missing in action. Students should apply through the Colorado Department of Higher Education.  Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Students with physical or emotional needs may be eligible for assistance with tuition, fees, books, supplies, maintenance, medical services, and transportation. Students should inquire with the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation regarding eligibility  at https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dvr.   Employee Tuition Benefit (ETB) ETB is available to eligible employees of Regis University and to their spouse and dependent children. Eligibility for benefits varies according to the number of hours and months an employee has worked. Students must be admitted to an eligible program and be eligible to receive the benefit, including meeting the minimum requirements of the financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress policy. Complete details are included in the ETB application available in the Human Resources Department.  Tuition Exchange and Faculty Children’s Exchange (FACHEX) Faculty and Staff Children Exchange Program is an undergraduate REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  38  tuition scholarship program available to the children of full-time faculty, administration, and staff of participating institutions. It allows children who are eligible for tuition remission at their home institution (parent’s employer) to be considered for tuition scholarship funds from one of the other participating Jesuit colleges. It is not a guaranteed benefit since Regis University does not control the selection/awarding process at the other participating Jesuit colleges and universities and Regis University does not have sufficient funds to award every student who applies to attend here with FACHEX. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information.  Outside Scholarships The Office of Financial Aid at Regis University, high school guidance offices, and public libraries have listings of scholarships provided by companies, individuals, and trusts outside the University. The Regis University website provides access to a scholarship database at www.regis.edu/financialaid.  State Scholarship/Grant Programs Some states, such as Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, offer grant and scholarship assistance for students attending Regis University. Information on these programs may be obtained from a school counselor or the Higher Educational Assistance Agency in the student’s home state.  Veterans’ Benefits The University is approved by the State Approving Agency of Colorado, a division of the State Board for Community Colleges and Occupational Education, to offer courses of education and training for veterans and eligible dependents under the provisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans and other eligible persons should obtain their certificates of eligibility from the regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) before entrance into the University. The payment of benefits by VA differs according to half-time or full-time enrollment. Students who are eligible for veterans’ benefits should check with the Regis University certifying official in the Academic Records and Registration office for specific information about their particular program. Additionally, students receiving veterans’ benefits must notify the Regis University certifying official under the following conditions:  the student is temporarily withdrawing from the program;  the student is permanently withdrawing from the program;  the student is changing programs and/or majors; or  the student is attending another college or university.  INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS Federal and state financial aid funds are restricted to citizens and permanent residents of the United States. International students with F-1 or J-1 visa types who seek employment on or off campus must follow procedures specified by the Designated School Official in the Office of Global Education in order to maintain legal status. If required standards are met, International students may apply for scholarships, institutionally funded grants, and student employment.  CONSORTIUM AGREEMENTS The Financial Aid Consortium Agreement is an agreement between Regis University and an eligible college to share enrollment information and records for student financial aid eligibility. Under a Consortium Agreement, Regis University may act as the Home school, meaning the student intends to receive his or her degree or certificate from Regis. The other school acts as the Host school. Students may take classes that Regis University approves for credit at the other college, and those credits will be transferred to Regis. Under this agreement, students can be considered for financial aid if they are at least half-time students, combining classes at both schools the student is attending. Students must renew their consortium agreement each semester and other qualifications and limitations may apply..  Registration/Enrollment Students should enroll in a degree-granting program at Regis University and create a degree plan with a Regis University advisor. This plan may be altered with the advisor’s approval. At the beginning of each semester, students must register for all courses they will take during that semester. If a student is taking courses at Regis University, he/she follows the standard registration process at Regis. Students who are taking courses at a Host school must meet with a Regis University academic advisor for pre-approval of their planned courses before they register.  When registering at a Host school, students should identify themselves as a Regis University student. If courses are taken at Regis, tuition is paid to Regis. If courses are taken at a Host school, tuition is paid by the student to the Host school. Students attending a Host school should apply for financial aid through Regis University. Students must:  submit a FAFSA;  complete an Authorization to Release Information form; and  contact the Office of Financial Aid at Regis University to complete any additional forms as appropriate. Courses approved by the Regis University academic advisor and taken at a Host school are considered for financial aid eligibility. Students must notify the Office of Financial Aid if their enrollment plans change, since enrollment status affects financial aid eligibility. Financial aid is not paid until the Office of Financial Aid receives verification from the Host school that a student is enrolled for the minimum required credits. This occurs after the Host schools’ add/drop period. Any credit refund from financial aid proceeds is processed within two weeks after financial aid is credited to the student account at Regis University.  For more information concerning consortium agreements, students should contact the Office of Financial Aid.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  39  STUDY ABROAD Enrollment in a program of study that is approved for credit by the student’s academic advisor may be considered as enrolled at Regis University for the purpose of being eligible for federal and state financial aid. Students who are juniors or seniors with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 and clean disciplinary records should contact the Office of Global Education for approved study abroad programs. If approved for participation, interested students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information.  ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS In some cases, the student must be enrolled as a full-time student in order to qualify for financial assistance. Most aid programs allow for less than full-time attendance, but the student must generally be enrolled at least half time in order to qualify. The student award letter specifies the enrollment requirements upon which the financial aid award is based. Undergraduate Status Credit Hour Requirement Full-Time 12 or more semester hours Three-Quarter Time 9 to 11 semester hours Half-Time 6 to 8 semester hours Graduate Status Credit Hour Requirement Full-Time 6 or more graduate semester hours Half-Time 3 to 5 graduate semester hours NOTE: If undergraduate classes are required for a graduate degree, the student must have at least six undergraduate semester hours to be considered a half-time student.  SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION All individuals required to register for the draft, in accordance with the Military Selective Service Act, must comply with this mandate or forfeit eligibility for federal student aid.  SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS The federal and state governments require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor the academic progress of students who are receiving federal, state, or institutional assistance. All hours attempted and completed are reviewed. Cumulative grade point averages and maximum hours of financial aid eligibility are monitored once per year. The full policy for Satisfactory Academic Progress is available on the Regis University Financial Aid website.  REFUNDS DUE TO WITHDRAWAL Scholarships, grants and loan funds normally are not credited to a student’s account until after the appropriate add/drop period based on the student’s academic program each semester. At this time enrollment status is verified and, if required, adjustments are made. Financial aid is not credited to a student’s account if no enrolled hours can be verified or enrolled hours are insufficient based on the level on the award letter. Students who completely withdraw after aid has been credited may have their aid adjusted in accordance with federal and state regulations. Withdrawal does not eliminate financial obligation to the University. Charges owed to the University at the time of withdrawal are the student’s responsibility based on the University’s tuition and housing refund policies. Details of these policies are available in the Office of Student Accounts. There are specific federal, state and University withdrawal policies regarding tuition and fees, housing charges, refunds to financial aid programs, and repayments resulting from withdrawal. The student’s withdrawal may result in a return of funds to the federal financial aid programs, and the student may have to repay those funds. There are three situations that may require immediate repayment of financial aid funds when a student withdraws: If University charges are reduced as a result of withdrawal, and a student account credit balance is created, these funds may be used to repay financial aid programs, depending on the amount of financial aid and the date of withdrawal. A student may have to repay financial aid funds that are in excess of an amount determined to be reasonable for the length of enrollment. This repayment is based on federal guidelines. If withdrawal occurs prior to fully establishing enrollment eligibility, the entire financial aid award, including any credit balance, will be repaid to the financial aid programs. This may result in a balance due to the University. Earnings in student employment programs are paid through the time of withdrawal. Students may not continue student employment after withdrawing from the University. Financial aid is for enrolled students only. Except in rare situations, financial aid cannot be disbursed after withdrawal. Students who receive financial aid and withdraw may lose future financial aid eligibility. Refer to the full Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy on the Regis University Financial Aid website. Information regarding the federal regulations for calculating refunds and repayments and the order of financial aid programs to which aid is restored is included in detail on the Financial Aid website.  STUDENT ACCOUNTS  TUITION, FEES, ROOM AND BOARD CHARGES Tuition, fees, and room and board charges are posted to students’ accounts as they are assessed. Payments are applied to accounts when received by the University. Students may call 303-458-4126 with questions concerning their account. If calling from outside the Denver Metro area, the toll-free number is 800-568-8932.  TUITION RATES Student tuition and fees will be billed based on the tuition rate and fees associated with the student’s primary college and academic program. Current tuition rates and associated fees can be found in each college section of this Catalog or on the Regis University Cost of Attendance by College page at Regis.edu   REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG      2018-2019  40  FINANCIAL POLICIES Tuition, fees, and other charges described in this Catalog are good faith projections for the current academic year. They are, however, subject to change from one academic term to the next as deemed necessary by the University in order to meet its financial commitments and to fulfill its role and mission. There may be other fees and charges that are not specified in this Catalog. These fees and charges may be ascertained by contacting the University office that administers the program or activity in which the student intends to enroll or engage. Additionally, a non-refundable tuition deposit may be required by an individual program upon official acceptance to the University. Regis University reserves the right to restrict and/or drop registration. The University will not register a student or issue official transcripts, diplomas, or other educational credentials or certifications to or on behalf of any student or former student with a financial obligation, which includes without limitation a financial obligation resulting from a student receivable balance, fee and fine receivable balance, Federal Perkins, Federal Nursing loan, Nurse Faculty Loan Program, and other institutional loans. At the time of registration, the student accepts financial responsibility for all tuition and fee charges. Full payment of the student account balance is due by the published due date. If the balance is not paid by the due date, late fees will be assessed and the student account will be considered in default.  It is the responsibility of the student to update Regis University with address and phone number changes and other pertinent contact information. Failure to receive invoices, reminders, or past-due notices does not relieve the student of his or her financial obligation. Students who are referred to a collection agency, even if the referral is due to an incorrect address on file, are obligated to pay any and all collection fees incurred. Failure to pay on a past due balance will result in the account being sent to external collection agencies.  Upon non-payment of a past due balance, Regis University may declare the balance due and payable.  At the time of registration, students agree to reimburse Regis University the fees of any collection agency up to 33% which may not be reflected in the statement of account, which may be based on a percentage of the debt, and all the costs, fees and expenses, including late fees and all other applicable charges to Regis University.  In the event this agreement is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection through legal proceedings or otherwise, it is the responsibility of the student to pay late fees, attorney fees, court fees and costs, and all other applicable charges to Regis University. Electronic signatures are equal to signed promissory notes. Tuition deferments, payment agreements, and RPO payment plans are equal to loans and are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Disputed past due accounts shall be governed by Colorado law, excluding its conflicts of law’s provisions. In the event of default, Regis University and its respective agents reserve the right to report defaulted information to the credit bureaus.  Once a delinquent account that was placed with a collection agency is paid off by the student, the student will be placed on a pre-pay status for two semesters with registration for any future registrations.

MISSION  Building on our Jesuit tradition of values-based experiential learning, the Anderson College of Business cultivates leaders of integrity who think critically, communicate clearly and implement innovative solutions to complex challenges. We partner with business and community leaders to enhance economic, environmental, and social well-being.  How We Achieve the Mission: Jesuit tradition: The Jesuit tradition of education focuses on the knowledge and skills one needs to succeed and also the emotional and moral sensibilities of the heart. We consider the values that drive decisions as a way to engage the whole person in their work. We also use learning experiences such as case studies, group projects, service learning, consulting partnerships, and internships to engage students with the world.  Cultivate leaders of integrity: Leaders are not necessarily the people at the top, but are those who influence and foster change. We plant the seeds and support change agents who seek to initiate positive change. We guide students as they analyze ambiguous situations, communicate with others, build teams, and effectively respond to unanticipated challenges in an ethical and socially responsible manner.  Partner with business and community leaders: We seek partners who are transforming the practices and systems that will enhance the well-being of all. We challenge our students to develop sustainable and innovative solutions that balance business and economic success, environmental impact, and respect for others.  VISION To help business become stewards of society with the goal of improving the quality of life on Earth. VALUES We achieve our mission by honoring and living out our core values.   Character that demonstrates honesty, integrity, resilience and respect at all times.  Competence that advances our professions and our lifelong skills of creativity, communication and critical thinking.  Care for the whole person that honors the dignity of the individual in community with others. Compassionate leadership that courageously engages difficult economic, environmental and social challenges in the pursuit of a more just world. PURPOSE Anderson College of Business offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, certificates, credit courses, and non-credit courses in both traditional and non-traditional formats.  Undergraduate offerings tailor learning to the student in the non-traditional program through classroom-based and online and to students in the traditional 16-week program through classroom delivery. The College  is structured to serve three general groups of undergraduate students:  those who desire to experience a traditional undergraduate program  those undergraduates who wish to complete a program leading to a degree and   those who seek specialized training or knowledge to increase their competence in their current occupation or profession or to prepare themselves for a new occupation or profession.  OUR CORNERSTONES  Learning through experience.  Driving change through innovation.  Building workforce capacity.  Sustaining the earth for future generations.  SERVICE LEARNING Service Learning is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human, community, and business development needs together with structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning and development. Service Learning joins two complex concepts: community action, the “service” and efforts learned from that action and connect what is learned to existing knowledge, the “learning.” Community-based learning serving business and non-profit entities becomes service learning when it is connected to classroom curriculum related activities and contains opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences, thus allowing for consciousness raising and systemic change. This is particularly true for Jesuit education that has for centuries held a mission of forming men and women who seek to transform the world through service to others.  ANDERSON COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Admissions requirements for Regis University students are outlined in this General Information section of this Catalog under the ‘Regis University Admissions’ heading.   More specific requirements for Anderson College of Business graduate degree admission can be found in this section of the Catalog under the heading ‘Graduate Programs’.  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019 60  ACADEMIC INFORMATION  STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Students are expected to have college-level writing skills when they enter a program. These skills include writing mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation, word usage and structure) along with analysis of issues, support of position, and clarity of thought. Each student is responsible for meeting the writing standards designated by the degree program.  STUDENT ETHICS STATEMENT An integral component of Anderson College of Business  courses is student and faculty self-disclosure and the use of personal experience for the purpose of facilitating course work. Each student is expected to honor confidentiality as it pertains to student disclosure. It shall be a violation of the ethical standards to use shared information, comments, or opinions expressed by another student or facilitator/instructor in the educational setting in a manner which is intended to humiliate, embarrass, harass, damage, or otherwise injure the student in his/her personal, public or business/professional life. In addition, confidentiality must be upheld by not disclosing any information which would identify a particular individual or organization. An additional integral component of higher education is challenging one’s own perceptions and beliefs regarding the course content and integrating information as well as understanding opposing perceptions and beliefs. Thus, students have the right to choose how much they will disclose and must also accept the responsibility of respecting disclosure of other students and facilitators/instructors.  STUDENT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT In the spirit of the Jesuit mission of Regis University, Anderson College of Business  students and faculty share responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. This includes using information technology responsibly in online and other courses. In order for faculty members to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, online courses, and other learning areas, the Anderson College of Business  and the faculty expect students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner and not engage in disruptive behavior, disorderly conduct or intentionally interfere in the freedom of expression of others. “Disruptive Behavior” or “Disorderly Conduct” as applied in all academic settings and formats (i.e., classroom, online, independent study, etc.) means behavior that a reasonable faculty member or student would view as intentionally or recklessly interfering with normal academic functions, university events, or university sponsored activities.  Examples include, but are not limited to: persistently speaking or commenting without being recognized or interrupting other speakers; behavior that distracts the class from the subject matter or discussion; or, in extreme cases, physical threats, harassing behavior or personal insults; refusal to comply with faculty direction including refusal to work in a group, using a cell phone or pager during a classroom session, inappropriate mediated communication; or behavior that has a negative impact in any learning environment. Disruptive behavior also includes any other behavior covered by the Regis University Student Handbook: Code of Conduct which can be found at www.regis.edu. Students who fail to adhere to acceptable behavioral standards may be subject to discipline which may include reprimand, dismissal from the class and/or expulsion from the Anderson College of Business. Students who wish to appeal a decision regarding the consequences of their behavior should follow the Appeal Process outlined in the Regis University Student Handbook.  LEARNING FORMATS A variety of learning formats and locations offer students flexibility and options in completing graduate and undergraduate study. Among all degrees, close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice as well as opportunities to develop skills and abilities that prepare learners for changing demands of the workplace.  Students may complete Regis University academic course work through any combination of the following learning formats as availability of course format permits:  classroom-based courses  online courses  blended courses (classroom-based and online combination) Course work acquired through any of these learning formats, as well as courses available through the College of Computer & Information Sciences, the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies, Regis College or the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions, meet the definition of Regis University credit.  Classroom-Based Classroom-based courses are offered in eight, and 16-week academic periods, weekend intensive format or in summer intensive format. Most traditional courses meet two or three days per week on the Northwest Campus for a total of 37 contact hours. Most non-traditional courses meet one or two days/evenings each week for a total of  32 or more contact hours. Course learning format, selection, and availability vary by campus location. Students choosing the non-traditional format usually study a single subject area for a concentrated period of time. This course format is based on a facilitative model of learning. Most non-traditional classes require a minimum of 19-25 hours of combined study and classroom time each week, depending on the course content, course length and the student’s learning style. While this model allows for degree completion in a shorter period of time, there is an increased expectation for independent learning outside the classroom.  Online Online courses are generally offered in an non-traditional eight-week format over the Internet. These courses are designed to 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG 61  provide an interactive learning experience for students. Faculty and students communicate and collaborate through online discussions and e-mail. Course materials generally include textbook(s) and online workshops.  Lifestyle issues--including variable work schedules, family responsibilities, physical limitations or geographical inaccessibility--make this a viable option for students pursuing higher educational goals. Online courses have highly structured requirements and deadlines which fall within eight week academic terms. Online students need to have computer equipment and skills at a specified minimum level. Please check with the undergraduate program for current requirements. Students should allocate a minimum of 20 hours each week for completing course assignments and participating in online discussions.  CURRICULUM Regardless of format, each course offered focuses on course objectives, required learning activities, and outcome evaluation. Close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice, as well as the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that prepare students for changing demands of the workplace. Because effective written and oral communication skills are essential in both occupational and academic environments, the Anderson College of Business  emphasizes the development of these skills.  FACULTY In addition to full-time faculty, the Anderson College of Business  makes use of facilitators, independent study course instructors, and presenters who are frequently working professionals representing various corporations, businesses and organizations. All hold a master’s or doctoral degree, and bring academic theory and current professional experience to the learning environment. An assessment process is employed to determine not only the knowledge base of each selected faculty member, but also his/her ability to facilitate the learning of all students.  ACADEMIC ADVISING A unique feature of Anderson College of Business  is its emphasis on academic advising. Advisors are available to assist with course planning and degree development as needed. Advisors provide assistance and recommendations to students from the point of admission through graduation.  Transfer Credit Approval In order to ensure acceptance of transfer credit from other institutions once students are enrolled at Regis University, all transfer courses need prior approval of an undergraduate advisor, graduate faculty advisor or designee.  Concurrent Enrollment Request forms may be obtained online through WebAdvisor. Undergraduate students are not permitted to take the last 30 semester hours of coursework at another institution without permission of the assistant dean for the Anderson College of Business. A grade of “C-” or better must be earned for undergraduate coursework to be accepted in transfer.  REGISTRATION The course schedules in the Anderson College of Business  are originated by the respective programs. Students should register online via WebAdvisor, in person, or by phone. Students may register and pay at any Regis University site.   Add/Drop Students may drop a course through the end of the published add/drop period online through WebAdvisor, in person, or by phone, or at any Regis University site. When students drop a course within the add/drop period, the course does not appear on the transcript and tuition charges are credited to the account. Students in the traditional  program must have approval from their advisor to add/drop courses. Students are responsible for dropping courses they do not plan to attend.  CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT IN OTHER REGIS UNIVERSITY COLLEGES OR PROGRAMS  Undergraduate Students may take courses in multiple programs within colleges to fulfill degree requirements for graduation. Students wishing to cross-register within the University are not required to complete an application. Students should consult with their academic advisor  Graduate Anderson College of Business policy provides students with the opportunity to transfer up to six credit hours of graduate course work into a graduate degree plan. Generally, this policy is used to accept course work completed prior to admission into the graduate program. However, under special circumstances, students have the opportunity to complete work in other Regis graduate programs while enrolled in a Anderson College of Business  graduate program and receive credit for the courses toward degree requirements.  To register for graduate courses in another college/program, a student must meet all requirements of the college/program whose course work is taken. Suitability of course work from other Regis graduate programs for Anderson College of Business  degree requirements depends on several factors: relevance of the course to the student’s needs and goals; compatibility of the course with Anderson College of Business  graduate mission and goals; fit of the course into the requirements of the student’s degree and/or specialization; and suitability of the course for credit in the area of Business Administration. Approval for transfers under this policy must be obtained from the student’s academic advisor prior to registration. Students enrolled in other Regis University graduate programs and in Good Standing may register for Anderson College of Business  graduate courses that are either classroom-based or online. To do so the student must: have the approval from his/her academic advisor in the program in which the student is currently REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019 62  enrolled and obtain written approval from the appropriate Anderson College of Business  graduate program chair. Courses eligible for cross registration include all Anderson College of Business  graduate courses for which there is no prerequisite requirement. If a student wishes to enroll in a course for which one or more prerequisite course exists, the student must satisfy all prerequisite requirements before he/she will be permitted to enroll. Permission to enroll in Anderson College of Business  graduate courses does not guarantee that the courses can be used toward the student’s degree requirements.   COURSE AVAILABILITY Regis University does not guarantee that courses will be offered at the same campus location or on the same day as they were offered for a previous academic period. A course is subject to cancellation if the minimum student registration for that course is not met.  CLASS ATTENDANCE Students are expected to make every effort to attend all class meetings. Attendance standards for individual courses are established in writing by the instructor at the first class session. Students unable to attend the first class must contact the instructor ahead of time.  Students in an eight week course who are absent from two classes or fail to participate in two weeks of online classes may receive a failing grade.  ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS/CLASS Final examinations may be given at the end of each academic period. Students who miss a final examination, or who fail to submit all required work without a justifiable excuse, are awarded a grade based on all course requirements. Students who are unable to take a final examination or complete final course requirements for a valid reason (i.e., circumstances beyond the student’s control) must request in writing to the instructor a grade of incomplete (I). The “I” grade must be removed within a specified period of time or the alternate grade is assigned. More information can be found under the “Grading” heading in this  section of the Catalog.  COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD  Undergraduate Traditional The average class load is 15 to 18 semester hours. Ordinarily, only students with a 3.000 minimum cumulative grade point average and no grades of Incomplete are allowed to carry more than 18 semester hours. Permission to carry 19 or more semester hours (course overload) must be obtained from the assistant dean for the Anderson College of Business. If, in the judgment of the assistant dean, a student benefits by a reduced course load, the student is restricted to a course load of fewer than 15 semester hours. Students in the traditional program will be allowed to register for no more than one non-traditional course each eight-week session, but only when the traditional schedule of courses during the corresponding semester does not exceed 12 semester hours. If the traditional schedule of courses is fewer than 12 semester hours, additional non-traditional courses may be allowed with the permission of the assistant dean of the Anderson College of Business.  Undergraduate Non-Traditional Students in the non-traditional undergraduate program who wish to register for more than two courses in any five- or eight-week term, or more than 18 semester hours in one semester must receive approval from the Anderson College of Business  Undergraduate Advising department. Students must obtain and submit an Overload Request form 30 days prior to taking the overload credit to the Anderson College of Business  Undergraduate Advising Department. The advisor will:  Verify that students have a 3.000 grade point average or higher.  Ensure that students have no incomplete grades pending.  Contact students regarding approval or denial of the request. No further overloads are approved if students receive any incomplete grades and/or fall below a 3.000 grade point average.  Graduate Students are considered to be enrolled full time if they are registered for six semester hours in one semester. Students who want to register for more than six semester hours in any semester should consult with their academic advisor.  GRADING For additional information on incomplete grades, change of recorded grade, and repeat for higher grade, students should refer to the University General Information section of this Catalog.  Grade of Incomplete If a grade of Incomplete is approved by the instructor for an Anderson College of Business  graduate course, the incomplete grade assigned is “I/F”. The length of time for completion is determined by the instructor but may not exceed the end of the following term/semester. If the work is not completed by the deadline, the Incomplete will revert to a grade of “F”.  Grade of “In Progress” “In Progress” grades are given to students in graduate capstone project courses, graduate thesis courses or practicum/internship courses where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the eight weeks or semester (if a semester-based course) provided for completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an “In Progress” grade can be granted for a period of up to one year (12 months) to complete the capstone project course or practicum/internship. The grade to be recorded in the student’s record is IP/F or IP/NP depending on whether the approved grade in a letter grade or Pass/No Pass. If the student does not satisfactorily complete the 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG 63  course within the one year period, the grade reverts to the “F” or “NP” grade. “In Progress” grades will only be given in the capstone/thesis courses or practicum/internship courses. “In Progress” is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases if the student is unable to complete the course work for an approved reason and the instructor approves, the appropriate grade is Incomplete/F (I/F) and the student has no more than the eight weeks or equivalent term to complete the work.  Grade Reports All grades are reported at the end of each academic period, at which time they become official and are entered on the students’ permanent record. Grade reports are no longer mailed to students; however, grades may be accessed online through the WebAdvisor link at www.regis.edu. Grades cannot be given over the phone or e-mailed to the student.  Appeals of Disputed Grades - Traditional Grade appeals for Anderson College of Business students who are enrolled in a traditional course must be initiated within the first month of the semester following receipt of the grade. The following procedure is to be followed if a student wishes to protest a grade he or she received in a course: 1. The student raises the matter with the instructor in question. If the grade remains in dispute, the student should follow step 2. 2. At the student’s request, the department chair arranges for a committee of three faculty members to review the case. The student and the teacher may each appoint one of these three. The third is to be chosen by the other two. The committee reviews evidence in any manner the committee deems equitable. (Typically, a written statement from each party that the other party can review and respond to in writing is the first step.) Oral presentations to the committee are sometimes also useful. Care should be taken lest either of the parties be intimidated through oral procedure. The committee recommends a solution. 3. The committee’s decision is final, unless one of two circumstances occur: new and relevant information is made available that the committee did not see, or the process was not followed. The dissatisfied party appeals to the Anderson College of Business  Assistant Dean. The Assistant Dean reviews the proceedings up to this point, obtains any new information deemed appropriate, and makes the final determination. Further appeals are not permitted.  Appeals of Disputed Grades – Non-traditional Students who wish to dispute a grade earned in a course should use the following procedures: 1. The student contacts the instructor of the course to request a review of the issue.  2. If the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student submits a written request for review of the grade to the department chair for the course. The written request must be initiated within 60 days after the last official day of the term in which the course in question was taken. The request must provide rationale indicating why the grade earned is not appropriate, and all relevant documentation must be included (course syllabus, copies of exams, quizzes, papers, presentation materials, etc.) The request must include the student’s name, address, e-mail address, course number, instructor name and the term in which the course was completed. 3. The department chair reviews all documentation submitted.  If needed, the degree chair contacts the student and the instructor to arrange a personal interview. The faculty lead approves or disapproves the appeal.  If the department chair approves the appeal, a Change of Grade form is completed and submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The department chair informs the student and the instructor in writing of the decision regarding the appeal. 4. If the grade dispute is not satisfactorily resolved, the student may appeal the decision to the Assistant Dean of the Anderson College of Business. This written appeal must be submitted within two calendar weeks of receipt of the decision in step 3 above. The Assistant Dean will review the proceedings and any additional information provided by the student. The decision of the Assistant Dean is final.  DEAN’S LIST Traditional Students For fall and spring semesters, a Dean’s List is created for the Anderson College of Business  traditional undergraduate students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of 15 or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.700 is placed on the Dean’s List. Students who request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of 15 letter-graded semester hours. Students who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean’s List.   Non-Traditional Students For fall, spring and summer semesters, a Dean’s List is created for Anderson College of Business  non-traditional undergraduate students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of twelve or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.800 is placed on the Dean’s List. A student who is required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course--and who also carries nine or more graded hours with a 3.800 semester grade point average--is eligible for inclusion on the Dean’s List.  Students who are not required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course but request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of twelve letter-graded semester hours. Student who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean’s List.  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019 64  ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES  Good Standing Anderson College of Business undergraduate students must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade of less than “C-“ in an upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward completion of major or minor requirements. A grade of less than “C-” in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses apply toward graduation. To sustain good academic standing at the graduate level, a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 for 6000-level course work is required. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned in the 6000-level courses, by the total number of semester hours attempted in those courses. No more than two courses with grades of “C” can count toward graduation requirements. A grade lower than a “C” (e.g. “C-”) is not counted toward degree requirements, but is included in the cumulative grade point average.  Probation Anderson College of Business  undergraduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000 at the end of any given semester is placed on academic probation. During the next semester (fall, spring, summer for non-traditional students or fall and spring for traditional students) of enrollment, the University expects the student to raise his/her cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. If the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.000, the student may be academically suspended at the end of the probationary semester. The student must work closely with his/her advisor to determine the number of semester hours to be taken during the probationary semester to maximize the possibility of earning the required cumulative 2.000 grade point average by the end of the semester. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the Dean. Academic probation is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript). Occasionally, a student’s Regis University cumulative grade point average is so low that the student finds it mathematically impossible to attain a 2.000 cumulative grade point average during only one semester. In this case, the student may enter into an agreement with an advisor of the Anderson College of Business  to earn a provisional grade point average for the semester. The agreed-upon grade point average is set within a range that is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student. If the provisional semester grade point average is earned for the semester, but the student’s cumulative grade point average is still below 2.000, the student may be permitted to continue on probation rather than be suspended. Undergraduate students accepted on probation by the Anderson College of Business  may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 2.000 cumulative grade point average. Graduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.000 for 6000-level course(s) at the end of any given semester are placed on academic probation. After one semester on probation, a student’s performance will be reviewed by the appropriate department chair and Assistant Dean. Students who are not successful in raising their grade point average to 3.000 will be considered for suspension by the department chair and Assistant Dean. Students on probation are permitted to take only one course per term and are not permitted to have an Incomplete grade while on Probation. In addition, graduate students who receive a grade of “C” or less in two courses are subject to academic review. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the College Dean.  Suspension If an Anderson College of Business  student has been placed on academic probation and does not achieve a 2.000 (undergraduate) or 3.000 (graduate) cumulative grade point average at the end of the next semester of enrollment, he/she is suspended. Academic suspension is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript). Students are formally notified of their suspension from Regis University in a letter from the Dean. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous semester and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped. After one calendar year, the student may apply for readmission by fulfilling the following written requirements: 1. Submit a letter requesting readmission and an explanation of the previous academic difficulties and how the problem(s) have been addressed. 2. Submit a written contract, signed by the student and the appropriate Assistant Dean, which states how the student will meet the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average within a defined period. 3. An official transcript showing at least 12 semester hours of acceptable academic course work completed at a regionally accredited college or university (undergraduate students only).  Dismissal Academic dismissal is action taken by Regis University by which the student is rendered ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, a student must have been suspended, applied for and been readmitted to Regis University on academic probation, and failed to achieve either the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average. The provisional grade point average is pre-determined by the student and the assistant dean. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).  Suspension/Dismissal Appeal Procedure Students who wish to appeal their suspension/dismissal must complete the following requirements within 30 days (or sooner if indicated in the letter) of the date on the letter of notification for Suspension/Dismissal. 1. Write a letter or send an email to the Dean, Anderson College of Business explaining: 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG 65  a. Why the student should not be suspended from the program or dismissed from the University. b. What prevented the student from successful progress toward completion of academic goals. c. That the student is committed to and ready to proceed with serious academic study. d. Why the student failed to achieve the required grade point average. Were there, for example, any extenuating circumstances beyond the student’s control. e. The names of the student’s advisor or faculty members from whom supporting statements may be solicited by the student (undergraduate students only). 2. Contact the advisor, faculty member, doctors, etc. to discuss the case. Any supporting statements from them must be received by the same deadline. The Dean is interested in any pertinent information which has genuine bearing on the matter. The focus is on why the suspension/dismissal action should be reversed and why the student failed to reach his/her academic goals. Decisions on Suspension/Dismissal appeals by the College Dean are final; no further appeals are accepted.

In many of your classes you will participate in service learning, which lets you apply what you are learning in class to the greater service of our community. The Regis College Center for Service Learning (CSL) partners with faculty, students and the public to connect the academic objectives of courses across the disciplines to specific assets and needs in the community. Through these partnerships, CSL works to transform hearts, minds and the world by applying engaged learning teachings to traditional coursework. Standing within the Catholic and Jesuit traditions, CSL strives not only to meet rigorous academic objectives, but also to challenge students to explore diverse perspectives, create meaningful relationships, develop a critical consciousness and serve as positive agents of social change for local and global justice.  In addition, there are many opportunities to get involved outside the classroom in service work, from one-time volunteer projects to those involving extended, in-depth commitments. Students can also choose to go on service trips during school breaks, traveling abroad, across the country or just miles away. CSL also has an Engaged Scholar Activist program which hires students to assist faculty members with developing and implementing service learning work and community projects. For more information on how to get involved in service, please visit the website for the Center for Service Learning at www.regis.edu/rcservicelearning.  ENGINEERING For the engineering student, Regis University offers, in collaboration with Washington University of St. Louis, the Dual Degree Program in Engineering in which a student can receive a strong background in liberal arts and sciences, and professional training in engineering.  These students complete their Regis College Core and major requirements, and then take two years of engineering courses at Washington University. It is possible for students to finish the Regis requirements in three years if they start early, but it may require taking summer courses. Students may take four years to finish the Regis requirements.  An outline of the courses to be taken at Regis, and the areas of engineering available at Washington University can be obtained from the Regis Dual Degree Program Liaison Officer. Following the successful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Science degree (Engineering) from Washington University and a Bachelor’s degree from Regis University. The Dual Degree Program also includes the possibility of earning a Master of Science degree in Engineering or an MBA by completing another year at Washington University. For further information, or to discuss other paths to engineering careers that may be available, students should contact the Regis Dual Degree Program Liaison Officer (Department of Physics and Astronomy). ACADEMIC INTERNSHIP PROGRAM The Academic Internship Program in Regis College provides the opportunity for students to participate in an off-campus placement in the professions, nonprofit sector, business, or industry while earning credit through their academic department. The program reflects the University’s mission to increase students’ ability to integrate and apply academic and personal learning through rich, structured experiences off campus.  Two courses are currently offered: "

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The Master of Arts degree requires the successful completion of 36 semester hours of graduate course work (600-level) in an individualized Degree Plan. Core courses, research methods, and a master’s research project are required.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  153  Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 or better in all 600-level courses. A grade of “C” or higher is required in all 600-level courses. A maximum of two courses with a grade of “C” can be applied toward the degree requirements. A grade of “C-” or lower is unacceptable.  COURSE OVERLOAD Students are considered to be enrolled full time if they are registered for six semester hours in one semester. Students who want to register for more than six semester hours in any semester may do so with the approval of the faculty advisor.  CROSS REGISTRATION MA Policy provides students with the opportunity to transfer graduate course work into the Master of Arts degree plan. Master of Arts students may enroll in graduate courses in other Regis graduate programs while enrolled in the Master of Arts program and count the courses toward completion of the requirements of the Master of Arts degree under the following conditions:  To register for non-Master of Arts courses, a student must meet all requirements of the program whose course work is taken.   Master of Arts students must include all such course(s) in the degree plan and the course(s) must be approved by the faculty advisor before the student registers for the course.  Suitability of course work from other Regis graduate programs for the Master of Arts degree depends on several factors: relevance of the course to the student’s needs and goals; compatibility of the course with Master of Arts mission and goals; fit of the course into the requirements of a student’s field of emphasis. Students enrolled in other Regis University graduate programs and in Good Standing may register for Master of Arts courses, either classroom-based or directed study. To do so the student must have approval from his/her academic advisor in the program in which the student is currently enrolled, and obtain written approval from the Master of Arts degree chair Courses eligible for cross registration include all Master of Arts courses for which there is no prerequisite requirement. If a student wishes to enroll in a course for which one or more prerequisite courses exist, the student must satisfy all prerequisite requirements before he/she will be permitted to enroll.

If incurred, other fees may be charged for special examinations and other miscellaneous fees and fines.  BOOKS AND SUPPLIES Books and supplies average about $900.00 per semester.   PERSONAL AND LIVING EXPENSES The amount of money spent by a student for all expenses during an academic year, August to May, varies with current prices and the habits and needs of the student; therefore, estimates of the amount of money needed by individual students for such items as entertainment, laundry, and clothing are not reflected here. Students should have sufficient financial resources to ensure successful completion of each semester.  PAYMENT OF STUDENT ACCOUNTS Each Regis College undergraduate student is expected to pay in full, set up a Regis Payment Option, or have guaranteed financial aid in place by August 1 for fall, January 1 for spring. and May 1 for summer semesters. Prior to the published due date, students should verify or change room and meal plans, accept or decline health insurance, verify and complete financial aid arrangements and pay all related account charges.  All charges made to student accounts during the year are itemized on a registration invoice. This invoice is mailed to the billing address designated by the student before classes begin.  Students can also view their registration invoice via WebAdvisor.  Additionally, students who are not enrolled at least part-time or that are close to graduating, must complete an Exit Interview for Perkins/Nursing /NFLP loans (if applicable) before transcripts and diplomas are issued.   Financing of Student Accounts All tuition and fees are payable in advance of each semester. Thus, financial plans should be made early to avoid problems that might occur after the due date. Students, parents or legal guardians who wish to make arrangements for financing should do so with a bank or other commercial lending institution that handles such financing. MasterCard, VISA, American Express, and Discover Card are accepted by Regis University. In addition, an interest free Regis Payment Option (RPO) is available to students enrolled in the Regis College Undergraduate Program. This payment plan breaks down the overall balance into six, five or four monthly payments for a $50 application fee. Student Accounts is pleased to assist students, parents, or legal guardians in making arrangements for payment through outside organizations or by direct bank wire transfer of funds for tuition and fees.  Returned Checks Any student who presents to the University a check that is not accepted for payment by the bank because of insufficient funds or other reasons for which the student is responsible is charged a fee of $31. The student must make payment by cash or certified funds equal to the total of the invalid check, plus the fee to register for additional courses. In addition, a financial hold is placed on registration, academic transcripts and diplomas until the invalid check amount and fee have been paid.  Consequences of Defaulted Accounts At the time of registration, students accept financial responsibility for all tuition charges. Full payment of the student account balance is due by the published due date.  If payment is not made on tuition and fees by the due date, a late fee of $300 is assessed. If payment is not received by the due date, the account will be considered in default.  Regis University reserves the right to restrict and/or drop registration if a student is in default. There is no guarantee that courses will still be available if dropped for non-payment.  The release of transcripts and diploma will also be restricted until any financial obligation with Regis University is paid in full. Financial obligations include past due tuition and fees, active RPO payment plans, deferments, institutional loans, and Perkins/Nursing/NFLP loans. Late fees can be assessed monthly on defaulted plans.  Checks returned for insufficient funds will incur additional penalty fees. Regis University and their respective agents and contractors will contact students in default regarding the student account, including repayment of the student account, at any current or any future phone number that is provided to Regis University.  This includes cellular phones or other wireless devices using automated telephone dialing equipment or artificial or pre-recorded voice or text messages. Failure to pay a defaulted balance will result in defaulted accounts being sent to external collection agencies.  Upon non-payment of tuition and fees balances as stated, Regis University may declare the balance due and payable.  Students in default agree to reimburse Regis University the fees of any collection agency up to 40% which may not be reflected in the statement of account, which may be based on a percentage of the debt, and all the costs and expenses, including late fees and all other applicable charges to Regis University.  In the event the defaulted balance is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection through legal proceedings or otherwise, defaulted students must pay late fees, attorney fees, court costs and fees, and all other applicable charges to Regis University.  Disputed defaulted balances shall be governed by Colorado law, excluding its conflicts of law’s provisions.  Regis University and its respective agents reserve the right to report defaulted information to the credit bureaus.   REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG    2018-2019  184  REFUND SCHEDULE FOR AUTHORIZED WITHDRAWAL FROM REGIS COLLEGE	The official date of withdrawal from the University or from a course is the date that the withdrawal request is submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration for processing. Notice of withdrawal from the University must be received by the Office of Academic Records and Registration by using the official University Withdrawal online form. The date the withdrawal request is processed and the date the student vacates the residence hall, if applicable, determines the amount of refund credited to the student. Refund policies are further described in the General Information Section of this Catalog under the ‘Withdrawal and Refund of Tuition’ heading. The following refund schedule applies to tuition only: Withdrawal Period    Refund First Week (add/drop week) 100% Second Week 80% Third Week 60% Fourth Week 40% Fifth Week 20% Sixth-Twelfth Week 0% Thirteenth-Sixteenth*  0% *Students cannot withdraw from courses during this time period.  ACADEMIC INFORMATION  THE ACADEMIC YEAR The academic year is divided into two semesters of 16 weeks each. The first semester begins with Orientation in late August and ends in mid-December. It is followed by a Christmas vacation of approximately three weeks. The second semester begins in early January and ends at approximately the close of the first week in May. The Summer Session extends from early May through the middle of August.  THE ACADEMIC ADVISING PROGRAM Academic advising is an integral part of the educational process in Regis College. It is the intent of this program to provide the student with a faculty advisor who assists the advisee to gain the maximum from his/her educational experience. Each student at Regis is assigned an academic advisor who: 1) aids the student in planning an educational program consistent with his or her interests and capabilities; 2) provides information about the academic process and University resources; 3) counsels students who may be experiencing academic difficulties; and 4) refers students to any other areas of student services that can help the advisee with difficulties outside of the academic sphere.  The Advising Program is administered through the Office of the Academic Dean for Regis College. This office serves as a general source of information about campus resources and specialized programs. MAJOR DECLARATION By the end of the sophomore year, each student must select a major area around which most of his/her upper division coursework centers. In some majors, even earlier decisions are encouraged. The programs in Education, and the natural sciences require careful planning in order to meet all requirements during four years.   COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD The average class load is 15 to 18 semester hours. Ordinarily, only students with a 3.000 minimum cumulative grade point average and no grades of Incomplete are allowed to carry more than 18 semester hours. Permission to carry 19 or more semester hours (course overload) must be obtained from an associate dean for Regis College. If, in the judgment of the associate dean, a student benefits by a reduced course load, the student is restricted to a course load of fewer than 15 semester hours.  UPPER DIVISION COURSES Freshmen and sophomores are allowed to take upper division courses only if they have completed the prerequisites or if they have obtained the permission of the instructor of the course. Juniors and seniors must also complete the prerequisites of an upper division course as listed in this Catalog before enrolling for the course.  REGISTRATION All students must consult with an academic advisor prior to registration. Students who have selected more than one major must consult with all assigned advisors, as appropriate. Registration materials are available online. Registration occurs online through WebAdvisor, but students must have their advisor approve their course planning worksheet before registering. It is the student’s responsibility to study their degree requirements and make certain that course selections meet those requirements. Additionally, students are financially responsible for all registered courses. (see Payment of Student Accounts). The University reserves the right to cancel a course when registration is not sufficient to warrant continuance, to divide a class if enrollment is too large for effective instruction and to change instructors. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis College class, may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped.  CONCURRENT/CROSS-COLLEGE ENROLLMENT POLICY Regis College students are eligible to register for 16 week semester courses offered in the other Regis University colleges. Regis College is committed to student success and the recognition that workload and time management are consistent obstacles to students’ academic performance, Regis College restricts students’ access to non-traditional format courses (e.g. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  185  8-week and 5-week) while enrolled as a full-time student in the semester-based format. Students must receive approval from their academic advisor and the Regis College Dean’s Office before enrolling in a non-traditional format course.  The advisor and the dean will evaluate any potential non-traditional format course (heretofore referred to as “the Course”) based on the following:  The course is a key component of the degree program (major or minor) in which the student intends to complete.  The course does not rely upon a foundational base of knowledge more suitable for working professionals.  The course content addresses similar learning outcomes as the course requirement the student is intending to fulfill.  The course is compatible with the student’s course load to ensure a reasonable balance of academic demands and responsibilities.  LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who decide to leave Regis College for one or two semesters and then plan to return have the option of applying for a leave of absence. This status guarantees them the same Core Studies and major/minor requirements that applied to them before leaving Regis and also allows them to preregister during the semester prior to their return. The Leave of Absence Application forms is available online through WebAdvisor. If a student does not complete a Leave of Absence form or if the leave of absence has expired (after two semesters), and later returns to Regis College, he/she must be readmitted to the College. The student is held to the current Core Studies and major/minor requirements. Requests for exceptions should be made in writing to the academic dean for Regis College.  CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT AT ANOTHER COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY In order to insure acceptance of transfer credit once the student is enrolled at Regis University, students should submit the Concurrent Enrollment form available on WebAdvisor.  Undergraduate students are not permitted to take the last 30 semester hours of coursework at another institution without permission of an associate dean for Regis College. A grade of “C-” or better must be earned for undergraduate coursework to be accepted in transfer.   REGIS COLLEGE ATTENDANCE POLICY Regis College’s primary obligation is the total education of its students, and at the core of this commitment is an understanding that such an education occurs through the direct interaction between faculty and students in their classes. Therefore, for students to achieve success in their educational endeavors, they must conscientiously and regularly attend all of their of classes. Freshmen in particular will be held accountable for maintaining regular attendance in their courses. Faculty will, at the start of the semester, announce their specific procedures concerning class attendance, verification of excused absences, etc., in written form through the course syllabus. It is the student’s responsibility to note these procedures and to follow them carefully. COLLEGE-SPONSORED ACTIVITY ABSENCE POLICY  Many Regis College students participate in extracurricular activities that are sponsored by the College.  These activities will occasionally be held in times that conflict with regularly scheduled classes or exams.  This policy is designed to clarify the obligations and responsibilities of participating students, their coaches or sponsors, and professors.  The policy will distinguish between activities that are sustained throughout the semester or year (e.g., athletics or debate) and those that are one-time events (e.g., presenting or participating in a conference). When students participate in College-sponsored activities, those absences from classes are considered excused.  However, students are required to give faculty notice of these absences as early as possible, and to make arrangements with the faculty for completing all assignments and mastering the material of the course.  In addition, faculty have the right to inform students, as well as their activity sponsors, if in the professor’s judgment the student will be compromising their chances of success in the course because of the absences.  ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS Final examinations are assigned at the end of each semester. A student who is unable to take a final examination for a valid reason (i.e., emergency circumstances beyond the student’s control) is eligible for a grade of Incomplete, which, if assigned, must be removed by the end of the next academic semester with the exception of spring semester. Incomplete grades assigned during spring semester must be finalized by the end of fall semester. A student must specifically request an Incomplete in writing from the instructor.  GRADE REPORTS All instructors in Regis College are required to submit mid-semester grades. Only end-of-semester grades are official and entered on the student’s permanent record. By federal legislation (The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended), grades can be released to parents or others only by specific request of the student, unless the parent claims the student as a dependent for federal income tax purposes and certifies this fact. Grade information cannot be released by telephone or by fax; however, grade information can be accessed through WebAdvisor.   APPEALS OF DISPUTED GRADES Grade appeals for Regis College undergraduate students must be initiated within the first month of the semester following receipt of the grade.  The following procedure is to be followed if a student wishes to protest a grade he or she received in a course: 1. The student raises the matter with the instructor in question. If the grade remains in dispute, the student should follow step 2. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG    2018-2019  186  2. At the student’s request, the department chair arranges for a committee of three faculty members to review the case. The student and the teacher may each appoint one of these three. The third is to be chosen by the other two. The committee reviews evidence in any manner the committee deems equitable. (Typically, a written statement from each party that the other party can review and respond to in writing is the first step.) Oral presentations to the committee are sometimes also useful. Care should be taken lest either of the parties be intimidated through oral procedure. The committee recommends a solution.  3. The committee’s decision is final, unless one of two circumstances occur:  new and relevant information is made available that the committee did not see, or the process was not followed. The dissatisfied party appeals to the academic dean. The dean reviews the proceedings up to this point, obtains any new information deemed appropriate, and makes the final determination. Further appeals are not permitted.  STUDENT CONDUCT  The community standards of conduct outlined in the Regis Student Handbook apply to students in academic classrooms, labs and off campus learning sites.  Faculty members have the right to expect students to be respectful of their classmates and professors.  If a student repeatedly engages in disruptive behavior in a classroom or lab that affects other students’ ability to concentrate on the class, faculty members may instruct the student to leave the classroom.   Repeated disruption of classroom instruction will be referred to the student conduct process, and may result in the student being removed from the course.  If the conduct of a student threatens the safety of anyone in the room, the Office of Academic Dean, in conjunction with the Dean of Students, has the right to remove the student after a single occurrence. A detailed summary of regulations and the student discipline process is available in the Regis University Student Handbook, which covers all University students. Students may access  the Student Handbook online via the Regis University website.  DEAN’S LIST For fall and spring semesters, a Dean’s List is created for Regis College undergraduate program students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of 15 or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.700 is placed on the Dean’s List. Students who request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of 15 letter-graded semester hours. Students who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean’s List.   ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES Good Standing A Regis College undergraduate student must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade lower than “C-” in any upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward the major or minor. A passing grade lower than “C-” in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses apply toward graduation. At the end of each semester, students who are academically deficient, with grade point averages below 2.000, are reviewed by the Committee on Probation and Suspension. The committee may recommend to the academic dean for Regis College that one of the following actions be taken: academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal.   Warning A student with a semester grade point average below 2.000 and a cumulative grade point average above 2.000 is placed on academic warning. Although academic warning indicates an academic deficiency, it is not as severe as academic probation and is not posted on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript).  Probation A student with a cumulative grade point average below 2.000 is placed on academic probation. The committee sets forth certain conditions that the student must meet within a specified time period. Although a student’s grade point average is the primary determinant in decisions regarding probation, other stated conditions must be met in order to remain in the College. Failure to meet any of the specified conditions may result in suspension.  A student is not permitted to re-enroll unless he/she has agreed in writing to all conditions set forth. Academic probation is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript).  Academic Suspension Academic suspension is action taken by Regis College for any probationary student with an unacceptable cumulative grade point average. Academic suspension renders him/her ineligible to return to Regis University for a period of 12 months. During that time the student must satisfactorily complete (grade of “C” or better) at least 12 semester hours (or equivalent quarter credits) at another regionally accredited institution. The student must obtain prior approval from Regis University of transferability of this coursework. This action may be taken for any student whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below 2.000. In addition, academic suspension may be taken for any student whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below a provisional grade point average agreed upon between the student and the associate dean for Regis College. Academic suspension is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript). Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis College class, may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  187  Suspension Criteria  Any student on academic probation whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below the minimum standard established for his/her class level is, under ordinary circumstances, suspended.  Class  Hours Attempted  GPA Freshman  0 to 29   1.800 Sophomore  30 to 59   2.000 Junior  60 to 91   2.000 Senior  92 or more  2.000  Any student on academic probation whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below 2.000, may be suspended (the table in item 1 notwithstanding). Any transfer student accepted by Regis College (undergraduate program) on probation for the first 12 to 15 semester hours may be suspended at the completion of the 12 to 15 hours if his/her Regis cumulative grade point average is below 2.000.  Any student who has met an agreed-upon provisional grade point average for the semester may be given the status of Probation Continued. This is a student (usually a freshman) who has earned an extremely low cumulative grade point average and, consequently, finds it almost mathematically impossible to attain a sufficiently high grade point average to be restored to Good Standing or even to be placed above the minimum for his/her class level. Such students have entered into an agreement with the associate dean for Regis College who acts on behalf of the Committee on Probation and Suspension. The agreed-upon grade point average is set within a range of what is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student in question (frequently between 2.000 and 2.300). A student failing to make the agreed-upon grade point average for the semester is suspended.  Three semesters are the maximum a student may be on probation during his/her academic career Thereafter, failure to maintain a 2.000 cumulative grade point average results in automatic suspension.  Students on probation will normally be expected to maintain and complete a full-time schedule (minimum 12 credit hours).  Students on probation will only be allowed to reduce their schedules to 11 hours or fewer with the approval of both their academic advisor and the Probation Director.  Unspecified students are held to the same standards as full-time students.  Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal is action taken by Regis College that renders the student ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, an undergraduate student must have been suspended, applied for and re-admitted to Regis College on academic probation, and failed to achieve either the required minimum 2.000 grade point average, the minimum standards for his/her class level, or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average. The provisional grade point average is pre-determined by the student and the associate dean for Regis College. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript). Appealing the Suspension or Dismissal Decision Upon being notified of academic suspension or dismissal, a student who wishes to appeal should write a letter to the Chair of the Appeals Committee and follow the procedures listed below: 1. Why the suspension/dismissal decision should be reversed, including the student’s honest assessment of how the academic troubles came about, and some indication that the student is ready to continue serious academic work. 2. Why the student failed to achieve the required grade point average. Were there, for example, any extenuating circumstances beyond the student’s control? 3. The names of the student’s advisor or faculty members from whom supporting statements may be solicited by the student. 4. Submit the letter by the deadline stated in the letter of suspension or dismissal. 5. Contact the advisor, faculty members, doctors, etc., to discuss the case. Any supporting statements from them must be received by the same deadline. The appeals committee is interested in any pertinent information that has genuine bearing on the matter. The committee focuses on why the student should be allowed to continue study at the University, and why the student failed to reach his or her academic goals.

Additionally, students are also urged to call Enrollment Services at 303-458-4126 or 1-800-388-2366 Ext. 4126, to request a copy of the brochure, “Paying Your Tuition at Regis University.”  ACADEMIC INFORMATION The Applied Craft Brewing Certificate Program follows the eight-week course schedule and the sixteen-week course schedule (for internship), Add/Drop and withdrawal deadlines coordinate with those in the respective schools. The same policies regarding appeals of disputed grades, academic student conduct, and academic dismissal that apply in the Regis College undergraduate program also apply to students in the Applied Craft Brewing Certificate.  FINAL EXAMINATIONS Final examinations occur during the regularly scheduled class period, via individual scheduling outside of class time, or via online examination.  Eight-week courses do not have separate scheduled examination periods.  INCOMPLETE GRADES A student who is unable to take a final examination or complete final class coursework for a valid reason (i.e., emergency circumstances beyond the student’s control) is eligible for a grade of incomplete.  A student must specifically request an Incomplete grade in writing from the instructor, who will determine if the reason is valid based on his/her judgment and the policies outlined in the course syllabus.  Students must resolve an Incomplete grade by the end of the next equivalent length academic period (e.g., by the end of the next semester for semester courses or by the end of the next eight-week course period for eight-week courses).  TRANSFER CREDIT Transfer credit is not awarded for the specialized coursework in the Applied Craft Brewing Certificate.  ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTY Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000 are placed on academic probation. Students placed on probation must raise their cumulative program grade point average to 2.000 in the subsequent term to be eligible for completion of the certificate.  Suspension appeals are submitted to the Program Director. The review committee will be constructed in the same way as the review committee for appeal of disputed grades except that the program director will serve as the instructor usually does in that process. The student may be asked to attend part or all of the appeal review meeting.  CERTIFICATE AWARD Students earn the certificate after all requirements are met and documentation is on file. Incomplete grades may result in later award of certificate. A program cumulative grade point average of 2.000 is required for award of the certificate. Transcripts are not released if any financial indebtedness to Regis University exists.

Successful completion of Education Gate System Portfolio to include a Colorado work sample. When students successfully complete these requirements, the faculty recommends students for state licensure. The faculty reserves the right to withhold recommendation on the basis of deficiencies in any of the characteristics or professional dispositions needed to become a successful teacher. Licensure is granted by the applicable state.  Regis University provides assistance, but bears no responsibility, for student deficiencies or failure in complying with external regulation, rules or laws.  It is the responsibility of students to apply for licensure through the Colorado Department of Education and it is the responsibility of the student to be aware of these licensing regulations. . Completion of the requirements for licensure is noted on the Regis University Academic Transcript. Students recommended for licensure must apply to the appropriate state agency within six months of receiving the recommendation. Students who fail to apply during this time frame may find themselves ineligible for a later recommendation from Regis University. State accrediting institutions may not issue licenses to students who completed the program prior to the University’s current accreditation.

PRE-HEALTH SCIENCES Health-science graduate programs such as medical, dental, and physical therapy schools select students after considering evidence of intellectual ability, motivation, an understanding of the nature of health professions, and past academic and personal achievement. Students should be prepared to answer the question “Why do you want to become a health care professional?” Toward that end, students are encouraged to gain experience in health-related service areas, including volunteer or internship opportunities. One aspect of achievement is the success of a student’s curriculum, which should include a substantial amount of modern science. There are no official pre-health majors such as pre-medical, pre-dental, or pre-physical therapy majors; rather any major can be suitable, provided students satisfy the minimum course requirements for post-graduate work. Many applicants major in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Health and Exercise Science, or Neuroscience. Standardized aptitude/achievement tests (MCAT, DAT, GRE) are given substantial weight by health-science graduate programs in the admissions process. A general background in the fundamentals of modern science is required for good performance on most of these tests. Therefore, any curriculum undertaken by a pre-health science student should include appropriate science courses. Because health science professions involve far more than basic science, students should demonstrate evidence of personal development, maturity, and experience. For further information and suggestions students should consult the pre-health sciences advisor and the pre-medical/health web page on the Regis University website. Students may wish to participate in activities of Alpha Epsilon Delta, the National Health Pre-professional Honor Society.

The College of Computer & Information Sciences of Regis University offers a range of programs in computer and information sciences. Founded in 1877 by the Society of Jesus, the University is firmly rooted in a 450-year old tradition of academic excellence and value-centered education. A main focus of the mission of the university is to educate men and women of all ages to take leadership roles and to make a positive impact in a changing society. Students learn more than technical skills. The faculty engage students in understanding the impact of technology in an increasingly digital world.   VISION Guided by our Jesuit Mission and Values, we aspire to be the premier Colorado institution delivering innovative computer & information sciences education that promotes industry engagement and skills for careers that matter.  MISSION Our mission is to deliver academic programs in an engaging learning environment that promotes social responsibility and a commitment to the common good challenging students to become leaders who make a difference in their chosen fields. Each of our academic programs will incorporate Jesuit values and leadership, relevant career-related skill sets, experiential learning, global engagement, entrepreneurial techniques, and tools to instill a passion for lifelong learning.  VALUES Our values of perseverance, integrity, communication, passion and knowledge arise from a foundation of family, community, security and health.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Serving students of all ages, the College of Computer & Information Sciences (CC&IS) provides degree programs in both a traditional semester based format and accelerated 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG 97  formats. Courses are offered face to face, online and in a blended format. CC&IS recognizes that active learning best supports the needs of all learners and integrates significant experiential elements across all programs. Additionally, CC&IS recognizes that lifelong learning is integral to growth and aims to instill a passion for lifelong learning in all graduates.   SERVICE LEARNING Service Learning is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning and development. Service Learning joins two complex concepts: community action, the “service” and efforts learned from that action and connect what is learned to existing knowledge, the “learning.” Community service becomes service learning when it is connected to classroom curriculum and activities and contains opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences, thus allowing for consciousness raising and systemic change. This is particularly true for Jesuit education that has for centuries held a mission of forming men and women who seek to transform the world through service to others. The Service Learning program seeks to assist faculty in integrating social justice and service learning concepts and activities across the curriculum in undergraduate and graduate programs.   ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Admissions requirements for Regis University students are outlined in this General Information section of this Catalog under the ‘Regis University Admissions’ heading. More specific requirements for College of Computer & Information Sciences graduate degree admission can be found in this section of the Catalog under the heading ‘Graduate Programs’.  ACADEMIC INFORMATION STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Students are expected to have college-level writing skills when they enter a program. These skills include writing mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation, word usage and structure) along with analysis of issues, support of position, and clarity of thought. Each student is responsible for meeting the writing standards designated by the degree program.  STUDENT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT In the spirit of the Jesuit mission of Regis University, students and faculty share responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. This includes using information technology responsibly in online and other courses. In order for faculty members to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, online courses, and other learning areas, the College of Computer & Information Sciences and the faculty expect students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner and not engage in disruptive behavior, disorderly conduct or intentionally interfere in the freedom of expression of others. “Disruptive Behavior” or “Disorderly Conduct” as applied in all academic settings and formats (i.e., classroom, online, independent study, etc.) means behavior that a reasonable faculty member or student would view as intentionally or recklessly interfering with normal academic functions, university events, or university sponsored activities.  Examples include, but are not limited to: persistently speaking or commenting without being recognized or interrupting other speakers; behavior that distracts the class from the subject matter or discussion; or, in extreme cases, physical threats, harassing behavior or personal insults; refusal to comply with faculty direction including refusal to work in a group, using a cell phone or pager during a classroom session, inappropriate mediated communication; or behavior that has a negative impact in any learning environment. Disruptive behavior also includes any other behavior covered by the Regis University Student Handbook: Code of Conduct which can be found at www.regis.edu. Students who fail to adhere to acceptable behavioral standards may be subject to discipline which may include reprimand, dismissal from the class and/or expulsion from the College of Computer & Information Sciences. Students who wish to appeal a decision regarding the consequences of their behavior should follow the Appeal Process outlined in the Regis University Student Handbook.  LEARNING FORMATS A variety of learning formats and locations offer students flexibility and options in completing graduate and undergraduate study. Among all degrees, close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice as well as opportunities to develop skills and abilities that prepare learners for changing demands of the workplace.  Students may complete Regis University academic course work through any combination of the following learning formats as availability of course format permits:  classroom-based courses  online courses  blended courses (classroom-based and online combination)  Classroom-Based Classroom-based courses are offered in multiple academic periods and formats. Most accelerated format courses meet one or two days/evenings each week for a total of 20 to 32 contact hours. Course learning format, selection, and availability vary by campus location. Most accelerated classes require a minimum of 19-25 hours of combined study and classroom time each week, depending on the course content, course length and the student’s learning style. While this model allows for degree completion in a REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019 98  shorter period of time, there is an increased expectation for independent learning outside the classroom.  Online Online courses are generally offered in an accelerated eight-week format over the Internet. These courses are designed to provide an interactive learning experience for students. Faculty and students communicate and collaborate through a variety of means including online discussions, e-mail, and synchronous communications. Educational technologies like synchronous and asynchronous web technologies and e-mail offer learners convenience and flexibility. Online courses have highly structured requirements and deadlines which fall within the academic terms. Online students must have computer equipment and skills at a specified minimum level. Please check with the program for current requirements. Students should allocate a minimum of 20 hours each week for completing course assignments and participating in online discussions.  CURRICULUM Regardless of format, each course focuses on course objectives, required learning activities, and outcome evaluation. Close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice, as well as the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that prepare students for changing demands of the workplace. Since effective written and oral communication skills are essential in both occupational and academic environments, all courses emphasize the development of these skills.  FACULTY Faculty members are frequently working professionals representing various corporations, businesses and organizations. All hold a master’s or doctoral degree, and bring academic theory and current professional experience to the learning environment. An assessment process is employed to determine not only the knowledge base of each selected faculty member, but also his/her ability to facilitate the learning of adult students.  ACADEMIC ADVISING Academic advisors are available to assist with course planning and degree development as needed. Advisors provide assistance and recommendations to students from the point of admission through graduation.  CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT IN OTHER REGIS PROGRAMS Concurrent enrollment is defined as taking courses simultaneously in more than one Regis University College. Students wishing to cross-register within the University are not required to complete an application; however, updated information may be required at the time of registration. Students may register for courses offered in the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions that are open to non-majors. Students should consult with their academic advisor. Some programs may have more restrictive requirements for cross-registration. Refer to the program information in the appropriate degree program section.  COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD Undergraduate students who wish to register for more than two courses in any five- or eight-week term, or more than 18 semester hours in one semester must receive approval from the Associate Dean. Students must obtain and submit an Overload Request form 30 days prior to taking the overload credit to his or her advisor. The advisor will:  Verify that students have a 3.000 grade point average or higher.  Ensure that students have no incomplete grades pending.  Request approval from the Associate Dean  Contact students regarding approval or denial of the request. No further overloads are approved if students receive any incomplete grades and/or fall below a 3.000 grade point average.  GRADING For information on incomplete grades, change of recorded grade, and repeat for higher grade, students should refer to the University General Information section of this Catalog.  Grade of Incomplete Grades of incomplete may be approved by the instructor for a student, if the student has completed at least 75% of the course work and experiences an unexpected event. If a grade of Incomplete is approved by the instructor for a course, the incomplete grade assigned is “I/F”. The length of time for completion is determined by the instructor but may not exceed the end of the following term. If the work is not completed by the deadline, the Incomplete will revert to a grade of “F”. Students may have only one course in which there is an incomplete grade pending at any time.  Grade of “In Progress” “In Progress” grades are given to students in graduate capstone project courses, graduate thesis courses or practicum/internship courses where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the eight weeks or semester (if a semester-based course) provided for completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an “In Progress” grade can be granted for a period of up to one year (12 months) to complete the capstone project course or practicum/internship. The grade to be recorded in the student’s record is IP/N (In Progress/No Pass). If the student does not satisfactorily complete the course within the one year period, the grade reverts to the “F” or “No Pass” grade. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG 99  “In Progress” grades will only be given in the capstone/thesis courses or practicum/internship courses. “In Progress” is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases if the student is unable to complete the course work for an approved reason and the instructor approves, the appropriate grade is Incomplete/F (I/F) and the student has no more than the eight weeks or equivalent term to complete the work.  Appeals of Disputed Grades Students who wish to dispute a grade earned in a course should use the following procedures: 1. The student contacts the instructor of the course to request a review of the issue.  2. If the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student submits a written request for review of the grade to the department chair.  The written request must be initiated within 60 days after the last official day of the term in which the course in question was taken. The request must provide rationale indicating why the grade earned is not appropriate, and all relevant documentation must be included (course syllabus, copies of exams, quizzes, papers, presentation materials, etc.) The request must include the student’s name, address, e-mail address, course number, instructor name and the term in which the course was completed. 3. The department chair reviews all documentation submitted.  If needed, the department chair contacts the student and the instructor to arrange a personal interview. The department chair approves or disapproves the appeal.  If the department chair approves the appeal, a Change of Grade form is completed and submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The department chair informs the student and the instructor in writing of the decision regarding the appeal. 4. If the grade dispute is not satisfactorily resolved, the student may appeal the decision to the Associate Dean of the College. This written appeal must be submitted within two calendar weeks of receipt of the decision in step 3 above. The Associate Dean will review the proceedings and any additional information provided by the student. The decision of the Associate Dean is final.  Academic Progression In order to assure academic progression in a CC & IS program, a student may repeat a course two times to remove a failing grade or a withdrawal (W) from a course. Students who fail or withdraw from a class three times may be subject to being removed from the program. Note: Students in the Health Information Management program must maintain a 2.500 GPA at all times and will follow the same probation and suspension procedures.  DEAN’S LIST Traditional Students For fall and spring semesters, a Dean’s List is created for the College of Computer & Information Sciences traditional undergraduate students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of 15 or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.700 is placed on the Dean’s List. Students who request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of 15 letter-graded semester hours. Students who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean’s List.   Non-Traditional Students For fall, spring and summer semesters, a Dean’s List is created for College of Computer & Information Scinces non-traditional undergraduate students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of twelve or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.800 is placed on the Dean’s List. A student who is required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course--and who also carries nine or more graded hours with a 3.800 semester grade point average--is eligible for inclusion on the Dean’s List.  Students who are not required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course but request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of twelve letter-graded semester hours. Student who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean’s List.  ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES  Good Standing A College of Computer & Information Sciences undergraduate student must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade of less than “C-“ in an upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward completion of major or minor requirements. A grade of less than “C-” in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses apply toward graduation. To sustain good academic standing at the graduate level, a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 for 600-level course work is required. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned in the 600-level courses, by the total number of semester hours attempted in those courses. No more than two courses with grades of “C” can count toward graduation requirements. A grade lower than a “C” (e.g. “C-”) is not counted toward degree requirements, but is included in the cumulative grade point average. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019 100  Probation The College of Computer & Information Sciences undergraduate student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000 at the end of any given semester is placed on academic probation. During the next semester (fall, spring, summer) of enrollment, the University expects the student to raise his/her cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. If the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.000, the student may be academically suspended at the end of the probationary semester. The student must work closely with his/her advisor to determine the number of semester hours to be taken during the probationary semester to maximize the possibility of earning the required cumulative 2.000 grade point average by the end of the semester. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the Dean’s Office. Academic probation is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript). Undergraduate students accepted on probation by the College of Computer & Information Sciences may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 2.000 cumulative grade point average. Graduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.000 for 600-level course(s) at the end of any given semester are placed on academic probation. After one semester on probation, a student’s performance will be reviewed by the appropriate program coordinator and the Associate Dean. Students who are not successful in raising their grade point average to 3.000 will be considered for suspension by the program coordinator and Associate Dean. Students on probation are permitted to take only one course per term and are not permitted to have an Incomplete grade while on Probation. In addition, graduate students who receive a grade of “C” or less in two courses are subject to academic review. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the Dean’s Office. Graduate students accepted on probation by the College of Computer & Information Sciences may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 3.000 cumulative grade point average.  Suspension If a student has been placed on academic probation and does not achieve a 2.000 (undergraduate) or 3.000 (graduate) cumulative grade point average at the end of the next semester of enrollment, he/she is suspended. Academic suspension is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript). Students are formally notified of their suspension from Regis University in a letter from the Dean. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous semester and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped. After one calendar year, the student may apply for readmission by fulfilling the following written requirements:  Submit a letter requesting readmission and an explanation of the previous academic difficulties and how the problem(s) have been addressed.  Submit a written contract for approval by the Associate Dean, signed by the student and the student’s advisor, which states how the student will meet the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average within a defined period.  An official transcript showing at least 12 semester hours of acceptable academic course work completed at a regionally accredited college or university (undergraduate students only).  Dismissal Academic dismissal is action taken by Regis University by which the student is rendered ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, a student must have been suspended, applied for and been readmitted to Regis University on academic probation, and failed to achieve either the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average. The provisional grade point average is pre-determined by the student and their advisor, and approved by the Associate Dean. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).  Suspension/Dismissal Appeal Procedure Students who wish to appeal their suspension/dismissal must complete the following requirements within 30 days of the date on the letter of notification for Suspension/Dismissal. 1. Write a letter or send an email to the Dean, College of Computer & Information Sciences explaining: a. Why the student should not be suspended from the program or dismissed from the University. b.

Once the student has applied, all remaining upper division (400 level) courses must be completed at Regis University.  Some courses taken toward a major may also count toward the Core Studies requirements. A single course cannot, however, satisfy two Core Studies requirements.  Upper division courses required to meet one major or minor cannot be counted toward a major or minor in another discipline except under the following conditions: o In the event the upper division requirements for a major exceed 18 semester hours, those excess hours may also be applied to another major or minor. o In the event that the upper division requirements for a minor exceed 12 upper division semester hours, those excess hours may also be applied to another major or minor.  Courses that satisfy lower division prerequisites for more than one major or minor may be applied to more than one major or minor.  Competence in oral and written communication skills is required. Students should be able to express themselves with clarity, precision and force, which comes only from a disciplined command of words, word usage and grammar. Major Requirements   42 SH Students must complete a minimum of 42 semester hours in their chosen field of study. At least 18 semester hours must be at the upper division level. Lower division (foundational) courses are designed to offer students a discipline breadth in a particular subject area. These courses are usually taken at the freshman and sophomore levels (200 and 300 level). Upper division courses are designed to offer students greater depth on a specific topic within the major field of study. These courses are usually completed at the junior and senior levels (400 level). Specific requirements for each major are listed in this section under the degree program.  Minor Requirements    12 SH A minor field of study consists of 12 upper division (advanced) semester hours from an area of study outside the major discipline. At least six of these semester hours must be completed through Regis University. A minor is required for HIM students.  General Electives The remaining credits required to meet the 120 semester hour requirement for a bachelor’s degree are known as general electives.

UNDERGRADUATE MINOR AREAS Minors are available for every approved major listed in the Anderson College of Business, The College of Computer & Information Sciences, the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies, Regis College and the HCA Minor available through the Rueckert-Hartman College of Health Professions.   MASTER’S DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Students should refer to the General Information section of this Catalog for information regarding graduate degree requirements.  CC&IS UNDERGRADUATE CORE STUDIES REQUIREMENTS Regis University recognizes that in today’s diverse and complex world, education cannot be limited to one field of study.  Instead, it is the goal of the University to give each student a full range of academic exposure.  Building upon a 450 year educational tradition, our core education is grounded in a Jesuit and Catholic vision of human development. Through its emphasis on active learning and integrated reflective thinking, the core education should broaden a student’s capacity to make critical judgments in a wide range of areas.  To this end, CC&IS requires that each student completes a liberal arts core curriculum. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019 102  Regis University’s mission is to develop leaders in the service of others.  Therefore, the Regis CC&IS Core Curriculum is firmly rooted in the Regis University Core Philosophy Statement.  The Core Curriculum is guided by the framework of the Characteristics of the Core Educational Experience:  Development of the Whole Person, Academic Challenge, Liberal Arts Foundation, Integration, Ethical Inquiry and Reflection, Spirituality and Religion, Concern for Justice, Global Awareness and Leadership. All Core courses will challenge students to reflect on tradition, continuity, and change while celebrating the essential goodness of the world, the compatibility of faith and reason, and the joy of learning.    Purpose of the Core Curriculum: Rooted in Catholic tradition and Ignatian spirituality, the core is directed towards the education of the whole person and is committed to academic excellence through the disciplined search for knowledge and the joy of discovery and understanding.  It celebrates the essential goodness of the world, provides opportunities for students to understand the ethical dimension present within all of their studies and allows them to cultivate respect for faith and reason, human diversity, and a special concern for social justice.  It promotes leadership in service to others and towards the common good.  Grounded in the Liberal Arts, the core promotes literacy in the major academic disciplines.  It also challenges students to integrate their knowledge both by demonstrating an understanding of the relevance of the disciplines, one to another and bringing together their learning with the practice of everyday life and the needs of their communities.

TALOG 113,"  COURSE OVERLOAD The Master of Science degree consists of 12 courses. Students may take three courses (nine semester hours) in any semester (there are two academic periods per semester), as long as all prerequisites are met. To take four courses (12 semester hours) during any semester (considered an overload) requires prior approval of the Associate Dean. Students may not take more than two courses per academic period. Overload is not permitted until the fourth course. Ordinarily, only students with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.500 and no grades of Incomplete are eligible for an overload. Graduate Overload forms may be obtained from the College of Computer & Information Sciences. The upper portion of the form is to be completed by students and submitted to the College of Computer & Information Sciences at least 30 days prior to registering for the course. Students receive written approval or denial of this request. Requests to take three graduate courses during one academic period are not approved.  DEGREE COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS The degree completion process is designed to have students apply their course work to a meaningful, broad reaching effort. Students can choose from up to three different options; including a Graduate Capstone, a two course Practicum, or an applied research Thesis.  A range of flexibility is provided regarding what the study can involve.  Each evaluation option provides students with a comprehensive mechanism for applying the knowledge from their program of study to define and solve a real world problem.   Graduate Capstone: The Graduate Capstone is a team project effort. Students are assigned to teams, and the project (a scenario based on a real company or organization) is determined by the instructor. Working together the team defines a problem and designs a solution. This team effort requires both team collaboration and individual contributions, which are presented in written and real time presentation formats. Teams present solutions to a faculty panel. Individuals are graded on their team and individual contributions. The Capstone requires synchronous participation by all students.  Practicum: Each graduate program provides a practicum to satisfy the degree requirements. The practicum for each degree consists of two courses in which students use their program knowledge to develop systems and/or provide operational support. Students prepare a final report and present to a faculty panel Practicum details vary based on the program.  Note that the practicum does not require an extra class for the degree.  The first practicum course counts as one of the degree elective courses.  Thesis: The thesis is designed to have students apply their course work to a meaningful, broad reaching investigation. The study should be of interest to the student from both a professional and academic viewpoint. A range of flexibility is provided regarding what the study can involve. The student selects a primary faculty advisor based on the faculty’s knowledge of and/or interest in the subject matter focus on the student’s project.  The paper that is produced by the student is an academically rigorous analysis of the student’s study and should be on average between 40-100 pages of text that include illustrations, diagrams, etc. The paper is published electronically in the Regis University Library, therefore, information in the paper must be publishable. The presentation of the paper and study takes the student approximately 30-45 minutes followed by a 15-20 minute question and answer period from a faculty panel.  Enrollment in a thesis course requires academic advisor and instructor approval.  GRADUATION  Students graduate the semester that all requirements are met and documentation of such is received in the Office of Academic Records and Registration by the designated deadline. Graduation requirements include:   Satisfactory completion of required academic coursework.   A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.000.   Satisfactory completion of a master’s project. Incomplete grades, falling below the required cumulative grade point average, late application for graduation, or late receipt of transcripts of transfer credit may delay graduation and awarding of the degree to a subsequent semester.  For additional information on Commencement and Graduation, refer to the General Information section of this Catalog.   CROSS REGISTRATION College of Computer & Information Sciences policy provides students with the opportunity to transfer up to six credit hours of graduate course work into the student degree plan. Generally, this policy is used to accept course work completed prior to admission into the program. However, under special circumstances, students have the opportunity to complete work in other Regis graduate programs while enrolled in the College of Computer& Information Sciences and receive credit for the courses toward degree requirements.  To register for non-College of Computer& Information Sciences courses, a student must meet all requirements of the program whose course work is taken. Suitability of course work from other Regis graduate programs for College of Computer& Information Sciences credit depends on several factors: relevance of the course to the students’ needs and goals; compatibility of the course with the College of Computer& Information Sciences mission and goals; fit of the course into the requirements of a student’s field of emphasis; and suitability of the course for credit in the area of Computer and Information Sciences. Approval for transfers under this policy must be obtained from the student’s academic advisor prior to registration. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019 114  Students enrolled in other Regis University graduate programs and in good standing may register for College of Computer& Information Sciences courses, either classroom-based or online. To do so the student must have approval from his/her academic advisor in the program in which the student is currently enrolled and obtain written approval from the appropriate College of Computer & Information Sciences department chair. Courses eligible for cross registration include all College of Computer& Information Sciences courses for which there is no prerequisite requirement. If a student wishes to enroll in a course for which one or more prerequisite courses exist, the student must satisfy all prerequisite requirements before he/she will be permitted to enroll. Permission to enroll in courses does not guarantee that the course can be transferred to the student’s primary degree program.  DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The College of Computer & Information Sciences degree requires the successful completion of a total of 36 semester hours of graduate courses (600-level).

MA Graduate Academic Certificates Liberal Studies Professional Studies  MASTER OF FINE ARTS Creative Writing  MASTER OF SCIENCE Criminology CCLS GENERAL INFORMATION Unless otherwise noted, the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies follows all policies and procedures as stated in the General Information section of this Catalog.    MISSION The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies offers innovative, accelerated higher education for adult learners to meet their academic, professional and personal goals, and to make a positive impact in a changing society. Inspired by the Regis University Mission which focuses on the common good, we motivate and challenge a diverse community of students, faculty and staff to acquire knowledge, abilities and commitments necessary for distinguished professional work and leadership in service to others.  PURPOSE The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies develops and administers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, certificates, credit courses, and non-credit courses for both traditional and non-traditional learners. These offerings tailor learning to the adult learner through classroom-based, guided independent study, or distance learning delivery. The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies is structured to serve two general groups: those who wish to complete a program leading to a degree and those who seek specialized training or knowledge to increase their competence in their current occupation or profession or to prepare themselves for a new occupation or profession.  Master’s Degrees The Regis University College of Contemporary Liberal Studies is nationally recognized as a leader in education providing adults with innovative, professional, collaborative educational programs. Graduate study has a substantive tradition in CCLS, dating from 1978, when the first graduate degree was offered at Regis. The graduate degrees vary in content, delivery system and focus; however, they hold in common a commitment to serving adult learners with quality, value-oriented, relevant graduate education.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Regis University College of Contemporary Liberal Studies recognizes that lifelong learning is integral to professional growth. No longer can the working professional survive on the assumption that the completion of a formal program in a prescribed number of years is adequate preparation for a lifetime of work. This concept must give way to a concept of lifelong education as an integral part of a career. The teaching/learning theories and strategies of the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies are drawn from the field of andragogy--the art and science of helping adults learn. In particular, four assumptions drawn from the work of Malcolm Knowles are implemented in programs offered by the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  141  Changes in Self-Concept: As people grow and mature their self-concept moves from one of dependency to one of increasing self-directedness. Adult learners are accustomed to making important decisions in their personal and professional lives. An educational program that seeks to meet adult learners on a psychologically sound and healthy basis must encourage increasing self-directedness. Role of Experience: As individuals mature, they accumulate an expanding reservoir of experience that causes them to be increasingly rich resources for learning. At the same time, this reservoir of experience provides them with a broadening base from which to relate new learning. Studies of cognitive changes in the adult years give evidence that both programmed and un-programmed experiences produce deep-seated changes in the way adults approach their thinking. Accordingly, for adult learners, effective education demands increasing emphasis on experiential techniques that tap this experience. Readiness to Learn: As individuals mature, their readiness to learn is decreasingly the product of biological development and academic pressures and is increasingly the product of the developmental tasks required for the performance of their evolving social roles. Adults, then, develop as workers, spouses, parents, organizational members and leaders, leisure time users and the like. There is no assumption that one has to sit passively by and wait for readiness to develop naturally. There are ways to stimulate readiness to learn through exposure to better models of performance, higher levels of aspiration and self-diagnostic procedures. Orientations to Learning: Adults tend to have a problem-centered orientation to learning. While much of a child’s education is one of postponed application, adults come to education because they are experiencing some need to improve their capabilities and demonstrate their competencies with some immediacy. Adult students want to apply tomorrow what they learn today.  SERVICE LEARNING Service Learning is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning and development. Service Learning joins two complex concepts: community action, the “service” and efforts learned from that action and connect what is learned to existing knowledge, the “learning.” Community service becomes service learning when it is connected to classroom curriculum and activities and contains opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences, thus allowing for consciousness raising and systemic change. This is particularly true for Jesuit education that has for centuries held a mission of forming men and women who seek to transform the world through service to others. The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies Service Learning program seeks to assist CCLS faculty in integrating social justice and service learning concepts and activities across the curriculum in undergraduate and graduate programs. The Service Learning program in CCLS houses information regarding service learning opportunities for faculty, students and staff including a database of service opportunities and resources for curricular information. The CCLS Office of Service Learning offers site referrals and consultation, faculty development, resource development, service learning newsletter, and evaluation.  ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Admissions requirements for Regis University students are outlined in this General Information section of this Catalog under the ‘Regis University Admissions’ heading.   More specific requirements for the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies graduate degree programs can be found in this section of the Catalog under the specific graduate degree information. Graduate Writing Skills Since graduate writing skills are critical to the successful completion of a master’s degree in CCLS, any student receiving an evaluation of ‘Unsatisfactory’ on either writing portion of the essays submitted with the application, will be required to complete "

Additionally the course focuses on applying critical thinking to problem solving and decision making.   MASTER OF ARTS: PROGRAM (MAP) "
EDFD 500,", or its equivalent prior to entering any graduate level courses in the program.   ACADEMIC INFORMATION STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Students are expected to have college-level writing skills when they enter a program. These skills include writing mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation, word usage and structure) along with analysis of issues, support of position, and clarity of thought. Each student is responsible for meeting the writing standards designated by the degree program. For master’s students, a personal computer with a modem is an indispensable management tool. The benefits of having full-time access to a personal computer far exceeds those obtained through sharing the limited amount of equipment in Regis’ computer laboratories. Students are encouraged to have access to their own personal computer, either through personal ownership, rental, or arrangements made with their employer.  STUDENT ETHICS STATEMENT An integral component of CCLS courses is student and facilitator/instructor self-disclosure and the use of personal experience for the purpose of facilitating course work. Each student is expected to honor confidentiality as it pertains to student disclosure. It shall be a violation of the ethical standards to use shared information, comments, or opinions expressed by another student or facilitator/instructor in the educational setting in a manner which is intended to humiliate, embarrass, harass, damage, or otherwise injure the student in his/her personal, public or business/professional life. In addition, confidentiality must be upheld by not disclosing any information which would identify a particular individual or organization. An additional integral component of higher education is challenging one’s own perceptions and beliefs regarding the course content and integrating information as well as understanding opposing perceptions and beliefs. Thus, students have the right to choose how much they will disclose and must also accept the REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  142  responsibility of respecting disclosure of other students and facilitators/instructors.  STUDENT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT In the spirit of the Jesuit mission of Regis University, CCLS students and faculty share responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. This includes using information technology responsibly in online and other courses. In order for faculty members to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, online courses, and other learning areas, the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies and the faculty expect students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner and not engage in disruptive behavior, disorderly conduct or intentionally interfere in the freedom of expression of others. “Disruptive Behavior” or “Disorderly Conduct” as applied in all academic settings and formats (i.e., classroom, online, independent study, etc.) means behavior that a reasonable faculty member or student would view as intentionally or recklessly interfering with normal academic functions, university events, or university sponsored activities.  Examples include, but are not limited to: persistently speaking or commenting without being recognized or interrupting other speakers; behavior that distracts the class from the subject matter or discussion; or, in extreme cases, physical threats, harassing behavior or personal insults; refusal to comply with faculty direction including refusal to work in a group, using a cell phone or pager during a classroom session, inappropriate mediated communication; or behavior that has a negative impact in any learning environment. Disruptive behavior also includes any other behavior covered by the Regis University Student Handbook: Code of Conduct which can be found at www.regis.edu. Students who fail to adhere to acceptable behavioral standards may be subject to discipline which may include reprimand, dismissal from the class and/or expulsion from the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies. Students who wish to appeal a decision regarding the consequences of their behavior should follow the Appeal Process outlined in the Regis University Student Handbook.  LEARNING FORMATS Students may complete Regis University academic course work through any combination of the following learning formats as availability of course format permits:  classroom-based courses  directed study   online courses  blended courses (classroom-based and online combination) Course work acquired through any of these learning formats, as well as courses available through the Anderson College of Business, the College of Computer & Information Sciences, Regis College or the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions, meet the definition of Regis University credit. Classroom-Based Classroom-based courses are offered in five, eight, and 16-week academic periods, weekend intensive format or in summer intensive format. Most courses meet one or two days/evenings each week for a total of 20 to 32 contact hours. Course learning format, selection, and availability vary by campus location. Students choosing this option usually study a single subject area for a concentrated period of time. This course format is based on a facilitative model of learning. Most accelerated classes require a minimum of 19-25 hours of combined study and classroom time each week, depending on the course content, course length and the student’s learning style. While this model allows for degree completion in a shorter period of time, there is an increased expectation for independent learning outside the classroom.  Directed Study For directed study, student’s share the responsibility for course design with a faculty advisor at Regis University, as well as an outside expert who serves as a course consultant. Plans for course study are formalized in a Learning Contract. The Learning Contract is similar to a course syllabus, and includes clear statements of course objectives, required learning activities and method of evaluation. In addition to completing courses in the classroom or online, students may choose to complete a variety of undergraduate courses through an independent study format. In most cases, students will complete the same assignments – with a few revisions – as students in a classroom-based course. Each course will be taken in an eight-week format. Instructors will be chosen from the affiliate faculty within the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies. Students spend approximately 45 clock hours per credit on each course, including planning time, meetings with their instructor, and doing the course work. For a three-semester hour course completed during an eight-week academic period, this would constitute a minimum of 17 to 20 hours each week. Selected courses are offered on the semester calendar.  Online Online courses are generally offered in an accelerated eight-week format over the Internet. These courses are designed to provide an interactive learning experience for students. Faculty and students communicate and collaborate through online discussions and e-mail. Course materials generally include textbook(s) and online workshops.  Lifestyle issues--including variable work schedules, family responsibilities, physical limitations or geographical inaccessibility--make this a viable option for adults pursuing higher educational goals. Regis Online courses primarily focus on the completion of a degree however many of the courses may be approved to apply toward other majors. Educational technologies like synchronous and asynchronous web technologies, CD and e-mail offer learners convenience and flexibility. Online courses have highly structured requirements and deadlines which fall within eight week academic terms. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  143  Online students need to have computer equipment and skills at a specified minimum level. Please check with the undergraduate program for current requirements. Students should allocate a minimum of 20 hours each week for completing course assignments and participating in online discussions.  CURRICULUM Regardless of format, each course offered through the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies focuses on course objectives, required learning activities, and outcome evaluation. Close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice, as well as the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that prepare students for changing demands of the workplace. Because effective written and oral communication skills are essential in both occupational and academic environments, the CCLS emphasizes the development of these skills.  FACULTY Facilitators, independent study course instructors, and presenters are frequently working professionals representing various corporations, businesses and organizations. All hold a master’s or doctoral degree, and bring academic theory and current professional experience to the learning environment. An assessment process is employed to determine not only the knowledge base of each selected faculty member, but also his/her ability to facilitate the learning of adult students.  ACADEMIC ADVISING A unique feature of CCLS is its emphasis on academic advising. Advisors are available to assist with course planning and degree development as needed. Advisors provide assistance and recommendations to students from the point of admission through graduation.  CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING Many adult students have extensive work or life learning that can be documented and evaluated for undergraduate college credit. The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies offers two methods of assessing prior learning:  Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) Regis University, like more than 1,500 other American colleges and universities, awards credit for documented, college-level learning gained through experience, and/or on-the-job training programs. A portfolio of prior learning consists of one or more essays in which the student demonstrates the knowledge equivalent to that gained from a college course. PLA credit may be awarded for a wide range of areas of expertise. Students can petition to earn credit in any college-level subject area (e.g., business, computers, fine arts, creative writing, religious studies, and photography). Regis University uses learningcounts.org to assess prior learning by portfolio Undergraduate teacher licensure students may be able to utilize the PLA assessment process to evaluate prior learning at the undergraduate level.  Students may petition for a maximum of 45 semester hours of PLA credit. Credits earned through the PLA process do not apply toward the Regis University residency requirements (30 semester hours). Students may obtain additional information from portfolio@regis.edu.  REGISTRATION Students may register online via WebAdvisor, in person, or by phone. Students may register any Regis University site.   Add/Drop College of Contemporary Liberal Studies students may drop a course through the end of the published add/drop period via online through WebAdvisor, in person, by phone, e-mail, or  at any Regis University site. When students drop a course within the add/drop period, the course does not appear on the transcript and tuition charges are credited to the account.   CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT IN OTHER REGIS PROGRAMS Concurrent enrollment is defined as taking courses simultaneously in more than one Regis University college. Students may take courses in multiple programs within colleges to fulfill degree requirements for graduation.  Students in the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies may register for courses offered in the Anderson College of Business, the College of Computer & Information Sciences, Regis College or limited courses in the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions. CCLS students must obtain the approval of their advisor.   COURSE AVAILABILITY Regis University does not guarantee that courses will be offered at the same campus location or on the same evening as they were offered for a previous academic period. A course is subject to cancellation if the minimum student registration for that course is not met.  CLASS ATTENDANCE Students are expected to make every effort to attend all class meetings. Attendance standards for individual courses are established in writing by the instructor at the first class session. Students unable to attend the first class must contact the instructor ahead of time.   ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS/CLASS Final examinations may be given at the end of each academic period. Students who miss a final examination, or who fail to submit all required work without a justifiable excuse, are awarded a grade based on all course requirements. Students who are unable to take a final examination or complete final course requirements for a valid reason (i.e., circumstances beyond the student’s control) must request in writing to the instructor a grade of incomplete (I). The “I” grade must be removed within a REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  144  specified period of time or the alternate grade is assigned. More information can be found under the “Grading” heading in this  section of the Catalog.  COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD Undergraduate students who wish to register for more than two courses in any five- or eight-week term, or more than 18 semester hours in one semester must receive approval from the CCLS Undergraduate Advising department. Students must obtain and submit an Overload Request form 30 days prior to taking the overload credit to the Undergraduate Advising Department. The advisor will:  Verify that students have a 3.000 grade point average or higher.  Ensure that students have no incomplete grades pending.  Contact students regarding approval or denial of the request. No further overloads are approved if students receive any incomplete grades and/or fall below a 3.000 grade point average. Graduate students should refer to the program/college section of this Catalog for specific requirements regarding course load/overloads for each degree program.  GRADING For information on  incomplete grades, change of recorded grade, and repeat for higher grade, students should refer to the General Information section of this Catalog.  Grade of Incomplete The student must submit the Incomplete Grade Request form, this form document serves as a contract between the student and the instructor regarding the completion of an incomplete grade for a course within the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies. A grade of Incomplete or “I” denotes that the required work for the course is incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances. Unforeseen circumstances mean, for example, that an accident, an illness, a death, or a major life transition has occurred. Incompletes are granted at the discretion of the faculty. The student must submit the Incomplete Grade Request Form to the instructor explaining the unforeseen circumstances which have occurred. The student also must have completed 75% of the course with a passing grade in order to be eligible for an incomplete. The length of time and the remaining requirements to complete the course are determined by the instructor; however, the maximum length of time for completion is the end of the following term.  Grade of “In Progress” “In Progress” grades are given to students in graduate capstone project courses, graduate thesis courses or practicum/internship courses where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the eight weeks or semester (if a semester-based course) provided for completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an “In Progress” grade can be granted for a period of up to one year (12 months) to complete the capstone project course or practicum/internship. The grade to be recorded in the student’s record is IP/F or IP/NP depending on whether the approved grade in a letter grade or Pass/No Pass. If the student does not satisfactorily complete the course within the one year period, the grade reverts to the “F” or “NP” grade. “In Progress” grades will only be given in the capstone/thesis courses or practicum/internship courses. “In Progress” is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases if the student is unable to complete the course work for an approved reason and the instructor approves, the appropriate grade is Incomplete/F (I/F) and the student has no more than the eight weeks or equivalent term to complete the work.  Grade Reports All grades are reported at the end of each academic period, at which time they become official and are entered on the students’ permanent record. Grade reports are no longer mailed to students; however, grades may be accessed online through the WebAdvisor link at www.regis.edu.  Grades cannot be given over the phone or e-mailed to the student.  Appeals of Disputed Grades Students who wish to dispute a grade earned in a course should use the following procedures: 1. The student contacts the instructor of the course to request a review of the issue.  2. If the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student submits a written request for review of the grade to the degree chair.  The written request must be initiated within 60 days after the last official day of the term in which the course in question was taken. The request must provide rationale indicating why the grade earned is not appropriate, and all relevant documentation must be included (course syllabus, copies of exams, quizzes, papers, presentation materials, etc.) The request must include the student’s name, address, e-mail address, course number, instructor name and the term in which the course was completed. 3. The faculty led reviews all documentation submitted.  If needed, the degree chair contacts the student and the instructor to arrange a personal interview. The faculty lead approves or disapproves the appeal.  If the faculty lead approves the appeal, a Change of Grade form is completed and submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The faculty lead informs the student and the instructor in writing of the decision regarding the appeal. 4. If the grade dispute is not satisfactorily resolved, the student may appeal the decision to the Assistant Dean of the appropriate school. This written appeal must be submitted within two calendar weeks of receipt of the decision in step 3 above. The Assistant Dean will review the proceedings and any additional information provided by the student. The decision of the Assistant Dean is final. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  145  DEAN’S LIST For fall, spring and summer semesters, a Dean’s List is created for College of Contemporary Liberal Studies undergraduate students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of twelve or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.800 is placed on the Dean’s List. A student who is required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course--and who also carries nine or more graded hours with a 3.800 semester grade point average--is eligible for inclusion on the Dean’s List.  Students who are not required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course but request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of twelve letter-graded semester hours. Student who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean’s List.  ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES  Good Standing A College of Contemporary Liberal Studies undergraduate student must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade of less than “C-“ in an upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward completion of major or minor requirements. A grade of less than “C-” in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses apply toward graduation. To sustain good academic standing at the graduate level, a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 for 600-level course work is required. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned in the 600-level courses, by the total number of semester hours attempted in those courses. No more than two courses with grades of “C” can count toward graduation requirements. A grade lower than a “C” (e.g. “C-”) is not counted toward degree requirements, but is included in the cumulative grade point average.  Probation The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies undergraduate student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000 at the end of any given semester is placed on academic probation. During the next semester (fall, spring, summer) of enrollment, the University expects the student to raise his/her cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. If the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.000, the student may be academically suspended at the end of the probationary semester. The student must work closely with his/her advisor to determine the number of semester hours to be taken during the probationary semester to maximize the possibility of earning the required cumulative 2.000 grade point average by the end of the semester. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the School Dean. Academic probation is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript). Occasionally, a student’s Regis University cumulative grade point average is so low that the student finds it mathematically impossible to attain a 2.000 cumulative grade point average during only one semester. In this case, the student may enter into an agreement with an advisor of the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies to earn a provisional grade point average for the semester. The agreed-upon grade point average is set within a range that is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student. If the provisional semester grade point average is earned for the semester, but the student’s cumulative grade point average is still below 2.000, the student may be permitted to continue on probation rather than be suspended. Undergraduate students accepted on probation by the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 2.000 cumulative grade point average. Graduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.000 for 600-level course(s) at the end of any given semester are placed on academic probation. After one semester on probation, a student’s performance will be reviewed by the appropriate faculty lead and School Assistant Dean. Students who are not successful in raising their grade point average to 3.000 will be considered for suspension by the faculty lead and School Assistant Dean. Students on probation are permitted to take only one course per term and are not permitted to have an Incomplete grade while on Probation. In addition, graduate students who receive a grade of “C” or less in two courses are subject to academic review. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the School Dean.  Suspension If a College of Contemporary Liberal Studies student has been placed on academic probation and does not achieve a 2.000 (undergraduate) or 3.000 (graduate) cumulative grade point average at the end of the next semester of enrollment, he/she is suspended. Academic suspension is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript). Students are formally notified of their suspension from Regis University in a letter from the School Dean. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous semester and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped. After one calendar year, the student may apply for readmission by fulfilling the following written requirements:  Submit a letter requesting readmission and an explanation of the previous academic difficulties and how the problem(s) have been addressed.  Submit a written contract, signed by the student and the appropriate Assistant Dean, which states how the student will meet the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average within a defined period.  An official transcript showing at least 12 semester hours of acceptable academic course work completed at a regionally accredited college or university (undergraduate students only).  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  146  Dismissal Academic dismissal is action taken by Regis University by which the student is rendered ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, a student must have been suspended, applied for and been readmitted to Regis University on academic probation, and failed to achieve either the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average. The provisional grade point average is pre-determined by the student and the appropriate school assistant dean. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).  Suspension/Dismissal Appeal Procedure Students who wish to appeal their suspension/dismissal must complete the following requirements within 30 days of the date on the letter of notification for Suspension/Dismissal. Write a letter or send an email to the Dean, College of Contemporary Liberal Studies explaining: 1. Why the student should not be suspended from the program or dismissed from the University. a. What prevented the student from successful progress toward completion of academic goals. b. That the student is committed to and ready to proceed with serious academic study. c. Why the student failed to achieve the required grade point average. Were there, for example, any extenuating circumstances beyond the student’s control. d. The names of the student’s advisor or faculty members from whom supporting statements may be solicited by the student (undergraduate students only). e. Contact the advisor, faculty member, doctors, etc. to discuss the case. Any supporting statements from them must be received by the same deadline. The Dean is interested in any pertinent information which has genuine bearing on the matter. The focus is on why the suspension/dismissal action should be reversed and why the student failed to reach his/her academic goals. Decisions on Suspension/Dismissal appeals by the School Dean are final; no further appeals are accepted.  BACCALAUREATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS In addition to the completion of the Core Studies academic requirements, the following are also required of each undergraduate degree candidate in the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies:  The completion of 120 semester hours of academic work in which the candidate has earned a minimum cumulative Regis University grade point average of 2.000. Thirty semester hours of the total 120 hours must be at the upper division level.  A minimum of 30 semester hours completed at Regis University.

Of the 42 semester hours, a minimum of 18 semester hours must be at the upper division course level (400 level).  The completion of a minor area is optional. The minor consists of 12 upper division (400 level) semester hours in a discipline outside the major that lends support to the development of the major and aids students in reaching their ultimate educational objective.  A grade of “C-” or higher for credit to be counted in the major or minor areas.  Students may transfer up to half of the upper division semester hours in the major and half in the minor. Once the student has applied, all remaining upper division (400 level) courses must be completed at Regis University.  Some courses taken toward a major may also count toward the Core Studies requirements. A single course cannot, however, satisfy two Core Studies requirements.  Upper division courses required to meet one major or minor cannot be counted toward a major or minor in another discipline except under the following conditions:  In the event the upper division requirements for a major exceed 18 semester hours, those excess hours may also be applied to another major or minor. o In the event that the upper division requirements for a minor exceed 12 upper division semester hours, those excess hours may also be applied to another major or minor. o Courses that satisfy lower division prerequisites for more than one major or minor may be applied to more than one major or minor.  Competence in oral and written communication skills is required. Students should be able to express themselves with clarity, precision and force, which comes only from a disciplined command of words, word usage and grammar.  Major Requirements   42 SH Students must complete a minimum of 42 semester hours in their chosen field of study. At least 18 semester hours must be at the upper division level.

COLLEGE FOR CONTEMPORARY LIBERAL STUDIES UNDERGRADUATE CERTIFICATE  Professional Liberal Studies 12-15 SH Twelve to fifteen semester hours of upper division course work chosen in consultation with an academic advisor.   DIPLOMA IN LIBERAL STUDIES The Jesuit Worldwide Learning (JWL) Academic Program includes both credit-bearing and certificate-level courses.  The Diploma in Liberal Studies includes 45 credits of coursework over three years. The Diploma program has been developed within the framework of Ignatian pedagogy that seeks to develop the whole person, or cura personalis.  Within each course and across the curriculum, student learning is structured around the concepts of experience, reflection and action. Experience:  Experience begins with the recollection of previous learning of facts, feelings and insights that may be of relevance to the discipline. To this experience, discipline-specific information, skills and knowledge are added through the learning process. Reflection:  As part of the learning process, students are invited to pause and consider questions of significance to themselves and their communities in the context of their discipline-specific coursework. 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  151  Action, Service, and Evaluation:  At its culmination, participants are invited to consider how their new skills and knowledge can be put into action within their communities. Credit Hour The definition of a credit hour is based on time spent in mentored learning activities that are directed toward student learning outcomes. All JWL Diploma courses have designated student learning outcomes. Three-credit courses require a minimum of 30 hours of mentored learning activities during an 8 week session. All JWL courses require learners to complete individual studying, reading, and writing in addition to mentored learning activities, but these activities are not counted toward credit hours.  Each course includes both a confidential student evaluation survey and a confidential faculty evaluation survey.  While responses will not be associated with the name of the responder, they will be summarized to provide important program feedback and inform continuous revision and improvement in the program. Faculty The international faculty represent over 25 universities and other educational institutions around the world. They accompany students throughout their education journey. Technology JWL delivers its Diploma courses over the internet using a learning management system that has been donated by Georgetown University. Blackboard provides students and faculty with a platform that enables asynchronous discussion; communication tools for announcements and email; hosting of video, articles, and assignments; submission of student work; space for collaborative and individual work; and a grade center for individualized instructor feedback to students.  Student Responsibilities  Students are expected to have strong English language comprehension when they enter the program, and the ability to attain college-level writing skills through participation in two early courses (Bridge to Learning and Academic Writing). These skills include writing mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation, word usage and structure), analytical thinking, argumentative writing, and proper citations. Each student is responsible for meeting the writing standards designated by the program. Online  Online courses are offered in an accelerated eight-week format over the Internet. These courses are designed to provide an interactive learning experience for students. Faculty and students communicate and collaborate through online discussions and e-mail. Course materials generally include textbook(s), required readings and videos, asynchronous lectures, individual and/or group assignments, and assessments.   Class Attendance  Students are expected to make every effort to attend class online throughout each week. Discussion posts are due each week, and most course assignments are due at the end of the week. Students should let instructors know ahead of time if they will miss a course deadline. Even with prior notification, late penalties may apply.  Attendance at Final Exams Final examinations may be given at the end of each academic period. Students who miss a final examination, or who fail to submit all required work without a justifiable excuse, are awarded a grade based on all course requirements. Students who are unable to take a final examination or complete final course requirements for a valid reason (i.e., circumstances beyond the student’s control) must make a request in writing of the instructor for an extension of the course deadline(s). More information on requesting an extension can be found in this catalog. Diploma in Liberal Studies Requirements  The courses of the Diploma program begin with a no-credit Bridge to Learning Course, followed by ten courses (30 credits) in core liberal studies and five courses (15 credits) in a concentration area, as detailed below.

ACADEMIC INFORMATION Sixteen-week semester courses in Biology graduate programs follow the same fall- and spring-semester academic schedules as the Regis College undergraduate program, including final examination schedules and both add/drop and withdrawal deadlines.  Eight-week accelerated courses in Biology graduate programs allow add/drop through the first week of the eight-week term and allow withdrawal from the second week through the fourth week of the term.  One-week one-semester hour courses in Biology Graduate Programs do not allow students to Add/Drop after the course has started and allow withdrawal through the third day of the course.  The same policies regarding appeals of disputed grades, academic student conduct, and academic dismissal that apply in the Regis College undergraduate program also apply to Biology graduate programs. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG    2018-2019  240  FINAL EXAMINATIONS Final examinations in semester courses (16-week course) are assigned at the end of each semester for two hours each during final-examination week.  The final examinations for semester courses in Biology graduate programs follow the same schedule as Regis College undergraduate courses, unless modified by the Director of the Program and the students are informed.  Final examinations in accelerated eight-week courses occur during the regularly scheduled class period, via individual scheduling outside of class time, or via online examination.  Eight-week courses do not have separate scheduled examination periods.  INCOMPLETE GRADES A student who is unable to take a final examination or complete final class coursework for a valid reason (i.e., emergency circumstances beyond the student’s control) is eligible for a grade of incomplete.  A student must specifically request an Incomplete grade in writing from the instructor, who will determine if the reason is valid based on his/her judgment and the policies outlined in the course syllabus.  The length of time allowed to finish work and resolve an Incomplete grade is determined by the instructor in consultation with the student, but may not exceed the end of the next equivalent-length academic term (e.g., by the end of the next semester for semester courses or by the end of the next eight-week course period for eight-week courses).  TRANSFER CREDIT Transfer credit is not awarded for graduate-level coursework in the Biomedical Sciences or Genetics and Genomics graduate programs given the closely coordinated nature of the curriculum in this one-year program and transfer credit is only given in limited circumstances in the Environmental Biology Programs (Such determinations are made by the program director).  ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTY Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.000 are placed on academic probation. Students placed on probation must raise their cumulative program grade point average to 3.000 in the spring semester to be eligible for graduation. In addition, students who receive a grade of “C” or lower in two courses at the 600-level in the same semester are subject to academic review by the appropriate Program Director and may be suspended from the program. Suspension appeals are submitted to the Program Director. The review committee will be constructed in the same way as the review committee for appeal of disputed grades except that the program director will serve as the instructor usually does in that process. The student may be asked to attend part or all of the appeal review meeting.  GRADUATION  Application The filing of a formal Application for Graduation with the Regis College Dean’s Office is required at the beginning of the fall semester in the academic year the student intends to graduate.  For students in the M.S. in Biomedical Sciences or the one-year M.S. in Environmental Biology programs, this is immediately after the start of the program.  Degree or Certificate Award Students graduate after all requirements are met and documentation is on file. Incomplete grades or late application may result in later award of degrees. A program cumulative grade point average of 3.000 is required for graduation with a degree. Certificates do not result in the award of a diploma and are not presented at commencement ceremonies. Diplomas and transcripts are not released if any financial indebtedness to Regis University exists.  Additional information regarding policies and procedures for making payment of account is located in the General Information section of this Catalog under the “Tuition, Fees, Room and Board Charges” heading.

While developing specific competencies on the job, the student is able to combine academic coursework with experience in a professional setting. The field experience course is available to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Students in this course receive three elective credits, and can take the course for a letter grade or opt for Pass/No Pass. University regulations on taking courses P/NP apply.   Internship Course Through the "
PC 498E,"-W--Leadership Internship. Students registering for either course must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.8 and cannot be on disciplinary probation. To register for either course, students must receive approval from the director of the Academic Internship Program and the faculty sponsor in their department. Course registration takes place in the Program office only after an internship has been secured and approved. Students cannot receive credit for virtual internships or internships in home offices. In order to find a placement that meets Program requirements, students should begin the internship search one semester prior to the semester in which they intend to participate. To get started, students should set up an advising meeting with Academic Internship Program staff. Regis College requires a minimum of 120 hour at the internship site over the full semester, for which students earn three semester hours of credit. Students must also fulfill all the academic requirements in the course syllabus. Exceptions to these policies must be determined at the beginning of the semester through consultation with the faculty sponsor and the director of Academic Internship Program, with approval in writing by the associate dean for Regis College.  In addition to interning the minimum number of hours at a site under the guidance of a site supervisor, students work closely with a Regis professor during the internship semester. Academic requirements in the course can include keeping a journal of observations and experiences at the site, as well as completing projects and meeting specific learning objectives. The faculty sponsor determines the grade for the course based on academic work and on mid-term and final evaluations submitted by the site supervisor.  Students in all areas, including thematic majors, can look forward to an enriching experience in the private sector, public sector, or nonprofit organization in the Denver area or in another state. Regis College also offers a semester-long academic internship program in Washington D.C. in partnership with two program providers. Fifteen semester hours of Regis credit are awarded. Students must apply for these programs by meeting with the director of the Academic Internship Program. Specific internship programs for ethnically diverse students are also available. The Academic Internship Program enables the student to develop solid professional skills to complement their classroom learning. For many graduating seniors, an internship can be the link to a network of employers after graduation. These contacts, in addition to an enhanced resume, are of benefit to students after they leave Regis. For those applying to graduate or professional programs, an undergraduate internship can be a distinguishing element of their application.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  179  Field Experience Course The -W Leadership Internship course, juniors and seniors are able to gain practical experience in a field of interest while earning credit in their program of study. The internship course can be taken for a letter grade only. In several departments, an academic internship is required for graduation, and the course credits count toward the major or minor. In other departments, the internship course counts as elective credit in the major or minor. Some departments have prerequisite courses that must be taken prior to the internship course.  HONORS PROGRAM The Honors Program is available to self-motivated, conscientious Regis College students who wish to complete an alternate pathway through the Core curriculum and be distinguished as an honors graduate. Honors students form a vibrant community of young scholars who are committed to making the most out of their time at college. Honors students are natural leaders across the campus community, tend to thrive on challenges, and enjoy working together to realize their full intellectual potential. Additionally, honors students are eager to integrate their intellectual lives into their personal, community, and world experiences. Honors Program students enjoy an integrated sequence of core seminars designed especially for them by faculty across the college. This team-taught curriculum stresses interdisciplinary study, small group interaction, and individual student initiative. A variety of “honors only” sections of standard Core courses invite students to explore material in greater breadth or depth, probing connections within and among disciplines. By taking an alternative pathway through the standard Core curriculum, the Honors Program provides an exciting way to integrate the broader education provided by a liberal arts college. The Honors Program is competitive and normally limited to 30 students per year. To be distinguished as an honors student at graduation, a student must maintain a 3.500 cumulative grade point average and complete at least 27 semester hours of dedicated honors courses, including a senior thesis. Students interested in joining the Honors Program should contact the director of the Honors Program.  DEPARTMENTAL HONORS Departmental honors programs are available to Regis College undergraduate program students in Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, English, Neuroscience, and Psychology. Students should contact the appropriate Department Chair for information. Departmental honors requirements are listed with the appropriate departmental major information in this Catalog.  PRE-LAW MINOR Through the Pre-Law minor, Regis University offers courses and structure, student campus organizations, mentor and internship relations in the legal field, and law-related advising across several academic disciplines. Res Judicata – meaning “those thing settled” in the courts is a student organization that builds on established Regis principles of peace, justice, and service.  These are long standing Ignatian educational values that are addressed through a speaker series, service projects, and strategic planning for graduate school.  The Pre-Law minor helps cohere the student’s liberal arts education, Ignatian principles, and pre-professional training so that students may develop skills valued by law schools and prepare optimally for a challenging and critical vocation.  PRE-MEDICAL AND PRE-DENTAL PROGRAMS Undergraduate students intending careers as physicians, dentists, or other health professionals will find appropriate academic preparation and supportive student colleagues. Medical and dental schools are placing increased emphasis on a broad liberal education as a background for graduate work, combined with the substantial science prerequisite courses. Therefore, although there are no official pre-medical or pre-dental majors, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry and Neuroscience are the most common majors. Courses must be chosen carefully to ensure completion of all requirements for entrance into the professional schools and to make adequate preparation for the Medical College Aptitude Test or the Dental Aptitude Test, examinations that are usually taken at the end of the junior year. Students are encouraged to gain experience in health-related service areas, including volunteer or internship activities. Students also may participate in educational and service activities sponsored by Alpha Epsilon Delta, the National Health Pre-Professional Honor Society. Students interested in preparation for graduate health careers should contact the Pre-Med/Pre-Health advisor located in the Biology Department.  PRE-PHARMACY PROGRAM Undergraduate students interested in pursuing a Doctoral Degree in Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) need not complete an undergraduate degree before entering the professional program; rather, they must complete the prerequisite courses, which will usually require two to three years of coursework. While the School of Pharmacy does not guarantee admission to Regis undergraduate students, individuals who have completed their prerequisite courses, at least 3 full time semesters at Regis University, maintained a cumulative GPA of 3.0 in their prerequisite course work, and earned a minimum of 30% on the PCAT are guaranteed an opportunity to interview with the School of Pharmacy. Undergraduate students considering a Doctoral Degree in Pharmacy should contact the School of Pharmacy for specific information on prerequisite coursework.  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG    2018-2019  180  PRE-PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM Undergraduate students interested in pursuing a Doctoral Degree in Physical Therapy may complete any undergraduate major, although the natural sciences such as Biology, Chemistry, and Neuroscience and the social sciences, such as Psychology, are especially useful in preparing for a career in Physical Therapy. While the School of Physical Therapy does not guarantee admission to Regis graduates, individuals who have earned a baccalaureate degree at Regis University and who have completed the prerequisite courses are given preference for admission. Undergraduate students considering a Doctoral Degree in Physical Therapy should contact the School of Physical Therapy for specific information on prerequisite coursework.  RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS (ROTC) Enrollment in Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) provides undergraduates and selected graduate students an opportunity to combine academic study with a military officer’s professional education program.

With a program portfolio of 100 programs in over 80 locations worldwide, the Study Abroad Office will work with students to identify programs that are financially and academically suited to students’ needs.  TRAVEL LEARNING Faculty-led, short-term, travel learning courses provide both faculty and students with opportunities to take their classrooms to the locations around the globe that bring the course content to life. They may be offered in all disciplines in the Regis College curriculum, and have been developed to be as affordable and accessible for students as possible while still upholding the academic standards and ethical commitments that serve as core values for any Regis educational program offered. REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG    2018-2019  182  While the majority of travel learning courses bring students to international locations, faculty are also invited to develop domestic travel learning courses that provide students with opportunities to extend the boundaries of their classroom studies across the United States. Travel learning courses may be developed as stand-alone classes in which all instruction occurs abroad, or they may offer a blend of on-campus and travel-based instruction. While typically offered during Summer Session, travel learning courses may also be offered in the spring and fall semesters with the actual travel component occurring during the breaks in the regular course meeting schedules.  SUMMER SESSION Regis College offers lower and upper-division undergraduate courses in the core as well as major areas of study from early May through August. Summer Session invites students to reach their educational goals through the convenience of accelerated courses. The focused learning atmosphere of the Summer Session balances the challenge of concentrated study with personal interaction between students and professors. Courses offered during Summer Session are equivalent to those offered during the fall and spring semesters in content, prerequisites, and number of credits. Most summer session courses are held on-campus, with a limited selection of online offerings. In addition, students have the opportunity to participate in a Faculty-Led Travel Learning program, arrange internships for academic credit with the Academic Internship Office, or an Independent Study or Special Study with select faculty.   TEACHER LICENSURE PROGRAM Regis College students interested in becoming teachers complete a sequence of professional licensure courses in addition to their core and major studies. This sequence of education courses at Regis is designed to lead to licensure at the elementary, secondary, or K-12 grade levels in Colorado. In addition, as a required component of our programs, all graduates complete the qualifications for an Endorsement in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education. Students also have the option to pursue licensure in special education. A Special Education Generalist Endorsement is available in conjunction with and elementary or secondary teaching licensure. The licensure programs are mission oriented and focus on serving the needs of all students. Students complete teaching internships in a variety of high needs schools in the Denver metropolitan area, including public and Catholic schools with diverse populations. Regis students enrolled in this sequence begin developing teacher performance, dispositions, and knowledge during the first courses and initial field experiences. Students may also choose to major in Elementary Education: Teaching for Social Justice. Students interested in teaching middle school or high school can pursue licensure with a content major (ex, mathematics, sciences, English, Spanish, history).

SPECIALIZATION DESCRIPTIONS   When "communication" is situated in the contexts of identity, community and culture, students begin to understand human experiences as systemic, co-created, emergent, narrative and performed.  A track that emphasizes Human Communication is likely to include courses in interpersonal and intercultural communication, relationships, conflict and dialogue, persuasion and performance, cultural institutions and meanings, and some forms of public communication and to be concerned with processes, practices and patterns as well as with description, understanding, intervention and change. At Regis, a commitment to social justice and the common good underpins these central questions and concerns."  The goal of the Media & Society track is to educate and guide students so that they may be informed, ethical and creative practitioners, leaders, critics and consumers in the professions and industries of the mass media. With an emphasis on practical application through community engagement, students will have opportunities to write for the Highlander, produce a show for KRCX, or record and mix a live performance among others.   The Public Relations and Civic Engagement track seeks to provide students with the knowledge and skills required to transition from college into a business/professional environment. In alignment with the values of Regis University, the track emphasizes community engagement though volunteerism, service learning, and the Internship program. Students in the track are also exposed to ethical, values-driven theory in the Communication Theory, Persuasion and Argumentation, and Communication Ethics courses. It is the goal of the track to train students to be ethical actors in the business community and to use the skills crafted by the track to support community conscious organizations.  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG    2018-2019  194  Communication Major 39 SH Required Courses – All emphasis areas -D.

HONORS PROGRAM Dr. J. Thomas Howe, Program Director Dr. Catherine Kleier, Associate Director Dr. Lara Narcisi, Associate Directors The Honors Program at Regis College is an alternative way of meeting the College’s Core requirements. At least 27 semester 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  205  hours of honors courses substitute for a portion of the Core curriculum. The honors curriculum has two major components: a five-semester sequence of Integrative Seminars and a requirement for dedicated Core replacement courses, which can be offered by any department. The Integrative Seminars: In the honors curriculum, there is a five-course sequence that replaces standard integrative Core courses. Each seminar is organized under a broad theme that invites interdisciplinary conversation and is team taught by faculty members from different disciplines. Each seminar takes its charter from the University Mission Statement and Core Philosophy Statement, drawing course objectives and a potential reading list from the synergy between these grounding documents. Each of these courses is thematically oriented and historically recursive. Dedicated Core Replacements: All departments have an opportunity to teach an honors section of their Distributive Core courses. Each of these honors offerings meets certain protocols--such as expectations for greater depth or student involvement--and is approved by the Honors Advisory Council. These sections are open primarily to honors students, however, instructors have the option to allow any student to take the course.  The most accomplished students accepted into Regis College are invited each spring to make an application to participate in this more rigorous and interdisciplinary curriculum. The Honors Program is competitive and normally limited to 30 students per year. Participation in Honors also promotes integration of a student’s intellectual life with personal, community, and world experiences. All Honors students prepare a Senior Thesis so the program is especially well suited for anyone planning on graduate study or a professional program, such as law or medicine.  To be distinguished as an honors graduate, a student must maintain a 3.500 cumulative grade point average, complete at least 27 semester hours of dedicated honors courses, and complete  a Senior Thesis . Students interested in the Honors Program should contact the director to apply by April  1st of the year they intend to matriculate at Regis University. Honors scholarship consideration will be given to all honor applications received by March 15th. The honors program is open to students from every major in Regis College.  However, the Honors Program is not compatible with programs in Pharmacy or Exercise Science in Rueckert-Hartman College of Health Professions. Since these career-focused programs have their own unique core requirements tailored to meet their professional needs, students are unable to complete the Regis College honors curriculum. The nursing program poses similar challenges; however, their unique core requirements offer a bit more flexibility and occasionally nursing students will pursue the Regis College Honors Program for their first two years, then transition to nursing and RHCHP in their third year. Often these students go on to complete the disciplinary “honors in nursing” program through RHCHP.  Although the “honors in nursing” program offers a wonderful opportunity for nursing students who wish to pursue an honors track, it’s important to note that they are unable to complete the final courses and honors thesis required of Regis College Honors Program students. Therefore they are not eligible for honors scholarships.   All Honors students take a special Honors section of the following Core courses: -W. INTERNSHIP IN POLITICS AND LAW (3). Offers an opportunity for placement in a governmental organization or private institution involved in political processes.

This degree prepares students to be autonomous and Interprofessional general practitioners equipped with the necessary tools to practice physical therapy as leaders in health systems in the 21st century.  The physical therapy curriculum explores motor control and movement system as foundational principles of PT education. Students study how the components of multiple body systems (cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, integumentary, nervous and musculoskeletal) interact to produce movement and relate this knowledge to physical therapy management across the lifespan. Extensive study of the foundation sciences is incorporated into the curriculum. Within an evidenced-based practice perspective, graduates apply the most current published literature to daily clinical decisions. This model enables students to successfully link theory and application to clinical practice. Numerous faculty-facilitated, small group activities are also included in the curriculum. For example, in-depth clinical problems and issues are explored in small group tutorials offered in the Professional Issues/Case Management series of the curriculum. These tutorials serve to extend and integrate content from other courses and foster students’ ability to access and apply information. We encourage all members of the Regis community to learn proficiently, think logically and critically, identify and choose personal standards of values, and be socially responsible. We further encourage the development of skills and leadership 2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CA.  Prerequisite(s): , BIOMECHANICS OF EXERCISE LAB (1).

The MAELD program includes required credit hours for a Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education (CLDE) Endorsement (21-23 semester hours) and a LDE Certificate (12 semester hours). The Master of Arts in Education programs are designed to provide continued depth of knowledge incorporating current research and practices in the field of education for the licensed teacher.  Completion of these programs does not lead to licensure as a public school teacher in the State of Colorado with the exception of the Graduate Teacher Licensure program which does lead to teacher licensure. Please refer to that specific section in the Regis College section of this catalog for further information.  LEARNING FORMAT Courses in the MAE Program are offered in a classroom format, a synchronous format, or in an online format. All methods of delivery include online components. Synchronous format is designed for distance students to attend a classroom course in real time. Fall and spring classroom and synchronous semester courses extend for the full 16-week academic period and are scheduled in the evenings or weekends. Online only courses are 8-weeks in duration. Two 8-week courses may be taken back to back in one semester. Most summer semester courses are offered in concentrated blocks.  FACULTY The MAE Program is distinguished by a faculty drawn largely from the ranks of practicing education professionals. The program’s fundamental instructional philosophy is that eminently qualified master teachers practicing constructivist learning theory in classrooms are actively involved in the program as instructors.

CERTIFICATE IN HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY   Patient outcomes have been measured in various ways since the late 1800s, but it was not until the 1970s that health care organizations began employing quality assurance nurses. Health care organizations have responded throughout the years by establishing quality and patient safety departments within their organizations. In the past, direction for quality programs was based on requirements of accrediting bodies such as the Joint Commission. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report focusing on the safety of patients in the U.S. health care system. This report triggered a number of actions including the 100K Lives Campaign, public reporting of health outcomes, pay for performance initiatives, and the National Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, which encourages voluntary reporting of adverse events. Reporting of health outcomes by health care agencies and other organizations has created an environment of transparency for health care organizations. The public can now access and compare hospitals on mortality rates, infection rates, how many complaints a hospital or nursing home has had, and much more.  The core of this certificate is comprised of four courses. Students who do not have at least two years of health care experience in a hospital or appropriate setting or basic knowledge or experience using quality improvement tools may also be required to take "

In 2002, the Loretto Heights School of Nursing decided to maintain a single accreditation--with AACN- CCNE -- and discontinued accreditation with NLNAC.   In 2017, the Loretto Heights School of Nursing received full ten-year accreditation for its Bachelor of Science in Nursing,  Master of Science in Nursing, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse and The Doctor of Nursing Practice  programs from CCNE.   All nursing curricula are designed to educate students in the art and science of nursing. Leadership skill development is promoted with a special emphasis on developing critical thinking, ethical decision making, and a commitment to social justice.   BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING (BSN)  The Loretto Heights School of Nursing offers the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) in different scheduling formats in order to meet the needs of a variety of student populations seeking their BSN. The Traditional Nursing Program offers the undergraduate curriculum according to a traditional academic fall through spring schedule. The Accelerated Nursing Program is available to serve the adult with a previous non-nursing baccalaureate degree who desires a degree in nursing. The Connecting Healthcare Occupations with Innovative Curriculum and Experience (CHOICE) Nursing Program offers the BSN with flexible schedules accommodating individuals who work in health care. Programs are also offered for registered nurses (RNs) wishing to earn BSN. The RN-BSN Program is delivered in a blended format or an online format. The RN to MS Nursing Program offers RNs both the BSN degree and the Master of Science degree (Leadership in Health Care Systems specialization) in a single program.   MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN NURSING (MS)  The Master of Science degree in Nursing prepares registered nurses for a number of different specializations at the graduate level. Master’s students in the Leadership in Health Care Systems specialization choose either a management or an education focus.

APPEALS OF DISPUTED COURSE GRADES  Grade appeals involving an issue of academic integrity are handled by the Academic Integrity Board of Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions. The policy and procedure is delineated in the Division of Counseling and Family Therapy, Division of Health Services Education, Loretto Heights School of Nursing, School of Pharmacy and School of Physical Therapy student handbooks.  The following procedure is to be followed if students wish to protest a grade received in a course when progression is not affected.  1. All grade appeals must be initiated within four weeks after the official term end date following receipt of the grade that is being challenged.  2. The student first contacts the instructor and reviews the issues. If the grade remains in dispute the student should follow step 3.  3. The student contacts the appropriate department/ program director/chair and, in writing, protests the disputed grade. The department director/chair then follows the following procedures:   Both the student and the instructor submit written statements explaining the issue to the appropriate department director/chair. The department/program director/chair reviews all the documentation submitted to determine the validity of the challenge. The department/ program director/chair contacts the student and instructor to schedule an appointment, if necessary. The department/ program director/chair may choose to seek additional information from other sources, if indicated by the circumstances. The department/ program director/chair makes a decision about the disputed grade and conveys that decision in writing to the student and instructor. If either party wishes to contest the department director’s/chair’s decision, the dissatisfied party may appeal the decision within two weeks of receipt of the decision or solution.  NOTE: If the instructor of record is the department director/chair, a designee will be appointed.   If the student’s academic program is offered through the School of Nursing, Pharmacy, or Physical Therapy, the appeal is made to the appropriate school dean. If the academic program is offered through Counseling and Family Therapy or Health Services Education, the appeal is made to the division director. All other appeals are made to the Academic Dean of RHCHP.  The appropriate dean or division director reviews the proceedings to date, obtains any new information deemed necessary, and makes the final determination. The appropriate dean or division director notifies all parties in writing of the final decision. The decision of the school dean or division director is final. The following procedure is to be followed if students wish to protest a grade received in a course when that grade prevents the student from progressing in the program. 1. The student must contact the instructor regarding posting of a grade that affects progression within seven business days of the official term end date to review the issues. If the grade remains in dispute the student should follow step 2. 2. Within two business days of talking with the instructor, the student must initiate the formal appeal of the disputed grade by contacting the appropriate department director/chair and, in writing, protesting the disputed grade. The department director/chair then follows the following procedure:  The department director/chair arranges for a committee of three faculty members to review the case. The student and the instructor each appoint one of the three committee members. The third committee member is chosen by the other two committee members. The department director/chair participates as an ex officio member of the committee. The committee reviews evidence in any manner the REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  334  committee deems equitable. (Usually a written statement from each party that the other party can review and respond to in writing is submitted.) Oral presentations to the committee are sometimes useful. Care should be taken lest either of the parties be intimidated through oral procedure. Note: The size of the committee may vary slightly based on an individual school’s approach to the process. In all cases, the student will have the opportunity to select a committee member to participate.   If the student’s academic program is offered through a school, the committee, with the concurrence of the department director/chair, recommends a solution to the school dean, who notifies the student and the instructor of the decision in writing. The decision of the School Dean is final.  NOTE: Students should refer to their specific Student Handbook for further guidelines.   DISCIPLINARY EXPULSION  All Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions students are bound by the provisions of the Regis University Student Handbook, the Regis University Catalog, and the appropriate RHCHP school or departmental handbook, including, but not limited to, the Standards of Conduct and general University policies and regulations. Copies of the Regis University Student Handbook may be obtained in the Office of Student Life located in the Student Center or accessed online at www.regis.edu.  Procedures for reviewing violations of the University’s Standards of Conduct are outlined in the Regis University Student Handbook. Incidents of unsafe behavior or unprofessional conduct in a clinical or academic setting are also grounds for disciplinary action, including, but not limited to suspension or expulsion from the program, as set forth below. The academic dean of the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions shall have sole discretion for determining which procedure shall be used and for determining which provisions apply in individual cases.  The Provost makes the final decision regarding academic expulsion. Examples of unprofessional conduct or unsafe behavior include but are not limited to:   A pattern of unsafe clinical performance.   Inadequate development of professional behaviors.   Any action of omission or commission that results in serious injury or harm to another.   Disrespectful, abusive or dishonest interaction with patients, families, staff, faculty or peers.   Violation of a client’s right to confidentiality.  Performance of a criminal act.   Abuse of drugs or illegal use or possession of controlled substances.   Failure of a for-cause or random drug screen and/or failure to comply with a request for a for-cause or random drug screen.   Failure to follow the policies and procedures of the clinical agency.   Manipulation, alteration, removal or destruction of other student/faculty/University/clinical faculty/staff materials and/or equipment.   Unauthorized use of Regis University or clinical agency equipment inclusive of computer accounts, records, and files.   Violations of the professional standards of conduct and ethics of the profession the student is preparing to enter.   Other prohibited conduct as defined by Regis University, the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions and the school, department, or program.   Other conduct or behavior that is unprofessional or unsafe as determined by the discretion of the School or Department.  The faculty member and/or responsible supervisor making the initial judgment that a situation of unsafe behavior or unprofessional conduct in a clinical or academic setting exists shall inform the student of the charges against him/her and notify the appropriate school dean (Nursing, Pharmacy, or Physical Therapy) or division director (Counseling and Family Therapy or Health Services Education) or designee. If in the judgment of the faculty member and/or responsible supervisor the nature of the conduct or behavior warrants, the student may be suspended from the classroom or clinical area until the review process has been completed.  Following a preliminary review of the evidence available in a case, the appropriate school dean/division director or designee shall schedule a hearing with the student to review the charges. If the student fails to appear at the hearing and the failure of appearance is not excused by the school dean/division director, the charges shall be deemed to be unchallenged and the student shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing. In such cases the school dean/division director may proceed to apply such sanctions as the school dean/division director deems appropriate.  At the hearing, the school dean/division director or designee shall:  1. Provide the student with copies of all written reports regarding the circumstances and facts of the case. The student shall have an opportunity to give his/her reactions to the reports and to offer any additional information relevant to resolving the case.  2. Interview involved parties, including the student, about the facts of the case. The student shall have the right to hear any testimony related to the case that may adversely affect him/her and to question persons giving such testimony.  3. Allow the student to present witnesses on his/her own behalf and to be accompanied by one advisor who is not a party to the case. Such advisors must be members of the Regis University faculty or full-time staff.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CA"
TALOG 335,"  Following the hearing and consultations deemed necessary with program faculty or committees, the school dean/division director or designee shall make a determination of the facts of the case and sanctions if appropriate. Sanction options include, but are not limited to, expulsion or suspension from the program, probation, warnings, or failure of a course.  Notification of the results of the review by the school dean/division director or designee shall be provided in writing by regular mail to the student’s last known address as identified in the records of the University and to the academic dean of the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions.  The student shall have three working days from receipt of the letter to appeal the decision of the school dean/division director to the academic dean. Notification of the results of the review by the academic dean shall be provided in writing by mail to the student with a copy to the school dean, division director or designee. The decision of the academic dean is final.   ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES   DEFINITIONS  Academic probation is an official sanction that is applied when a student fails below the minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average for the program. Academic probation may also be applied for violations of the academic integrity policy. Academic suspension is an official sanction that is applied when a student on academic probation fails to achieve the required minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average or other conditions established under their probation. Academic suspension may also be applied for violations of the Academic Integrity Policy.   UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS   Good Standing  Students at Regis University must maintain at least a 2.000 (“C”) cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted. A grade of “C-” or higher is required for upper division courses in the major or minor area to be counted as work toward the major or minor. A grade of “C-” or higher is required by some schools or departments for lower division major courses to be counted as work toward the major or minor.  NOTE: Undergraduate programs in the Loretto Heights School of Nursing require a grade of “C” (2.000) or higher in all nursing courses. The Health Services Education undergraduate programs require a grade of at least a “C” in all HIM and HCA courses and a cumulative GPA for progression at a 2.500.  A grade of “D” in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, those course hours may apply toward graduation.  Academic Warning  Undergraduate students in the Traditional Nursing Program whose semester grade point average falls below a 2.000 but whose cumulative grade point average remains above a 2.000 are placed on academic warning. Although academic warning indicates an academic deficiency, it is not as severe as academic probation and is not indicated on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript).   Academic Probation Students with a cumulative grade point average below a 2.00 are placed on academic probation. During the next semester of enrollment, the College expects students to raise their cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. In some instances, the academic advisor, in consultation with the department director or chair, establishes additional conditions that students must meet within a specified period of time. Failure to raise the cumulative grade point average or meet any of the specified conditions may result in suspension. Academic probation is recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript).  Occasionally a student’s Regis University cumulative grade point average is so low that it is almost mathematically impossible for the student to raise it to a 2.000 in one semester. In that situation, the department director or chair may enter into an agreement with the student to permit the student to earn a provisional grade point average for the semester. This agreed upon grade point average is set within a range that is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student in question. If the provisional grade point average is earned for the semester, but the student’s cumulative grade point average remains below a 2.000, the student may be awarded the status of Probation Continued. If the agreed upon grade point average is not achieved, the student may be suspended.  In the case of academic probation due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school or department student handbook.   Academic Suspension  Undergraduate students in the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions who have been placed on academic probation and do not achieve cumulative grade point average of 2.000 (2.5 for some programs in RHCHP) or meet those conditions established during their probation are, under ordinary circumstances, suspended. This renders students ineligible to return to Regis University for a period of 12 months.  Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped.  After one year, students may reapply for admission by submitting to the appropriate program: 1) a letter requesting readmission, explaining the causes of the earlier academic difficulties and describing how the student has overcome those difficulties; and 2) an official transcript showing at least REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  336  12 semester hours (or equivalent quarter hours) of acceptable academic coursework completed at another regionally accredited college or university.  In the case of academic suspension due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school or department student handbook.   GRADUATE STUDENTS  MASTER’S PROGRAMS AND DOCTOR OF NURSING PRACTICE   Academic Probation  Students must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.000 to graduate. If a student’s grade point average falls below 3.000 in the program, the student is placed on academic probation. Students placed on academic probation have one semester to raise their grade point average to a 3.000. In the case of academic probation due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school or department student handbook.   Academic Suspension and Dismissal: Master’s Students Students who fail to raise the cumulative grade point average to 3.000 are suspended. In addition, students who receive a grade of “C” in two courses at the 600 level are subject to academic review and may be suspended from the program.  Suspension may be appealed to the department director or school dean. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class.  Masters students earning a letter grade of C- or below (course failure) are eligible to repeat the course for a minimum letter grade of “C” to maintain eligibility to progress in the graduate program pending program director approval.     Master’s students in Leadership who receive two course failures (C- or lower) as initial grades in any course will be dismissed from the program.  Nurse practitioner students (NNP and FNP) who receive two course failures (C- or lower) as initial grades in any course will be dismissed from the program.   See the Division of Counseling and Family Therapy for minimum grade requirements for that Division.  Academic Suspension and Dismissal: Doctor of Nursing Practice Students  Students who fail to raise the cumulative grade point average to 3.000 are suspended. In addition, students who receive a grade of “B- or below” in two courses at the 700 level are subject to academic review and may be suspended or dismissed from the program.  Suspension may be appealed to the department director or school dean. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class.  Students earning a letter grade of B- or below are eligible to repeat the course for a minimum letter grade of “B” to maintain eligibility to progress in the graduate program pending program director approval. DOCTOR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY  Students are notified of a change in academic status in writing from the  program director or school dean, but failure to provide or receive the notice does not invalidate the action taken.   Academic Probation  When the cumulative grade point average of a student in the Doctor of Physical Therapy program falls below 3.00, the student is placed on academic probation. A student is allowed a maximum of two probation semesters during the length of the program. The School of Physical Therapy’s expectation is that the student will make every effort to raise his/her cumulative GPA to 3.00 in the first probationary semester in order to return to good academic standing. If when on probation it is not possible to raise the cumulative GPA to a 3.00, the student will be suspended from the program (see section on Academic Suspension). A student on academic probation is not allowed to participate in clinical education experiences. Academic Probation is noted on the permanent academic record (transcript).  In the case of academic probation due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school student handbook.   Academic Suspension  A student is suspended from the Doctor of Physical Therapy program if he/she fails to complete necessary remediation to a satisfactory level in the subsequent semester of receiving a “C” or “C-.” A student who receives a grade lower than a “C-” in a course is suspended from the program. In addition, if a student’s cumulative grade point average is less than 3.000 for more than two semesters, he/she is suspended from the program. Academic suspension renders the student ineligible to participate in the School’s academic activities including academic coursework, clinical coursework, and project coursework for the remaining sequence of course offerings with the student’s respective class. The student may apply for consideration of readmission to the program for the following academic year. Academic Suspension is noted on the permanent academic record (transcript).  In the case of academic suspension due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school student handbook.   DOCTOR OF PHARMACY  Policies related to Academic Probation and Academic Suspension for students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program are available to pharmacy students in the School of Pharmacy Student Handbook.   2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CA"
TALOG 337,"  UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE   Academic Dismissal  Academic dismissal is action taken by the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions that renders a student ineligible to return to the College for any program of study. Academic dismissal may be imposed for serious violations of academic integrity or failure to meet the conditions of a prior academic suspension. In the case of a serious violation of academic integrity, a student may be dismissed following a first offense. In the case of academic suspension for grade point average, a student must have been suspended for low cumulative grade point average, been readmitted to the program on academic probation, and subsequently failed to achieve the required cumulative grade point average. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).   Academic Suspension/Dismissal Appeal Procedure  Upon being notified in writing of suspension or dismissal due to a low grade point average, students who wish to appeal the decision should do the following:  1. Write a letter of appeal to the school dean/division director of the appropriate school/division within deadline stated on the letter of notification. This letter of appeal should include:  a. The student’s honest and straight-forward assessment of how the academic problems came about. b.  Why the student failed to achieve the required grade point average. Were there, for example, any extenuating circumstances beyond the student’s control? c. Why the student should not be suspended from the program or dismissed from the University. d. Some indication that the student is ready to continue serious academic work. e. The names of the student’s advisor or faculty members from whom supporting statements may be solicited by the student. 2. Collect supporting statements from advisor, faculty members, or external medical provider as appropriate who are willing to support the appeal and submit these statements with letter of appeal by the designated deadline.  The school dean/division director is interested in any pertinent information that has genuine bearing on the matter. The focus is on why the student failed to reach his/her academic goals and why the student should be allowed to continue studies at Regis University.  The school dean/division director reviews all materials submitted by the student and, if appropriate, forwards them to the designated faculty committee within the program. The school dean/ division director notifies the student in writing of the final decision regarding the student’s appeal.  In the case of academic suspension or academic dismissal due to violations of academic integrity, appeals are handled by the Academic Integrity Board for the Rueckert-Hartman College of Health Professions. The specific policy and procedure for appeals of sanctions related to academic integrity are delineated in the school/ departmental handbooks within the Academic Integrity Policy.

RUECKERT-HARTMAN COLLEGE FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS NON-DEGREE OFFERINGS   HEALTH CARE ETHICS Health care ethics is an integral component of an education within the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions. The Division of Health Services Education offers courses in Health Care Ethics These courses are dedicated to the mission of fostering moral awareness and ethical action in health care practice and leadership. The mission is accomplished through rigorous academic courses, faculty research and scholarship, and outreach services to the local health care community. Members of the faculty are knowledgeable in clinical, professional and organizational ethics, as well as health care public policy, with special attention to the Catholic moral tradition and conceptions of Catholic social justice.  Drawing on the larger mission and values of the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions and the heart of our Jesuit heritage, Health Care Ethics promotes deep individual reflection and an informed civil discourse based on the following core values:   Respect for the life and dignity of the human person   Intellectual rigor and humility in the face of complex issues   Responsibility of the individual to act with an informed conscience   Commitment to the common good, with particular care for those who are poor and marginalized.  Our core values guide the education we provide in preparing health professionals for the ethical challenges they will face. Learners and facilitators are thereby encouraged to develop an informed understanding of their own moral foundations in an atmosphere of mutual support and encouragement, honoring the Regis University commitment to the question “How ought we to live?”  The truly important ethical issues in today’s health care arise all along the continuum from bedside to boardroom to public policy debate.  Professionals in the health care industry are faced with a range of complex issues and ethical dilemmas related to specific clinical situations, the conduct of health care organizations, and the demands of a professional role.  Courses at both the graduate and undergraduate levels present a variety of classical and contemporary ethical perspectives along with models for ethical decision-making. Students explore a wide range of contemporary issues in bioethics, including those occurring at the beginning and end of life, dilemmas in everyday practice, and the many questions surrounding emerging health care technologies. They also consider ethical dilemmas that organizations often face including conflict of interest and public accountability. Finally, students consider many of the challenges inherent in the health care policy arena including issues of social justice and the realities of limited health care resources. Students develop an enhanced sensitivity to the role of social, cultural, and faith-based influences in the delivery of health care.  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  342  DIVISION OF COUNSELING AND FAMILY THERAPY  The following includes a list of division options:  Master of Arts in Counseling: Clinical Mental Health Counseling  Master of Arts in Marriage and Family Therapy  Post-Graduate Academic Certificate in Marriage and Family Therapy  Post-Graduate Academic Certificate in Counseling Children and Adolescents   Post-Graduate Academic Certificate in Counseling Military Families   Post-Graduate Academic Certificate in Depth Psychotherapy Students must be admitted to the Master of Arts in Counseling or the Master of Arts in Marriage and Family Therapy or a Post-Masters Certificate Program and meet course prerequisites in order to enroll in courses with the MCPY, MFT, or CFT prefix.

LORETTO HEIGHTS SCHOOL OF NURSING   BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING Within the framework of the mission and goals of the University, the undergraduate programs in the Loretto Heights School of Nursing (LHSON) have as their dominant focus a holistic, individualized, and humanistic approach to the individual, family, and community. The curriculum is organized to focus on critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and social responsibility. Upon successful completion of the undergraduate program, each graduate receives the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree which prepares students for professional practice in a variety of health care agencies and for graduate study. Graduates are eligible to take the state board licensure examination in any state.   Traditional Nursing Program  The Traditional Nursing Program extends over four academic years. The upper division nursing courses are based on the humanities, behavioral science, and natural science courses taken in the freshman and sophomore years. Clinical experiences and service learning augment classroom and skills and simulation laboratory learning experiences. Because the nursing curriculum is structured sequentially, failure to complete a course successfully may require students to wait a full year to repeat coursework and reenter the sequence.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CA"
TALOG 351,"  Accelerated Nursing Program  The Accelerated Nursing Program is designed to meet the needs of individuals who are seeking a second degree and/or wish to make a career change. Accelerated students complete their nursing coursework in approximately 12 months. Clinical experiences and service learning augment classroom and skills and simulation laboratory learning experiences. To be accepted into the Accelerated Nursing Program, students must have a previously earned non-nursing baccalaureate and/or graduate degree and have met the criteria for acceptance into the undergraduate program in Nursing, including completion of all necessary prerequisites. Since the Accelerated Nursing Program is intense and fast-paced, it is strongly recommended that students not be employed.   CHOICE Nursing Program  The CHOICE (Connecting Health Occupations with Innovative Curriculum and Experience) Nursing Program provides health care workers with the opportunity to pursue a nursing degree while maintaining full-time employment. The CHOICE Nursing Program offers evening classes, with clinical rotations scheduled primarily on the weekend. The program requirements are the same as those for the other prelicensure programs, and prerequisite course requirements must be met prior to beginning the program. Clinical experiences and service learning augment classroom and skills and simulation laboratory experiences.  The program is completed within two years (six consecutive semesters).While CHOICE is designed for health care workers, applicants who do not currently work in the health care industry may apply, pending space availability.   RN-BSN Program  Acceptance into the undergraduate nursing BSN degree completion program requires a current unrestricted or unencumbered professional RN license in the state in which the student’s clinical/practicum experience will be completed. One year of experience in nursing practice as a Registered Nurse is recommended.  Coursework in this program is provided in either an eight-week or five-week accelerated format and delivered both online and in a blended format. Practicum experiences and service learning augment online and campus-based learning experiences. The length of time to complete the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree depends upon the academic background of the individual RN student and the option chosen for coursework but generally takes 16 to 22 months.  All requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree are completed through enrollment in Regis University classes, transfer credits, and/or examination. A minimum of 30 semester hours must be completed through Regis University. The University grants credit by examination to individuals who have developed college-level knowledge outside the formal classroom situation and can successfully demonstrate the knowledge.  The LHSON fully supports the Colorado Nursing Articulation Model. This model permits nurses who are graduates of diploma programs and some associate degree programs to enter the program without testing and receive up to 33 semester hours of credit for prior learning. Certain restrictions apply and applicants are advised to consult with the RN-BSN Program admission counselor.   Applicants with an Associate’s Degree in Nursing – Block Transfer Applicants with an Associate’s Degree in nursing from accredited programs, meeting requirements, are eligible to receive a minimum of 66 semester hours of credit from their previous ADN program as a block transfer if they meet the following requirements: 1. Completion of an ADN program at a regionally accredited institution; 2. Completion of an ADN program consisting of at least 66 semester hours; and 3. Licensure as a registered nurse who passed the N-CLEX national examination. In addition to the block transfer of at least 66 credits, students also must complete: 1. 27 semester hours of upper division nursing courses and 3 semester hours of Health Care Ethics at Regis; 2. Regis core studies requirements comprised of 3 semester hours of philosophy and 6 semester hours of religious studies;  3. 3 semester hours of statistics;  4. 6 semester hours of upper division electives; and 5. Up to 6 semester hours of general electives.  Students are advised to choose electives from the liberal arts and humanities.  This coursework meets the 120 semester hour total required for the award of Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree.   Challenge Examinations  Predominately two types of examinations are available for RN students to challenge selected lower division (freshman and sophomore level) courses. These include the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests and the DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST). A third testing option is available for RN students to earn credit in nutrition, anatomy and physiology, and microbiology by taking the National League for Nursing (NLN) exams.  It is important for students currently enrolled in the LHSON RN-BSN or RN to MS Nursing Programs to note that the NLN exam is the only one of the three challenge examinations that meets the semester hour requirements for nutrition (3), anatomy and physiology (8), and/or microbiology (4).  The courses and sequence of courses for the RN-BSN and RN to MS Nursing Programs differ from those in the prelicensure (Traditional, Accelerated, and CHOICE) Nursing Programs. Nevertheless, all Regis University LHSON students meet the same outcomes in order to earn the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree.   REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  352  Dual Enrollment The Loretto Heights School of Nursing has some agreements in place with community colleges to offer a dual enrollment program between the associate degree and the bachelor’s degree.  These dual enrollment programs allow an ADN student to start BSN course work prior to completion of the ADN program and prior to obtaining an RN license, typically the last year of the ADN program.  Students should inquire about this option.   RN to MS Nursing Program  The RN to MS Nursing Program is designed to meet the needs of registered nurses who want to earn both a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and a Master of Science degree in Nursing. The program offers online and/or blended classes in an eight-week accelerated format. Practicum experiences and service learning augment course work.  All requirements for the BSN are completed for the RN-BSN Program with the exception of three courses which are completed at the graduate level (from the MS degree in Nursing). Leadership in Health Care Systems is the specialization of the graduate portion of the program. Students focus either on management or education in this portion of the program.   UNDERGRADUATE NURSING ADMISSION  High School Graduates Prospective freshmen who wish to apply to the Traditional BSN program and to be eligible for Guaranteed Admission should complete the following requirements:  Complete the Regis Freshman Application or The Common Application. Regis University accepts the Common Application in lieu of its own application and gives equal consideration to both.  Failure to answer the Felony/Misdemeanor question will stop the processing of the application/enrollment to Regis University. If convicted of a felony or misdemeanor, a background check may be required.  Applicants should request that official high school transcripts be forwarded to Regis University's Office of Admissions. (Transcripts must be official and may not be stamped Student Copy.)  High school seniors should have their official ACT and/or SAT test results forwarded to the Office of Admissions from their high school or testing agency.

NR 410," Introduction to the Profession of Nursing course with a passing grade on the first attempt. Passing grade is “C” or above. Students who fail to complete  with a grade of “C” or above are ineligible for Guaranteed Admission.  Students have one opportunity to earn Guaranteed Admission. Students who do not successfully complete the Guaranteed Admission requirements, or maintain the conditions of eligibility, will forfeit the opportunity to be considered for Guaranteed Admission in the future.  Only new freshman entering Regis College are eligible for Guaranteed Admission consideration. Transfer students are ineligible.   Due to the insufficient course offerings available in the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies, particularly related to science offerings, students enrolled in a College of Contemporary Liberal Studies program are not eligible for Guaranteed Admission. Procedures: 1. All pre-nursing students must meet with the pre-professional advisor to sign the Guaranteed Admission Policy Agreement at the time of matriculation. 2. Evaluation for Guaranteed Admission occurs after fall semester of the students’ eligibility year (fall semester, sophomore year).  Students earning progression are admitted conditionally, pending successful completion of the pre-nursing curriculum requirements consistent with Guaranteed Admission eligibility requirements.  Admitted students are re-evaluated at the completion of the fourth term (spring semester, sophomore year) to ensure eligibility. 3. Students not meeting Guaranteed Admission eligibility at the end of their third semester (fall semester, sophomore year) must submit additional application materials and are competitively evaluated by the LHSON Student Affairs Committee.   4. Regis University students who request a change of major into pre-nursing must make an appointment with the pre-professional advisor to determine eligibility for the Guaranteed Admission program. There is no appeals process for students not admitted to the Traditional BSN via the Guaranteed Admission policy.

FAILURE OF AN UNDERGRADUATE NURSING COURSE  Undergraduate nursing students who fail a required course taken at Regis University:   Should contact their academic advisor and appropriate  program director regarding possible options for proceeding after a course failure.   May be allowed to repeat the course one time only with faculty recommendation and the approval of the LHSON Student Affairs Committee and the appropriate program director.   May progress to another course provided the failed course is not a prerequisite course, and they have faculty recommendation and the approval of the LHSON Student Affairs Committee and the appropriate  program director.  NOTE:  Students have the right to protest a grade received in a course. See “Appeals of Disputed Grades” in the RHCHP General Information Section of this Catalog.  Any program required course taken at Regis University requires following the same process of an Academic Jeopardy and Learning Contract and will be subject to LHSON course failure policy.  Students may not progress in the program after two required course failures taken at Regis University and are therefore dismissed from the nursing program.   Learning Contracts for Remediation In the case of need for remediation of academic, clinical, and/or behavioral issues identified by a department director in consultation the appropriate program coordinator and/or course, clinical and/or clinical faculty a Remediation Learning Contract may be required of a student in order to progress in the program.  A Remediation Learning Contract is a written agreement between the student and the LHSON that details the specific activities, behaviors, and timeframes for remediation of the identified academic, clinical, and/or behavioral issues.  Additional information about the Remediation Learning Contract is found in the LHSON Student Handbook.  Violation of any term or terms of a Remediation Learning Contract may be grounds for course failure and/or dismissal from the nursing program.  UNDERGRADUATE NURSING STUDENT ADVISING  Undergraduate nursing students are assigned an academic advisor upon admission who assists them with planning their program of study.  Students and advisors discuss the terms of the program requirements at appropriate intervals during the program. Advisors counsel students on meeting the requirements for the undergraduate program; however, it is the student’s responsibility to schedule advising appointments and to complete all degree requirements.

The primary teaching strategy used throughout the curriculum is team-based learning, which is an active learning method that emphasizes student preparation and assessment both as an individual and as a member of a student team. During the curriculum, students learn how to apply fundamental principles to medication management as part of a health care team.  The School of Pharmacy program offers students experiential learning opportunities throughout the curriculum. Experiential learning opportunities are designed to allow the students to apply the knowledge gained from campus based courses in a variety of health care settings. The experiential sequence includes both introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences. The introductory experiential component consists of one semester of campus-based learning and five semesters of off-campus introductory practice experiences. The advanced experiential component requires students to complete seven, six-week experiences during the summer semester following their third year and both semesters of their fourth professional years. Participation in the experiential learning component of the program necessitates travel to various sites in the Denver metro and surrounding areas. Advanced pharmacy practice experiences are also offered (but not required) in other states within the United States, its territories and possessions. All expenses incurred during the introductory and advanced practice experiences are the responsibility of the student. During any one rotation students are given choices within a select subset of these sites.  The goal of the curriculum is found within the educational outcomes of the Regis University School of Pharmacy developed by the faculty. The educational outcomes are:  A Regis Pharmacist Must Be Knowledgeable.  Regis University School of Pharmacy must prepare students so that they know how:   to acquire and process information to solve problems efficiently;   the pharmacy profession fits into the interdisciplinary health care system;   to integrate knowledge from different scientific and academic disciplines into pharmacy practice;   the economic, psychological, social, and cultural factors affect all aspects of health care;   scientific and clinical principles dictate disease management strategies; and   the business, social and administrative aspects affect pharmacy practice.  A Regis Pharmacist Must Be Skillful.  Regis University School of Pharmacy must ensure that students will:   acquire and critically evaluate information related to patient care;   provide pharmaceutical care using evidence-based principles;   accurately communicate drug therapy information to health care professionals, patients and their caregivers;  REGIS UNIVERSITY CATALOG  2018-2019  374   be proficient in drug compounding, distribution, and administration;   demonstrate the ability to manage basic business aspects of pharmacy practice;   be able to adapt to changes in the health care system; and   collaborate with all members of the health care team.  A Regis Pharmacist Must Be Principled.  Regis University School of Pharmacy must foster students who are:   aware of his or her and others’ emotions and respond to them appropriately;   accountable to, responsible to, and respectful of others;   committed to continuous professional and personal development;   empathetic towards others;   trustworthy;   prepared for leadership roles in the profession and the community;   ethical and socially responsible;   culturally aware when interacting with others;   sensitive to issues of social justice; and   willing to accept the crucial role that pharmacists play in achieving a common good within society.  Essential Functions  In order to provide safe and effective pharmacy care, a student in the Doctor of Pharmacy program is expected to possess functional use of the senses of vision, hearing, and somatic sensation. All information received by the senses must be integrated, analyzed, and synthesized in a consistent and accurate manner. The applicant/student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Students must possess the ability to communicate in many forms, and also must have adequate psychomotor and cognitive skills and must possess the psychological ability required for utilization of their intellectual abilities.  If a student cannot meet these essential skills and abilities, it is the responsibility of the student to request appropriate accommodations. The university will provide reasonable accommodation as long as it does not fundamentally alter the nature of the program offered and does not impose an undue hardship. The details of the essential functions are found in the School of Pharmacy Student Handbook.   ADMISSION  Applicants to the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program must complete and submit their application through the PharmCAS system at www.pharmcas.org. Initial screening of PharmCAS applications is performed by the Office of Admissions. Screening is based on selection criteria designed by the School of Pharmacy faculty.

TRANSFER CREDIT  The School of Pharmacy curriculum integrates content from pharmaceutics, pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, and the biological sciences with therapeutics in the courses over the first three professional years. Since the curriculum is highly integrated, it is unlikely that a student wishing to transfer into the School of Pharmacy during the first three professional years will be able to do so without difficulty (e.g. not having adequate background in the pharmaceutical sciences or therapeutics). However, requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.   DEGREE AWARD  Students graduate in the semester that all requirements are met and documentation of such is received by the Office of Academic Records and Registration. Incomplete grades and late application for graduation may delay graduation to a subsequent semester. The Doctor of Pharmacy degree will be conferred to a student when he/she has satisfactorily completed all required academic and experiential course work, met the School of Pharmacy educational outcomes, and demonstrated behaviors consistent with the pharmacy profession.  It is the student’s responsibility to read and understand all policies and requirements of the School of Pharmacy and the University. It is also the student’s responsibility to maintain personal records of course work applicable to the degree such as elective courses.

TALOG 381,"  abilities necessary for distinguished professional work and contributions to the improvement and transformation of the physical therapy profession.  During clinical experiences, students have the opportunity to integrate knowledge gained from courses and to refine their skills in examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention, outcomes, and communication with diverse populations. Participation in clinical experiences within the program necessitates travel to various sites outside the Denver area and across the country. All expenses incurred during the clinical experiences are the responsibility of the student. Students are required to participate in a minimum of one rural experience and one out-of-state experience to facilitate an appreciation of various practice settings. Currently, the School of Physical Therapy is affiliated with more than 400 clinical sites throughout the country, as well as select international experiences. For each clinical experience students are given choices within a subset of these sites.  Graduation requirements include completion of a scholarly project and a capstone portfolio. Upon successful completion of the program, graduates are awarded a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree, making them eligible to take the physical therapy licensure examination in any U.S. jurisdiction.   ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS   The intent of the entry-level physical therapy program is to educate competent physical therapists who can examine, evaluate, diagnose, and establish interventions for the general population of acute, rehabilitation and chronic patients/clients in health care settings. The observational, cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills deemed essential to complete this program and to perform as a competent practitioner of physical therapy are located in the School of Physical Therapy Student Handbook. If a student cannot meet these essential skills and abilities, it is the responsibility of the student to request an appropriate accommodation. The university will provide reasonable accommodation as long as it does not fundamentally alter the nature of the program offered and does not impose an undue hardship.   ADMISSION  All applicants will apply for admission to the Doctor of Physical Therapy professional entry program through the Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service (PTCAS) [PTCAS c/o Liaison International, 311 Arsenal St., Suite 15, Watertown, MA  02471].

Computer Literacy  Students are required to be computer literate prior to entering the program. Necessary skills include proficiency in several computer applications such as Microsoft Office or similar Google apps. Students are also expected to be comfortable navigating web pages using common Internet browsers, attaching documents to emails, and participating in online discussion forums as required by specific courses within the program. Prior knowledge in SPSS statistical software is highly recommended.  All students undertaking the Doctor of Physical Therapy program must have ready access to a computer system compliant with RHCHP systems requirements and configuration for the online learning management system that is used to augment classroom-based courses. See Student Handbook and University website for specific details.  Students are also required to have a laptop or tablet, and a smartphone.  NOTE: High speed broadband (cable or DSL) or wireless Internet access at home and while on clinical rotations is required so that students can access multimedia files through the University systems throughout the entire program. All students/faculty/staff electronic communication is accomplished through an issued RegisNET email account. Class notes, routine school communication, and class scheduling are examples of critical information that students will access daily through the RegisNET account. The University has several computer labs on campus that students may use, however, access from home and clinical rotation housing is essential. Consult the school website for further information on system requirements and configurations at www.regis.edu.   ADVISING   An academic faculty advisor is assigned to all entering DPTadvisor students. Advisors counsel students on meeting requirements for the graduate program and provide guidance and support for progression throughout the program as necessary. Students are required to meet with their advisors a minimum of one time per semester to facilitate ongoing dialogue and development of professional behaviors, complete portfolio requirements, and graduation criteria throughout their studies. Each DPT student is also assigned a clinical educator for guidance in selecting and completing clinical education experiences, and a research advisor for completion of a scholarly project.   PROGRAM PROGRESSION   A student needs a minimum grade of “C+” or better in each course in order to progress in the Physical Therapy program. If a grade of “C” or “C-” is received in any of the course requirements, the student must remediate the course within the following semester in order to progress (for specifics, see Remediation). Students may participate in clinical education rotations during semester IV while remediating a grade of “C” or “C-”.  DPT students may not participate in any subsequent clinical education experience until remediation of a grade of “C” or “C-” in a previous semester course is completed. It should be noted that failure to participate in a clinical education experience may limit a student’s ability to continue participation in the program with their original cohort. As DPT courses are offered once a year, a student may be required to delay progression for a full academic year to complete a required course.   ADD/DROP  Students follow the add/drop policy dates published in the General Information section of this Catalog. Requests to drop a course require the signature of the program director. Students who drop a course must understand that this jeopardizes their ability to continue in the program.  2018-2019  REGIS UNIVERSITY CA"
TALOG 383,"  REMEDIATION   A grade of “C” or “C-” for a course must be remediated. The initial grade will be changed to a “C+” following successful remediation of the “C” or “C-” grade. Grades of “D” or “F” for a course cannot be remediated. Refer to the RHCHP Graduate Academic Suspension section in this Catalog for consequences. The process of remediation begins the first week of the semester following receipt of a grade of “C” or “C-”. During this week, a remediation contract with input from the student and instructor is developed that outlines format, content and evaluation method for the remediation. This contract is finalized and signed by the student, instructor, and program director.  The agreed upon remediation must be successfully completed by the end of the semester following the semester in which the unsatisfactory grade was received. Failure to successfully complete the remediation process by this time cancels the student’s ability to participate in a clinical education experience. An exception to this policy is available during semester IV. Students may participate in "
DPT 750,"--Clinical Education I while remediating a “C” or “C-” grade. Students may not participate in any subsequent clinical education rotations until remediation for a “C” or “C-” in a previous semester course is completed.  Students should be aware that completion of a remediation must occur at least nine days prior to the start of the clinical education rotation. It should again be noted that failure to participate in a clinical education experience may limit a student’s ability to progress through the remainder of the curriculum.  Students should refer to Program Progression for specific consequences for not completing a remediation successfully or on time. If the initial remediation is not successful, one more remediation is allowed as long as time still allows within the designated remediation contract date. If remediation attempts continue beyond the contract date (in cases of subsequent clinical rotations) or end of semester, this may also necessitate stopping out until the next academic year. If this remediation is not successful, the student is considered to have an unremediated “C” or “C-” and is suspended from the program.   PROBATION/SUSPENSION/DISMISSAL See details within the RHCHP Graduate Academic Standing and Penalty section of this Catalog and the School of Physical Therapy Student Handbook.   COURSE OVERLOAD  A student may participate in independent study as a course overload for any term with the permission of the faculty of record, the advisor and the program director.   TRANSFER CREDIT  Transfer credit from other health professions education programs to the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program will be considered for each individual student request.  Courses under consideration for transfer must be graduate-level and must have been taken within the past three years in a ground-based format. The school dean and director of graduate studies will evaluate the syllabus from each requested course for equivalency of course content and rigor.  Credit hours earned with grades of “B-” or better (grades of C+ or below are not acceptable) at an accredited institution of higher education prior to admission to the Regis University School of Physical Therapy  may be transferred based on equivalency review.  Credit hours are transferred, but quality points are not. The grade-point average of the student will be determined only by work done at Regis University.  GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS  Students must meet the following criteria to be awarded the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree:   Satisfactory completion of required academic and clinical coursework.   Cumulative GPA of 3.000 and a minimum of “C+” in each course.   Satisfactory completion of a scholarly project.   Satisfactory completion of a comprehensive examination.   Satisfactory completion of a capstone project.   Successful progression in professional behaviors, including required membership in and attendance at APTA activities.  Recommendation for the degree by the faculty of the School of Physical Therapy.  It is the student’s responsibility to read and understand all policies and requirements of the School and the University. It is also the student’s responsibility to maintain personal records of coursework applicable to the degree.
