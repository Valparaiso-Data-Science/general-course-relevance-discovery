In the book of John, Jesus told his followers, “I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father” (John 14:12, NIV). Maybe you have some questions about what Jesus’ words mean. Perhaps you doubt whether He could have meant them for you. Many people have dreams, but aren’t sure how to make that dream a reality, or how to persevere through the obstacles. But I like what Dr. Bruce Wilkinson said in his book, The Dream Giver, “Great things aren't the legacy of unusually gifted Great Men and Women. Great things are what you will accomplish when you put God first and make Him owner of all you care about most.” Whether you are in full pursuit of God’s calling in your life, or in the process of discovering His plans for your life, you have come to the right place! Put God first, keep God first, and see what happens! Please take some time and browse through this catalog and our website at www.macu.edu to discover the range of programs we offer recent high school graduates, commuting daytime students, and busy adults pursuing degrees online and through accelerated evening classes.  Our programs will help you grow in the knowledge of your discipline, your devotion to God, and your service to others. I hope you’ll join us. Let us encourage and inspire you, and prepare you to dream bigger and do greater. God bless you,   John Fozard President   Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  7 GENERAL INFORMATION   University Accreditation and Affiliations The University is a recognized institution of higher education with the credentials of accreditation listed below.

Transfer students who enter the University with an Associate of Arts or an Associate of Science from a regionally accredited institution are considered to have met the lower-division (1000- and 2000-level) course requirements of the University’s General Education core curriculum. However, these students are still required to complete any lower-division coursework that is required beyond the University’s lower-division General Education course requirements, as well as the upper-division (including General Education) course requirements for a degree.  5. Transfer credit will be entered on the student’s record upon receipt of all official transcript for all post-secondary institutions attended and successful completion of twelve (12) credit hours at Mid-America Christian University.   Residency Requirements Academic residency requirement refers to the maximum allowable transfer credit for each degree type. The credit hour residency requirement indicates the number of credits you must complete through the University in order to graduate. It does not mean that you must physically come to the University or attend courses at any physical location.  MACU’s academic schools may establish program specific residency requirements that are higher than the University residency requirements, but they may not have a residency requirement that is lower than the University standard.  Academic Residency Requirement • All degree programs that have a capstone / practicum / internship requirement must have that requirement fulfilled by Mid-America Christian University credit.  The requirement cannot be fulfilled via transfer credit unless there is approval from the dean.  Credit Hour Residency Requirements • Non-degree certificate students, at least 50% of the credits required for an undergraduate or a graduate certificate must be earned at MACU. Application of any transferred credits is at the discretion of the school chair or registrar. • Associate degree programs have credit residency requirements of 15 credit hours earned at MACU that apply to the associate program. • Bachelor degree programs have credit residency requirements of 30 credit hours earned at MACU that apply to the bachelor program. 15 of the final 30 hours or 50 percent of the major are also required in residence. • Graduate degree programs have credit residency requirements of at least 24 credit hours earned at MACU that apply to the program of study. All transfer credit must be approved by the school chair.  Note: Residency credit hours may also include non-collegiate learning credit (see Non-Collegiate Learning Credit). Non-Collegiate Learning Credit Mid-America Christian University encourages capable students to seek college credit for knowledge they may have acquired in a variety of ways.  The University will award credit based on the following measures of non-collegiate learning: proficiency exams (CLEP, AP, DSST (DANTES), departmental exams); formal non-collegiate coursework for which credit recommendations have been established by NCCRS (National College Credit Recommendation Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  34 Service, formerly National PONSI); military educational experiences recommended for credit by ACE; and credit by demonstrated competency (CDC).  Advanced standing credit for non-collegiate learning must be validated by successful completion of 12 hours before being placed on the student’s transcript.  Mid-America Christian University will only award this credit as it applies to the degree programs. Advanced placement credit will be recorded on the official transcript without grade equivalent or inclusion in the CGPA.  Academic credit awarded by Mid-America Christian University is considered resident credit. If a student achieves advanced credit for any course in which he/she is currently enrolled, there will be no refund of tuition or fees refunded for that course, even if the student drops/withdraws from the enrollment of the class.  Mid-America Christian University recognizes that non-collegiate learning may have been awarded on another institution’s transcript.  The University will accept this type of credit as credit earned from that institution as long as they are regionally accredited.  All non-collegiate credit evaluated and accepted by Mid-America Christian University will not be included in the CGPA and transcribed as credit earned “CR” and not awarded a letter grade. ACT Assessment of Advanced Credit Mid-America Christian University will award advanced placement credit to the student whose ACT scores equal or exceed the following:   ENGL  1103 English Comp  28   3 hrs. of credit      MATH  1103  Math             28   3 hrs. of credit Advanced Placement Program (AP) Reviews and decisions about the granting of academic credit for courses for which a student has made an appropriate score are the privilege of Mid-America Christian University.  A score of three (3) or better must be achieved in order for credit to be considered.  Information regarding advance placement credit is located in the Office of the Registrar.  The maximum number of credit hours available through AP exams is established at 30, this is in combination with credit from other ACE (military), DSST, and CLEP credit.  This maximum credit does not include credit awarded through CDC or ACT evaluations. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) All entering students are encouraged to take the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) of the College Board.  This is the most extensive program of testing for college credit in the United States.  CLEP enables the student to demonstrate the level of knowledge gained outside the formal educational settings or in high school and provides the University with the information needed to determine if credit is to be awarded and how much credit to award.  Advance credit will not be given for "

The University will not permit drugs or alcohol use on its property or while acting in a capacity representing the University.  This policy applies to all property (both the interior and exterior of such property) owned, operated, or managed by the University, including all buildings, facilities and grounds.  Such premises include, but are not limited to University housing, athletic facilities, parking lots, offices, classrooms, restrooms, hallways, stairwells, drive ways, sidewalks and lawns.  This policy also applies to vehicles owned or leased by the University or under university control, as well as at any off-property university-sponsored meeting or event.     Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  10 Drug-Free School and Communities Act The Drug Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 require an institution of higher education to certify to the U.S. Department of Education by 10-1-90, that it has adopted and implemented a program to prevent the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and employees in order to remain eligible for federal financial assistance of any kind. An illicit drug is the non-medical use of a variety of drugs that are prohibited by international law. These drugs include: amphetamine- type stimulants, cannabis, cocaine, heroin and other opioids, and MDMA (ecstasy).  This policy is adopted by MACU to comply with this statutory directive and encourage a culture of compliance.  The university is committed to providing education regarding the negative impacts of illicit drug use, misuse of prescription drugs, and the excessive or illegal consumption of alcohol.     Health Risks Alcohol and other drug use represent serious threats to health and quality of life. Alcohol and other drug use increase the risk of accidents, birth defects, HIV/AIDS, and other disease. Combining drugs may lead to unpredictable effects and many prescription and nonprescription drugs are potentially addictive and dangerous. Major categories of drugs and probable effects are below.  DRUG  CATEGORY EFFECTS Alcohol Depressant Impairs judgment and coordination, and in many persons causes a greater likelihood of aggressive and/or violent behavior. Even short-term use may cause respiratory depression and, when consumed by pregnant women, may cause irreversible physical and mental abnormalities in newborns (fetal alcohol syndrome) or even death. Long-term use may lead to irreversible physical and mental impairment, including liver disease, heart disease, cancer, ulcers, gastritis, delirium tremens, and pancreatitis.  Alcohol interacts negatively with more than 150 medications. Driving while under the influence of alcohol is particularly dangerous and is a major cause of traffic-related deaths. Cocaine/Crack Stimulant Constrict blood vessels, dilate pupils, increase blood pressure, and elevate heart rate. Cocaine use may induce restlessness, irritability, anxiety, paranoia, seizures, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and death. Cocaine is extremely addictive, both psychologically and physically. Great risk exists whether cocaine is ingested by inhalation (snorting), injection, or smoking. Compulsive cocaine use may develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked and smoking crack cocaine can produce particularly aggressive paranoid behavior in users. Date Rape Drugs (Rohypnol, Rophies, Depressant May incapacitate a person, particularly when used with alcohol. Rohypnol and GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) are characterized as “date rape” drugs because they incapacitate victims, thereby increasing vulnerability to sexual assault and other crime. Sedation, relaxation, and Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  11 Roofies, GHB, Ketamine, etc.) amnesia are associated with Rohypnol use. Rohypnol may be psychologically and physically addictive and can cause death if mixed with alcohol or other depressants. GHB usage may result in coma and seizures and, when combined with methamphetamine, appears to cause an increased risk of seizure.  Combining use with other drugs such as alcohol can result in nausea and difficulty in breathing. GHB may also produce withdrawal effects, including insomnia, anxiety, tremors, and sweating. Ketamine may induce feelings of near-death experiences. Ecstasy  Stimulant & Psychedelic Its chemical structure is similar to other synthetic drugs known to cause brain damage.  Ecstasy use may cause psychological difficulties, including confusion, depression, sleep problems, drug craving, severe anxiety, paranoia, and even psychotic episodes. Similar difficulties may occur weeks after taking MDMA. Physical symptoms such as increases in heart rate and blood pressure may result from use of such substances. Other physical symptoms include muscle tension, blurred vision, nausea, rapid eyes movement, and involuntary teeth clenching.   Hallucinogens (acid, PCP, LSD, psilocybin) Hallucinogenic The most potent mood-changing chemicals and may produce unpredictable effects that may impair coordination, perception, and cognition. Some LSD users experience flashbacks, often without warning, without the user having taken the drug again. Violence, paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, convulsions, coma, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure may result from hallucinogen use. Marijuana Psychoactive Impairs memory, attention, coordination, and learning. Long-term effects of smoking marijuana  include problems with memory, learning, distorted perception, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, loss of coordination, increased heart rate, anxiety, and panic attacks. Persons who smoke marijuana regularly may have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, including daily cough and phlegm, chronic bronchitis, and more frequent chest colds. Because users of marijuana deeply inhale and hold marijuana smoke in their lungs, they incur a higher risk of getting lung cancer. Narcotics (heroin, opium, morphine, codeine, pain medications) Narcotic May produce temporary euphoria followed by depression, drowsiness, cognitive impairment and vomiting. Narcotic use may cause convulsions, coma, and death. Tolerance and dependence tend to develop rapidly. Using contaminated syringes to inject drugs may result in Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  12 contracting HIV and other infectious diseases such as hepatitis. Nicotine Stimulant Highly addictive and, according to the Surgeon General, a major cause of stroke and is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Over time, higher levels of nicotine must be consumed in order to achieve the same effect. Nicotine consumption results in central nervous system sedation and, after initial activation, may cause drowsiness and depression. If women smoke cigarettes and take oral contraceptives, they are more prone to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases than other smokers. Pregnant women who smoke cigarettes run an increased risk of having stillborn or premature infants or infants with low birth weight. Sedative-Hypnotics (depressants Quaaludes, valium, Xanax, etc.,) Depressant Depresses the central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory functions.  Sedative-hypnotic use may lower blood pressure, slow reactions, and distort reality. Convulsions, coma, and death are outcomes associated with sedative-hypnotic use. Consuming sedative-hypnotics with alcohol or 3.2 beers is especially dangerous. Steroids Hormone May permanently damage liver, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Possible side effects include liver tumors, cancer, jaundice, fluid retention, and hypertension. In men, steroids may cause shrinking of testicles; reduced sperm count, infertility, baldness, breast development, and increased risk for prostate cancer. In women, steroid use may cause growth of facial hair, male-pattern baldness, menstrual changes, enlarged clitoris, and deepened voice. Stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine, speed, chrystal, crank, caffeine, diet aids, over the counter stimulants Stimulant Are powerful central nervous system stimulants that may increase agitation, physical activity, and anxiety. Stimulants may decrease appetite, dilate pupils, and cause sleeplessness. Dizziness, higher blood pressure, paranoia, mood disturbance, hallucination, dependence, convulsions, and death due to stroke or heart failure may also result from use.  Internal Sanctions Any student or employee of the University who has violated this prohibition may be subject to disciplinary action including, but not limited to, suspension, expulsion, termination of employment, referral for prosecution and/or completion, at the individual's expense, of an appropriate rehabilitation program. All disciplinary action shall be taken in accordance with applicable policies of the University.  Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  13  ****Requirement for Notification of a Drug Conviction – Any MACU employee who is convicted under a criminal drug statue for a violation occurring in the workplace must notify the university with in five (5) working days of the conviction.  Within ten (10) working days MACU is required to notify the Department of Education, the agency from which federal funds are received of this conviction.  Within thirty (30) days MACU will take appropriate disciplinary action.    External Sanctions Local, state, and federal laws provide for a variety of legal sanctions for the unlawful possession and distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol. These sanctions include, but are not limited to, incarceration and monetary fines. Federal law provides rather severe penalties for distributing or dispensing, or possessing with the intent to distribute or dispense a controlled substance, and penalties of a less severe nature for simple possession of a controlled substance. The type and quantity of the drug, whether the convicted person has any prior convictions, and whether death or previous injury resulted from use of the drug in question (this, however, is not a factor in a case of simple possession) all affect the sentence. For example, if less than 50 kilograms of marijuana are involved and it is your first offense (no prior convictions), then you are subject to imprisonment of not more than 5 years, a fine of $250,000, or both. If however, 50-100 kilograms of marijuana are involved instead of less than 50, and all other factors are the same as in the preceding example, you are subject to imprisonment of not more than 20 years, unless death or serious injury results from the marijuana use, then you are subject to not less than 20 years or life, a fine of $1,000,000, or both. While the penalties for simple possession are less severe, the first conviction still carries a sentence of up to a year imprisonment, a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $100,000, or both. With regard to simple possession, the number of convictions makes both the minimum period of imprisonment and fines greater. Under special provisions for possession of crack, a person may be sentenced to a mandatory term of at least 5 years in prison and not more than 20 years, a fine of $250,000, or both.  Starting July 1, 2000, conviction under Federal or State law involving the possession or sale of a controlled substance shall make a student ineligible to receive any grant, loan, or work assistance beginning with the date of conviction and ending as follows:  (1) conviction for possession of a controlled substance:  first offense - 1 year; second offense - 2 years; third offense - indefinite; (2) sale of a controlled substance:  first offense - 2 years; second offense - indefinite.  Students may regain eligibility earlier than specified by satisfactorily completing a rehabilitation program or other requirement as specified in the regulations.  State Law provides similar penalties with regard to the simple possession, distribution, or possession with the intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. Simple possession of marijuana is a misdemeanor and carries a punishment of up to 1 year in the county jail. A second or subsequent conviction for simple possession of marijuana carries 2-10 years in the state penitentiary. Possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute is a felony and carries a punishment of 2 years to life in the penitentiary and a fine of up to $20,000 for the first conviction. A second or subsequent conviction carries a punishment of 4 years to life in prison and a fine of up to $40,000. Depending upon the quantity involved, a convicted individual could be sentenced under the Oklahoma “Trafficking in Illegal Drugs Act” which provides for much harsher penalties.  Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  14 On July 1 2006, the Prevention of Youth Access to Alcohol became effective.  For minors’ consuming/in possession of alcohol or 3.2 beer, the following penalties apply: • 1st violation: fines up to $300 and/or community service not to exceed 30 hours, and mandatory revocation of driver’s license for 6 months;  • 2nd violation: fines up to $600 and/or community service not to exceed 60 hours, and mandatory revocation of driver’s license for 1 year;  • 3rd violation: fines up to $900 and/or community service not to exceed 90 hours, and mandatory revocation of driver’s license for 2 years;  • All minors who violate this law are subject to drug and alcohol assessment;  • Minors who have not yet received a driver’s license will not be allowed to obtain a license for the same amount of time, as the license would have been revoked.  Courts do not excuse individuals convicted of these offenses from a prison sentence to go to college or work. A conviction for such an offense is a serious blemish on your record that could prevent you from entering many careers or obtaining certain jobs.  Further information regarding these local, state, and federal laws may be found in the MACU Public Safety Department where copies are available to MACU community and they are encouraged to review this information. The above-referenced examples of penalties and sanctions are based on the relevant laws at the time of adoption of this policy statement. Such laws are, of course, subject to revision or amendment by way of the legislative process.  To review the legal sanctions imposed under Federal Law for drug violations, please go to the following link, which includes a written description of the sanctions: http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ftp3.shtml Training The University will distribute policies and establish a training program designed to educate the  MACU community in the recognition of drug and/or alcohol abuse symptoms related to work performance in the workplace and classroom; classroom behaviors and in handling these problems in a progressive and confidential manner.  This training will occur twice year and will be conducted by certified individuals.   Drug/Alcohol Treatment Resources The University recognizes that alcoholism and drug abuse are treatable illnesses, and encourages employees and students who may have alcohol or drug abuse problems to seek treatment for them.   Employees and students with health insurance should consult their health insurance plan to determine the treatment program coverage that may be available to them.  The following support services are available:    Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Information and Referral Line 1-800-662-HELP (4357)    National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Hope Line 1-800-622-2255 24 hours a day    Reach-Out Hotline Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  15 1-800-522-9054 Alcohol, drug, domestic violence, sexual assault, rape crisis intervention and mental health referral.  Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988  In accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, the University hereby notifies all faculty, staff, administrators, and students that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited on campus.  Any campus member found to have violated this prohibition may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or be required to satisfactorily participate in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program as a condition of continued employment.  The drug abuse assistance/rehabilitation program shall be one that has been previously approved for such purposes by a federal, state, or local health, law enforcement or other appropriate agency.   The imposition of such disciplinary action or requirement to satisfactorily participate in a drug abuse assistance/rehabilitation program is premised solely upon a violation of this prohibition and does not require a criminal conviction.   Institutional Review Board Mid-America Christian University is committed to the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects in all research, class projects and relative activities. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) upholds the standards or government agencies (Federal Regulations Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, and Part 46).   A copy of these standards can be found in the University Library, the office of Academic Affairs, the Academic portal and in the Office of the Director of Institutional Effectiveness.    Title IX Confidentiality and Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC) Licensure Mid-America Christian University has adopted a mandatory reporter model for all employees of the university.  This policy is not meant to be in conflict with the legal requirements of confidentiality for licensed counselors.  For the purpose of compliance, both with Title IX and LPC Licensure laws, employees who are licensed professional counselors should view this policy as a matter of function, not legal conflict.  LPC employees are not to enter into counseling relationships with students, faculty or staff members so that they would begin to function under their license.  Such a relationship would be a conflict of interest and professional ethics for the employee.  Avoiding this conflict will protect the employee’s ability to be a mandatory reporter for Title IX violations at the university.  Should the employee sense that a conversation with a student, faculty or staff member is leading toward disclosure of a potential Title IX, the below statement should be read to the individual: As an employee of Mid-America Christian University, I am not able to enter into a confidential counseling relationship with you.  Any information that you share with me about sexual harassment discrimination, or assault may require me to report that information to the appropriate University Officer.

This mission statement reflects MACU's stable, historical philosophy of education in the enduring identity and heritage of the University. This mission guides all the purposes, goals, and activities of the University.  The mission and purposes of Mid-America Christian University affirm the basic goal to equip men and women for effective Christian ministry, providing that a person does not have to be a pastor or a missionary to have a ministry. All Christians are called to serve Christ and minister to others. Many graduates exercise this responsibility as pastors and full-time church ministers, but others are called to serve as musicians, teachers, counselors, or in other ways.  The mission statement is congruent with the objectives and purposes of the institution. It continues to be evident in practical application.  Vision Verse “Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing,  and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father." (John 14:12) Vision Statement Mid-America Christian University is “Preparing People to do Greater Things for God and His Kingdom” Dre am Bigger. Do Greater. History of the University Chartered by the state of Texas and recognized as an institution of higher education, South Texas Bible Institute opened on September 14, 1953 in Houston, Texas. Under the leadership of Dr. Max R. Gaulke, the institute’s founder and president, the institute used the facilities of the First Church of God and began its first class with 26 students.  In the fall of 1955, the curriculum was expanded to that of a four-year college and the name was changed to Gulf-Coast Bible College. In 1966, Gulf-Coast Bible College became an associate member of the American Association of Bible Colleges and was granted full membership in 1968. Ten years later, it was granted full accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In June of 1968, Gulf-Coast Bible College became a general agency of the Church of God, Anderson, Indiana. As a result of the action by the General Assembly, the College was granted representation on the Executive Council of the Church of God and full membership on the Commission on Higher Education of the Church of God. In the summer of 1985, Gulf-Coast Bible College moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and became Mid-America Bible College. Moving to Oklahoma City placed the college under a new regional accreditation body, the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2003, the college became Mid-America Christian University. Since its inception, the University has been led by four distinguished presidents: Dr. Gaulke, the University’s founder (1953 – 1975); Dr. John W. Conley (1975 – 1989); Dr. Forrest Robinson (1989 – 1999); and Dr. John D. Fozard (1999 – present). Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  20 ADMISSIONS For the kingdom of God does not mean food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit; he who thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.  Romans 14:17-18 Mid-America Christian University is committed to preparing leaders whose life, character, convictions, and gifts make them worthy ambassadors of Jesus Christ.   The University admits individuals who will profit from the educational environment that the University offers. Students should possess evidence of moral integrity, exhibit a life of sensitivity to God and their fellow students, and be regular participants in the fellowship of an evangelical church. As a condition of enrollment, all students are asked to sign a statement expressing their willingness to observe all University regulations and guidelines. Adult and graduate students, upon signing their application, declare they understand and respect the regulations of the institution.  While MACU admits students of any race, color, disability, gender, religion, and national or ethnic origin, to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school, the University reserves the right to refuse admission, continued admission or readmission to any student or prospective student who does not meet the admission qualifications for acceptance into MACU or abide by the University’s regulations and guidelines. The details of campus conduct are contained in the Student Handbook.  Students may download a copy of the handbook at www.macu.edu or on the student portal at my.macu.edu.  Admission Classifications All applications will be reviewed by the Enrollment Support Services and Registrar staff.

Probationary Acceptance — Transfer students who have an cumulative (overall college) GPA below 2.0 or who are on suspension at their most recent academic institution may be admitted under probationary acceptance. For those granted probationary acceptance, continued enrollment at MACU will depend upon their cumulative GPA during the first term of attendance. The cumulative GPA standards by class level (see Academic Probation and Suspension section below) will be applied at the end of the first term of probationary enrollment. Undergraduate students are instructed to sign and abide by an Academic Success Contract. Failure to do so may result in discontinued enrollment.  Provisional Acceptance — Applicants who fail to meet the admission requirement(s) for a given program or require readmission after suspension/dismissal may submit a written appeal to the Admissions and Retention Committee for further considerations for provisional acceptance.  If admitted via the Admissions and Retention Committee, students may have additional provisions required to ensure the best possible opportunity of academic success. Students who fail to meet those provisions outlined by the committee may be suspended from the University. Undergraduate students are instructed to sign and abide by an Academic Success Contract. Failure to do so may result in discontinued enrollment.  Conditional Acceptance — Students may submit official or unofficial transcripts that are not final transcripts for Conditional Acceptance. Students will be considered for regular or probationary admission once all official, final transcripts and test scores, as applicable by application type, have been submitted. Financial aid could be affected for students in a conditional acceptance status. MACU recommends all transcripts be submitted prior to classes beginning in order to secure accurate Title IV level funding. The Office of the Registrar must have all admission requirements prior to Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  21 the end of the student’s first term.

Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.  Luke 12:42, 43   Mid-America Christian University seeks to provide a quality education for all its students at the most reasonable cost possible.  As a private, non-profit institution, Mid-America Christian University receives no support from taxes or other public funds. Other funds are provided as gifts from churches, Church of God World Service, and concerned Christian individuals.  Tuition and Fees Expenses associated with enrollment at MACU include tuition, fees, room and board, which includes unlimited access to the dining facility from 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. each day. Please email info@macu.edu for current charges or visit www.macu.edu. Payment Payment due dates are structured according to your admitting college.  Please refer to the below for the designated due dates based on your admitting college College of Arts and Sciences Charges for a semester are due and payable by the end of the first week of the semester.  Traditional students making payment in full by the end of the first week of the semester will receive a 5% discount on the net bill.  Students not paying their account in full at the beginning of each semester will be required to sign a payment plan agreement with Accounts Receivable Clerk (CAS) in the Business Office. College of Adult and Graduate Programs Tuition and fees are due at the beginning of each course. 1. Tuition is charged by the course and not per semester.  2. Books are not included in the cost of the program.   3. One-time fees are listed in the Schedule of Situational Fees.   Late Payment Fees  All accounts that are 60 days past due may be assessed a 1% (12% APR) finance charge per month on any outstanding balance with the University. For College of Adult and Graduate Studies’ students, this charge will be implemented by the end of the second course of the current period of enrollment. Collections The University reserves the right to share delinquent account information with any appropriate companies aiding in the collection of delinquent accounts.  The companies aiding in the collection of delinquent accounts are authorized to report past due balances to the credit bureau.  Until the repayment is received from the student, the institution will prohibit the release of all academic transcripts and will report the owed payment on all requested Financial Aid Transcripts and NSLDS. Financial Aid: Scholarships, Grants and Loans Financial aid awards are based on the student's need and on the student's application for aid.  The process of applying for aid can be completed at any time.  However, some federal, institutional, and private scholarships are limited and are awarded on a first come, first-served basis.  Priority dates for individual states are published on the FAFSA website.    To apply for aid, the student should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  37  Applying for a PIN Number – www.pin.ed.gov • Can take up to 72 hours (3 Days) to receive with a valid e-mail address • Needed to sign FAFSA electronically for faster processing • Students will only need to know their personal information  Completing Your FAFSA – (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) – www.fafsa.ed.gov • MACU School Code:  006942 • You will need your PIN number • You will need a copy of your previous year’s taxes • You will need a copy of your previous year’s W2s  Aid programs exist to assist the family and the student in payment of University costs.  A maximum effort to help the student with his or her bill is expected on the part of the family.    Federal and State Financial Aid MACU participates in the following programs:  Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Federal Direct Loans, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Plus Loan, Federal Work Study (FWS), Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG), Oklahoma Tuition Equalization Grant (OTEG), and the College Challenge Access Grant Program. Applying for Federal/State Financial Aid To receive federal/state aid, the student must: 1. Be accepted as a student as defined in the University Catalog; 2. Complete an application for federal aid upon submitting your application and using our school code of 006942, the Office of Financial Aid will receive a copy.  3. Be enrolled in at least six (6) hours; 4. Maintain satisfactory progress as defined by the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy   guidelines; and 5. Not be in default on any federal student loans or owe a refund on any federal student grant Federal/state aid is determined by the student's eligibility as calculated from the information reported on the student's FAFSA.  Withdrawals and Return of Title IV Funds Upon receipt of the student’s Change of Registration Form, the Office of Financial Aid will complete a Title IV refund calculation to determine earned and unearned aid.  Note: Students may have to repay some of the financial aid funds. If the student withdraws prior to completion of at least 60% of the semester, the University is required to calculate how much of the federal financial aid was “earned” by the student and the University.  The University will be required to return to the federal aid programs a portion of funds that were used to pay tuition and fees.  By returning federal aid funds that had been used to pay the University charges, the student may then have an outstanding balance due to the University.  This balance due to the University is in addition to any federal aid that the student must repay.  Formula:  enrolled days/days in enrollment period = % of aid earned   Example:  Student withdraws on 57th day of class   57/121 = 47.1% of aid earned  52.9% of funds received by the University must be returned to the federal aid programs Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  38 The University received $3,648.61 in student aid funds as payment of tuition and fees, and must return 52.9% ($1930.11) to the federal aid programs.  Because the $3,648.61 in tuition and fee charges are not reduced (see Institutional Refund policies), the student will now owe $1,930.11 in tuition and fees to the University that were originally shown as paid by aid funds. Funds returned to the federal aid programs are applied to the aid programs in a specific order.  The order of return by the University is:  1. Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan 2. Subsidized Federal Direct Loan 3. Federal Perkins Loan 4. Federal PLUS Loan 5. Federal Pell Grant 6. Federal SEOG  7. Other Title IV Programs  If a student owes a repayment of Federal Pell grant or FSEOG funds, he cannot receive federal financial aid funds at any school until that repayment has been made. Federal educational loans (Direct Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan) are repaid by the borrower according to the terms of the promissory note. If a student fails to earn any credits for a payment period, the Financial Aid office will determine if the failed credits was earned or if the student failed to participate throughout the payment period. If the student has completed more than 60% of the payment period, all financial aid disbursed is considered to be “earned” and no return of federal aid funds is required.  If it is determined the student failed to participate through at least 60 percent of the payment period, Title IV funds must be returned to reflect the portion of the Title IV funds earned (portion of the payment period for which the student participated). The school is then responsible for returning any portion of the unearned Title IV funds to the appropriate Title IV program within 45 days. Federal Students Loans Student loans, Stafford, and parent loans (PLUS) are funds provided by the federal government which must be repaid. Different types of student loans may be available, depending on your eligibility for each. Subsidized Direct Loan  A Subsidized Direct Loan is a low interest loan based on financial need. Interest is paid by the federal government while the student is attending school at least half-time and during the six-month grace period following graduation. For details on the maximum annual loan limits, contact the Office of Financial Aid. All Subsidized Direct loans must be repaid. Unsubsidized Direct Loan Unsubsidized Federal Direct loan is a low-interest loan that is not based on financial need. If the student is not eligible for a Subsidized Direct Loan, as determined by the results of the FAFSA, an Unsubsidized Direct Loan can be an alternative. Unsubsidized means that interest will accrue while the student is enrolled in school. The student can choose to pay the interest while in school or defer the interest and have it added to the principal balance. As with the subsidized loan, repayment on the principal does not begin until six months after the student has graduated, dropped below half-time status, or withdrawn from the University. For details on the maximum annual loan limits and origination fees, contact the Office of Financial Aid. All Unsubsidized Direct loans must be repaid. Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A PLUS is available to parents who want to help their dependent children with their cost of education. Eligibility is based on credit history as determined by federal guidelines and the lending institution. The interest rate is fixed (not to exceed 9%). The maximum loan limit is not to exceed the student federal budget less any additional assistance the student may be receiving. Prior to disbursement, the lender withholds 4% Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  39 from the loan amount to cover loan origination and insurance fees. Repayment of the PLUS begins immediately after the loan is disbursed. Grants The following grants are provided by federal and state sources and do not have to be repaid. Federal Pell Grant Pell Grants are awarded by the federal government to students who are found eligible after completing the FAFSA. A Pell Grant is applied directly to your student account and does not have to be repaid. The amount is determined according to eligibility and the number of hours in which you enroll. Pell Grants are not available to students who have already completed a bachelor's degree. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) The SEOG is a federal grant administered by the University. The SEOG is applied directly to your student account and does not have to be repaid. Students who are eligible for a Pell Grant have first priority for the SEOG. Eligibility is determined by the results of the FAFSA. The amount is subject to change based on availability of funds. Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG) OTAG is a grant awarded by the State of Oklahoma. Eligibility is determined by the results of the FAFSA and by the OTAG residency requirements. OTAG is applied directly to the student's account and does not have to be repaid. The student must complete and mail the FAFSA by March 1 or earlier to be considered for OTAG. Oklahoma Tuition Equalization Grant (OTEG) OTEG is a grant awarded by the State of Oklahoma. Eligibility is determined by the results of the FAFSA and by the OTEG residency requirements. OTEG is applied directly to the student's account and does not have to be repaid.  “OK Promise” Oklahoma Higher Learning Access Program (OHLAP) OHLAP is a grant awarded by the State of Oklahoma. The student must be enrolled in the program throughout high school. Eligibility is determined by the results of the program enrollment and by the OHLAP agency requirements. OHLAP is applied directly to the student's account and does not have to be repaid. Institutional Scholarships, College of Arts and Sciences   Institutional scholarships will be given on the basis of need, academic accomplishment, or academic potential. Specific applications may be obtained from the Office of Financial Aid. Scholarships and grants will apply only to the semester of the year for which they are approved. Church or church organizations participating in the Church Matching program must send the amount to be matched by September 1st for the fall semester and January 1st for the spring semester in order for the University to match funds. Some scholarship funds are not available in the adult education programs. Scholarships are provided by private sources and by the University to qualifying students. Scholarships do not have to be repaid. To receive institutional scholarships, the student must: 1. Be accepted as a "regular" student as defined in the University Catalog; 2. Complete an application for federal aid upon submitting your application and using our school code, 006942, the Office of Financial Aid will receive a copy.  3. Be enrolled in at least 12 hours; 4. Maintain satisfactory progress as defined by the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy guidelines; and 5. Meet any specific guidelines as dictated by the individual institutional scholarship guidelines. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  40 When applying for institutional scholarships, please note that: 1. All requirements for institutional scholarships must be completed by the last day of the semester for which the scholarship was awarded. 2.

Veteran’s Benefits An eligible veteran may receive government assistance while attending Mid-America Christian University.  Information concerning the veteran's program is available from the Registrar’s Office.  Federal Work Study Program The Federal Work Study Program provides students with an opportunity to work in order to help pay for their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the Student Aid Report. On- and off-campus employment includes clerical, library, reading tutors, maintenance, cleaning, and recreational services.  Financial Policies Satisfactory Academic Progress To receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by the institution and by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, the following conditions must be met: 1. A student is eligible to receive financial aid for a total of 1.5 times the length of the academic program (i.e. student enrolled in a program that is 120 hours long can only take a maximum of 180 hours or 1.5 times the normal program length).  A less-than-full-time student must complete the program within a proportionate length of time.  All transfer hours accepted by the Registrar’s Office toward a student’s program are counted as attempted and earned.  a. Students who change their major multiple times run the risk of exceeding the 1.5 or 150% completion rule.  Once a student exceeds this rule they are no longer eligible for any kind of Federal Aid.  Determination of what classes will actually transfer for each major change will be completed by the Registrar’s Office, losing completed hours after each transfer affects the 1.5 or 150% completion rule.  Attempted hours are defined as any hour that the student has attempted without completion by either withdraw, failing, incomplete, and/or any loss of hours during a change of major. b. Students who earn one bachelor’s degree and wish to earn a second bachelor’s degree can be affected by the SAP policy.  These students will be subject to the Registrar’s Office determination of what classes and hours are accepted for this additional degree.  The additional hours required for the second degree will be added to the original length of the academic program.   Hours that are not transferred into the second degree program will still count as hours attempted, therefore, this student will be subject to the same 1.5 or 150% rule for this second bachelor’s degree and might not be eligible for Federal Aid.   2. A student must be enrolled in at least twelve (12) credit hours each semester to be eligible for institutional and institutionally-awarded private aid.   3. To maintain satisfactory progress, a student must successfully complete at least 67% of the total cumulative hours attempted.  For example, a student who attempted a cumulative total of 55 hours must have successfully completed at least 36 hours to meet the requirement (55 X .67 =36.85:  round decimals down to whole numbers. 4. Hours attempted are defined as hours for which students receive an A, B, C, D, F, W, or I on the transcript. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  42 a. Students will be reminded that withdrawals count as attempted hours.  “W’s” can adversely affect the student’s eligibility for Federal Aid.  “W’s” will be counted in the above listed 67% rule (#3) as attempted hours that are not completed. b. Students will be reminded that remedial courses, although mandatory in some cases, can affect SAP.  Remedial courses are counted in the attempted hours; however, they are not awarded hours of completion. Student’s taking remedial courses will need to be careful of the number of remedial hours attempted/completed according to the SAP policy.                         5. To maintain satisfactory progress, a student must earn the required cumulative grade point average (CGPA) each semester:   0-24 credit hours = 1.75        25 or more credit hours = 2.00     Graduate = 3.00                         6. Every student's academic progress is evaluated by the Office of Financial Aid to assess satisfactory progress according to the guidelines established by the college.  Evaluations occur after grades are posted for a period of enrollment in both CAGS and CAS programs.   7. If a student fails to complete the minimum number of hours or the minimum CGPA needed to maintain satisfactory progress, he/she will be placed on financial aid WARNING for the following full semester. The student IS eligible to receive financial aid during the warning period.  The exception to this is earning zero credits in one term results in an automatic financial aid SUSPENSION. 8. If a student does not make up their deficiencies, but does successfully complete the required 67% of the attempted hours AND achieves the required minimum GPA during their warning period, they may continue on financial aid warning and receive aid.  9. If a student fails to meet minimum satisfactory progress at the end of the warning semester, he/she will be placed on financial aid suspension and become INELIGIBLE to receive financial aid until satisfactory progress has been achieved.  The Office of Financial Aid will inform the student as to the minimum number of semester hours and the minimum CGPA that must be achieved before eligibility for further financial aid is regained. 10. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Financial Aid Committee and will be considered only under extenuating circumstances and with a written appeal.  Circumstances could include becoming very ill or severely injured, a relative dies, becomes very ill or severely injured, a mental breakdown, or proof of improved academic achievement at another school both qualitatively and quantitatively.  Institutional Refund Policy A student must officially withdraw or drop to be considered for an institutional refund.  Refunds are calculated by the Business Office upon completion of the drop or withdraw through the Registrar office.  Any fees associated with a course or program are non-refundable. College of Arts and Sciences To ensure fair and equitable refunds of unused tuition, fees, and room and board charges to students who withdraw or drop before completions of each semester, the following Institutional Refund Policies have been established according to the following withdrawal or drop deadlines.   Refund policy for 16-week classes First week ................................. 100% refund Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  43 Second week ............................... 90% refund Third week ................................. 75% refund Fourth week ................................ 50% refund Fifth week ................................... 25% refund  Refund policy for 5-week to 8-week classes  Prior to the first class ................ 100% refund Within the first week .................. 80% refund Within the second week ............. 60% refund After the second week  ................. 0% refund        Summer Institutional Refund Policy (week-long classes)  Prior to the first day of class100% refund  After the 1st Day ..................... 0% refund   Weekend Class Refund Policy  Prior to the first class .......... 100% refund  Prior to the third class .......... 50% refund  After the third class has met ... 0% refund The date of withdrawal shall be the date on which the student completes and turns in the appropriate forms for the University and not the date of last attendance unless the student never attends.  Room charges are pro-rated according to the refund policy for 16-week classes. College of Adult and Graduate Studies  A student shall normally be assessed tuition charges by the course.  When a student withdraws during a course, for any reason, the portion of the tuition considered earned by the college shall be in direct proportion to the number of sessions or fractions thereof elapsed since the beginning of the course  The tuition refund schedule based on the date of withdrawal or drop is as follows:  Refund Policy for 5-week and 8-week sessions   Prior to the first session of the coursed……….100%    Prior to the second session of the course………80%   Prior to the third session of the course…………60%   After the third session of the course, there are no refunds.              Refund policy for 2-week session                 Prior to the first session of the course………….100% refund                After the first session of the course, there are no refunds.  The date of withdrawal shall be the date on which the student completes and turns in the appropriate forms for the college and not the date of last attendance.   If a student in their first period of enrollment does not participate or attend their first course in the first two weeks, the Registrar is authorized to withdraw the student from all enrolled courses.  A student who is withdrawn from the University for this reason will be refunded 100% for the tuition and fee charges on the student’s account.  The student is responsible for book charges.   If a class is failed, the student shall be assessed the tuition again for the class when repeating the class.    Refund Policy for Financial Aid Recipients Who Withdraw Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  44 Any student receiving federal financial assistance who completely withdraws from all classes at MACU will be subject to the Return of Title IV Funds Refund Policy required by federal regulation. This policy only applies to students receiving assistance through the Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Perkins Loan, Subsidized Direct Loan, Unsubsidized Direct Loan, and Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students Programs and alternative/signature loans. This Policy assumes a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time the student remains enrolled through the semester.  Upon withdrawal, the Office of Financial Aid will determine the date of the student’s withdrawal on record in the Office of the Registrar and will calculate the amount of financial assistance the student earned while enrolled in classes according to the following formula:  number of days enrolled divided by total number of days in the semester. If the amount of federal aid disbursed exceeds the amount of federal aid earned as of the date of withdrawal, either the University, the student, or both are required to return some portion of the federal aid received.  Late disbursements for which the student is eligible are required to be included. CAS students who remain enrolled beyond the 60% of the semester are considered to have earned 100% of the financial aid received.  Students who are enrolled for less than 60% of the semester will likely be responsible for repaying a portion of the financial aid received. The Office of Financial Aid will calculate the amount of any refund due according to the Return of Title IV Funds Formula outlined in federal regulation.  Examples of this refund formula are available in the Office of Financial Aid.  Any refund amount calculated from this formula will be returned to the appropriate federal financial aid programs.  Refunds for financial aid recipients are never given directly to the student.  Calculated refund amounts are returned to the federal financial aid programs in the following order:  Unsubsidized Direct Loan, Subsidized Direct Loan, Perkins Loan, Plus Loan, Federal Pell Grant, SEOG Grant, other federal financial aid programs. Under this policy, the date of withdrawal is the date the student began the withdrawal process by contacting the MACU Office of the Registrar either in person or by phone to complete a Notice of Withdrawal form.  If a student leaves MACU without contacting the Office of the Registrar to formally withdraw, the withdrawal date will be designated as the midpoint of the semester or the last date of attendance at a documented academically related activity.  For students who fail to return from an approved leave of absence, the withdrawal date will be designated as the date the leave of absence began. Over Awards and Overpayments An over award or overpayment occurs when a student receives federal aid beyond his or her eligibility or need.  Even though great care is taken to prevent an over award/overpayment to a student, occasionally due to student or institutional error, a student may receive more federal aid than he/she is entitled.   In the event a student receives federal aid (Title IV Funds) for which he/she is later deemed ineligible, the institution will refund all Title IV amounts (with top priority) to the appropriate source no later than 45 days from the determination date of such over award.  The student’s account will be adjusted and the student will be informed of the action and of the repayment owed to the institution.  Release of Student Records and Documents A student may not receive an official transcript, certificate, or diploma until all accounts and fines (current or otherwise) have been settled in accordance with University policies.  Such documents will be retained by Mid-America Christian University as security for such obligations until they are satisfied.  Refund Specific to Military Tuition Assistance Third-Party Contract The University refund policy applies to all Third-party contract students which includes military tuition assistance (TA) students.  Any unearned TA funds are returned to the funding source on a proportional basis through at least the 60 percent portion of the period for which the funds were provided.  TA funds are earned proportionally during an enrollment period, with unearned funds returned based upon when a student stops Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  45 attending.  In instances when a Service member stops attending due to a military service obligation, the University will work with the affected member to identify solutions that will not result in a student debt for the returned portion. ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND POLICIES "Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds...” Titus 2:7  Through an exceptional faculty of practitioners and scholars, Mid-America Christian University educates and encourages students in the pursuit of their chosen field of study. The academic policies set forth provide a framework in which students can develop their knowledge and skill set, develop a closer relationship with God, and mature in their mental, social, emotional, physical, and spiritual capabilities.  Academic Load The normal academic load is 12-15 hours.  A minimum load of 12 hours is required for classification as a full-time student.  The college dean or his/her designee must approve any student load beyond 18 hours in any semester.  The number of hours a student carries may be limited if a student works or has a record of low academic achievement.  Academic Probation and Suspension To remain in school and be eligible for a degree or diploma, a student must maintain satisfactory academic progress.  The following procedures are utilized to track the progress of individual students at MACU. Undergraduate Probation 1. Only the student's CGPA (cumulative grade point average) counts toward probation.  Probation is based on the total number of hours attempted At The End of any period of enrollment in which the student is enrolled.  For the College of Arts and Science, satisfactory academic progress is evaluated at the end of each semester.  For the College of Adult and Graduate Studies, academic progress is evaluated at the end of twelve hours for undergraduate students. 2. All transfer courses transcribed by the Office of the Registrar will count toward the CGPA. 3. The registrar will notify a student that he/she is placed on probation for the following semester/period of enrollment when the Minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average falls below the following standards. Hours Completed    Required CGPA    0-24 1.75    25+     2.00  4. Any course may be repeated once with the highest grade earned replacing the first. Subsequent repeats require the second grade and subsequent grades to be used in the cumulative grade point average. 5. Students placed on probation have one semester/period of enrollment to bring their CGPA up to the required standard as listed in item 3 above.  If the satisfactory standard has not been met at the end of that probation-ary period, the student will be suspended from the University for at least one semester/period of enrollment.  The student may appeal to the Admissions/Retention Committee for an additional semester of probation, to be granted, if so desired. 6. Transfer students, whose program evaluation shows that the CGPA of the accepted transfer classes does not meet the standards listed above in item 3, will NOT enter on probation.  They will be treated as any other student and have one standard semester of attendance, plus the one probationary semester, if their CGPA does not meet the required standards. 7. A student is taken off probation at the end of any semester that his or her CGPA is accepted. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  46 Undergraduate Suspension A student placed on academic suspension will be suspended from the University for one semester/period of enrollment.  Following this period, the student who desires to reenroll at MACU must appeal for readmission to the Admissions/Retention Committee. This notice must be in writing and must be given to the Director of Admissions no later than 15 days before the first day of classes of the semester in which enrollment is desired. Graduate Probation 1. Only the student's CGPA (cumulative grade point average) counts toward probation.  2. Probation is based on the total number of hours attempted At The End of any period of enrollment in which the student is enrolled.  Academic progress is evaluated at the end of nine hours for graduate students.  3. All transfer courses transcribed by the Office of the Registrar will count toward the CGPA. 4. The registrar will notify a student that he/she is placed on probation for the following semester/period of enrollment. 5. Any course may be repeated once with the highest grade earned replacing the first. Subsequent repeats require the second grade and subsequent grades to be used in the cumulative grade point average. 6. Graduate students placed on probation have period of enrollment to bring their CGPA up to the required standard as listed in item 3 above.  If the satisfactory standard has not been met at the end of that probation-ary period, the student will be suspended from the University for at least one period of enrollment.  The student may appeal to the Admissions/Retention Committee for an additional semester of probation, to be granted, if so desired. 7. A student is taken off probation at the end of any semester that his or her CGPA is accepted. Graduate Suspension A student placed on academic suspension will be suspended from the University for a one period of enrollment.  Following this period, the student who desires to reenroll at MACU must appeal for readmission to the Admis-sions/Retention Committee. This notice must be in writing and must be given to the director of admissions no later than 15 days before the first day of classes of the semester in which enrollment is desired. Academic Success Contract for  Probation and Provisional Status Students To encourage satisfactory academic progress and provide accountability and monitoring, a student from the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) placed on academic probation or any student admitted through the Admission/Retention Committee is required to sign an Academic Success Contract that outlines the minimum probation requirements. Students are expected to abide by the requirements of the Academic Success Contract. Failure to do so may result in discontinued enrollment. Academic probation and provisional students are required to complete an Academic Success Contract that includes the following components: 1. Approval from the Registrar’s Office for courses. 2. Enrollment and completion of "
UNIV 1101," Becoming a Master Student.  3. Access to a personal copy of each required textbook (not sharing with another student). 4. Participation in weekly grade/class attendance reports. 5. Participation in weekly Time Management sessions through the Academic Success Center. 6. Regular meeting with an academic advisor/assigned faculty mentor. 7. Participation in five (5) hours of Supervised Study Hall each week during the semester.  Academic Periods of Enrollment The College of Arts and Sciences academic year is divided into two semesters of sixteen weeks plus summer Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  47 sessions.  The College of Adult and Graduate Studies undergraduate academic year is at least 24 credits and 40 weeks of instructional time divided into periods of enrollment of at least 12 credit hours in 20 weeks of instructional time. The graduate academic year is at least 18 credits and 36 weeks of instructional time divided into periods of enrollment of at least 9 credit hours in 18 weeks of instructional time for graduate students.  Academic Terminology  MAJOR A major represents a primary field of study of a degree-seeking student.  A major is a structured plan of study requiring a minimum of 30 semester hours.  It must be feasible for students to complete degree requirements within 122 semester hours.  The major appears on the official transcript. CONCENTRATION/EMPHASIS A concentration or emphasis is a structured plan of study within a program that define a specialty area or specific field of study.  The number of semester hours for a concentration/emphasis varies, but is included within the required hours for the major.  A concentration/emphasis must include a minimum of 12 semester hours of specialized coursework. The concentration/emphasis appears on the official transcript.  MACU uses the word concentration to depict a specialty area or specific field of study in undergraduate level degree programs and emphasis is used for graduate level.   MULTIDISCIPLINARY Options Multidisciplinary options allow a unique opportunity for students interested in more than one academic discipline choose a primary program and a secondary discipline of study.  The courses required in the secondary discipline will be taken in lieu of the primary program’s electives.  At the time the student designates the primary and secondary multidisciplinary course of study, they must be approved by the chairpersons of the two academic disciplines.  Accommodations Policy At Mid-America Christian University, it is our desire to create an environment where all students are accepted and valued. Reasonable accommodations will be provided for those students who qualify under the American Disabilities Act as having a disability. Disability includes two elements: (1) a physical or mental impairment which (2) substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the person in question. Major life activities include but are not limited to walking, breathing, seeing, hearing, performing manual tasks, caring for oneself, learning and working; has a record of physical or mental impairment; or is regarded as having a substantially limiting physical or mental impairment, even though the impairment is insubstantial or a reflection of the attitudes or others or nonexistent. A student must provide documentation of disability to the ADA Accommodations Committee.  This documentation will include diagnosis, recommendations, or requirements from a physician, therapist, counselor, previous schools and/or others as pertinent and available.  All diagnostic information is confidential and therefore memos can be sent only at the student’s request. Upon receipt of a request for special accommodations and documentation for our records, the  ADA Accommodations Committee will initiate the process for reviewing the accommodations request.     Alternative Certification in Teacher Education The Alternative Certification in Teacher Education is designed for those who have a degree, but need a teaching license/certificate to teach.  Oklahoma requires at least two years of work experience in the field of his or her degree, or one college course posted as post-baccalaureate in the teaching field or in education. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  48 Anyone seeking alternative certification must also pass the Oklahoma General Education Test (OGET) and an Oklahoma Subject Area Test (OSAT) based on his or her bachelor’s degree field. The Oklahoma State Department of Education determines which OSAT must be passed, as well as any additional education requirements that must be completed prior to licensure. Each applicant must complete an application for alternative licensure including a resume and official transcript. Also, applicants must pass an interview and background check.  More details about alternative certification can be found on the Oklahoma State Department of Education website  Attendance/Participation College of Arts and Sciences Attendance Policy Allotted Absences In recognizing that unavoidable circumstances may result in an occasional absence, except for Internships and Practicums, a student is allowed a number of absences without penalty.  Number of Absences Allowed Without Penalty:     MWF classes =   4 absences   TR   classes =   3 absences           M    classes =   2 absences  Mid-America Christian University considers a maximum number of absences to be no more than four weeks of a 16 week course and no more than one week of an 8 week course.  Any absences beyond the number allowed without penalty may result in a grade reduction if specified in the course syllabus.  No student who is otherwise passing a course shall be given a failing grade solely due to exceeding the maximum number of absences allowed.  However, attendance alone does not mean a student will pass a course.  Maximum Number of Absences Allowed, Including University-Sponsored Events:     MWF classes = 12 absences   TR   classes =   8 absences    M    classes =   4 absences  NOTE: All students are responsible for the content of any course in which he or she is officially enrolled, including satisfying all course requirements.     University-Sponsored Absences for Athletics/Music/University Sponsored Groups Students involved in intercollegiate athletics, musical ensembles or other university-sponsored groups are expected to be absent for only those classes that are in direct conflict with travel and game/performance schedules.  Practices and pre-game preparation are not sufficient rationale for absences from scheduled classes.  If there is a significant attendance problem due solely to conflicts arising from university-sponsored events, the student should consider finding a more appropriate time for taking the course.  All university-sponsored events which will impact course attendance, must be sent to the Vice President of Academic Affairs for approval.  Students must notify the instructor in advance of any planned absence to make certain all work is completed prior to the absence, if specified in the syllabus, or to set a deadline for makeup work.  The last day for withdrawing/dropping a class in any semester is two (2) weeks prior to the last day of classroom instruction.  Some classes may only be withdrawn from/dropped once without penalty. See Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  49 Academic Programs, Core Completion – Special Requirements.   If the student is assessed a penalty and has legitimate, extenuating circumstances beyond his/her control for some or all of the absences, the student may appeal, in writing,, through the Registrar to the Academic Appeals Committee to have the absences reviewed.  • It is the student's responsibility to keep track of his/her absences.  • If the student chooses to appeal excessive absences, he/she shall do so within 14 days after the date of the first absence that causes his/her grade reduction in the course. • "The burden of proof" for absence appeals will require verifiable documentation, e.g., a doctor’s excuse. • The student is responsible for all work missed and all assignments made in his/her absence.  College of Adult and Graduate Studies Participation Policy Due to the concentrated scheduling and the emphasis upon participatory learning, students need to actively participate in academically related activities each week.  Participation in academically related activities includes but is not limited to: • physically attending a class where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the instructor and students; • submitting an academic assignment; • taking an exam, an interactive tutorial or computer-assisted instruction; • attending a study group that is assigned by the Instructor; • participating in an online discussion about academic matters.  Academically related activities do not include activities where a student may be present but not academically engaged, such as: • living in institutional housing; • participating in the school’s meal plan; • logging into an online class without active participation; or • participating in academic counseling or advisement.  Any student who misses the first two weeks of academically related activities in any course will be administratively dropped on the census date which will result in no refund for this course.  If the student feels that there are legitimate, extenuating circumstances beyond his/her control for some or all of the missed weeks of academically related activities, the student may appeal in writing through the Business Office to review and request a refund.  If one week of academically related activities are missed from an accelerated course it is recognized as a twenty percent (20%) loss of instructional and interaction time.  Any student missing academically related activities must contact the professor for makeup assignments.  The acceptance of makeup work is at the sole discretion of the professor.  Makeup work will include not only assignments missed but specifically designed work to include all contact class hours missed.  Failure to complete the makeup work will prompt a review of the student’s performance by Academic Affairs which may result in probationary status affecting financial aid.   Graduate students who accumulate more than one absence in a course must arrange a conference with Academic Affairs who will determine conditions for the student’s continuance in the program.  Class Standing A student's class standing is dependent upon the total academic credit he/she has earned. Freshman  0 - 24 semester hours Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  50 Sophomore 25 - 48 semester hours Junior 49 - 73 semester hours Senior 74 +     semester hours or more Courses / Educational Model Issues-Based Curriculum The centerpiece of MACU’s undergraduate traditional program in the College of Arts and Sciences is a dynamic issues-based curriculum.  This unique academic approach equips students with the skills required to understand and address the challenging issues of the day. Throughout their course of study, students are exposed to the three most critical issues in the world today: the scarcity of food, energy, and water.  As an agricultural and energy state, Oklahoma provides a unique opportunity to explore vital issues such as these. Viewing this as a global issue, students are encouraged to participate in MACU’s study abroad programs that provide them with firsthand experience dealing with these issues that are often a matter of life and death.  Global Learner Program The “Global Learner" is a University program that encompasses study abroad, issues based curriculum and immersive learning environments. Our goal is to facilitate a learning experience that will broaden students' understanding of what it means to be a part of a global community. This academic year, we are focusing on issues of energy, water scarcity, food insecurity locally (in Oklahoma), domestically (in the US) and abroad.   Not only does The Global Learner Program aim to help students learn about the issues of energy, food insecurity and water scarcity but it provides the opportunity for students to collaborate with non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) to travel, for example, to Uganda to work with locals to hand drill wells (boreholes) and to Italy to participate in the Festival of Life Ceremonies designed to help prevent suicide by celebrating life. This type of experience also provides students with the opportunity to develop a greater cultural awareness and understanding, which is vital to academic and personal growth and development.  College of Arts and Sciences On-Campus Student Experience  The College of Arts and Sciences provides a traditional on-campus student experience for recent high school graduates as well as more mature, daytime-commuting students. On-campus classes are taught in a traditional classroom setting that allows face-to-face interaction with faculty and peers. Online and On-Campus Accelerated Student Experience The College of Adult and Graduate Studies provides a non-traditional student experience for busy, working adults that allows them to pursue a degree online, on campus through accelerated classroom formats, or a combination of both online and on campus. Online students interact with faculty and peers in online webinars, dialogues and other forms of social media. On-campus students enjoy a traditional classroom setting with an accelerated format that allows them to meet only one evening per week. Individualized Instruction Individualized instruction is reserved for students who meet the following criteria: • The content, requirements, and standards of tutorial shall be the same as those of the corresponding course. • Individualized instruction allows a student to take an unscheduled course required for completion of a program of study. • The course must not have been offered currently, and will not be offered again prior to the student’s graduation. • A student seeking individualized instruction may initiate the request by completing this form obtained from the office of the Registrar, after preliminary discussions with the advisor. • Please note that students should submit this request only after exhausting such options as a substitution by the school chair, or substituting a similar course from another school or institution • Justification for a course through individual instruction is required. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  51 In the case of a student requesting permission for study in an inter-departmental curriculum, the student should seek the approval of the department chair of the faculty member supervising the course.  Neither the department chair nor the dean will approve a request which attempts to compensate for an inadequately planned schedule.  If permission is granted, the following regulations apply: 1. The Individualized Instruction Form must be completed. 2. The course requirements must be completed in one (1) semester/period of enrollment. 3. The student must pay full tuition for each credit hour. 4. The student must pay an individualized instruction fee of $60.00 per credit hour for undergraduate courses in addition to the normal tuition charge.  Honor Studies Honor studies are open to qualified students who have demonstrated initiative and capability for individual study and research.  A course is designed to give students opportunity to do advanced work in an area of particular interest to them under the supervision of a selected member of the faculty.  The appropriate college dean must approve the offering of the course and its format, which must be completed within the regular semester as scheduled.   Course Cancellations The University reserves the right to cancel any course in which fewer than ten (10) students are registered.  Credit Hour Policy  For academic purposes, Mid-America Christian University uses the federal definition of the credit hour to measure semester credit hours awarded to students for course work.  The Federal Definition of Credit Hours is stated as follows: Credit hour: Except as provided in 34  Becoming a Master Student (1 cr.) This course provides the student with the opportunity to learn and adopt a variety of theories and techniques that promote success in academic pursuits and beyond. Offered every fall.  "
CFR 668,".8(k) and (l), a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than: (1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practicum, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Specific coursework is evaluated as follows: Traditional Coursework – Based upon this definition, the University’s traditional in-seat courses running 150 minutes per week for fifteen weeks conform to this standard, with students awarded 3 credit hours for such coursework. Courses with relatively more or less weekly contact time between faculty and students are assigned appropriately more or fewer credit hours. By this standard, the University’s laboratory and applied music classes also yield an equivalent and appropriate amount of credit, depending upon the amount of instructional time and student learning activity. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  52 In addition, based upon the foundation of this accepted practice in higher education, the University defines the following equivalences for courses with a non-traditional structure, condensed format, or alternative mode of delivery: Internships and Practicum – The University recognizes the educational value of the hands-on experience gained in an internship or practicum. Typically, to earn 3 semester credit hours, a student is expected to receive a minimum of 135 clock-hours of in-field experience during the term, with a commensurate amount of in-field time for internships yielding 6, 9, or 12 credit hours.  In addition, the University expects the faculty internship supervisor to interact with the student regularly, reviewing with the student observations or assessments from the faculty member or from any on-site supervisor, and providing both formative and summative evaluation of student performance.  For internships near campus, students normally interact with faculty in the classroom on a weekly basis. Faculty interaction for internships at a distance may occur less frequently.  Such oversight may also make use of such online connection technologies with a local professional serving as in-field supervisor and intermediary between campus faculty and intern.  All internships adhere to standards outlined by the Higher Learning Commission and the U.S. Department of Fair Labor Standards Act.  Individual Instruction Classes - Instructors should make adjustments so that the total number of hours of work required by students is equivalent to that of a traditional class that meets face-to-face. Condensed Courses (Accelerated) – The quantity and quality of student learning activities in condensed courses is expected to be equivalent to those experienced in traditional courses in the discipline awarding the same number of credit hours. Courses offered in both a traditional and condensed or online format must be structured around the same intended learning outcomes and organized around the same or complementary learning activities.  In addition, similar assessments of student performance must be used, and similar data must be gathered for use in course and program assessment. The Curriculum Committee is responsible for ensuring at the time of review that these courses meet the credit hour definition.  This equivalence of content, student activity, and evaluation enables the University to validate the parallel quality of the learning experience in these courses and the equivalence of the credit awarded in condensed courses compared with traditional coursework.  Online Courses – Whatever the length of term, students receiving 3 credit hours for online coursework are expected to engage in online “classroom” activities and independent “homework” activities equivalent in quality and variety to a traditional in-seat course in the discipline at the same educational level. The Curriculum Committee is responsible for ensuring at the time of review that these courses meet the credit hour definition. Graduate and Professional Studies - The required academic work normally will exceed three (3) hours per credit per week. Ultimately, the responsibility for protecting the academic integrity of curricula, programs, and class schedules rests with the University’s Vice President for Academic Affairs and respective Academic Deans. The University may adjust its basic measure for awarding academic credit proportionately to reflect modified academic calendars and formats of study as long as it meets the aforementioned criteria.  The University grants semester credit hours for formalized instruction in a variety of delivery modes, such as a lecture course, which also requires laboratory work and/or supervised independent study or field activities.   Regardless of the mode of instructional delivery or class scheduling, the University will assign academic credit consistently across academic programs as well as for transfer credit among accredited institutions of higher education. In all cases, the student learning outcomes must be equivalent.  Review and Approval Process: Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  53 1.  Course developers will ensure that the required quantity of student learning per credit is the equivalent forty-five (45) hours of coursework over a fifteen (15)-week semester through instructional activities that address and demonstrate student competencies in defined learning outcomes.  These instructional activities should draw upon instructional practices approved by the University’s Vice President for Academic Affairs and respective Academic Deans. 2. University Governance Bodies (e.g., the University Curriculum Committee, Faculty Committees, Academic Council, and University Senate) recommend to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the President the appropriate semester credit hour definition and application according to the following guidelines: a. The University's semester calendar will not violate any accreditation standards, federal guidelines, etc.; b. The University's semester calendar will facilitate the educational attainment of the University including the process for the award of transfer credit; and c. A semester credit hour will be consistent throughout all the academic programs of the University.  Commencement and Graduation  Commencement Students are invited to participate in the annual MACU Commencement Exercise held each spring.  This exercise serves as a celebration of the students’ great academic achievements that can be shared with family and friends.  Students will indicate their intent of participating in commencement at the time they submit their application for graduation.    Adornment Policy Adornments may be worn but are limited to cords from MACU or honor societies officially recognized by MACU (See section on Honor Societies).  Decoration on mortar boards is not allowed under any circumstance.  Application for Graduation All candidates for a degree are asked to fill out an Application for Graduation two semesters/period of enrollments before their expected graduation date.  No student will be classified as a graduating senior or placed on the prospective graduation list until this application is on file in the Registrar's Office.  Once approved, this form constitutes a formal agreement between the student and the institution regarding the completion of degree requirements.  Deadlines for the Application of Graduation Acceptances All Students who wish to participate in Commencement in May are required to submit an Application for Graduation through the MACU Portal no later than March 1st (see Completion Requirements). All students are required to submit an Application for Graduation through the MACU Portal or to the Office of the University Registrar no later than two months prior to their planned conferral date. For example, a student planning to graduate as of May 1st is required to submit their petition by March 1st.  Early Participation – “Walking Early” Students may be interested in participating in a graduation ceremony before all degree requirements have been met.  In order to qualify for Early Participation, the student must meet the following eligibility requirements and receive permission from the Office of the Registrar.   To be eligible for Early Participation, all program degree requirements must be scheduled prior to the Application for Graduation deadline (March 1st), and must end prior to the start of the following fall term.  These requirements include but are not limited to the following: • Practicum/Internship/Student Teaching • Subject Exams/Alternative Credit • Courses/Community Service Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  54  Graduation Conferral Periods Degrees are conferred 14 times per year, the 15th of every month for the College of Adult and Graduate Studies, and the last day of each semester for the College of Arts and Sciences.  A period of one month following each conferral date is required to review and post the conferral information.  Official transcripts are available to order at any time after the conferral information is posted.  Diplomas will be printed and issued three times a year:  Print Date Conferral Period July 15 Conferred between January and May October 15 Conferred between June and August February 15 Conferred between September and December  Diplomas and Certificates Only the degree, primary major, and honors (if earned), will appear on the diploma. The name on the diploma must be the legal name of the graduate, or within reason. For example, a student can request their nickname rather than their full first name.  Prefixes such as Mr., Dr., Rev., etc. will not be printed on the diploma.  All diplomas will be issued in compliance with the conferral periods listed above, provided the student has met all financial obligations.  If the student has an outstanding financial obligation, the Office of the Registrar must be contacted once the balance is cleared.  The student needs to verify their mailing address prior to the diploma being sent out.  If the student does not receive their diploma within ten business days (20 days if international address) of receiving notification of it being mailed at the address specified through the petition to graduate process, the student should contact the Office of the Registrar.  The Registrar will send another diploma.  However, if the diploma mailing address was not updated, the student will need to provide the updated address and pay the cost of a replacement diploma.  Final Examination Week  The College of Arts and Sciences final examination week is part of the 16-week semester minimum required by the State of Oklahoma. Students, except for graduating seniors, may not be excused from attending classes during finals week.  All students should plan to attend each of his or her classes and take the final examination for each of those classes according to the final examination schedule.  A graduating senior in the final semester, who has an "A" average for a course may, at the discretion of the professor, not be required to take the final examination in that course providing all requirements are met on the day which is designated each semester.  The College of Adult and Graduate Studies does not have a final examination week due to the nature of the accelerated program.  Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  55 Registration  Students whose account is in good standing may register for the upcoming semester/period of enrollment once the schedule is posted. To register, students can access the schedule via the student portal or pick up a schedule of classes which are located outside of the Registrar’s Office.   After consulting with his or her academic advisor students can register online via the student portal.  All Business Office and Financial Aid holds must be resolved before a student can register via the student portal.  Directions on how to register online are posted on the student portal and available in the Office of the Registrar.    Auditing a Course A student who wishes to attend class, but who does not want to receive credit for the class, is an auditor.  Audited courses will be entered on the student's transcript with the "AUD" notation for a grade.  Regulations governing audited courses are as follows: 1. Permission to audit will be granted only by the appropriate college dean with permission of the instructor of the class. 2. Instructors will determine the requirements that apply to the auditors.  These will be explained at the time permission is granted for auditing.  3. If permission is granted to audit, the student will notify the registrar on forms provided.  Audited courses will be recorded on the transcript only when the instructor has indicated to the registrar that the student has fulfilled the requirements which were stipulated at the time permission was granted for an audit. 4. A course taken for audit cannot be given credit after the add/drop period. Late Registration Late registration is conducted through the Office of the Registrar.  No late registration will be accepted after the first week of instruction. Prerequisites A prerequisite to any course is listed in the course description section of the catalog and should be carefully observed.  Prerequisites must be taken unless the school chair with the approval of the college dean waives such requirements. Taking the lower division course concurrently with the advanced course is permitted with the approval of the school chair and the college dean.  Registration Changes During Add/Drop Period Prior to the course census date, students are able to modify their schedule via the www.my.macu.edu portal.  During this period students are encouraged to visit with Academic Affairs to ensure these changes will meet program requirements and not adversely affect future enrollment.  Students may add classes through the first week of the course period; and may drop courses through the second week of the course period.  Students should refer to the ‘Institutional Refund Policy’ for information regarding refund of tuition during the add/drop period.  Cancellation of Enrollment during the Preliminary Enrollment Period  All new undergraduate students wishing to enter the College of Adult and Graduate Studies undergraduate programs for the first time will be enrolled in a preliminary enrollment status for the first 28 calendar days of their first term/period of enrollment.  The College will cancel the enrollment of students who are not earning satisfactory grades as determined by the College as of the preliminary enrollment period. Students who are failing or have not participated in accordance with the College’s participation policy after the 14th day will be considered to have cancelled while in the preliminary enrollment period. Students may self-elect to cancel their enrollment any time during the preliminary enrollment period.

Withdrawal Administrative Withdrawal/Drop Administrative withdrawal/drop is the process by which the University may withdraw a student from classes.  The University will administratively withdraw a student from a course due to lack of participation by the census date or last day to enroll in classes (See Attendance/Participation policy). Administrative Dismissal Administrative dismissal is the process by which the University dismisses a student from further class participation at the time due cause is determined.   A student may be administratively dismissed for due cause through suspension or expulsion for academic dishonesty (see Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy) and/or disciplinary procedures.  Administrative dismissal may be invoked after due process when a student fails to comply with a University policy. Administrative dismissal is noted in the student’s permanent record. Information concerning procedures that govern violations of student conduct are available in the Student Handbook. The student is responsible for any balance remaining on the student’s account after all applicable credits are applied. A student who has been administratively dismissed may be reinstated when the condition that has necessitated administrative dismissal has been fulfilled to the satisfaction of University officials (see Readmission Policy).  Withdrawal/Transfer-Out from the University If a student needs to withdraw from the University, the student should use the following withdrawal procedure to protect his or her status and leave in the best possible position in respect to future registration at this or another college or university. Failure to follow these procedures could result in a lower scholastic Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  57 standing and a greater financial loss. It is the student's responsibility to determine if any balance is owed on his or her account as of the date of withdrawal.  Contact Academic Advisor/Chair Submit an Institutional Withdrawal/Transfer-Out Form of your intentions to withdraw from the University (all current/future courses). Arrangements should be made with the Business Office for payment of the account. *Students with an F-1 student visa must also contact the Designated School Official.   *Students seeking to drop a single course should contact their Academic Advisor/Chair. GRADES, TRANSCRIPTS AND STUDENT RECORDS Grades Students’ grades in all courses are filed in the Office of the Registrar and become a part of the official records of the University.   • Passing grades used are A, B, C, D, and under certain conditions, P and S.   • Non-passing grades are F, and U.    • W, meaning withdrawal, is a neutral grade assigned at the time of withdrawal.  Grade Point System Each hour of A, B, C, D and F carries a grade point value as follows: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0, and I=0.  Grades of P and S, as well as grades of U, AW, and W, carry no grade point value and are not included in the computation of a student’s period of enrollment or cumulative grade point average.  Grading Scale When grades are calculated on a percentage basis and not on a curve, they are evaluated as follows, unless different requirements are specified on class syllabi:   90% to  100% = A  80% to    89% = B  70% to    79% = C  60% to    69% = D    0% to    59% = F  Scholastic Achievement Levels of scholastic achievement are determined by a number of means that may include periodic testing, class participation, daily assignment, class attendance and participation, library work and projects, and by a final examination given at the end of the course.  Levels of achievement are recorded as follows:   A   - Superior Scholarship.  This indicates outstanding achievement in: 1. Completeness and accuracy of knowledge 2. Comprehension 3. Use of knowledge 4. Originality and creativity of thought and expression. 5. Ability to interrelate with other academic disciplines.  B   - Above Average.  This indicates above average levels of achievement in respect to some or all of the factors mentioned above.  Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  58 C   - Average.  This indicates satisfactory and acceptable work.  D   - Below Average.  This indicates an unsatisfactory level of performance which falls below the minimum standard acceptable for graduation but is of sufficient quantity and quality to be counted in the points required for graduation, including credit hours, if balanced by superior work in other classes.  F   - Failure.  This indicates unsatisfactory performance and failure in a required course must be repeated.  W* - Withdrawal.  This indicates that a course was commenced, but that the student withdrew from the course before a final grade was awarded.  AW*- Administrative Withdrawal.  This indicates a course was commenced, but the student was withdrawn administratively because of lack of attendance or disciplinary measures before a final grade was awarded. P* - Pass.  P meaning Pass is used as a passing grade and indicates quality of C work or better.    S* - Satisfactory.  This indicates that a course was completed satisfactorily and credit hours have been earned.  U   - Unsatisfactory. This indicates that a course was commenced but was not completed satisfactorily.   No credit hours have been earned.  I   - Incomplete.  When a course is not completed by the end of a semester or a summer session because of circumstances beyond the student's control, an "I" to indicate "Incomplete" may be given only with approval of the appropriate college dean.  AUD*- Audit.  This indicates that a course has been attended, but no hours have been attempted or earned.  WIP*- Work in Progress.  This is a temporary grade issued while the course is still in process.  *These grades are not used in computation of grade point average.   Incomplete Grades An incomplete grade is not an alternative to a grade of F, and no student may be failing a course at the time an Incomplete is awarded.  To receive an Incomplete, the student should have satisfactorily completed a substantial portion of the required coursework for the period of enrollment.  The instructor will indicate to the student, and submit to the Office of the Registrar an approved incomplete form, which states what must be done to complete the course and sets a time limit appropriate to the circumstances.  However, the time allowed should not exceed six months.  The student is fully responsible for completing the assigned work prior to the deadline.  The grade will remain “incomplete” unless a grade change is approved.  Any incomplete grade will be computed the same as an “F” grade.  A student who has received two or more I (incomplete) grades that have not been changed to passing grades normally will not be permitted to enroll for another period of enrollment without approval from the college dean. How to Obtain Academic Transcripts Academic Transcripts Students may obtain official copies of their transcript from www.getmytranscript.com.

Every student is expected to observe the highest standards of conduct, both on and off the campus.  The University cannot accept the responsibility for the education of any student who is not in sympathy with the purposes and the regulations of this institution.  The University reserves the right to dismiss any student whose conduct or academic standing is regarded as undesirable.  In such cases, the fees that are due or have been paid in advance to the University will not be remitted or refunded in whole or in part.  Neither the University nor any of its officers shall be under any liability whatsoever for such dismissal.  Any student under disciplinary suspension or expulsion is not to be on campus for any reason except those approved by the Office of Student Life. The University reserves the right to amend or add to any of the regulations stated above. The process of appeals as pertaining to students is set forth in the Student Handbook and is available to all students. All stated objectives, requirements, and agreements with the student are made with the understanding that the student is an equal participant in the learning process and must share with the professors and administration the responsibility for successful completion of his or her degree requirements.  Each student is responsible for knowing and adhering to regulations governing registration, withdrawal, degree plans, graduation requirements, and the payment of tuition and other expenses of his or her education. Chapel and Assembly Programs Chapel is the largest community expression of corporate worship on campus for students as well as faculty and staff. Chapel meets twice a week during the academic year. Chapel services are available via livestream at http://www.macu.edu/watch/ for our extended community.

Academic Appeals Process In the event any student of Mid-America Christian University considers that he/she has an academic grievance or that some action is not justified or constitutes an encroachment upon his or her academic rights, Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  64 he/she may submit his or her grievance according to the provisions of the Academic Appeals Process. Academic grievances may include, but are not limited to, any question of examinations, assessments or student outcomes, grades, requirements for satisfactory progress in a course, disciplinary action for academic dishonesty or plagiarism, or exceeding the maximum number of allowed absences for a course.  To resolve conflict or to voice other types of complaints, reference the Student Complaint Process listed under the Academic Support section of this catalog.  The Student Complaint Process and complaint form are also located in the Student Handbook and are posted on the Student Portal.      The procedure to be followed in processing an academic appeal is as follows:   1. The student will seek with good faith effort, to resolve any academic problems by direct appeal to the instructor or person(s) involved. If the issue is discussed with the instructor and a satisfactory resolution of the issue is not agreed upon or the instructor is unavailable after the student makes diligent effort to contact the instructor, the student may file a written academic appeal. Written academic appeals must be filed no later than sixty (60) business days after the course grade is posted or fourteen (14) business days after the maximum number of absences have been exceeded in an absence appeal.  2. Requirements for an Academic Appeal a.

The chair of the Academic Appeals Committee will establish a mutually satisfactory date for convening the hearing.  4. At its discretion, the Academic Appeals Committee may hold such informal or formal hearings, as it deems necessary. The student and instructor will be permitted to present witnesses and evidence relevant to the appeal. The Academic Appeals Committee will take into account information from any source the committee deems appropriate.  5. The burden of proving grievances shall be upon the aggrieved student. The student must provide clear and convincing evidence for the committee to provide a remedy for the issue in question. It is the student’s responsibility to provide the committee with any necessary documentation needed to resolve the issue. The aggrieved student will be entitled to counsel or witnesses if he/she so chooses.  6. The committee will make the decision whether or not to grant the appeal and provide a remedy. If the student is not satisfied with the decision, the student may make an appeal to the appropriate dean of the college in which the course is taught. The appeal shall include the original appeal letter and any other information the student may provide to the dean to assist in making a decision. The appeal must be filed with the appropriate dean within twenty (20) business days of the Academic Appeals Committee Decision. 7. After the appropriate college dean makes a decision, the student may appeal the dean’s decision to the   within twenty (20) business days of the dean’s decision. The appeal should include the original appeal letter, information provided to the dean in the previous appeal, and only new information Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  65 that was not previously available through due diligence at the time of the initial appeal, to aid the Vice President for Academic Affairs in making a decision. 8. Any appeal regarding a decision made by an academic dean will go directly to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. 9. All decisions by the Vice President for Academic Affairs shall be final and binding upon all parties involved.  Student Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy  1. Mid-America Christian University expects faculty, staff, administrators, and students to live out the core value of academic honesty and integrity and accountability in an honest community, which is essential to a Christ-like character.  The purpose of this Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy, referred to in this document as “this policy,” is twofold: (1) to uphold the core value of academic honesty and integrity while preserving academic freedom in research and scholarship; and (2) to investigate suspected instances of violations and, when confirmed, to administer course and institutional remediation and consequences, in a consistent, just, and equitable manner.  Provided, however, that as to faculty, staff, and administrators, disciplinary action will be administered in accordance with relevant provisions in the Employee and Faculty Handbook, as applicable.    2. All faculty, staff, administrators, and students engaging in research and scholarship are expected to do “original” work; that is, the work is independently created (as opposed to being copied from another’s work or the writer’s own prior work) and includes the writer’s individual thoughts.  Scholarly work is to exhibit sufficient modification from the original source to demonstrate comprehension of the material. A work may be original even though it closely resembles other works so long as the similarity is purely coincidental and unintended, and not the result of copying.  A student may only submit academic work for credit once unless permission is granted by the current instructor. 3. Guidelines for Writing Assignments a. Students are predominantly to do their own writing of the content by describing content information in their own words, documenting the source of information, and minimizing the use of direct quotes as defined in writing by the instructor.  b. Unless the expressed purpose of an assignment is otherwise stated in writing, originality requires more than “reporting” the ideas or data of others or presenting another’s position by copying passages.  c. The purpose of an academic assignment is for students to engage in the mental process of knowing, comprehending, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating academic content and presenting conclusions or results using standard grammar, mechanics, and content in a coherent and organized fashion.  d. Quoting material that has been written or published by another author must be shown as a quotation when it appears as a part of one’s work.  e. Paraphrasing involves the rewording and/or restructuring of the material of others to fit one’s own style of writing.  The ideas contained therein, however, are those originally spoken or published by others.  The reason for paraphrasing is twofold: (1) to put the idea into one’s own words; and (2) to give credibility and authority to one’s idea.  f. All sources must be properly documented, whether directly quoted or paraphrased, according to the American Psychological Association (APA), with page numbers, unless otherwise specified or modified by the instructor in writing. Proper documentation includes in-text citations and complete bibliographic information.  Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  66 g. Common knowledge, which is information the reader could find in general sources, may be documented at the writer’s discretion.    4. Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to, any form of dishonesty, cheating, or plagiarism on any coursework, research, or scholarly writing. Any person who knowingly or intentionally assists another in a violation of this policy is equally responsible and subject to course and/or institutional remediation and consequences, as applicable.  Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: a. Submitting another’s work as one’s own or knowingly or carelessly enabling another to submit one’s work as though it were his/her own. b. Failure to properly acknowledge the work of others or authorities quoted, paraphrased, or consulted in the preparation of written work. c. Unauthorized use of a textbook, notes, or other materials on an exam or assignment. d. Receiving or giving unauthorized assistance on any coursework. e. Tampering with experimental data to obtain a “desired” result or creating results for experiments not conducted. f. Tampering with or destroying the work of others. g. Lying, being deceptive, or withholding relevant academic information. h. Falsifying or fabricating college records, forms, or other documents. i. Unauthorized access of computer systems or files. j. Violations of copyright law.  5. When a violation of this policy is confirmed in student coursework, instructors are required to notify students in writing prior to remediation and consequences and submit an electronic report outlining the violation of this policy through the Centralized Reporting System. a. Course Remediation and Consequences. If the instructor determines that a violation of this policy has occurred, the following actions may be taken individually or in combination at the instructor’s discretion:  (1) A grade of 0/F for the assignment. (2) A grade of 0/F for the assignment with the option to resubmit and/or complete an alternative assignment for full or partial credit. (3) A grade of F for the course. This score will be recorded with the Registrar within two (2) business days of written notification to the student of a violation of this policy, preventing a withdrawal from the course. (4) A grade of F for the course with the option to resubmit the work and avoid any further violation of this policy for the remainder of the course for a change of grade at the end of the course. Note: The grade of F will be recorded with the Registrar within two (2) business days of written notification of the student of a violation of this policy, preventing a withdrawal from the course. If no further violations occur, the instructor will submit a Grade Change Form. (5) Student completion of a designated online tutorial. The student must successfully complete the Academic Integrity Tutorial, Plagiarism Tutorial and/or module(s) pertaining to the offense at the instructor’s discretion within the timeframe given by the University for such tutorial or module. (6) An educational discussion, relevant assigned reading, or other training designated by the instructor.    b.  Institutional Remediation and Consequences.  The Academic Deans of the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Adult and Graduate Studies will be responsible for enforcing institutional remediation and consequences for students pursuing a degree in their respective schools.  Such Deans may meet with the student for any violation of this policy and will automatically do so upon a second and any subsequent violations. The Academic Dean may Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  67 designate an appropriate representative, such as the program director/school chair, to meet with the student rather than meeting with the student personally. The Academic Dean or his/her representative may administer one or more of the following:   (1) censure (private reprimand);   (2) probation;   (3)  suspension; and/or   (4) recommend expulsion.    c. Consequences may be increased or decreased based on evidence of aggravation or mitigation.  For example, self-reporting, prompt and genuine acceptance of full responsibility, remorse, repentance, and/or remediation may be considered in mitigation.  Stonewalling, false, misleading, or incomplete statements, or a rebellious, arrogant, condescending and/or contemptuous attitude, may be considered in aggravation.   6. All confirmed violations of this policy must be reported electronically through the Centralized Reporting System by the instructor within ten (10) business days of the written communication to the student regarding the policy violation. The following information must be submitted electronically through the Centralized Reporting System: a. Date of Report Submission b. Student Name c. Class d. Instructor Name e. Date of Violation f. Type of Violation g. Explanation of Violation h. Course Remediation and Consequences Taken i. Copy of Written Communication with Student Regarding Violation j. Copy of Assignment on which Violation Occurred  k. Copy of TurnItIn Report (for writing assignments uploaded through D2L) l. Deadlines regarding remediation and consequences  7. In the event that any student of Mid-America Christian University considers that he/she has an academic grievance or that some action is not justified or constitutes an encroachment upon his/her academic rights, he/she may submit his/her grievance according to the provisions of the Academic Appeals Process in the University Catalog.  Formal Student Complaint Process                                                      The purpose of this policy is to provide a safe and organized way for students to voice complaints that they have. It is important that students have a wide-spread understanding of how to rectify situations that pertain to their experience at MACU. When practiced well, the ability to biblically and respectfully resolve conflict is a restorative process for the individuals involved.  The complaint process at MACU is designed to help students to biblically resolve complaints. Therefore, we follow the process of responsibility and resolution located in Matthew 18:15-17 “If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother. But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY FACT MAY BE CONFIRMED.  If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.”  (NASB)  It is for this reason that only complaints which the student as attempted to resolve on the department level will be recorded and processed as formal complaints. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  68  The Division of Student Affairs, working in conjunction with the Dean and Associate Dean of the College of Adult and Graduate Studies (CAGS), will methodically process written student complaints that it receives in accordance with the spirit of resolution in the Matthew 18 passage.  Mid-America Christian University values the process of resolving complaints that may arise. Seeking resolution is the conscientious response to a grievance that one may have within any community. Conflict resolution is often the necessary element to bring health back to a community. Complaints commenced through this process may bring about an inquiry and/or disciplinary action involving another member of the University community (student, faculty or staff).  The University is committed to keeping a confidential and professional process that facilitates resolution within a safe environment, guarding against retaliation. Steps: 1. Initially, complaints should be resolved following the biblical model of addressing the person or department responsible for resolving your complaint. If you are unsure who that person is, please contact Student Affairs (405-691-3800) or CAGS Student Services (877-569-3198) to get appropriate direction. 2. If step one is not successful in resolving your complaint, formal complaints may be registered with the Division of Student Affairs through the form on my.macu.edu. This form will be kept confidential.   3. The Division of Student Affairs or the Dean or Associate Dean of CAGS will act as a mediator between the student and party or parties named in the complaint. After your complaint is reviewed, you will receive a letter documenting the receipt and appraisal of your grievance from the office named in the complaint document, within 48 hours of receiving the complaint.  For CAS complaints, the Vice President for the area named in the complaint will be made aware of the issue.  For complaints within the College of Adult and Graduate Studies, the Dean or Associate Dean will be notified. 4. If the complaint is not resolved in steps 1-3, the Dean of Student Life may consider pursuing any further action in order to reach resolution.  *Please note that the same complaint form may be used to report any exemplary service or experience that occurred on campus. That person or office will be notified of your comments. STUDENT LIFE “In everything you do put God first and He will direct you and crown your efforts with success.”  Proverbs   Mid-America Christian University is committed to the preparation of students as whole persons.  Through programs and events, students are encouraged to develop and refine their abilities in making responsible choices in all aspects of their lives based on Christian principles and philosophies.  Faculty and staff work together to help students in the growth process.  Thus, education at Mid-America Christian University is education with a distinctive purpose.

A unique campus feature, the Nature Reserve is located on the east side of the campus grounds and is recognized by the State of Oklahoma as being the home of a variety of different types of wildlife and vegetation. Counseling and Guidance Mid-America Christian university values the holistic care of our students.  For this reason, upon counselor availability, we are committed to providing confidential counseling free of charge for all of our College of Arts and Sciences students as well as any College of Adult and Graduate Studies students able to drive to the university’s main location for sessions.  Counseling services are provided by Graduate students in the Master of Science in Counseling program completing the practicum/internship portion of their program.  The students are under supervision by both a licensed on-site supervisor as well as their university supervisor who is also a licensed practitioner.  To make an appointment contact the coordinator for the Adult School of Psychology and Counseling at 405-692-3160. Additional support is available to students who live in the residence halls.

For students on the go, the cafeteria offers takeout meals and works to accommodate various student schedules.    Health Care Basic first aid for minor incidents is provided through the Residence Life Staff or MACU PD. The campus is located approximately one and a half (1.5) miles northeast of St. Anthony Healthplex South, two (2) miles south of Community Hospital, and six (6) miles south of Integris Health Southwest Medical Center for incidents requiring the use of a hospital. CAS students are asked to make the Office of Student Life aware of any illnesses and/or medical attention sought. The Office of Student Life can make referrals to area doctors; however, regular doctors’ fees are required.  No fee is required for the campus services.    At the time of enrollment each year, students are required to sign a waiver of medical responsibility.  This waiver states that the student is covered by either personal or parental medical insurance and is solely responsible for any medical expenses incurred while a student at MACU.  While MACU does not offer student health insurance, the Student Life Office has several resources for students seeking to purchase a plan.  Residency Policy For these reasons, MACU requires all students 26 years of age and below to live on campus.  The minimum age requirement for students to live on campus is 17.  While student housing is designed for CAS students, CAGS students may appeal to be granted access to student housing.  MACU does recognize that, while it is generally better for students to live on campus, there are exceptions.

These experiences of competition are an important part of the university experience.  Varsity athletes at Mid-America Christian University participate in NAIA Division I Athletics.    Intramural competition is offered in basketball, volleyball, flag football, table tennis, and many other areas.  Participation in these areas provides opportunities for on-campus competition and promotes the health and physical development of students.

New Student Orientation Committee New Student Orientation Committee (NSOC) is a student run organization that exists to welcome new students to campus at the start of fall and spring semesters. Students may apply to join the committee in the fall and spring of each year. This leadership opportunity is an exciting way to impact the lives of new students and set the expectation for what it means to be a part of the MACU community.  Student Government Association The Student Government Association affords the students an avenue for expressing opinions and co-operating in promoting the best interests of the University.  All new clubs on campus may seek official affiliation with the University through the Student Government Association. Official clubs are able to solicit funds from SGA for club activities, along with other benefits from university support.   The SGA has a responsibility to promote fellowship, scholarship, leadership, and spiritual life within the University; to promote understanding between students and University personnel; and to inspire loyalty to the University and the principles for which it stands. Mid-America Christian University Catalog 2018-2019      October 15, 2018  72  Student Ministerial Fellowship This fellowship is organized to encourage those who feel a call to the Christian Ministry and to acquaint them with some of the practical aspects of Community Service.
