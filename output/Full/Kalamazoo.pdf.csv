Statements containedherein are not contractual obligations, and verbal or other representations that are inconsistent with or not contained within the catalog's offerings orpolicies are not binding. Kalamazoo College reserves the right to change, without specific notice, offerings, policies, procedures, qualifications, fees andother conditions.PoliciesHonor SystemThe mission of Kalamazoo College is to prepare its graduates to better understand, live successfully within, and provide enlightened leadership to arichly diverse and increasingly complex world.Members of the Kalamazoo College community come to teach, study, and work here because the College's mission and community statementscorrespond to their values. This community of individuals holds these values in common, despite our diversity. However, we recognize that thiscommunity is a fragile balance of cooperation, goodwill, and dependence, ever in need of renewal as new members enter it.The Honor System is a set of mutually held principles freeing us to create an environment of living and learning that will foster understanding, mutualrespect, intellectual curiosity, and social commitment. We ask the members of the Kalamazoo College community to pledge themselves to creating andprotecting a sense of honor in their lives, and we call upon them to act when they observe actions that are in conflict with these principles.Taking Responsibility for Personal BehaviorTo develop academic and social growth, we commit ourselves to free inquiry, openness to different points of view, and honesty in speech and conduct.In our attitudes and actions, we aim beyond selfishness and parochialism.Respecting OthersTo enhance our community, we accept responsibility for its social well-being. We commit ourselves to treat with respect those with whom we differ, torecognize the rights held by others, and to resolve conflicts. Expressions of prejudgment and prejudice are contrary to this mutual respect and preventthe fostering of community.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Nurturing Independent ThoughtTo safeguard the integrity of academic work and research, we accept responsibility for our own scholarly performance. We regard false representationof our scholarly work as unacceptable because it undermines our integrity and that of the community. We commit ourselves to knowing under whatconditions scholarly research is to be conducted, the degree of collaboration allowed, and the resources to be consulted.Accepting Environmental ResponsibilityTo maintain and improve the condition of our physical environment, we commit ourselves to the respectful and prudent stewardship of our community’smaterial and natural resources. Academic FreedomFor its highest effectiveness, liberal learning requires an environment of free inquiry in which the whole range of human aspiration and achievement,knowledge, and culture can be subjected to searching scrutiny. Liberal learning believes that people should be free to construct and criticize withoutrestraint of official dogmatism. Liberal learning specifically denies that if an idea is unpopular it is therefore suspect, or that if an idea is popular it istherefore true, and trusts instead in those canons of discrimination that are given in the Western tradition of historical scholarship and ethics.Standing self-consciously within this tradition of liberal learning, Kalamazoo College claims for its teachers and students the freedom to engage in thecareful and critical examination of the history of ideas; the freedom to create, to hold, to advocate, and to act on behalf of ideas that express their ownconvictions and integrity; the freedom to engage in the controversy that an unfettered examination and expression of ideas generates; and the freedomto invite to campus representatives of points of view that are important to an informed understanding of the conflict of ideas in our own time.Since freedom of any kind always exists within certain clearly understood boundaries, these freedoms are subject to the following limitations:1. The freedom of individual members of the College to hold, advocate, and act on behalf of ideas does not entail the right to receive endorsementor support of those ideas from the College as a corporate body. It is understood that no one may act as a spokesman for the corporate institutionwho has not been expressly authorized to do so.2. Ideas held, whether by members of the College or by its guests, may be advocated openly in order that the processes of learning and ofadvocacy may be served by open criticism and by counter-advocacy.3. It is understood that both advocacy and action will avoid destruction of property and injury to the personal or intellectual rights of others.4. It is understood that the commonly accepted prohibitions against plagiarism, slander, libel, and incitement to force or violence are in effect in theexercise of these freedoms.5. It is understood that freedom of advocacy and action does not entail the right to violate the regulations of the College with impunity.The Board of Trustees affirms its belief in upholding academic freedom on the campus. It is convinced that the maximum educational opportunityoccurs when the College preserves for all its members the right to question, to debate, to criticize, and to dissent. On the other hand, it is equallyconvinced that freedom is only possible in an environment predicated on peace and orderliness. Therefore, the Board of Trustees wishes it clearlyunderstood that lawlessness, either on campus or off campus, and interference with the College’s educational process cannot be condoned.Student RecordsStudent Records: Notification of Student Rights under FERPAThe College subscribes fully to the guidelines set forth in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, Section 438 of the GeneralEducation Provision Act. It provides students access to education records directly related to them and protects the private information contained withinthose files from unauthorized persons.The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that applies to educational agencies and institutions that receive fundingunder a program administered by the U.S. Department of Education. It affords students certain rights with respect to access to, amendment, anddisclosure of their education records. Specifically, these rights include:1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request foraccess.A student should submit to the Registrar or Vice President for Student Development and Dean of Students, or other appropriateofficial, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The College official will make arrangements foraccess and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by theCollege official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the requestshould be addressed.2. The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, orotherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.A student who wishes to ask the College to amend a record should write the College official responsible for the record, clearly identifythe part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the College decides not to amend the recordas requested, the College will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request foramendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to ahearing.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 20183. The right to provide written consent before the College discloses personally identifiable information from the student's educationrecords, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.The College discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to schoolofficials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory,academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company withwhom the College has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using College employees or officials (such as an attorney,auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as adisciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or herprofessional responsibilities for the College.Upon request, the College may also disclose education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeksor intends to enroll. In such cases, the College will make reasonable efforts to notify students of this action.ExceptionsExceptions to the rights outlined above relate, primarily, to student and/or campus safety issues. The limited occasions when a student’sconsent is not required to disclose personally identifiable information include:1. To protect the health or safety of students or other individuals. Such a release of information could include medical or lawenforcement personnel, public health officials, and parents. This information may include medical or health treatment records.2. The final results of an institutional disciplinary proceeding to an alleged victim of any crime of violence or non-forcible sexoffense.3. To provide timely warning and information of crimes that represent a threat to the safety of students or employees.4. To provide information from campus law enforcement units to others.5. To comply with the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System requirements.6. To another institution at which the student seeks or intends to enroll.7. To parents if a student is a dependent for income tax purposes, if a health or safety emergency involves their child, or if astudent under the age of 21 has violated any law or policy concerning the use or possession of alcohol or other controlledsubstance. Please note that disclosure of information to parents in these circumstances is permitted, not required. The policy ofKalamazoo College is to notify parents only in the case of a health or safety emergency or other set of extraordinarycircumstances that affect a student’s status at the college.4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply withthe requirements of FERPA.The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:Family Policy Compliance OfficeU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue, SWWashington, -2019September 21, 2018Directory Information“Directory information” is defined by FERPA as information contained in the education records of a student that would not generally be consideredharmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.

This regulation uses a daily pro-ration of financial aid earnedbased on the number of days enrolled to the number of days in the term, including weekends and holidays. The school must calculate the portion of thetotal financial assistance that the student has earned and is entitled to retain. At the point where the number of days enrolled is at or greater than 60percent of the term, there will be no return of federal funds. Mandatory fees, such as the Matriculation Fee and Student Activity Fee will not beprorated or removed. If a student receives more assistance than the student earns, the unearned funds must be returned to the applicable aid programs.An example of the calculation is if a student attended 50% of the term, 50% of the aid disbursed will be earned. The remainder or unearned amountmust be returned.If a student unofficially withdraws, the last date of attendance determined by the Office of Financial Aid will be used to calculate the portion of the totalfinancial assistance that the student has earned and is entitled to retain. At the point where the number of days enrolled is at or greater than 60 percentof the term, there will be no return of federal funds.Institutionally-funded scholarships and grants will use this same pro-ration method.A student's withdrawal date is the last date of documented academic activity as determined by the Dean of Students (official withdrawal) or asdetermined by the Office of Financial Aid (unofficial withdrawal). Further information regarding penalties for withdrawal from a study abroad programmay be found in the "Center for International Programs" section of this catalog.If a student is receiving Title IV funds and chooses to withdraw, funds will be returned in this order:1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans2. Federal Direct Subsidized Loans3. Federal Perkins Loans4. Federal Parent PLUS Loan5. Federal Pell Grant6. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)7. Other GrantsA student who receives a refund of federal financial aid after the posting of institutional charges and subsequently withdraws from the College before60 percent of the term is over will be subject to the federal return of funds policy on a portion of the funds they received back as a credit on theiraccount. Such an outcome may occur when a student has no charges on their account for room and board as a result of living off campus.Financialaid from the State of Michigan will be returned to the Michigan Department of Treasury according to guidelines specified by the state. The state'srefund is based on percentage of tuition paid by the program to the percentage of tuition refunded back to the student. Timeframe for Return of TitleIV Funds: As per federal regulations associated to the Higher Education Act, Kalamazoo College must return the amount of Title IV funds for which itis responsible as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days after the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew.An institution mustdetermine the withdrawal date for a student who unofficially withdraws no later than 30 days after the end of the earlier of the:1. Payment period or period of enrollment as appropriate2. Academic year in which the student withdrew; or3. Educational program from which the student withdrew.Post-Withdrawal Disbursements: If the amount disbursed to the student is less than the amount the student earned, the student is eligible to receivea post-withdrawal disbursement of the earned aid that was not received. Kalamazoo College will disburse any Pell funds within 45 days of thedetermination that the student withdrew and disburse any loan funds within 180 days.Whenever possible, a student who receives any financial aidshould attempt to consult with staff in the Office of Financial Aid before withdrawing.

However, scholarships offered byagencies outside of the College may be held concurrently, unless the combined scholarships exceed the "total cost of attendance," as defined by theOffice of Financial Aid. Heyl Scholarships are not based on financial need, and some students may qualify for additional need-based financial aid fromthe College.

Students should direct this request to the Executive Director of the Heyl Scholarship Fund.The Heyl Scholarship Fund also provides fellowships to any student graduating from Kalamazoo College with a major in the Division of NaturalSciences and who wishes to pursue graduate study in selected science fields at Yale University.

These are the steps that a student must follow to apply for need-based financial aid at Kalamazoo College:Apply and be accepted for admission to the College.Submit a completed Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) via the web at FAFSA.gov.  Be sure to list Kalamazoo College (code002275) as one of the schools to receive your data. This form is used to determine eligibility for federal and state awards.  Priority filing date isNov. 15 in the year preceding enrollment.If you are a Michigan resident, take the SAT test before December of your senior year in high school and arrange to send scores to the State ofMichigan for Michigan Competitive Scholarship consideration. High school counselors have information about test dates.Financial Aid PoliciesThe following policies affect the amount of, and eligibility for, financial aid at Kalamazoo College:Federal Title IV funding (Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Work/Study Program, FederalPerkins Loan, Federal Direct Loan) will only be awarded to eligible students who have successfully earned a high school diploma (or itsequivalent ) or a GED.College financial aid is awarded to those students participating as regular students in the normal academic program for the purposes of obtaininga first bachelor's degree.College funded aid is awarded on an academic-year basis for those quarters in which the student is enrolled as at least a three-quarter timestudent. Enrollment in a course as a repeat of a first attempt cannot be counted toward enrollment for financial aid eligibility unlessthe original grade was a D, F, NC, or NG.The type, amount, and composition of the financial aid package will vary from year to year according to family circumstances and funds availableto the College for distribution. If the family encounters a change in its financial situation after the application materials have been filed, theyshould contact the Office of Financial Aid.Students can apply as early as Oct 1 in the year preceding enrollment, but no later than March 1. If selected for U.S. Department of Educationverification, we request copies of IRS tax transcripts and the completion of a verification worksheet. Continuing students who are residents ofthe state of Michigan risk reduced funding from state need-based program if they file later than March 1st. Otherwise, the College considersstudents who file by April 1st to be on time for financial aid consideration.Financial aid will be credited to each student's account by the first day of classes each quarter. Aid items that arrive from external sources in theform of a check will be deposited to the student's account for the student's use and will not be available until the first day of classes.All aid awarded by sources other than Kalamazoo College must be reported to the Office of Financial Aid. The financial aid package will then bere-evaluated to incorporate these resources.Priority for campus jobs is given to financial aid recipients who have been designated as eligible to earn funds under the Federal Work/Studyprogram.  An equal opportunity employer, Kalamazoo College is committed to equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal protection under thelaw. The College administers its programs without regard to race, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin, height, weight, marital status, disabilityas protected by law, sexual orientation or gender identity.A student retains eligibility to continue to receive financial aid support from the institution, as well as federal and state programs, by maintainingan acceptable standard of academic performance. Therefore, financial aid is provided and administered under the terms of the College'sFinancial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress policy.NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) Financial Aid RegulationsKalamazoo College is an NCAA Division III school with strict financial aid award policies and regulations. Questions about eligibility and NCAA rulesshould be directed to the Office of Admission. Our Athletics Department cannot discuss specific financial aid issues with any prospective student.Special Financial CircumstancesProspective families may experience extraordinary financial setbacks different from what is reported on the current-year FAFSA. Families whoexperience persistent job loss, unplanned retirement, one-time significant income, etc… are encouraged to complete a Special Circumstances Form.Contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information.Financial Aid Satisfactory Acadmic Progress (SAP) PoliciesKalamazoo College wants to assure that students progress toward graduation in a successful and timely manner. Furthermore, federal regulationsrequire institutions that award federal student aid to implement policies and practices that monitor student progress toward achievement of a degree.This involves monitoring both a reasonable quality of academic achievement as measured by Grade Point Average and a reasonable "length oftime" to earn an academic degree.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018The following section explains how Satisfactory Academic Progress is measured at Kalamazoo College. The College will administer this policy to allstudents, whether their financial aid is funded from federal, state, and/or institutional sources.Who determines if a student is making Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress?The Committee on Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (CFASAP) shall include the Director of Financial Aid (chair), the Registrar, the Deanof Students, and the Dean of First-Year and Advising.How often is Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress evaluated?CFASAP will meet at the end of the academic year following the Academic Standards Committee's review of student grades.  Because summerclasses are not offered at Kalamazoo College, this review occurs after Spring Term.What are the criteria and standards used to measure progress?There are two forms of measurement; qualitative and quantitative:Qualitative measure: Grade Point Average (GPA): A student who has been enrolled for three terms of study (first-year) must have achieved aminimum cumulative GPA of 1.67 by the end of the first academic year. At the end of the second year, and each year thereafter, the cumulative GPAmust be 2.0* ("C" average) or above.  Remedial coursework is not offered at Kalamazoo College and therefore will not be included in this assessment.Failure to meet these standards will result in the student being denied financial aid for the next term of enrollment. A student whose financial aideligibility is cancelled because of a deficient cumulative GPA may file an appeal and be granted an additional term under the status of "probation" atwhich time the student must meet the standards established for success. Refer to the section "Appealing Cancellation of Financial Aid" forinformation about how to appeal.*Note: the standard for renewal of college-funded merit scholarships, Lux Esto, Trustee, Presidential, Founders, J.T. Williamson, andEnlightened Leadership scholarships has been established as a cumulative 2.5 GPA at the end of the sophomore and junior years.Quantitative measure: Students are considered eligible for financial aid only for those terms which constitute a part of their program leading tograduation. A "term" at Kalamazoo is also referred to as a "quarter". The expected duration (number of terms/quarters) for which a student may enrollto achieve a first bachelor's degree is twelve. These twelve terms may include a maximum of 3 terms of study abroad/study away. Understandably,there are reasons that may require a student to need to enroll beyond this standard. Therefore, the College extends eligibility for some types of financialaid to allow a maximum of 150% of the published program length (18 terms) to achieve graduation requirements. Not all forms of financial aid will beavailable for this extended length of time. Financial aid awards from the College (both merit scholarships and need-based grants) will not normallyextend beyond 13 terms. The chart below explains the funding options available based on the length of time.Number of Enrolled Terms:        Eligible for Federal/State Aid     Eligible for College-Funded Aid       Up to 12YESYES13YESMust Petition Director of Financial Aid14YESMust Petition Committee (CFSAP)15-18Federal OnlyNOTransfer Students: As transfer students are admitted to the College, the Registrar reviews the applicant's academic transcripts. This official reviewestablishes the number of units needed to meet our degree requirements and includes enrollment at prior institutions. The number of terms of fundingavailable at Kalamazoo will be based on the remaining credits required to complete the degree, using a standard of 3-class course load per term. Thenumber of transfer credits accepted upon admission will be included in the quantitative calculation which includes number of credits attempted andcompleted.Change of Major/Double Major: If a student elects to double major or change majors, then all classes previously taken will count towardsSatisfactory Academic Progress.Persuit of a Second Degree: Students who have already earned a bachelor's degree cannot be admitted to the College for the pursuit of a seconddegree.Tracking Academic Progress-Probation and Cancellation of Financial Aid: In order to successfully complete graduation requirements within areasonably established length of time, the student must be making reasonable progress toward the degree. A calculated ratio of units attempted to unitscompleted illustrates a student's progress towards achieving a degree within the College's acceptable standard. In the chart below, a comparison ismade to the cumulative number of units attempted to cumulative number successfully completed.Successful completion requires that a passing grade is received for a course. First-year students are expected to successfully complete 67% of thecourses attempted. After the first 9 units have been attempted, students are expected to successfully complete 75% of the courses attempted. Studentswho fail to meet this standard will no longer be eligible to receive any forms of financial aid and will have a financial aid eligibility status of "Cancelled".Please read the section labeled "Appealing Cancellation of Financial Aid" to determine what is required to regain financial aid eligibility.The following table illustrates a sample of the percentage of successful course completions to attempted. Please contact the Financial Aid Office if youhave any concerns about your ratio.Units Attempted             Units Completed            Ratio: at least            9667%12975%201575%2720.475%362775%Note: Since Kalamazoo College students primarily attend at full-time status, the standards within this policy are established for full-timeenrollment. All standards, however, function properly in the occasional term in which a student is not enrolled for three courses.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Clarifications/explanations:Grades of F, NC, and W are not considered passing grades. Grades of I (Incomplete) must be successfully replaced with a passing grade withinthe timeline established by the Registrar. See section on "Grading Practices" in the Academic Policies section of the catalog for rules onincomplete grades.When you repeat a course, removal of the first grade earned will count as an unsuccessful attempted unit.If the required ratios are not met, financial aid and scholarships for the next term will be cancelled.  If your financial aid eligibility is cancelled youmay follow instructions below to appeal.If you need more than 36 attempts to complete your degree, you may petition CFASAP for permission to have an additional quarter of funding. Refer tolength of time above.Appealing Cancellation of Financial AidWhat is the process to appeal a cancellation?Appeals will only be heard by the Committee on Financial Aid Satisfactory Progress (CFASAP), and its decision will be final. Appeals must be inwriting using the 2018-19 Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form and sent to the Office of Financial Aid by the appropriate deadline.Completing this form allows the student:to explain the circumstance why the student believes they deserve another chance to meet the standard,to identify the reason for the academic difficulty, andto outline what has changed or been accomplished to lead to a better performance.It must be feasible for the student to return to a state of meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress in the next period of enrollment carrying anormal course load.What are the outcomes of a successful appeal?Probation: A successful appeal will permit the student to receive financial aid in the next period of enrollment under the status of "Financial AidProbation".Conditions of Probation: While on probation, the student is expected to carry a full-time course load. The specific conditions and levels ofachievement that are required to be met during the probation period will be conveyed in a letter from the CFASAP when the appeal is granted.In very rare cases, CFSAP may "mitigate" withdrawn courses from counting in the student's ratio and extend the student's eligibility. Grades of"F" cannot be mitigated.Responsibility of Notifying Students: Financial Aid shall notify the student of all Committee decisions in writing. Letters will be sent to the student'scampus mailbox or to the student's home address of record if a notification takes place during the summer period between academic years. As acourtesy, an email will alert the student that a letter has been sent. All communication with the CFASAP should be sent to the Director of FinancialAid.What happens after a term on probation?Reinstatement/Cancellation: If the student successfully meets the academic requirements set forth by the Committee while on probation, they willbe removed from probation and return to regular financial aid eligibility. If the academic results required while on probation are not achieved, all formsof financial aid and scholarships (institutional, federal, and state) will be cancelled for future terms.Regaining eligibility after Cancellation: A student who has been cancelled for financial aid eligibility, but not academically dismissed, will have topay for the next term without any financial aid or scholarship assistance. Such a student may petition the CFASAP committee on their own. A meetingwith the Director of Financial Aid and the Registrar is advised before such an appeal is submitted.Subsequent Cancellation: It may be possible for a student who was once cancelled to regain eligibility and subsequently return to a condition ofcancellation again. Only in unusual cases will a student be reinstated following a second cancellation. Third cancellations are always final.Appeal process for additional terms of financial aid fundingStudents who have not been cancelled or been placed on probation may still find the need to enroll beyond 12 terms in order to achieve their degree.Consider the following when asking for additional terms of financial aid support.For all students, circumstances that typically lead to approval for additional funding of institutional aid beyond the 13th term are course withdrawalsnecessitated by illness or injury of the student or a death in the family. Furthermore, any additional terms must be necessary for graduation and may notsolely be the result of failures, under-enrollment, or poor planning.Students who require financial aid and scholarships beyond the basic standard of twelve terms must make a written request to the Director of FinancialAid or to the Committee on Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (CFSAP). Students who need one additional term must send a letter ofappeal and include the specific reason why the additional term is needed to graduate. Students who wish to request financial aid and scholarshipsbeyond 13 terms must petition the Committee on Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress. The written appeal must be a formal and include thespecific reason why the additional terms are needed to graduate. The petition letter may be delivered to the Director of Financial Aid who will bring thepetition to the Committee on Financial Aid Satisfactory Progress.All students requiring an additional term(s) must remember to file a FAFSA for the year in which the aid is being requested in order to be consideredfor all forms of need-based aid in addition to College-provided scholarships.If you find you still have questions or concerns about Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress after reviewing this policy, we encourage you tocontact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018 Academic PoliciesIt is the student's responsibility to be familiar with all policies and procedures of the College. It is ultimately the student’s responsibility to meet allgraduation requirements.Academic policies and procedures are established by the faculty to ensure the integrity of the academic program at Kalamazoo College. The AcademicStandards Committee is charged by the faculty to take action on petitions made by students for adjustments to academic rules and policies. A petitionmust be made in writing and submitted electronically to the Academic Standards Committee. Petitions are available on the Registrar's Website.Placement and Transfer InformationPlacement of first-year students and transfer students into Kalamazoo College courses may depend on previous coursework, College BoardAdvanced Placement (AP) Examinations, the International Baccalaureate (IB), or departmental placement exams. The College does not placestudents, nor grant credit toward graduation, based on the College Level Examination Program (CLEP).Chemistry and Mathematics PlacementPlacement in chemistry and mathematics courses depends on scores earned on Kalamazoo College placement tests (offered online during thesummer before the first year) or the appropriate College Board Advanced Placement Examination. See the Chemistry and Mathematics pages underthe Courses of Instruction section for more information on placement in those departments. Placement does not imply academic credit towardgraduation; see the Admissions Policies section of this catalog.Foreign Language PlacementStudents who have previously studied a foreign language must take a Kalamazoo College foreign language placement test. Placement in foreignlanguage courses depends on the score earned on the Kalamazoo College placement test, a College Board Advanced Placement Examination, or anInternational Baccalaureate Higher Level examination. Students who have completed three or more years of foreign language in high school will notbe placed in a 101 class. Placement does not imply academic credit toward graduation; see the Admissions Policies section of this catalog.Transfer CreditAdvanced Placement (AP) CreditPlease refer to the Admissions Policies section of this catalog.International Baccalaureate (IB) CreditPlease refer to the Admissions Policies section of this catalog.Dual Enrollment CreditPlease refer to the Admissions Policies section of this catalog.New Transfer StudentsPlease refer to the Admissions Policies section of this catalog.Continuing StudentsSummer Transfer Credit: Students who wish to receive credit for academic work completed over the summer must have the program and course(s)approved prior to their enrollment. Students may receive credit (with a grade of C or better) for courses taken at a regionally accredited U.S. collegeor university, on a program offered in the U.S. through a regionally accredited U.S. college or university, or from an appropriately accreditedinstitution outside of the U.S. For U.S. institutions, the Registrar will determine whether the college or university is accredited and appropriate; forinstitutions and programs outside the U.S., the CIP will make that determination, along with checking into risk management issues. The Registrar'sOffice will work with appropriate departments to determine the appropriateness of the courses.Transfer students may not transfer more than 18 total units toward graduation. Credit transferred from other institutions is not used in the calculationof the Kalamazoo College cumulative grade point average (GPA). A student may not transfer credit for a repeated course if the student earnedcredit (D- or better) for the original course.Transfer units may be used to satisfy language and physical education requirements and, at the discretion of the departmental faculty, may be usedtoward majors, minors, and concentrations. All work to be considered for transfer credit must be submitted on an official transcript mailed directlyfrom the transfer institution to the registrar. The College reserves the right to deny transfer credit not reported within the first year of enrollment.Kalamazoo College does not allow concurrent enrollment. Credits taken at another college or university while enrolled during a standard session atKalamazoo College will not be considered transferrable. This does not apply to Interinstitutional coursework as discussed below.Michigan Guest Student EnrollmentThe Registrar's Office has forms for students wishing to take courses at another Michigan college or university. Applications must be submitted atleast thirty days prior to the start of the term. All transfer policies for continuing students apply to students participating in this program.Study Abroad Course CreditStudents must obtain prior approval for participation in any study abroad program by applying to the Center for International Programs. See thesection on Study Abroad Grades for information on how credit from approved courses is transferred. Study abroad courses do not apply toward themaximum allowable transfer units, and study abroad grades are not used to calculate the grade point average (GPA).KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Interinstitutional EnrollmentStudents may take advantage of opportunities offered by the Kalamazoo Consortium for Higher Education by enrolling in courses at WesternMichigan University or Kalamazoo Valley Community College. This program is intended to provide students in good academic standing theopportunity to take courses that are not available at Kalamazoo College but will add a meaningful dimension to their educational program. First Yearstudents must obtain approval from the Dean of the First Year in order to participate in the program. Juniors and seniors at Kalamazoo College maynot take lower level credit at one of the other institutions without receiving special permission from the Registrar's Office prior to registration.Enrollment is considered on a "space available" basis. The College reserves the right to refuse students the ability to participate in the program. Finalapproval must be received by the Registrar's Office. Students must adhere to the policies of both the home and host institutions during the time ofinterinstitutional enrollment.Credit will be awarded to students based on the number of credits the interinstitutional course is worth at the school offering it. Courses worth 3semester credits will be awarded .9 units, and courses worth 4 semester credits will be awarded 1.2 units. Questions regarding how this affectsdegree completion should be directed to the Registrar's Office.Kalamazoo College students must be registered for a minimum of two Kalamazoo College units for the quarter in which they enroll in aninterinstitutional course and must include the course as part of a normal full-time registration. Interinstitutional courses do not count as part of theresidency requirement. The overload policy does, however, apply to the registration of interinstitutional courses; interinstutional courses worth 3 or 4semester credits will count as a full academic course regardless of course credit conversion. Students may also not register for more than twocourses at the host institution. Students are encouraged not to enroll in interinstitutional courses during the Spring quarter due to academic calendardates, housing issues, and the fulfillment of requirements for graduating seniors.Courses taken under the interinstitutional program are included in Kalamazoo College tuition charges and will appear on the Kalamazoo Collegetranscript; the grade(s) received will be calculated in the Kalamazoo College GPA.Students from WMU and KVCC wishing to take classes at Kalamazoo College under this program should submit an approved Michigan GuestStudent Application to the Registrar's Office. Applications must be submitted a minimum of 30 days prior to the start of the term.Enrollment at Kalamazoo CollegeCreditCredit is measured in terms of "units." In most cases, a course is equivalent to a single unit. Exceptions include some laboratory courses and a limitednumber of partial credit courses.Each Kalamazoo College unit is equivalent to 5 quarter hours or 3.33 semesterhours.Course LoadKalamazoo College is on the quarter system. Each quarter is composed of ten weeks of class plus an examination period for a total of eleven weeks.Students normally carry a course load of three academic units per quarter. (Academic units do not include physical education units.) This course loadenables a student to complete all graduation requirements (36 academic units and 1 physical education unit) within 12 quarters.Students may also, in certain circumstances, underload or overload.UnderloadStudents may choose to underload (take less than three units) in a given quarter in consultation with their advisor, the Office of Financial Aid, and theRegistrar. Students who are registered for fewer than 2.4 units are not considered fulltime, are ineligible for participation in intercollegiate athletics,and may be ineligible for certain forms of financial aid and insurance coverage. Students who have brought in credits/units from AP, IB, dualenrollment, or transfer may not apply these units toward a specific quarter to offset an underload. Students may carry fewer than two units onlyunder exceptional circumstances, as judged appropriate by the Dean of Students.OverloadStudents may be allowed to overload (register for four or more units in a single quarter) after completion of their first quarter of enrollment on aspace available basis (as determined by the Registrar) and on the condition that the following requirements are met:First year students: A minimum cumulative GPA of 4.00 and advisor approval are required. First-year students may not overload in their firstquarter of enrollment.Second year students: A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.50 and advisor approval are required.Third year students and seniors: No minimum GPA is required; however, students on academic probation may not overload, and seniors maynot overload in their SIP quarter. Advisor approval is required.Residency RequirementA minimum of 18 full-unit courses must be completed at Kalamazoo College, including 6 of the last 12 courses*. These minimum units exclude unitsearned on Study Abroad, study away (including GLCA programs), and interinstitutional registration.*Students on approved programs for 3/2 engineering are not subject to the requirement that 6 of the last 12 course must be at KalamazooCollege.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Withdrawal, Leaves of Absence, and Dismissal from the CollegeWithdrawalA student who wishes to withdraw from the College must contact the Associate Dean of Students in the Office of Student Development to completean exit interview and the proper paperwork. During the exit interview, the student will receive information about separating from the College andabout options for reinstatement, if appropriate. Students receiving financial aid are encouraged to meet with the Office of Financial Aid (please seethe College's refund policy in the Expenses section of this catalog for complete details about refunds and financial aid). Students withdrawing during aquarter on campus will receive a grade of W for all courses in progress at the time of withdrawal.Leave of AbsenceIn rare instances, a Leave of Absence may be granted to students experiencing significant hardship (including, but not limited to, medical, mentalhealth, or family-related issues). This is a status conferred by the Associate Dean of Students and may require documentation. Any student granted aLeave of Absence during a quarter on campus will receive a grade of W for all courses in progress at the time of withdrawal. Although the Collegeconsiders a student on a "Leave of Absence", for purposes of enrollment reporting to state and federal agencies, such a student is reported aswithdrawn/no longer enrolled. This is a requirement of student financial aid programs. Such agencies will be advised when the student is reinstatedfor continued coursework.A Leave of Absence may be granted for up to one quarter, but a student may request an extension of one additional quarter. If a student is unable toreturn after the extension, the student will be withdrawn from the institution. Reinstatement following a Leave of Absence is subject to review by theOffice of Student Development in consultation with the Health and/or Counseling staff.Academic DismissalThe Academic Standards Committee meets at the end of each quarter to review student grades. Students experiencing academic difficulties may beplaced on academic probation or, in certain cases, dismissed from the College. (See the section on Academic Progress for more information abouttypes of probation and academic dismissal.) Actions taken by the Academic Standards Committee may be appealed by submitting a petition forreconsideration. Appeals will be heard by the Academic Standards Committee, and its decision will be final.Administrative WithdrawalThe College reserves the right to administratively withdraw a student who does not return to campus for a planned on-campus quarter, whoseenrollment falls below two units, or who fails to satisfy or make arrangements to satisfy any financial obligations.Kalamazoo College is committed to the well-being and safety of its community members and to the integrity of its learning environment. The Collegemay require a student to take an administrative withdrawal or leave of absence if the Vice President for Student Development and Dean of Studentsor designee deems a withdrawal necessary to protect the health and safety of the student or others or the integrity of the learning environment andcampus community. Examples of such extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to: suicidal threats, self-starvation or purging behavior,ongoing substance abuse or addiction, serious threats of harm to others, or disruptive or destructive behavior. Similarly, a student who is notfunctioning as a student (attending classes and completing academic work) may be administratively withdrawn by the College. Before a requiredadministrative withdrawal is considered, the Vice President for Student Development and Dean of Students or designee will encourage the student totake a voluntary withdrawal.This policy and associated procedures do not take the place of disciplinary action associated with a student's behavior that is in violation of Collegepolicies, standards, or regulations. This policy is to be invoked in extraordinary circumstances in which, at the discretion of the Vice President forStudent Development and Dean of Students or designee, the regular disciplinary system cannot be applied or is not appropriate. The proceduresrelated to this policy appear in the Student Handbook.ReinstatementA student who withdraws, is withdrawn, or is dismissed from the College may apply for reinstatement. In order to return to the College from awithdrawn or leave status, a student must make a request in writing to the Office of Student Development. The College reserves the right to require,review, and approve documentation that the student is qualified and ready to return to academic work. Students applying for reinstatement must do sono later than thirty days prior to the start of their anticipated quarter of return.If a student withdrew from the College while on academic probation or was dismissed for academic reasons, the application will be forwarded to theAcademic Standards Committee for review. Students must indicate in writing how the problem that led to probation or dismissal has been resolved oraddressed.In the case of a voluntary withdrawal for medical/psychological reasons, or any administrative withdrawal under this policy related to a physical ormental health condition, the student must submit a Health Care Provider Report from a treating health professional as part of their request forreinstatement. Kalamazoo College Student Health Center and/or Counseling Center may require a release from the student to discuss currenttreatment and follow-up needs with the treating health professional, in order to assess whether the student is qualified and ready to return to theCollege and whether the College can provide the follow-up care needed to maintain the student's enrollment. Kalamazoo Health and Counselingprofessionals will review this information and recommend to the Dean of Students or designee approval (with or without conditions of treatment,education, counseling, or other) or denial of the reinstatement.After consulting with College health professionals and/or other appropriate College officials as necessary to facilitate an informed decision, the Deanof Students or designee will make the final decision about reinstatement. In all cases, in order to return to Kalamazoo College, a student's financialaccount must be in good standing and any enrollment fees paid.Students who interrupt their course of study for more than one academic year must, upon reinstatement, consult with the Office of the Registrar. TheOffice of the Registrar will make a determination about whether the student will follow the degree requirements of the Academic Catalog underwhich they were first enrolled or the catalog in effect when they are reinstated.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Registration and Student Schedule ChangesRegistrationStudents are expected to register during the designated registration periods for their next quarter on campus. Prior to registration, students arerequired to acquaint themselves with the class schedule, academic policies, procedures, and regulations in this catalog and the policies located on theRegistrar's website. The student's advisor must clear the student to register before the student is allowed to register for classes. The Registrar'sOffice reserves the right to move students from one section of a course to another to balance the sections (if requested by the department) or toaccommodate the schedules of all students registered for a particular course.A student's registration is not finalized until the student's fees are paid or arrangements for payment have been made with the business office. TheCollege reserves the right to withdraw a student for failure to meet the designated deadlines of registration. Registration may be denied a student forfailure to adhere to health center regulations (such as failure to provide proof of vaccinations or other health information as required), lack of tuitionpayment, failure to declare a major by the end of the sophomore winter quarter, or as a result of disciplinary action.Registering for the Senior Individualized Project (SIP)SIP registration, including its impact on course load, is described in detail under Senior Individualized Project in the Kalamazoo Curriculum section ofthe catalog. The SIP counts as one or two course unit(s) for the term(s) during which it is counted, but the SIP is registered via a separate processfrom class registration. The SIP registration process involves a paper form (no online registration) that must be submitted to the Registrar's office bythe student. This paper form has its own set of deadlines:SIP Quarter Registration Form DueAll SIPs involving work over the summer (as part of an extended fall term) Friday of 10th Week, Junior Spring QuarterFall and Fall/Winter SIPs  Friday of 1st Week, Senior Fall QuarterWinter SIPs Friday of 1st Week, Senior Winter QuarterAny changes to SIP registrations must be made in the Registrar's Office by the end of the drop/add period of the quarter of registration (end of thefirst week of Fall quarter for Summer and Fall units; end of the first week of Winter quarter for Winter units). These changes include dropping a SIP,changing the department or SIP supervisor, changing the number of units, etc.Independent StudyA student may register for an independent study course (198/298/398/498) in an area of interest that is not available as a regularly offered course or,under special circumstances (such as the unavailability of a required course), a student may take a regular course as an independent study. Allindependent study applications require the approval of the instructor, department chair, advisor, and Registrar. Independent Study is a full-unit course,and students may not receive credit for more than one independent study course per quarter nor for more than two independent studies during degreecompletion. Independent Study applications are due in the Registrar's Office by 5 p.m. Friday of the first week of the quarter.Credit/No Credit Option PolicyStudents in good academic standing may elect to take at most one letter-graded course on campus as CR/NC (Credit/No Credit) in any givenquarter, for a total of up to four courses over their college career.Students may elect this option for at most one course in any one department. The CR/NC grade option is not available for Shared PassageSeminars or for the final course taken to satisfy the language requirement (i.e. 103 or 201).Letter-graded courses taken as CR/NC may not count towards any major, minor, or concentration (including required cognates), nor may theysatisfy prerequisites for those course sequences that require a "C- or better," without special permission from the department.Students who take a course for a CR/NC grade may retake the course for a letter grade.Students may choose to apply the CR/NC option at any time during the course up to the end of the withdrawal period (the end of Week 8).The professor will assign a letter grade as per normal procedure, but the Registrar's Office will convert passing grades to CR and will convertan F to NC. (Professors will not be formally notified if students have taken this option.)Registering to Repeat a CourseA course in which a student earned a grade of C-, D, F, W, or NC may be repeated. If the repeated enrollment is at Kalamazoo College, bothattempts will appear on the student's transcripts, but only the most recent attempt will be used to calculate the Kalamazoo College cumulative GPA,and only one total unit of credit will be earned. Any course repeated at another institution will not affect the original course grade on the KalamazooCollege transcript and is not used in the calculation of the Kalamazoo College cumulative GPA. A student may not transfer in credit for a repeatedcourse if the student earned credit (D- or higher) for the original course. Students may not repeat a course, either at Kalamazoo College or at anotherinstitution, to replace a D or F once they have taken a higher level course.Repeating Partial-Credit CoursesPartial-credit courses, such as -2019September 21, 2018The day after the drop/add deadline for a term is the official "census date" for the quarter, when a student’s status as a full-time or part-time studentis determined based on the number of units for which the student is enrolled. All changes to a student’s class schedule must be on file in theRegistrar's office by this time. Students will receive grades for all classes that appear on the final class schedule and only for those classes.Course WithdrawalFrom the second week through the eighth week of a quarter, students may exercise their option to withdraw from a course. After eighth weekstudents may not withdraw from a course, although they may withdraw from the College. When a student withdraws from a course the courseremains on the student's transcript with a grade of a W. Because the course remains on the transcript, the financial aid full-time enrollmentrequirement is still met for almost all programs. Note that Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress standards must also be met (see theFinancial Aid Policies section in this catalog). In addition to the implications for financial aid, students should be aware that course withdrawal mayaffect a student's medical insurance coverage, athletic eligibility, study abroad eligibility, sequencing of classes, and timely completion of degreerequirements.Students may not withdraw below two units in any given quarter. Students experiencing serious health difficulties, a family emergency, or some otherextraordinary circumstance outside the students' control should meet with the Dean of Students to discuss possibly withdrawing from the College,Underloading, or other options. (See the sections on Underloading, Withdrawals, and Leaves of Absence for more information.)Registering to Audit a CourseStudents may audit a course with permission of the instructor. There is no official registration or notation on the transcript. There is no audit fee forregistered Kalamazoo College students.Registration and Study AbroadSee the section on Study Abroad for information on choosing courses while on study abroad and for information on how credit from those courses isapplied to a student's transcript. Students register for their first quarter on campus after study abroad in the usual way. They should contact theiradvisor for course selection approval and then register online during the registration period in the prior quarter.Grading PracticesGradesThe grade point system at Kalamazoo College is:Final Grade  Quality PointsA   4.00    (excellent)A-  3.67B+  3.33B  3.00    (above average)B-  2.67C+  2.33C    2.00    (average)C-  1.67D+  1.33D  1.00    (below average) F  0.00    (failure)CR (credit), NC (no credit), H (honors), IP (in progress), W (withdraw), and I (incomplete) do not affect the grade point average (GPA).Grade ReportsGrade reports are made available online to students at the end of each quarter. Printed copies are available upon request. Copies of grade reports willbe sent to parents only if students present a signed statement of request to the Registrar.Course AttendanceAttendance is the responsibility of the student and is regulated within each course. Faculty members may report to the Early Alert Committee thosestudents whose absences may be impairing their performances.Final ExaminationsExaminations are held at the end of each quarter for most courses. Students and faculty are required to follow the exam schedule as set by theRegistrar. However, if a student has three final exams scheduled for the same date, one of these exams may be changed by making appropriatearrangements with one of the instructors.Incomplete GradesAn I (incomplete) is recorded when work is of acceptable quality but has not been finished because of illness or other extraordinary circumstanceoutside the student's control. If the work has not been completed by the end of the sixth week of the next quarter, the instructor should submit thegrade the student had earned by the end of the quarter. This deadline applies whether the student is on or off campus or has left the College.If a student has been granted a Leave of Absence after the end of a quarter in which he/she has received an incomplete, the incomplete deadline willbe extended for one quarter. In this circumstance, the incomplete grade will be due by Friday at 5:00pm week six of the quarter following the firstquarter in which the student is on a Leave of Absence. There are no exceptions to this extension unless the student petitions and receives approvalfrom the Academic Standards Committee.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Change of GradeStudents seeking a grade change should contact the course instructor responsible for the grade issued. Both students and faculty should understandthat a change in an assigned grade should reflect only identifiable and distinct errors in the evaluation process. Students should initiate thisprocess as soon as possible and no later than the end of the sixth week of the following quarter or within six weeks after graduation or withdrawalfrom the College. Faculty who identify an error in grading should submit a change of grade form to the Registrar within one year of the originalrecording. After one year, the transcript record is considered the permanent record.Cumulative GPAAll courses taken at Kalamazoo College are included in the calculation of the cumulative Kalamazoo College grade point average (GPA), except theSIP, PE activities, other credit/no credit (CR/NC) courses, and repeated courses. When a student repeats a course (for which they received a C-, D,F, W, or NC), both attempts will appear on the student's transcript but only the second attempt will be used to calculate the Kalamazoo Collegecumulative GPA, and only one course unit will be earned. (See the section on Registering to Repeat a Course for more information). Transfercourses and courses taken on study abroad/study away do not affect the cumulative GPA.Academic ProgressClassificationStudents may be classified by unit status, by entering cohort, or by expected graduation year, depending on the context. For enrollment verificationpurposes, unit completion is the sole determinant of class status. Students must receive 36 academic units to graduate, or 9 units per year, plus onephysical education unit. The unit status classification used for enrollment verification is as follows:First-Year: 0–7 academic units*Sophomore: 8–16 academic unitsJunior: 17–25 academic unitsSenior: 26 academic units and above* First-year students who bring in AP, IB, dual enrollment, or transfer credits are reclassified, as appropriate, at the end of the first year.After the first year, a student's unit status is adjusted each quarter; the expected graduation year is adjusted as necessary, usually at thecompletion of the spring quarter.Good StandingStudents who are not on academic probation are considered to be in good standing at Kalamazoo College. Students should be aware that maintaininggood academic standing does not ensure continued financial aid eligibility. Grades of NC or W may also affect an award. Please refer to theFinancial Assistance section of this catalog for more information.Dean's ListStudents who earn a term GPA of 3.5 or better for a full-time course load of at least 3 units, without failing or withdrawing from any course, will beplaced on the Dean's List. Students who elect to take a letter-graded course as credit/no credit (CR/NC) or receive an F, NC, or W grade are noteligible for Dean's List consideration during that quarter. Students with I or IP grades will be considered for Dean's List upon receipt of the finalgrades. Dean's List recognition is posted on students' transcripts.Honor SocietiesThe College invites qualified first-year students to join the Alpha Lambda Delta national scholastic freshman honorary society.Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest honorary scholarship society in the United States, has a chapter at Kalamazoo College, Delta of Michigan.

Students must also demonstrate good character in order tobe considered for election.Monitoring Academic ProgressThe Academic Standards Committee meets at the end of each quarter to review the grades of all students. If a student appears to be havingacademic difficulties, as indicated by withdrawn courses, poor grades as compared to previous work, or failing grades, the committee may issue awarning letter through the Registrar or may place the student on academic probation. The Academic Standards Committee may place students onacademic probation whenever their cumulative GPA falls below 2.00. Placing a student on academic probation is notification that the student is nolonger in Good Academic Standing and needs to take immediate action to improve academic performance.First-Year Academic WarningStudents placed on "First-Year Academic Warning" must be First Year Students at the end of their first quarter. Students may be given this statusinstead of probation if their cumulative GPA falls between a 1.67 and 1.99 GPA after the first quarter. Students must improve their cumulative GPAto a 2.0 or better in the subsequent quarter to demonstrate academic progress. Students on First-Year Academic Warning should meet with theiracademic advisor within the first two weeks of the subsequent quarter and as needed thereafter in order to develop strategies for success. It is thestudent's responsibility to seek this assistance and ensure progress toward degree completion. Students are encouraged to seek assistance throughvarious support services, including the learning centers, subject tutoring through supplemental instruction and individual departments, careercounseling and testing through the Career and Professional Development Center, and personal counseling through the Office of StudentDevelopment. Failure to meet this requirement will result in academic probation (see probation levels below). "First-Year Academic Warning" statusdoes not apply to transfer students.Academic Probation Level IStudents on academic probation should meet with their academic advisor within the first two weeks of the subsequent quarter and as neededthereafter in order to develop strategies for success. It is the student's responsibility to seek this assistance and ensure progress toward degreecompletion. Students are encouraged to seek assistance through various support services, including the learning centers, subject tutoring throughsupplemental instruction and individual departments, career counseling and testing through the Career and Professional Development Center, andpersonal counseling through the Office of Student Development. Failure to meet these responsibilities may result in continued or final probation ordismissal from the College. Student athletes placed on academic probation will be ineligible to participate in MIAA/NCAA sports.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Academic Probation Level IIIn addition to the conditions from "Academic Probation Level I" students placed on "Academic Probation Level II" must be enrolled in and completethree letter-graded courses in the next quarter of residence and earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 for the quarter.

NOTE: Kalamazoo College cannot waive GPAor other eligibility requirements established by other programs. Therefore, only certain Kalamazoo-sponsored study abroad programs may beavailable to these students. The final decision regarding admission to and participation in specific programs rests with the Executive Director of theCenter for International Programs and host institutions abroad. The Executive Director reserves the right to deny participation in study abroad/studyaway when students' actions either on or off campus raise doubt that they are ready for an international study experience or prepared to representKalamazoo College appropriately.Students on academic probation, or who have a history of significant disciplinary problems, are not eligible to participate in the study abroad/study awayprogram. All incomplete grades must be resolved prior to departure for study abroad/study away. All students participating in long-term or extended-term study abroad programs must have junior standing (a minimum of 17 Kalamazoo College academic course credits; note, this excludes PE or appliedmusic credit).

The Center staff will assist by providing the student a clear description of the physical and emotionalrequirements of the program as well as the accommodations that could be available. The student will be asked to provide the Center staff with a cleardescription of the accommodations which the student believes will be necessary for the student to meet the requirements of the program as well as a listof the accommodations provided the student by Kalamazoo College.  The Center staff will determine the availability of those or other reasonableaccommodations at the program location. The student's acceptance into a specific study abroad/study away program is contingent upon thedetermination to the Executive Director's satisfaction that reasonable accommodations are available at that program location.Study Abroad/Study Away Application, Selection, and PlacementStudents must meet specific requirements and deadlines in order to be eligible to participate in any study abroad/study away program. Theserequirements differ from program to program, but for all of them prospective participants must fill out and submit required application materials, whichare available on the CIP website and in the CIP. Students must complete a Kalamazoo College study abroad/study away application and, in most cases,will also need to complete additional materials for the host institution or university. Incomplete applications will be considered late and will not beprocessed until completed. Application materials will be forwarded by the CIP office to the appropriate study abroad/study away programs.Information on specific program requirements and applications is available online. With the exception of a single required foreign language course,students must meet all study abroad requirements at the time they apply and continue to meet the set requirements prior to departure. Academicperformance and probationary status for violations of the student code of conduct will be evaluated by CIP staff following each quarter prior todeparture for study abroad/study away.Students may only apply for one study abroad/study away program at a time, regardless of the application deadline of that program. If a student is notadmitted into his or her first choice study abroad program, the CIP will assist the student in applying for another study abroad program for which he orshe is eligible and in which there is space available.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Participants are admitted to specific study abroad/study away programs based upon student qualifications, program capacities, and other conditionsdeemed relevant by the Executive Director of the Center for International Programs. Students meeting the College's and any program-specific eligibilityrequirements are selected for participation in the study abroad/study away program on the basis of such items as their cumulative grade point average,their grades in the appropriate foreign language (where applicable), the strength of the required essay(s), faculty letters of recommendation, anevaluation of the transcript, and other information provided in their application and their College records. The Center for International Programs mayalso require applicants to be interviewed.Transfer students should expect that their previous academic work will be reviewed as part of the selection process and must supply the Center with anofficial transcript from their previous institution(s) at the time of application. The Office of the Registrar cannot release copies of non-KalamazooCollege transcripts. A combined transfer and Kalamazoo GPA will be used to determine eligibility.Applications for participation in the winter quarter short-term study abroad programs are due on Thursday of the third week of fall quarter. Applicationsfor participation in Spring short-term study abroad programs are due eighth week of fall quarter; applications for participation in long-or extended-termstudy abroad programs are due in the Center third week of winter quarter. Failure to turn in the completed application materials by the due dates willjeopardize a student's participation in study abroad. Study Away application deadlines can be found in the CIP office and on the CIP website.Study Abroad Foreign Language PrerequisitesStudents who desire a university-integrated experience, in which they take classes with host country students in French-, German-, or Spanish-speakingprograms, must have advanced proficiency in the appropriate foreign language equivalent to at least level 202 or 203.  Students who have proficiency ina foreign language through level 201 will most typically take courses in the target language but offered through a language and culture institute forforeign students attached to or otherwise affiliated with a university.Students who have already taken the required minimum level of foreign language for their study abroad program are encouraged to maintain their levelof proficiency during the time before departure. Students will not receive credit for a language course abroad equivalent to one already taken atKalamazoo College.Students choosing the spring short-term study abroad option may not have proficiency in the language of the Study Abroad program greater than fourunits (level 202) of that language and must have a minimum proficiency equivalent to 2 units (102). Most short-term programs can only offer courses atthe 201-203 level and are thus not appropriate academically for students with higher levels of foreign language proficiency.Students who are not able to complete the program's language requirement prior to the conclusion of the last quarter on campus before study abroadmay be placed on conditional admission status until proof of completion has been received and approved by the language department and the Registrar.Study Abroad/Study Away FeesFor Kalamazoo College students participating in a long-term Kalamazoo College study abroad program, the comprehensive fee for 2018-2019 is$38,612; for an extended-term Kalamazoo College program, the 2018-2019 fee is $57,918.

Students may beable to manage on less than these amounts if they budget carefully and restrict independent travel. Many study abroad/study away programs requireparticipants to accept financial obligations that are not covered by the Kalamazoo College comprehensive fee. Students should consult specific programinformation for details.Study Abroad/Study Away Billing and PaymentPayments for study abroad/study away programs are made according to the regular college tuition payment schedule. For specific billing dates, contactthe Kalamazoo College Student Accounts Office.All student accounts, including fees, must be cleared before students can leave for study abroad/study away. Final departure packets will not bereleased unless student accounts are paid in full or appropriate arrangements have been made through the Kalamazoo College Student AccountsOffice. Non-payment of the comprehensive fee installments will jeopardize a student's continuing participation in the program and may result inwithdrawal or dismissal from the program.Study Abroad Financial Assistance/ScholarshipsInternational education is supported at Kalamazoo College by a number of generous gifts, including the S. Rudolph Light Endowment and the ArcusGay and Lesbian Fund Study Abroad Endowment. For Kalamazoo College students receiving Kalamazoo College financial assistance/scholarships, thisaid is available for those programs that appear in the "approved for transfer of academic credit and Kalamazoo financial assistance/scholarships"category of the List of Study Abroad Programs. The term "limited financial aid" indicates that state and federal funds are fully available, but institutionalfunding (including GLCA tuition remission) will not be credited.For a list of outside scholarships and/or fellowships available to college students, please see the "Scholarships" page on the CIP website. KalamazooCollege students with demonstrated financial need as determined by the Kalamazoo College Office of Financial Aid may be eligible to receive a travelsubsidy for their study abroad program. More information on travel subsidies is available in the Travel Subsidy FAQs on the CIP website.Work/Study: No employment is available to students while on study abroad. Students travel overseas on a student visa that specifically prevents themfrom seeking employment or earning money while they are in that country: If work/study is part of their financial aid package, students should consultthe Office of Financial Aid and should find an alternative source for those funds for the quarters spent abroad.Study Abroad Pre-Departure OrientationCIP staff members recognize that an important first step in preparing for the study abroad experience is for participants to have an opportunity to learnmore information about their study abroad program. During the quarter preceding study abroad participation, CIP and other College staff members offerquestion-answer sessions as well as formal meetings providing information about the academic structure of the programs abroad, health and safetyinformation, and details about logistical components of the program. Where feasible, study abroad returnees as well visiting international students willcontribute to sessions to help students prepare to make the most of their time abroad. Kalamazoo students must attend all mandatory study abroadorientation workshops and sessions, sign up for/or complete and submit all signature or material submission documents, and read all learning contentmaterial in the Hornet Passport, the College online study abroad/away application and information system. Students are also encouraged to participate inoptional workshops, which provide additional information and preparation. Failure to attend these mandatory sessions or complete required orientationassignments may result in the student's withdrawal from study abroad.Academic Credit from Study Abroad/Study AwayAll academic work completed in the study abroad/study away program is certified by the Executive Director of the Center for International Programsand the Registrar and is recorded on the Kalamazoo College academic transcript on the basis of examinations and reports supplied by supervisors andteachers abroad. Study abroad/study away credits may be used to satisfy graduation requirements. Major, minor, or concentration requirements are atthe discretion of departmental faculty. Credit distribution for other College graduation requirements is determined by the Registrar. When registering forcourses abroad, students should direct inquiries regarding such credits accordingly. Students are encouraged to obtain approval from the department inadvance if a student wishes to use a course from study abroad/study away to satisfy requirements for a major, minor, or concentration. KalamazooCollege students are eligible to earn three Kalamazoo College units of credit for a short-term program, six units for a long-term program, and nine unitsfor an extended-term program. Once students have completed the study abroad/study away program and (where necessary) consulted with theRegistrar, the appropriate grades and credits will be recorded on the transcript. Only those courses from study abroad/study away which are within the"Liberal Arts Tradition" of the College will be accepted for credit.Independent Study on Study Abroad/Study AwayNo independent study for credit, including "distance education" courses, may be pursued in any study abroad/study away program without advanceapproval from the Executive Director of the Center for International Programs.Grades from Study Abroad/Study AwayAll grades earned on study abroad/study away fall within the College's general policies on transfer credit. Study abroad/study away grades will bereviewed, translated, and certified by the Center for International Programs and will be recorded by the Registrar on the official Kalamazoo Collegetranscript according to the Kalamazoo A, B, C grading system. Grades from study abroad/study away courses will not be counted in the student'sKalamazoo grade point average. To receive credit for a study abroad/study away course, students must earn a C or better according to the localgrading scale. (Note: Courses taken as "pass/fail" on study abroad will not be transferred.) Credits will normally be listed on the Kalamazoo Collegetranscript with the same academic rubric used at the foreign institution; for example, a class listed as a "History" course will be listed as a "History"course on the Kalamazoo transcript. A student who believes that, for instance, a course listed as "Art History" at a foreign institution should be listed as"History" on the Kalamazoo transcript should appeal to the Executive Director of the Center for International Programs and the Kalamazoo CollegeRegistrar. In consultation with the department affected and after examining a syllabus of the course completed abroad, the Executive Director andRegistrar will determine how the course should be described on the transcript.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Students seeking a grade change for a course taken on study abroad/study away must petition the Center for International Programs no later than sixweeks following notification of their grades.

Students must enroll in the required numberof courses as specified by Kalamazoo College and cannot exceed or reduce the required number of courses in the program without the writtenpermission of the Executive Director of the Center for International Programs. Approved course withdrawals will be noted on the transcript with a "W".If a petition for a course withdrawal is made on the basis of medical reasons, appropriate documentation and the signature of a health care provider isrequired. The availability of "extra credits" in the form of AP and/or dual-enrollment credits will not be accepted as a sufficient reason for coursewithdrawal.Students wishing to withdraw from a course must first submit the "Course Withdrawal Form" to the CIP. Approved withdrawal petitions will be sent bythe CIP to the study abroad/study away partner institution.Change of Student Status: Study Abroad/Study AwayStudents who decide not to participate in the program after being admitted will be required to pay any costs incurred on their behalf (including, but notlimited to, moneys advanced on their behalf for nonrefundable deposits at other institutions, airfare, legal documents, visa and application fees, housingdeposits, host university tuition, etc.). Students who leave the program with the permission of the Executive Director of the Center for InternationalPrograms after the program abroad has begun may be entitled to a partial refund as specified in the College's policies. Students will still be responsiblefor covering any non-recoverable costs paid on their behalf. Eligibility for possible refunds will be computed according to the on-campus calendar.These students may be eligible to receive grades of W (withdrawal) on the Kalamazoo College academic transcript or depending on the date ofdeparture, be eligible for a change of status from study abroad/study away to on-campus student. Students who leave the program without earning anyacademic credit will be withdrawn from the College. Students will be charged for any non-recoverable costs paid on their behalf and they will besubject to the withdrawal policies of the College.Students who wish to travel home for a personal or family emergency must notify the Executive Director of the Center for International Programs, ordesignee, and complete a "temporary leave of absence" form.Dismissal from Study Abroad/Study AwayApplication to and acceptance into the study abroad/study away program is separate from admission to the College. Participation in study abroad atKalamazoo College requires that students meet eligibility criteria as well as exercise responsible judgment and behavior. The Executive Director of theCenter for International Programs or designee may dismiss students from the study abroad/study away program for violations of College policy and/orregulations, disruptive behavior or conduct which could bring the program into disrepute, misuse and/or abuse of alcohol or drugs, medical or academicgrounds, or behavior that poses a danger to the student or others.When students accept their admission to the study abroad/study away program, they agree to abide by the policies and regulations set forth in the StudyAbroad Handbook, the Academic Catalog, and other relevant Kalamazoo College publications. Of particular importance for students participating instudy abroad is the "Statement of Social Behavior" from the Study Abroad Handbook that states, in part, that acceptable behavior includes compliancewith local laws and regulations, host university policies and regulations (including local housing regulations and policies), and adherence to the socialpatterns of the homestay family (or local housing placement) and the local community. Any behavior that, in the judgment of the Executive Director ofthe Center for International Programs, causes pain or discomfort to others, reflects discredit on the individual or upon the College, or poses a danger tothe individual student or to others is considered unacceptable and may subject the offender to immediate administrative action by the Executive Directorof the Center for International Programs including, but not limited to, immediate dismissal from the study abroad/study away program. Immediateadministrative action may also be required for behavior or medical conditions which affect a participant's ability to perform the essential functions of astudent.Students who are dismissed from the study abroad/study away program will be withdrawn from their courses overseas and receive a grade of W foreach course. They will also be removed from their program-provided housing and will be expected to return to the home country.  Examples of studentbehavior while on study abroad/study away that may lead to immediate administrative action by the Executive Director of the Center for InternationalPrograms or designee include, but are not limited to, illegal drug use, abuse of alcohol, failure to attend class and/or other required academic activities,hitchhiking, unauthorized absence from the study abroad/study away program, unauthorized changes in housing, arrest for infractions of local laws, andviolations of Kalamazoo College policies. Furthermore, the Center for International Programs reserves the right to notify the parents of any studentwhose behavior abroad, which in the judgment of the Executive Director, is unacceptable or in violation of study abroad/study away and/or Collegepolicy.

Residential living is supportive of one'sacademic preparation and plays an integral role in one’s experiential education, providing rich opportunities for involvement and development. Therefore,Kalamazoo College requires all students to reside within the College's residential system and board at the College's dining center through the WinterQuarter of their Junior year.To be eligible for campus housing students must be enrolled full-time (at least two units) for the term of residence, and be at least 16 years of age at thetime campus residency begins. Students under the age of 16 are not eligible to live in on-campus housing.All first-year students and visiting international students must live in the College's residential system and board at the College's diningcenter for their first three quarters.Exceptions for first-year students are made for:married studentsstudents with childrenstudents who are at least 23 years oldstudents who are under the age of 16Transfers: All transfer students shall be treated per their student classification (see below)All sophomores and juniors must live in the College's residential system and board at the College's dining center.Exceptions are made for:married studentsstudents with childrenstudents who are at least 23 years oldstudents who are under the age of 16students commuting from the primary residence of parents or guardians within 30 minutes or 30 miles of the Collegestudents released by the College's Petition CommitteeExceptions to the board plan only are made for:residents of campus apartments and the Living/Learning Housing Units (who may carry a board plan if they wish)those released by the College's Petition CommitteeSeniors are not required to live on campus. Juniors and seniors will be housed on campus on a space available basis only. Juniors and seniors whochoose to live on campus must carry a board plan unless they are:residents of the Living/Learning Housing Units and campus apartments (who may carry a board plan if they wish)Several campus housing options are available. Residence halls are coed by area or floor, with single, double, or triple rooms as well as suites. TenLiving/Learning Housing Units allow groups of seven to nine students to arrange their housing around a particular educational focus and initiateprogramming to enrich their own experience and that of the wider campus.The primary purpose of our residential campus is to develop and maintain an atmosphere that promotes academic, personal, and social growth. Workingwith students, the College assumes the responsibility for standards of occupancy and the proper care of the residence halls. All on-campus housing issupervised by professional staff members and student resident assistants under the supervision of the Director of Residential Life.Students with DisabilitiesIn compliance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended, and with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),Kalamazoo College recognizes that qualified students who have diagnosed or identified learning, physical, and emotional disabilities are entitled to thesame benefits from the educational programs of the College. Kalamazoo College is committed to making every effort to providing reasonableaccommodations, unless that imposes an undue hardship or burden. The Associate Dean of Students and the student will work together to negotiate andensure appropriate accommodations that will work for the student. Cost associated with diagnosis, evaluation, and testing is the responsibility of thestudent, except in cases of severe financial need demonstrated to, and upon recommendation of, the Associate Dean of Students.The office also makes assistance available to students experiencing short-term illness or physical injury.Kalamazoo College has the right to: Deny a request for accommodations, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids and services if the documentationdemonstrates that the request is not warranted or if the individual fails to provide appropriate documentation.Please direct questions to the Associate Dean of Students Office.Procedure1. Upon enrollment or upon receiving an assessment that verifies a disability, a student must make an appointment with the Associate Dean ofStudents/Disability Services Coordinator to discuss the disability and the process for receiving accommodations. It will be imperative to bring orsend ahead the medical verification of the disability.2. You must provide a copy of the medical documentation and any recommendations about necessary accommodations that are included. If theassessment does not provide the necessary information with which to determine accommodations or if the assessment is more than three yearsold, the Associate Dean of Students may ask for additional assessment.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 20183. The Associate Dean of Students/Disability Services Coordinator will review the assessment. The student and Associate Dean of Students willthen enter into negotiations to determine appropriate accommodations. One should not assume that specific accommodations offered in highschool would necessarily be offered by the College.4. The Associate Dean of Students/Disability Services Coordinator will communicate in writing to the student the approved accommodations.5. Each quarter, the Associate Dean of Students/Disability Services Coordinator will send a letter requesting specific accommodations to thefaculty of courses in which the student is registered unless the student requests that this step not be taken.6. If the accommodations do not seem to be working, the student shall contact the Associate Dean of Students/Disability Services Coordinator, andthey will work together to discover why the accommodations are not working and to develop additional or different accommodations if thatbecomes necessary.Student Responsibilities:Be sure to read and understand your responsibilities in the partnership to provide you full access to Kalamazoo College's educational opportunities. Youmay also benefit from general suggestions for being a successful student.Student Registration:For registration assistance, please read registration information for students with disabilities.Will Graduation Requirements Change Because of Disabilities?  No.We believe that teaching within a course can be modified to address particular disabilities by providing reasonable accommodations. Students,regardless of their disability, in most cases can successfully master the material of courses and meet graduation requirements. Should a student havequestions about the process of seeking accommodations, please contact the Associate Dean of Students and Disability Services Coordinator at (269)337-7209. Kalamazoo College uses several assistive technologies to assist students with disabilities access resources in classrooms and in the library.Resources AvailableLibraryThere is barrier-free access.All floors are accessible by elevator. Visually impaired students would need staff assistance.Staff assistance may be required for retrieving materials from upper shelves.Several internet workstations are available for seated users.Media CenterAudiotapes, tape recorders, and an audio lab are available to visually impaired students.A text and image enlarger is available to visually impaired students.The video collection includes some tapes with subtitles.Sound amplification equipment is available.A transmitter and six assistive listening devices to help overcome background noise can be used in Dalton, Stetson, and the Recital Hall.The Media Center is accessible by elevator.Computer Center/Computer LabsComputer labs in Dewing, Olds/Upton, Hicks Center and Dow are accessible by elevator.Tables in the computer labs will accommodate wheelchairs.Specialized equipment is not available in the computer labs.Media Center staff can help determine appropriate equipment for the College to purchase.Social Policies and RegulationsWhen a student accepts admission to Kalamazoo College, the student agrees to live by a set of mutually held principles defined as the Honor System.The faculty and staff of the College, in return, agree to treat the students by the same principles. Policies and regulations, including the Student Code ofConduct, interpret the broad principles of the Honor System. Students are expected to acquaint themselves with these regulations and to abide by themboth in spirit and in practice, whether enrolled in on-campus or off-campus programs. Failure to live within the College's policies and regulations, thuswithin the spirit of the Honor System, will result in administrative action or action through the Student Conduct Process.Enforcement Authority and ResponsibilityThe Board of Trustees gives authority for administering the College to the President. The President delegates to the Provost and the faculty theauthority to determine the curriculum of the College and the academic processes, policies, and regulations that define the academic structure. ThePresident delegates administrative responsibility for particular programs, activities, and processes to the administrative officers of those programs.Social policies and regulations and the Student Conduct Process are under the jurisdiction of the Vice President of Student Development andDean of Students. Violations of social policies and regulations are addressed by the VP/Dean of Students, deans or directors of programs, orthrough the Student Conduct Process.Academic policies and regulations are under the jurisdiction of the Provost and the faculty. Violations are addressed by individual faculty, bycommittees of the faculty, by directors of programs, by the Registrar, by the Provost or his/her representatives, or through the Student ConductProcess.Administrative procedures, policies, and regulations are under the jurisdiction of specific program directors and administrative officers. Thosedirectors and administrative officers address violations.Students will be treated with procedural fairness within each of these respective systems in accordance with procedures communicated through theStudent Code of Conduct, College policies and regulations, the Academic Catalog, or specific documents from the offices or programs.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Relationship to Governmental Law Enforcement UnitsThe College reserves the right to determine whether violations of municipal, state, or federal laws are also actionable under the College's HonorStatement, Student Code of Conduct, standards, policies, or regulations. Therefore, students who are cited or arrested and/or charged by lawenforcement authorities may be notified that College action is also pending. College policies and regulations are not designed to replicate state or federallaws, but rather to address student conduct under the Honor System, the Student Code of Conduct, and the College's policies and regulations, and toensure an appropriate educational environment for all community members. Thus, College proceedings need not await the outcome of civil or criminalproceedings. Since the Fourteenth Amendment does not refer to or place restrictions upon private action, private institutions of higher education likeKalamazoo College are not bound by the prohibitions in the Fourteenth Amendment. Such private institutions are not in a constitutional relationship withtheir students unless they are in some way acting on behalf of the state.In cases where students have allegedly violated both campus regulations and statutory laws, the College may be faced with a situation where it musttake action on its Student Code of Conduct prior to action by the courts. This does not constitute double jeopardy for the student, since the campus andthe community are two separate jurisdictions and the College is not making either legal or criminal determinations, but determinations about theappropriateness of student conduct within its community. Therefore, the proceedings are independent of one another and one need not await theoutcome of the other. The College is maintaining its integrity by lawfully determining whether sanctions may be appropriate and/or whether the studentis fit to continue in the academic community. Kalamazoo College reserves the right to take such action in cases where the College determines that thestudent's presence on campus may endanger or disrupt others or the College community.Jurisdiction. In the course of their education, students are members of multiple communities and hold multiple citizenships, including on study abroad,at internships, student teaching, on SIPs, etc. The College reserves the right to determine whether violations of municipal, state, or federal laws, orviolations of the standards or policies of universities or countries abroad also constitute a violation of College standards and regulations. Therefore,students who are cited or arrested and charged by law enforcement authorities or are charged or disciplined by institutions, municipalities, or countriesabroad may be notified that College disciplinary action is also pending. Further, the College reserves the right to take action on behavior off campus thatviolates College standards and regulations, adversely affects the lawful educational mission of the institution, or has endangered or disrupted others.Consequences of ViolationsAdministrative or faculty action, or action through the Student Conduct Process will result from violations of the Honor System, the Student Code ofConduct, or the policies and regulations of the College. Responsive action can include suspension or expulsion from the College; limitation of access toprograms, activities, or housing; restriction of privileges; imposition of new requirements; required community service; or community restitution hours, toname a few. Actions are designed to educate a student about the responsibilities of membership within an educational community. However, whenthose efforts fail, the recourse is to rescind the privilege to attend this College.Acting under the authority of the Board of Trustees, the President of Kalamazoo College (or designate) may, on an interim basis, suspend or expel anystudent whose conduct is detrimental to the well-being of the College or members of the College community. In such circumstances, the proceduresemployed in responding to violations of College policy may be suspended in the event of a crisis or a threat to the safety, health, or well-being ofmembers of the College community.Title IXKalamazoo College is committed to creating and maintaining a community in which students, faculty, and staff can work together in an atmosphere freefrom all forms of discrimination. Kalamazoo College is strongly opposed to discrimination, including sexual harassment, and such behavior is prohibitedby College policy.Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides that:"No person i the United States shall, on basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discriminationunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . " 20 U.S.C.  § 1681 and 34 C.F.R. Part 106 (1972).What does this mean?Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex or gender identity of students and employees of educational institutions that receive federal financialassistance. Each college or university receiving federal financial assistance must designate at least one professional employee as its Title IXCoordinator. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for monitoring the overall implementation of Title IX.What does Title IX apply to?Title IX applies to every aspect of education from a student's application until their graduation, including course offerings, counseling, financialassistance, student health, student housing, marital and parental status of students, physical education and athletics, student conduct involving sexualharassment, educational programs and activities, and student employment.What does sex/gender discrimination mean?Title IX prohibits sexual misconduct, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation, and other behaviors when gender- or sex-based. All studentsand employees are covered under Title IX, including people who are female, male, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transgender, and of any genderidentity or gender expression.What if I have questions?If you have further questions about Title IX, please contact Ellen Lassiter Collier, Director of Gender Equity, via email at ellen.lassitercollier@kzoo.eduor by phone 269.337.7480.Additional information about the College's policies and procedures for addressing sex and gender discrimination can be found in the Policy AgainstHarassment:  https://reason.kzoo.edu/hr/policies/genemploy/harassment/KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Kalamazoo CurriculumThe Kalamazoo CurriculumFor fifty years, Kalamazoo College’s distinctive K-Plan has served as the foundation and focal point of the College's curriculum. The original fourcomponents -- on-campus instruction, career service internships, foreign study, and the senior individualized project -- have remained at the heart of theK-Plan experience, augmented and enhanced by new opportunities such as service learning, externships, social justice leadership, and interculturalresearch projects. Throughout a half century, however, the underlying principles of the K-Plan have remained unchanged:    * Depth and breadth in the liberal arts;    * Learning through experience;    * International and intercultural engagement, especially through study abroad; and    * Independent scholarship, culminating in the Senior Individualized Project (SIP).Following these principles, students construct individualized K-Plans combining activities that reflect and expand their own interests. Some activities willintegrate multiple K-Plan components, since the principles suffuse and reinforce one another. For example, students may experience depth and breadthin the liberal arts while on study abroad, intercultural engagement through service learning, independent scholarship while participating in a summerinternship, or experiential learning while conducting their SIP. Thus, rather than narrowly prescribing a single path for students to follow frommatriculation to graduation, the guiding principles in the K-Plan encourage students to navigate their own path to an individualized, integrated liberal artseducation, and provides a structure to support them while doing so.Exploration Across the Liberal ArtsThe K-Plan and its general education curriculum encourage student exploration within the liberal arts through a variety of unique opportunities, bothon campus and off. Students engage with new ideas, new experiences, new perspectives, and new places as they explore diverse disciplines, avariety of cultures, and possible careers. This exploration enables them to expand their intellectual horizons and to broaden their perspective on theirparticular field of interest. Before each registration period, students meet with their academic advisors to discuss their plans for pursuing an educationthat balances pursuing new interests, further developing and integrating existing interests, and studying at least one discipline in depth through a major.Students may also broaden their learning experience by studying a second discipline or an interdisciplinary field in depth through a major or minor.Students who wish to be considered for election to Phi Beta Kappa must demonstrate a knowledge of mathematics, take a wide variety of coursesoutside the major, and must include courses in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.Shared PassagesAll students take three Shared Passage courses.First-year Seminars constitute the gateway to the K-Plan and to college life for entering students, while also serving as the foundation of the SharedPassages Program. Offered in Fall quarter, First-Year Seminars are designed to orient students to college-level learning, with particular emphasis oncritical thinking, writing, and speaking. In keeping with Kalamazoo College's emphasis on intercultural education, they aim to engage students in thestudy of significant social and historical differences. They integrate collaborative and group work, effective research strategies and discussions, allpromoting active, engaged learning. They work to accustom students to modes of academic behavior likely to promote success in college, includingclass participation, productive approaches to assignments, visits to faculty members' offices, and awareness of support structures for K students.First-Year Seminars are linked to academic advising, the First-Year Experience program, Upjohn Library, and the Writing Center. They createconnections with the components of the K-Plan; depth and breadth in the liberal arts, learning through experience, international and interculturalengagement, and independent scholarship.Transfer students and students who do not pass the First-Year Seminar must work with the Registrar's Office who will, in consultation with theAssociate Provost and Dean of the First Year Class, determine how the First-Year Seminar requirement will be met.Sophomore seminars build upon the learning goals of the First-Year Seminars, focusing on a particular topic or question viewed from multipleperspectives. Learning goals include intercultural proficiency and the ability to differentiate between observation and interpretation (both critical skillsfor study abroad and experiential education in general), as well as enhanced writing and oral presentation abilities. As in the First-Year Seminars,information literacy and enhanced research skills remain a key component of Shared Passages.Students who transfer to the College after the sophomore year and students who do not pass the sophomore seminar must work with the Registrar'sOffice who will, in consultation with the Associate Provost and Dean of the Sophomore Class, identify an appropriate substitution.Senior-level courses in the Shared Passages Program focus on integrating students' Kalamazoo College experiences and preparing them for livesbeyond 'K.' Disciplinary senior seminars integrate students' experiences inside and outside a particular major, while interdisciplinary senior seminarsprovide a liberal arts capstone experience, allowing students from a variety of majors to apply diverse aspects of their Kalamazoo College educationto a specific topic or problem.Students who do not pass their senior seminar may find that completion of their degree is delayed. They must work with the Registrar's Office, inconsultation with the Associate Provost and Dean of the Senior Class, to identify an appropriate substitution. If the senior seminar was also arequirement for the major, the student must work with the department chair to determine what is required to complete the major.Students on approved 3/2 engineering or health professions early entry programs are required to meet the senior capstone requirement by workingwith the director of their program at Kalamazoo College to identify a single capstone course at the approved school that reasonably fits the publishedsenior capstone guidelines. Upon transfer of the credit for this course back to Kalamazoo College, the student will have completed the seniorcapstone requirement.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Foreign Language Learning and ProficiencyKalamazoo College is dedicated not only to international education and study abroad but also to proficiency in a second language. All studentsconsequently are required to demonstrate at least an intermediate--â€level proficiency in a language other than English.Proficiency in any language offered by the College can be demonstrated by completing the third language course (numbered 103 or 201, dependingon the language) in any sequence or by scoring at a proficiency level determined by the department on an examination developed or approved by theCollege. Kalamazoo College regularly offers Chinese, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Latin and Spanish. Please see individualdepartment policy regarding whether/how credit earned from the College Board Advanced Placement examinations and International Baccalaureateexaminations applies to the language requirement in that particular language.Students wishing to satisfy the College language requirement by taking a language not taught on campus are responsible for 1). Finding anotherUniversity or College that offers the language and 2) successfully completing a course (or courses) in that language at the intermediate level. Beforeregistering, the student must have the course (or courses) approved by the Registrar's Office.Students who are at least partially bilingual in a language taught on campus should take the College's placement test and score at a proficiency leveldetermined by that language department. Students who are at least partially bilingual in a language not taught on campus and whose formalsecondary education was exclusively in English may fulfill the language requirement by demonstrating intermediate-level literacy skills in thatlanguage. A written essay test will be administered on campus and rated by a person fluent in that language. A reasonable effort will be made toprovide this option to students requesting it.Students whose formal secondary education was not exclusively in English may request to certify that they had at least two years of secondaryeducation in a school which teaches at least 50% of its content in a language other than English. Students should contact the Registrar's Office torequest such certification.Senior Individualized ProjectThe Senior Individualized Project (SIP)The Senior Individualized Project is the capstone of Kalamazoo College's program of liberal arts education, offering students the opportunity to makeuse of all of their experiences at the College. The SIP is an occasion for independent scholarship, often in conjunction with an internship or othercreative activity that results in a written report, performance, or exhibit. A number of departments host symposia, recitals, exhibitions, or theatricalproductions in which results of research or creative work are featured. Rather than selecting only a subset of students to work on an honors projector thesis, the College considers such independent work a significant part of the education of all Kalamazoo College students and requires it of allseniors. The requirement is waived for students participating in approved 3/2 engineering or health professions early entry programs, as they are notat the College for their senior year.Every student must complete a Senior Individualized Project of at least one unit. The SIP requirement is usually completed in the major department,although students may complete a SIP in any department or program of the College with the approval of the department chair or program directorand a faculty SIP supervisor from that area. Each department sets its own requirements for senior projects done in that department, including therange of acceptable projects, the required background of students doing projects, the format of the SIP, and the expected scope and depth ofprojects. The amount of SIP credit (one or two units) is determined by the student and the SIP department at the beginning of the project. Inconsultation with the faculty SIP supervisor, and within the constraints set by the relevant department, students determine their project's form and theenvironment in which it is to be pursued.The College reserves the right to archive student SIPs within academic departments, the Upjohn Library and/or an online digital archive, and topublish SIP titles and the titles of SIP presentations.General Information about SIPsEvery senior must complete a SIP in a department, program, or Independent Interdisciplinary Major. Every SIP must have a faculty advisor(also known as the SIP supervisor) within that department, program, or IIM committee.Each student must complete at least a 1-unit SIP. Departments and programs have the option of allowing or requiring a 2-unit SIP.A student may split a SIP between two departments, be it 1 or 2 units. In this case, the student may have more than one faculty SIPsupervisor.The SIP does not necessarily have to be done in the major department, although most SIPs are done in the major or in one or bothdepartments of a double major. Some majors strongly encourage their students to do their SIP in the major. Many departments have certainprerequisites that must be met before doing a SIP within that department.All departments and programs provide written guidelines or requirements for SIPs done within their disciplines. Ask your department orfaculty advisor for guidelines early in the process. In general, SIPs take the following forms:Research thesis or reading project culminating in review paperInternship with a paper relating theory to practiceLaboratory or field research with a paperTranslation with appropriate explanationCreative work culminating in an exhibition, performance, and/or written workUnder extenuating circumstances, with approval of the Department or Program Chair or IIM committee, advanced coursework atKalamazoo College or another institution may be substituted for the SIPDepartments and potential SIP supervisors are not obliged to approve every SIP proposal that is presented to them. You may have to meetcertain prerequisites, or you may have to adjust your ideas or modify your proposal, before it gains the approval of a SIP supervisor. Enlist aSIP supervisor early in the process and then work with that person to develop a project that will be interesting, significant, and meaningful toyou.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018The SIP QuarterEach student must complete at least a 1-unit SIP. Departments and programs have the option of allowing or requiring a 2-unit SIP.A student may split a SIP between two departments, be it 1 or 2 units. In this case, the student may have more than one faculty SIP advisor.Students may conduct SIP work over the summer (as part of an extended fall term), during the fall quarter, or during the winter quarter.The SIP quarter will be included in any financial aid package you already receive. A SIP is charged as part of a regular quarter load (2 to 4units of course work carries the same tuition fee). A summer SIP will be registered in the Extended Fall term and included in the Fall tuitionbilling.Students may not overload while working on their SIP. With the exception of performance-based SIPs in specific departments, which mayhave partial units spread over multiple quarters, students will have at least one “SIP quarter” in which at least one unit is devoted to the SIP.During this term students may take no more than 2 non-SIP courses (not counting partial credit courses)Sip UnitsMaximum Additional Coursework Allowed1 Unit Summer SIP3 courses (up to 3.9 units) in Fall2 Unit Summer/Fall SIP2 courses (up to 2.9 units) in Fall2 Unit Summer/Winter SIP3 courses (up to 3.9 units) in Fall;2 courses (up to 2.9 units) in Winter;Summer component must be finished before Fall term1 Unit Fall SIP2 courses (up to 2.9 units) in Fall2 Unit Fall SIP1 course (up to 1.9 units) in Fall2 Unit Fall/Winter SIP2 courses (up to 2.9 units) each in Fall and Winter1 Unit Winter SIP2 courses (up to 2.9 units) in Winter2 Unit Winter SIP1 course (up to 1.9 units) in WinterMulti-term Performance SIP in Art or Music  Depends on portion of SIP unit registered each termSIP Registration PoliciesThe SIP counts as one or two course unit(s) for the term(s) during which it is counted, but the SIP is registered via a separate process from classregistration. The SIP registration process involves a paper form (no online registration) which must be submitted to the Registrar's office by thestudent herself/himself. This paper form has its own set of deadlines:SIP QuarterRegistration Form DueAll SIPs involving work over the summer (as part of an extended fall term)Friday of 10th Week, Junior Spring QuarterFall and Fall/Winter SIPsFriday of 1st Week, Senior Fall QuarterWinter SIPsFriday of 1st Week, Senior Winter QuarterSome departments may also require a SIP proposal or contract, which should be submitted to your SIP department.  Your department’s SIPcontract deadline may be earlier than the normal SIP registration deadline, in which case it is recommended that you turn your SIP registrationform in to the Registrar’s Office at the same time that you submit the contract to your department. Some departments require all SIPproposals to be submitted in the spring.  Submitting a SIP proposal to your department does not constitute registration for your SIP;you must officially register by submitting a registration form to the Registrar’s Office in order to receive a grade or earn creditfor a SIP.The SIP registration form requires your signature and the signature of your faculty SIP supervisor (the person who will evaluate and gradeyour work). Many departments also designate a SIP coordinator. Find out from your department who your coordinator will be.Any changes to SIP registrations must be made in the Registrar’s Office by the end of the drop/add period of the quarter of registration (endof the first week of Fall quarter for Summer and Fall units; end of the first week of Winter quarter for Winter units). This includes dropping aSIP, changing your department or SIP advisor, changing the number of units, etc.After the end of the drop/add period, you may withdraw from a SIP as you would from any other class, and the SIP will appear on yourtranscript with a grade of W.  The withdrawal period for SIPs ends on Friday of the first week of the term following the SIP quarter (the endof the drop/add period for the following term).Overloading is not permitted during a SIP quarter. Work completed over the summer as part of an extended fall SIP is the exception; studentswith a summer SIP unit may either take up to 3 full-unit courses or 2 full-unit courses and a fall SIP unit during the regular fall term.(Registration above 3.9 units is considered an overload.)A student may not take 1 unit of SIP as their only course during a quarter unless that is the only unit they need to graduate.If a student drops, withdraws from, or fails a SIP, the original SIP advisor is not obligated to supervise a second SIP with that student.SIP Deadlines for Students and FacultyEach Department, Program, or IIM Committee is responsible for establishing and implementing specific SIP deadlines within the SIP quarter(the term in which the bulk of the work on the SIP is to take place). This may include deadlines for drafts, interim feedback, revisions,presentations, etc.For all SIPs, the final copy (i.e., no more revisions) is due to the SIP supervisor no later than Friday of second week of the term following theSIP quarter. For Summer SIPs, this means second week of the Fall quarter, even though Summer SIPs appear with the Fall registration.Students are expected to be completely finished with all work associated with the SIP by that time, with the possible exception of departmentalor program symposia in later terms.Faculty shall submit Credit/No Credit grades by Friday of 6th week of the quarter following a registered SIP unit. For departments with partialSIP units extending into Spring, that partial unit grade is due by 6th week of the Spring quarter. A grade of Credit may be upgraded to Honors(e.g., after a Spring departmental symposium) until the end of Spring quarter.The time lag between students turning in completed SIPs and faculty deadlines for turning in grades should not be interpreted as extra time forstudents to make revisions to the SIP. Work on the SIP in a quarter in which the student is not registered for SIP credit is consider an“invisible overload” for the students and is against College policy.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018SIP GradesThe SIP will receive a grade of Honors (H), Credit (CR), or No Credit (NC). If you complete a SIP in two departments, you may be gradedseparately by each department. The SIP grade is not included in the cumulative GPA calculation, though it is recorded on the academictranscript along with the title of the project. There are no college-wide rules regarding length or breadth of paper that determine the differencebetween a CR and an H; the grade is determined solely by evaluators within the academic department or program, with the input of anyoutside mentors the student may have consulted.Students who register for a 2-unit SIP but only complete enough work to earn 1 unit will receive a grade of CR for one unit and a grade of NCfor the other unit.  Faculty may also award a CR for one unit and an H grade for a second unit of a 2-unit SIP.An “In-Progress” notation (IP) indicates that a SIP is continuing beyond the end of the quarter.Incompletes will only be issued in consultation with the faculty SIP supervisor, and only in the event of a verified serious illness or familyemergency. An incomplete will not be granted for poor or neglected work.PE/Wellness UnitThe College requires all students to successfully complete one unit of physical education or wellness activity classes (typically five classes). -2019September 21, 2018be able to communicate effectively in both written and oral formsbe proficient in at least one second languagebe able to think critically, reason analytically, and solve problems skillfullyDegree Requirements#Units Requirements3 Units Shared Passages Seminars1Unit First-Year Seminar  First-Year Seminars do not satisfy major, minor, or concentration requirements.1Unit Sophomore Seminar (-2019September 21, 2018List of ProgramsMajorsAnthropology and SociologyArt HistoryArt – Studio ArtBiologyBusinessChemistryClassical CivilizationClassicsComputer ScienceCritical Ethnic StudiesEast Asian StudiesEconomicsEnglishFrenchGermanGreekHistoryIndependent Interdisciplinary MajorInternational and Area StudiesLatinMathematicsMusicPhilosophyPhysicsPolitical SciencePsychologyReligionSpanishTheatre ArtsWomen, Gender, and SexualityMinorsAnthropology and SociologyArt – Studio ArtArt HistoryChineseClassical CivilizationComputer ScienceEnglishFrenchGermanGreekHistoryJapaneseLatinMathematicsMusicPhilosophyPhysicsPolitical SciencePsychologyReligionSpanishTheatre ArtsConcentrationsAfrican StudiesAmerican StudiesBiochemistry & Molecular BiologyBiological PhysicsCommunity and Global HealthCritical TheoryEnvironmental StudiesJewish StudiesIndependent Interdisciplinary ConcentrationFilm and Media StudiesNeurosciencePublic Policy and Urban AffairsWomen, Gender, & SexualityKALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Special Programs3/2 EngineeringComplex Systems StudiesShared Passage SeminarsInterdisciplinary CoursesPhysical EducationExperiential ProgramsExperiential education is an important element of the K-Plan, with on-campus and off-campus opportunities in both domestic and international settings.Study abroad, study away through domestic programs, civic engagement, student research, internships and externships, career treks, and studentactivities and athletics are key curricular components of the K-Plan, and are supported by a variety of administrative departments on campus.First-Year ExperienceThe intentional weaving together of hands-on involvement, experiential learning, and mentorship within the context of a rigorous academic life is thehallmark of our First-Year Experience (FYE). Kalamazoo College was named one of thirteen "Institutions of Excellence in the First College Year" bythe National Policy Center on the First Year of College and is featured in Achieving and Sustaining Institutional Excellence for the First Year ofCollege (Jossey-Bass, 2005). US News & World Report has recognized Kalamazoo's First-Year Experience as a "program that really works." FYE atKalamazoo College helps students:achieve academic success,identify and pursue passions,connect with Kalamazoo College and the greater Kalamazoo communities,construct complex intercultural understandings, anddevelop a purpose-filled and balanced life.First-Year Seminars are the foundation of the FYE program, which includes participation in orientation and the Summer Common Reading, connectionswith Peer Leaders and academic advisors, residing on campus in a first-year residence hall, and attendance at First-Year Forums. Peer Leaders,carefully selected student-mentors, share their knowledge and experiences to help first-year students achieve greater academic and personal success.Each First-Year Seminar is assigned a Peer Leader.Center for Career and Professional DevelopmentThe Center for Career and Professional Development (CCPD) empowers students to clarify their career aspirations, broaden their networks, hone theirprofessional skills, and articulate the integrated outcomes of their K-Plan, so that they are well prepared to step confidently into life after KalamazooCollege.To support students in their career development, the CCPD offers the support for externships and internships in the summer months, and recruitingevents, networking opportunities, and a variety of workshops and on- and off-campus events during the academic year. The CCPD's staff also offersservices including individual coaching appointments, peer advising, career assessment tools, résumé and cover letter critiques, and practice interviews,Managed by the CCPD, Wisr, the Kalamazoo College Career Mentoring Network is an exclusive professional network that brings together studentsand alumni around common career interests. For students, the Wisr offers networks and mentoring relationships useful after graduation.Center for International ProgramsEvery study abroad program at Kalamazoo College is unique, but each offers challenging course work in an education system whose values andmethods reflect those of the local culture, opportunities for integrative cultural experiences, and structured opportunities for using the local language(s)both in and out of the classroom. As the academic, language, and other specific qualifications differ from program to program, it is imperative thatstudents carefully read the program descriptions and Study Abroad Handbook, available from the Center for International Programs (CIP).Civic Engagement and Service-LearningDuring their careers at K, about two thirds of all Kalamazoo College students are actively engaged in the greater Kalamazoo area through community-based courses, student-led co-curricular initiatives, and summer Community Based Internships. Through the nationally recognized Mary JaneUnderwood Stryker Center for Civic Engagement (CCE), established in 2001, and working in long-term, reciprocal partnerships, students areinvolved in public problem-solving and collaborative efforts to build a more equitable community. This takes place in over 20 different courses eachyear, and in ongoing programs that paid student Civic Engagement Scholars (CESs) lead and coordinate. Each week, about 200 K students work atcommunity sites, through courses, volunteer activities, and through community federal work study –in fact, because of the many opportunities to workwith public schools, the CCE is the largest student employer on campus! In the summer, the CCE offers six-week, fully-funded Community BasedInternships in Kalamazoo with many of our partner organizations.Our programs address issues such as health and educational equity, immigrant rights, prison reform, arts for social change, food justice, sustainability,and neighborhood and City of Kalamazoo development. With over 40 community organizations and grass-roots groups, students serve as scholaractivists who conduct research and outreach; develop community gardens; make films; register voters; advocate for policy change; work withKalamazoo Public School students; create health education materials; create stories, ceramics, visual arts, and poetry with community members;influence environmental practices; and more. We emphasize building long-term relationships that are transformational for individuals and communities;we respect and promote both student agency and community voice. All students involved with CCE programs, within courses or in student-ledprograms, engage in structured reflection in order to make critical connections between service and learning, theory and practice, the global and thelocal, and to integrate these experiences into their individualized "K Plans." All of our programs foster civic, academic, and personal growth within asocial justice framework, and offer plentiful opportunities for student leadership and collaboration with communities.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Domestic Study Away ProgramsKalamazoo College students who meet appropriate qualifications are eligible to apply for participation in a fine arts program in New York City, a fallquarter seminar at the Newberry Library in Chicago, a fall program based in Philadelphia, an arts, social justice and entrepreneurship program inChicago, a semester program on the U.S.-Mexico border through the Border Studies Program, or be part of a reserch project at the Oak RidgeNational Laboratory in Tennessee.  Students interested in study away programs should consult with the Center for International Programs.Student Support and ServicesAcademic AdvisingAdvisors are academic mentors who notice what is happening to their advisees, pay attention to their academic progress, and help them work towardscompleting their degrees while identifying and fulfilling their goals. Academic advising at Kalamazoo College helps students to develop plans compatiblewith their interests, abilities, and goals; design a course of on- and off-campus study; meet degree requirements; grow intellectually and personally; andmake the most of their undergraduate education. All students must meet with their advisors before they are allowed to register for classes for theupcoming quarter. New students are assigned to an advisor linked to First-Year Seminars. Students typically stay with their first advisor until theydeclare a major sophomore year, when they may opt to change to an advisor in their major department. Departmental Student Advisors (DSAs) providea student perspective on majors, minors, and concentrations.Early AlertKalamazoo College has had an Early Alert system in place since 1996. If faculty or advisors have concerns about a student's academic progress orengagement, they are asked to use the Early Alert system. Academic advisors are notified immediately of any reports regarding their advisees. TheEarly Alert Committee, a group of academic and student development administrators, meets regularly each quarter to review the reports and makeplans for follow-up.Student Health CenterThe Kalamazoo College Student Health Center is staffed by physician assistants, registered nurses, and an office coordinator. Services include acutemedical care, diagnosis and treatment of illness and injury, travel consultation and immunizations, gynecological care, and limited diagnostic testing. Ifnecessary, referrals are provided to outside medical care centers and specialist physicians. Medical supervision and after hours on call advice is offeredby Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine Family Practice Residency program, located at the Family Health Center.There is no fee for most services at the Student Health Center. Students are charged for in-house diagnostic tests, physical exams, some individual pre-travel consultations, immunizations, annual gynecology exams, some medications, supplies, nutritional counseling, and some treatments. The StudentHealth Center only bills the College Insurance Plan directly. For all other insurances, we offer an insurance ready receipt at the time ofservice. Student Health Services does not provide medical excuses for missed classes, exams, or assignments since medical conditions areconfidential.Counseling CenterThe Counseling Center provides a confidential setting where mental health professionals and interns help students understand and work throughpersonal concerns. Our services include individual counseling, therapy and support groups, educational workshops, and referral to off-campus mentalhealth professionals.Students with DisabilitiesIn compliance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended, and with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),Kalamazoo College recognizes that qualified students who have diagnosed or identified learning, physical, and emotional disabilities are entitled to thesame benefits from the educational programs of the College. Kalamazoo College is committed to making every effort to providing reasonableaccommodations, unless it that imposes an undue hardship or burden on the College. The Associate Dean of Students and the student will work togetherto negotiate and ensure appropriate accommodations that will work for the student. Cost associated with diagnosis, evaluation, and testing is theresponsibility of the student, except in cases of severe financial need demonstrated to, and upon recommendation of, the Associate Dean of Students.The office also makes assistance available to students experiencing short-term illness or physical injury.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Academic ProgramsAfrican StudiesProfessor: Bangura (Director)The concentration in African Studies offers students the opportunity to study Africa, its people, and its societies from a perspective that provides aholistic understanding of the continent. In order to provide concentrators with an in-depth understanding of African peoples and cultures, histories, andthe political, economic, and ecological environments, the program draws upon the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities.In addition, students will develop a heightened awareness of the long-term and complex relationship between Africa and the West. A core curriculum ofcourses, coupled with study abroad opportunities and an ongoing series of campus events including speakers, special programs, and visiting scholars, willprovide students with a foundation for future work and/or study in African studies and related fields.Requirements for the Concentration in African StudiesNumber of UnitsSix units are required.Required CoursesAFST/-2019September 21, 2018AFST/HIST/WGS272Gender Relations in Africa This course explores categories of masculinity and femininity that relate to and inform oneanother.

It analyzes the mode of enslavement of Africans by slavers in Africa, the experiences of slavesin the Middle Passage, and the impact of the trade on continental and Diasporan Africans. It also explores the role played by Africa-based abolitionistmovements in ending the trade in Atlantic Africa.AFST/HIST/RELG274Islam in Africa This course explores the spread of Islam from the Arab peninsula to the African continent in the seventhcentury through the nineteenth century and limns the factors which facilitated this advance. It examines the methods and principles of Islam and howthe religion affected the life styles of its African neophytes and adherents. As a result of the interaction between Muslim and African civilizations, theadvance of Islam has profoundly influenced religious beliefs and practices of African societies, while local traditions have also influenced Islamicpractices. Muslims were important in the process of state-building and in the creation of commercial networks that brought together large parts of thecontinent. Muslim clerics served as registrars of state records and played a role in developing inner-state diplomacy inside Africa and beyond.AFST/HIST275/-2019September 21, 2018Literature and Fine ArtsAMST/-2019September 21, 2018AMST/ENGL275American Realisms: U.S. Literature 1865-1914 This course examines a variety of approaches to knowing a literary period.We will explore theoretical, socio-historical, formal, and thematic paradigms that can organize our understanding of the wide variety of written andcinematic texts produced in the period between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of World War I. Through a study of the frequentlyconflicting stories about gender, race, sexuality, art, and Americanness that come to voice during this period, students will challenge and complicate theirdefinitions of literary realism.Prerequisite: A Reading the World course or instructor permissionAMST/ENGL276Modernism and Postmodernism: U.S. Literature 1914-Present A study of the rise of a modern aesthetic in the wake ofWorld War I and the postmodern response in the second half of the 20th century with an eye toward the diversity of voices and formal choices thatmark this period.Prerequisite: A Reading the World course or instructor permissionAMST593Senior Individualized Project Each program or department sets its own requirements for Senior Individualized Projects done in thatprogram, including the range of acceptable projects, the required background of students doing projects, the format of the SIP, and the expected scopeand depth of projects. See the Kalamazoo Curriculum Curriculum Details and Policies section of the Academic Catalog for more details.Prerequisite:Permission of department and SIP supervisor required.Anthropology and SociologyProfessors: Garriga-López (Chair), Baptiste, Cunningham, Luthra, Thomann, VillegasThe related disciplines of anthropology and sociology seek to understand the nature of communities, organizations, institutions, the systems of culturalmeanings that form and inform them, and the interplay between individuals' lives and the societies in which they live. Such understanding requirescritical analysis of the interactions among societies and the political, economic, and cultural dimensions of power embodied in structures of class, gender,ethnicity, and race operating on both a local and global level.Our goal is to provide courses that integrate the two disciplines into a common curriculum from which students derive the multiple perspectives, patternsof evidence, and methodological skills that will engender a broad yet nuanced understanding of the local and global dimensions of contemporary issues.This awareness, gained through reading, discussion, and active engagement both in the local and national community, as well as through participation ininternational programs and projects— is consistent with and thus directly serves the overall mission of the college: "to better understand, livesuccessfully within, and provided enlightened leadership to a richly diverse and increasingly complex world."Students graduating with a major in Anthropology and Sociology will find this major relevant for careers not only in anthropology and sociology, but alsofor such related fields as human services, journalism, law, medicine, public health, urban affairs, international development, government, business, andeducation.Requirements for the Major in Anthropology and SociologyRequirements for the Major in Anthropology and SociologyA minimum of ten courses, comprised of three core courses and seven other ANSO courses of the student's choosing, of which at least two must be atthe 200-level, two at the 300-level and two at the 400-level.

Prerequisite: Take a ANSO-245 and be sophomore standing.ANSO322Prisoners and Detainees Prisoners and Detainees: Race, Citizenship, and Imprisonment: This course examines the ways laws andimprisonment have become means to discipline bodies imagined as dangerous, disposable, and detrimental to the state, in short, non-citizens. Itspecifically merges two social processes that define non-citizenship -the prison industrial complex and deportability- as mechanisms that actively prohibitentry into the space of belonging for those who are illegalized and strips citizenship from those who are criminalized. We will analyze illegalization andcriminalization as social, political, and cultural processes that function to police, discipline, distinguish, and re/form the "other".Prerequisite: Take one200-level ANSO courseANSO325States, Bodies & Epidemics This course examines epidemics as social events. Students will become familiarized with majoranthropological and sociological works on contagion and social responses to epidemic disease.

Prerequisite: One 200-levelANSO courseANSO/ENVS350Political Histories of Western Environment This course explores a partial (Western) history of how humans have understoodthemselves in relation to nature. To do so, this course relies on a landmark text in the field along with a series of primary texts, tracing the continuitiesand ruptures in thought during different historical periods have engaged with the idea of nature and the place of the human within it. Although, thecourse relies mostly on a broadly defined Western thought tradition in this course but students are encouraged to undertake research on other traditionsand bring those into the classroom. The readings for this course are organized temporally, starting with the oldest.Prerequisite: One 200-level ANSOcourseANSO357Immigrants and Exiles From its classical reference to displaced communities as a result of wars of conquests or natural disasters tocurrent movements of population across borders as a result of global capitalism, the concept of diaspora has accumulated an archive of academic andimaginative literature. This course, a comparative introduction to the study of diaspora, focuses on the development of diverse diasporic communitiesand their role on the current global stage. Our specific focus will be on how members of these communities stake their claims both to their homecountries and to the countries in which they reside.Prerequisite: One 200-level ANSO courseANSO412Capitalism and Its Discontents This course aims to get students to read and explore the contemporary relevance of Marx's writings.

The three-course sequence emphasizes reading and writing in MSA and listeningcomprehension and speaking in both MSA and dialect, in addition to introducing students to the history, geography and cultures of the Arabophoneregion through authentic media and diverse projects. Students also have the opportunity for service learning initiatives serving the Arab refugeepopulation of Kalamazoo. Successful completion of the sequence fulfills the college's language requirement, prepares students for the college's newstudy abroad programâ€‹ in Amman, Jordan, and provides them with a rare ability to engage with Arabic-speaking communities in Michigan andelsewhere.Arabic coursesARBC101Beginning Arabic I This is a beginning course in Modern Standard Arabic (written) and colloquial Arabic (spoken), and the first in athree-course sequence. The first quarter of study will cover the Arabic alphabet and phonology, basic morphology and syntax, and introductoryconversational skills, as well as an introduction to the geography and cultures of the Arabophone region. Students will demonstrate their beginning skillslargely through oral presentations and dictation.ARBC102Beginning Arabic II This is the second course in a three-course sequence in Beginning Arabic, with continuing instruction of ModernStandard and colloquial Arabic. This course emphasizes vocabulary acquisition and foundational grammar (gender and number agreement, subject andobject pronouns, present-tense verb conjugation), building toward simple narration in compositions and presentations. Students will explore Arab culturesas well as practice reading and listening skills through a variety of authentic media.Prerequisite: ARBC-101ARBC103Beginning Arabic III This course completes the three-course sequence in Beginning Arabic. Students will continue intensive vocabularybuilding and move on to grammatical topics including gerunds, superlatives, past and future tense verb conjugation, conditional and comparative phrases,as well as Arabic's dazzling verb pattern system. Students will continue to explore Arab cultures and practice reading and listening through a variety ofauthentic media, and develop their composition and presentation skills through written and oral projects. Prerequisite: ARBC-102Art and Art HistoryProfessors: Hahn, Koenig, Lindley, Rice (Chair), VinsonIn an ever-increasingly visual world, art and art history cultivate essential critical looking skills that allow students to better navigate and respond to theircommunities, both local and global. Courses in the department take advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of the liberal arts experience, and weencourage students to interweave their personal and academic interests with artistic expression and research across visual cultures. Many classes haveno prerequisites and are open to all students; while more advanced courses provide training for those interested in postgraduate study of studio art or arthistory. Senior projects can provide internships and other opportunities for experiential learning in the context of the arts: commercial art, artsmanagement, museums and galleries, or professional studio practice. In every case, our goal is to enrich students' experience of their visual world and todevelop the necessary analytical and communication skills in order to thrive upon graduation.Our studio art courses provide instruction in drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, photography, printmaking, digital art, documentary video, andcombined media. These courses are designed to help you explore creative visual modes of expression and learn both traditional and innovative mediapractices. The curriculum's directive is to familiarize students with contemporary issues in the visual arts, while developing practical and professionalskills for future pursuits. To supplement coursework, studio classes participate in visiting artists' and critics' lectures, gallery and museum visits, studiovisits, and a senior class trip to Chicago.The art history curriculum offers courses across time periods and geographies, all of which provide a solid foundation in visual analysis, historicalframeworks, and theoretical interpretations. The surveys provide a broad introduction to western art; while intermediate and advanced courses moreclosely scrutinize specific cultures, ranging from ancient Greek art to contemporary global art. Art history majors are rigorously trained to conductindependent and collective research, developing strong problem-solving and critical reading and writing skills. Augmenting coursework, students visitnumerous museums, work with visiting artists and art historians, and participate in the senior trip to Chicago.The department offers a major or minor in Studio Art and a major or minor in Art History.AP, Dual Enrollment, Transfer, and Study Abroad CreditsMajorsStudents who major in the department can use a total of only three units of eligible transfer, dual enrollment, AP, and credits from study abroadcombined to count toward their major, with approval of the department. Only two units from study abroad can be used toward the major.MinorsStudents who minor in Studio Art or Art History can use a total of two units of eligible transfer, dual enrollment, AP, and credits from study abroadcombined to count toward their minor, with approval of the department. Only one unit from study abroad can be used toward the minor.Requirements for the Studio Art MajorIt is highly recommended that a minimum of two classes in an area of focus, including at least one second-level or intermediate course, should becompleted by the end of the junior year. Areas of focus include painting, photography, documentary video, ceramics, and sculpture (three sculpturecourses expected for students planning a sculpture SIP).Number of UnitsTen units are required. A SIP is not counted as part of the ten units.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Required Courses: Six UnitsTo be completed by the end of the sophomore year:-2019September 21, 2018All SIPSs are to be advanced-level work. Students are expected to complete preparatory coursework and seek out a SIP advisor in the departmentprior to the fall of their senior year. Proposals must meet departmental expectations for Studio Art and Art History SIPs. Approval is based on thequality of the proposal, the student's preparation for the proposed topic, and the faculty advisor's ability and availability to supervise the proposed topic,approach or technique.A Senior Individualized Project in art for a non-major is possible only if the student has taken the relevant courses in the department and securesapproval for the proposed project.Studio Art SIP GuidelinesSIPs in Studio Art are usually one unit, typically executed in the winter quarter of senior year. The bulk of a Studio Art SIP includes the creation of asignificant body of artwork in an area of focus. Students should have considerable experience, including at least one intermediate/advanced course, inthe medium or area of the SIP. Sculpture and ceramics students should take at least three sculpture or ceramics courses, respectively. All Studio Artmajors are required to enroll in ARTX490 (Advanced Studio) in the fall before the SIP; this may also be required for non-majors who plan to do StudioArt SIPs. Beyond the production of work, the SIP consists of a midterm and final defense of the project. The SIP document (a reflective narrativedescription of the project with the addition of supporting research, materials and images) will be due upon completion of the creative work. The studentwill also have the opportunity to have an exhibition and public presentation of their completed project during the spring term.Art History SIP GuidelinesSIPs in Art History are usually a one-unit research SIP.The research SIP (one unit) is a paper of 40 to 50 pages on a topic in which the student has sufficient background to do advanced research. The topicmust be approved in consultation with the SIP advisor prior to the fall of the senior year. Students are required to enroll in ARTX-491:Ways of Seeing inthe fall quarter of their senior year in preparation for writing their SIP in the winter quarter.Internship SIP GuidelinesThe internship portion of an Internship SIP usually takes place during the summer between the junior and senior year. Students participate in an artsinternship that will be a substantial experience, with most students working for approximately 20-30 hours a week. Students should consult with afaculty member about their plans and internship applications early in their junior year and no later than the end of winter quarter.Studio Art Internship SIP students should register for a one-unit summer SIP. The SIP internship documentation (detailed daily journal, descriptions ofthe institution and personnel, 15-page research paper, reflective essay) is due at the beginning of the fall term.The Art History Internship SIP frequently takes place in a museum or gallery. Students should register for a one-unit winter SIP. Students are alsorequired to enroll in ARTX-491 Ways of Seeing in the fall quarter of their senior year prior to the completion of their written documentation andresearch paper during the winter quarter of the senior year.Art History coursesARTX145Survey of Art I: 1100-1600 This survey course focuses on painting, sculpture, manuscripts, and architecture produced in the Christianand Islamic worlds from the 12th through 17th century. We will consider the visual cultures of cosmopolitan cities such as Paris, Isfahan, Venice, andConstantinople, which were centers of power as well as points of exchange. Throughout the course, we will think about how objects structured bothreligious practices and complex relations between different social groups. Major goals of the course include honing skills in looking critically and usingart historical terms to interpret works of art.ARTX150Survey of Art II: 1600-1945 Artistic revolutions from the 17th through the 20th centuries in the East and West caused radical visual andinstitutional transformation. This course surveys the development of modern art from a global perspective, tracing the influence of East and West uponone another from the Rococo to the Neoclassical, from Romanticism to Realism, to Cubism, Expressionism, and Postmodernism. We will examine howartists interpret the world around them and how these interpretations change over time.ARTX195Art, Power, and Society At the heart of art history is a desire to understand the complex ways art functions within various systems ofpower: who made it, who possesses it, how it circulates, and who benefits. The overarching goal of this course is to make visible the processes bywhich the invisible power of cultural hegemony operates. Through reading, writing, discussion, site visits, and guest lectures, we will explore variousquestions that seek to probe the relationship between art, power, and society. Our case studies will range widely through time and space, from Silladynasty Korea to present-day Bronson Park in Kalamazoo.ARTX/CLAS208Introduction to Greek Art and Archaeology This introduction to the multidisciplinary field of Greek archaeology examines theart and architecture of the Greek world from a contextual perspective. The course traces Greek material culture from Bronze Age origins throughHellenistic transformations. (This is a designated Greek literature or culture course in Classics.)ARTX/CLAS209Introduction to Roman Art and Archaeology This introduction to the multidisciplinary field of Roman archaeology examinesthe art and architecture of the Roman world from a contextual perspective. The course traces Roman material culture from Iron Age and Etruscanorigins through Early Christian transformations. (This is a designated Roman literature or culture course in Classics.)ARTX215A History of Photography Photography was invented at two different geographic locations more or less simultaneously, which coincidedwith the rise of the modern political state and the industrial revolution in Western Europe. This course is a survey of that medium, and its culturalimplications, from the beginning in France and England in the early 19th century, through the modern era of the 20th century, to touch upon conceptual,postmodern, and contemporary trends.ARTX221Renaissance Art I This course provides an introduction to the art and visual culture of Northern Europe in the period between c. 1350and 1600. Artists such as Jean Fouquet, Jan van Eyck, Hieronymus Bosch, and Albrecht D&uuml;rer famously experimented with new pictorial genresand illusionistic techniques in large-scale religious works, including altarpieces, as well as smaller works intended for private display. We will explorehow methods of representation were related to social developments, including new forms of piety, technological innovations, and changes in the artmarket. Toward the end of the course we will consider the topic of idolatry and iconoclasm during the Protestant Reformation, examining how religiousconflicts affected contemporary attitudes toward images.ARTX222Renaissance Art II A strong papacy and its patronage in 16th-century Rome brought Michelangelo, Raphael, and many others fromFlorence and other cities to work there. They established an idealized classical style that was soon transformed into elegant, anti-classical Mannerism inmuch of Italy. At the same time, Venetian painters developed a distinctive style, less classical but more sensual.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018ARTX223The Long 19th Century Eric Hobswam coined the period of time from the French Revolution to the end of WWI as "The Long 19thCentury." This course takes a selective, topics-based approach to exploring this period of rapid change in the visual arts. We will explore how thecreation and distribution of art from both the metropole and the periphery led to a visual revolution, creating many of the conditions for the modern visualworld we exist in today.ARTX224Art Since 1945 Painting, sculpture, architecture, performance, and installation art from approximately 1945 to the present day. Theemphasis will be on examining the visual arts of this period from both a formal and socio-historical standpoint, using primary texts such as artistmanifestos and the writings of critics to help guide an understanding of the visual. In the process, we will seek to better understand how the terms"modern," "postmodern," and "global," were expressed, evaluated, defined and shaped in the visual arts during the latter half of the 20th century.ARTX227Modern Art Museum This course addresses the ideological aims and critical functions of art museums, from the 19th century to thepresent day. Course topics include: the origins of the modern art museum, the politics of collecting and exhibiting art, the ethics of collecting practices,and the relationship between art history and the museum. Case studies of curators and artists who have pushed the boundaries of traditional museumdisplay will be used to examine how the relationship between objects, artists, and institutions has changed over time.ARTX260Baroque Art In 17th-century Europe, exploration and scientific discovery expanded the world. Similarly, beginning in Rome, artists suchas Caravaggio and Bernini both expanded and modified Renaissance innovations. Artists from all over Europe flocked to Rome, and Flemish, Spanish,French, and even some Dutch painters were transformed there, but political, religious, and cultural differences modified the styles they practiced whenthey returned, and those of other painters who had never left.ARTX290Art and Gender This course explores the intersection of visual culture and gender through the lens of critical theory. We will examinehow gender has been constructed both in and through the visual arts historically as well as in the present through various interrelated topics such as themyth of the artist; the gaze, the voyeur, and desire; the gendered body in visual art; and the gendered body's intersection with race, class, and sexualorientation.ARTX295Public Art and Its Public(s) in the United States In the history of art, public art has been the source of much commentary andcontroversy. After all, to call an artwork "public" is to suggest that it belongs to everyone-"the public"-and thus that anyone might have a say in it. Butwhat makes an artwork public? This course is an opportunity to reflect on this and other questions, as we explore shifting conceptions and practices ofpublic art in the United States from the 18th Century to the present, when older models of site-specific public art objects have ceded to an emphasis oncommunity-oriented "social practice."ARTX295Art and Environmental Justice This interdisciplinary course explores the relationship between contemporary art-making practices andenvironmental justice concerns. With the recent devastation of the Flint water crisis, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and continually increasing globaltemperatures, this seminar examines how visual artists have explored the ecological crisis through various modes of mediation, including installation,performance, and socially-engaged art projects. The course combines readings in art history, critical theory, and environmental studies in conjunctionwith individual and group studio practice. While no prior experience in art is required, this is a jointly-conceived seminar in studio art and art history, soresearch effort will be manifested through reading, writing, and making. Contributes to the Environmental Studies Concentration.ARTX395Art & Revolution in Russia, 1910-1935 This course introduces students to the highly experimental art created prior to and immediatelyfollowing the Russian Revolution. Looking first to Paris for models of avant-garde painting, these artists quickly started to apply theoretical politicalmodels to radical modes of making: constructions, textile design, advertising, furniture, photography, and film. The artists' unique commitment to bothutopian politics and modern formalist techniques was a distinctive combination that would decidedly distance them from the advent of Soviet Realismand Stalinism. The course is formed around intensive reading of primary and secondary sources, class discussion, and written responses.Prerequisite:Take at least one (1) 100- or 200-level art history course or by permission.ARTX/WGS395Performance Art in the 20th C. This course examines the dynamic history of performance art in the twentieth century, from thehistorical avant-garde to contemporary practices. A chronological exploration of performance art, the course also studies the themes inherent to liveperformance works, most especially gender, sexuality, and race. We will trace the alternative models of artistic-subjectivities and spectatorshipproduced when the body - and its vulnerabilities - is the subject of art. Such themes include: the politicization of daily life; the problem of documentation;the inherent narcissism of body art; the role(s) of the body in psychological and phenomenological experience; and the body and its modernmechanizations.ARTX491Ways of Seeing: Methods in Visual Analysis This course begins with a basic but fundamental question: how do we describe what wesee? We will explore how philosophers, artists, and critics have grappled with this issue throughout history, seeking to understand the critical issues thatcan arise when communicating vision in verbal form. Because the practice of art history rests upon translating the expressive content of the visualworld into words, a significant component of this class will focus on methodology, writing, and the critical analysis of classic theoretical texts that haveformed the approach and structure of the discipline. Art and art history majors should plan to take this course during the fall of their senior year.Offered Fall.Prerequisite: Two Art History courses and Senior StandingARTX593Senior Individualized Project Each program or department sets its own requirements for Senior Individualized Projects done in thatdepartment, including the range of acceptable projects, the required background of students doing projects, the format of the SIP, and the expectedscope and depth of projects. See the Kalamazoo Curriculum (Curriculum Details and Policies) section of the Academic Catalog for moredetails.Prerequisite: Permission of department and SIP supervisor required.Studio Art coursesARTX105Basic Drawing This course is a study of drawing fundamentals, with emphasis on line, value, and shape organization as instruments ofprecision and expression. Students planning to major or minor in art should take this course by the spring quarter of the sophomore year.Prerequisite:Open to First-Years & SophomoresARTX110Digital Art The course provides the student with a working knowledge of, and skills associated with, computer-based art production. Wewill be using Macintosh computers with Adobe software (both raster- and vector-based programs). Early the student will create work that consistsprimarily of images and text, but later will move to time-based and/or conceptual forms. To help contextualize this kind of artistic production, participantswill spend some time looking at a brief history of digital art as well as its relationship to artwork in general.ARTX115Digital Photography The objective of this studio art course is to provide the student working knowledge of, and experience with, thefundamental creative tools used in fine art photographic practice. We will use digital cameras, optimize with Photoshop, and make archival pigmentprints in the Center for New Media. Participants learn to analyze and discuss their work in critiques; discussion will be centered on technical, formal,and conceptual characteristics. We will also discuss subject matter and content and the difference between the two. In this critical "reading" of images,like that of a text, we will explore the basics of visual literacy. A digital camera with manual exposure capabilities is required.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018ARTX125Ceramics: Wheel Throwing In this course, students explore clay through the use of the potters' wheel, their hands and class discussion.Course content is focused on the role of function in relation to utilitarian wares for sharing and serving food. Individual students will reflect on theirpersonal experiences with food in an attempt to better understand the potential and specific use of pottery forms. Students will also be encouraged toconsider new ideas and challenge themselves in regards to form, function and technique, as they develop technical abilities and a broader understandingof the possibilities of clay and pottery forms.ARTX128Painting: Traditional Practices This course is an introduction to traditional oil painting techniques. Students will work directly from lifewhenever possible and will have the opportunity to work from still life, landscape and the human figure. The course will emphasize working methodsthat stress critical judgment, mark making, space, color, light and composition from direct observation.ARTX134Sculpture: Object Investigation This hands-on studio course investigates how objects are created, used, transformed and/or combinedto make art. Student projects may be fabricated from found objects, wood, paper, fabric, 3D printing, and "non-traditional" materials. Concept-drivenassignments ask students to create work that addresses the presence, history, meaning, materiality, and form of objects. Assignments also incorporatefundamentals of three-dimensional design. Discussion and critiques focus on issues prominent in contemporary art. This course includes a series ofwoodshop trainings outside of class time and is designed to be accessible to non-majors at any point in their academic career and may be of particularinterest to students in anthropology, psychology, biology, literature and philosophy, in addition to a major in studio art.ARTX200TV Production Designed for students with significant involvement in producing Kalamazoo College TV productions and production studiowork. Students must meet a minimum 30-hour commitment within one term to receive 1/4 unit of credit. Various activities may include: studioequipment operator, producer, director, writer, and talent. There is no limit on how many times a student may repeat the course, but a student may onlyreceive credit for one unit. Cannot be use for the Art History, Studio Art, or Art and Art History majors or minors. Does count towards to MediaStudies Concentration.ARTX201Visual Fundamentals This course explores the basic elements (line, shape, repetition) and principles (figure/ground relationships,emphasis) of visual art and design. Basic color theory is also covered. Critical discussion accompanies a sequence of hands-on studio exercises andprojects, which include work in collage, drawing, painting, and digital imaging. Readings and discussion will also be included as an art theory primer.Prerequisite: ARTX-105, ARTX-110, ARTX-115, or ARTX-128ARTX203Figure Drawing Figure drawing focuses on drawing issues related to working from the nude model while emphasizing proportion,foreshortening, and planar structures of the figure. Students will work from very short poses to extended poses, creating drawings with approachesuniquely designed for drawing the figure. This course continues the process begun in basic drawing of building a solid foundation in drawing skillsthrough observation. Students aim to develop sensitivity to the structure, anatomy and expressive qualities of the human form. Homework is assignedfor each class period and there is an evening drawing session on Wednesday nights for the purposes of completing assignments.Prerequisite: ARTX-105ARTX/SEMN206Ceramics: World Pottery World Pottery is a hands-on studio course with significant research and reflection components. Classtime will be used to introduce students to a variety of clay bodies and clay-forming techniques from historical and regional perspectives (wheel-throwingwill not be taught). Creative assignments ask students to consider and critique the role of cultural exchange and image appropriation within historicalceramics and in their own creative work. Projects will also investigate the roles of different types of pottery within contemporary American society, asa point of reference and departure. Each student will propose, execute, and present a research project. Lectures, critiques, and discussions will focus onindividual and societal assumptions about pottery. This course is a Shared Passages Sophomore Seminar.Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlyARTX/SEMN214Framing Difference This course will combine research and studio components, split more or less evenly. The research topic,broadly painted, will be fine art documentary practices, grounded with an entry-level hands-on studio component (using both film and digitalphotography). There are two motivations for this course: to give students creative control of photographic tools (technical, formal, conceptual) prior totheir leaving for study away, but also to explore the issues and ethics of photographic documentary practice. While the broad research topic isdocumentary practice (theory/tradition), this course will place particular emphasis on the ethics of photographing outside of one's own group. Thiscourse is a Shared Passages Sophomore Seminar.Prerequisite: Sophomores Only.ARTX220Ceramics: Clay in Community Throughout the term, students use clay as a sculptural medium through the use of traditional, exploratory,and experimental hand building techniques. Concepts/topics for creative projects address definitions of space, place, community, and participatory art.Civic engagement sections may include lab hours spent with an off-campus community partner. Civic engagement sections will focus on a specifictheme addressing access and equity, as they exist in our own lives and within the greater Kalamazoo community. Technical, contextual, and conceptualconsiderations specific to ceramics are also covered. Wheel-throwing will not be taught.ARTX228Painting: Contemporary Practices This course is designed for students who have had some previous studio art experience in painting,drawing, or design. Some knowledge of drawing and composition will be expected of students enrolling in this course. Students will learn about modernand contemporary issues in art and will be asked to produce work that investigates some of these themes. The primary medium for the class will beacrylic paint, but students will be encouraged to experiment with mixed media and alternative materials. In addition to technical experimentation studentswill address complex conceptual issues. Students will have the opportunity to explore a variety of styles and approaches to painting.Prerequisite: ARTX-201 (old ARTX-100) or ARTX-105 or ARTX-128ARTX230Analog Photography This course provides the student working knowledge of, and experience with, the fundamental creative tools usedin fine art photographic practice-using traditional (analog) processing and printing techniques. In addition to producing chemically based photographs,participants learn to analyze and discuss their work in critiques. To inspire and contextualize we will view historical examples from the Daguerreotypeto contemporary practice. Assignments will be directed (to make the most of the inherent aspects of traditional analog materials) but will be open tointerpretation. Students interested in pursuing photography at the advanced level are encouraged to take Digital Photography prior to AnalogPhotography, if possible.ARTX233Printmaking An introduction to and development of basic techniques in intaglio and relief processes. Linoleum cut, wood cut, etching, andsoft ground techniques will be some of the print methods explored.Prerequisite: ARTX-201 (old ARTX-100) or ARTX-105ARTX234Sculpture: Structure and Space This mixed-media studio course explores concepts of structure and space as source material andnecessary elements in the creation of sculpture and installation art. Assignments incorporate the use of linear and planar art materials, fundamentals ofthree-dimensional design, concept and critical thinking skills. Materials may include wood, paper, cardboard, wire, string, fabric and/or other non-traditional materials. Material skills are developed through experimentation and exploration, as opposed to technical demonstrations with the exception ora woodshop practicum that takes place during evening and weekend woodshop hours. Readings, discussion and critiques focus on issues prominent incontemporary art. This course is recommended for art majors and non-majors at the sophomore level and above and may be of particular interest tothose pursuing studio art, physics, engineering, architecture, sociology and philosophy. Students interested in pursuing sculpture at the advanced levelshould also take Object Investigation prior to enrolling in Structure and Space, if possible.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018ARTX240Watercolor This course is an exploration of basic watercolor techniques to help assist students in developing the necessary skills to workindependently in this medium. Technical experiments, wash painting,and wet-into-wet techniques teach students to control the medium and layer color.Students learn to work for an extended period of time on one piece, eventually developing their own subject matter and content.Prerequisite: ARTX-201(old ARTX-100) or ARTX-105ARTX250Introduction to Documentary Video Production Designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of documentary filmmaking, thiscourse will cover every aspect of the craft, beginning with pre-production through production and post-production. Students will learn to generate storyideas, interview subjects, transcribe and write scripts, capture and log footage, and edit finished films with music and graphics. Class lectures willprepare students to accomplish every step of the process; students will then work outside of class time to apply the techniques and skills. Students willalso watch scenes from films and critique them as to style, content, and narrative structure. Ethical issues pertaining to documentary filmmaking willalso be discussed. Equipment will be provided, but students will need to purchase a SDXC card and hard drive.ARTX295Ceramics: Intermediate Wheel Throwing This course will explore the possibilities of personal expression and function in the ceramicmedium with a focus on traditional wheel throwing. Hand building and altering techniques will also be covered in challenging new ways. Pottery offers aunique historical and cultural context. Discussions and assignments will reflect on those contexts as well as the value of handmade pottery and the roleof object makers in contemporary society. Students enrolling in this course must have taken Artx125 or another college level wheel throwingcourse.Prerequisite: ARTX-125ARTX295Ceramics: Handbuilding and Ekphrasis The overarching theme is "Ekphrasis", meaning to translate one work of art into another usinga different material (e.g., writing a poem about a painting). Historically potters have replicated objects traditionally made in other materials; there is acontemporary art trend whereby artists remake and reenact artworks. We will research this inclination, and through our making investigate the allure,the controversy and the substance surrounding reconstructing. Through the use of traditional, exploratory and collaborative techniques we will makefunctional and sculptural work. Basic clay and glaze technology are covered through concept-based projects addressing form, surface treatment,translation, and appropriation.ARTX301Advanced Documentary Video Production Advanced Documentary will reinforce skills and explore alternatives to the techniques andaesthetics learned during the Introduction to Documentary course (ARTX-250). Students will be taught a broader repertoire of techniques and skillsbeyond the introductory level with respect to proposing a story, interviewing subjects, transcribing and writing a script, capturing and logging footage,and editing finished films with music and graphics. Students will individually produce between three and four short documentaries that incorporate everystep of the filmmaking process. Class lectures will examine the structure and technique of films; students will then work outside of class time to applywhat they have learned.Prerequisite: ARTX-250ARTX316Intermediate Photography Photography taught as a creative and expressive medium from a fine art perspective. In this course, thestudent will expand their knowledge, skills, and experience in the medium by focusing on an individual project for the duration of the term. The studentcan use either analog or digital tools to create this small body of work. Critiques will be held and a written component will be due as well (structuredreflection and artist statement). A camera with manual exposure capabilities is required.Prerequisite: ARTX-230 and ARTX-115, ARTX-214, orSEMN-214ARTX320Intermediate Ceramics: State of Clay The intermediate levels of Ceramics: Hand Building and Ceramics: Wheel Throwing are taughtas one joint course in the same time slot. Concept-based and technical assignments are designed to be accessible and applicable for both sets ofstudents. Assignments help students question what it means to choose clay as a medium while developing a more advanced body of work. Lectures anddiscussions focus on the expanding role and definition of ceramics within contemporary art, with an emphasis on the development of Americanceramics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Basic clay, glaze and firing technology are covered through a series of technical labs. OfferedSpring (odd years)Prerequisite: ARTX-220 or ARTX-125 (Both are preferred). Students may also use ARTX-206 or SEMN-206 as a prerequisite withinstructor permission.ARTX327Sculpture: Mold Processes A ceramics and sculpture course focusing on the many techniques of mold-making as a means to createand reproduce forms.

Materials include wax, clay, plaster,and non-traditional materials.Prerequisite: Take one of ARTX-134, ARTX-135, ARTX-234, or ARTX-220.ARTX328Intermediate Painting This course builds upon the conceptual approach to painting that began in Painting: Contemporary Practices andwill emphasize individual direction and innovation. Most assignments will begin with an introduction to a broad contemporary theme in the visual arts andwill ask students to respond to some aspect of the topic by generating artwork. The last three weeks will be given over to a series of works that addressone of the topics covered earlier in the quarter or a topic that a student has a particular interest in investigating.Prerequisite: ARTX-228ARTX330Alternative Photographic Processes The objective of this intermediate (and specialized) studio art course is to provide the studentworking knowledge of, and experience with, large format view-cameras and alternative photographic printing processes. In addition to producingphotographs using these admittedly obsolete tools and materials, participants learn to analyze and discuss their work in critiques. Through this study, aswell as the production of a small body of work, each student should finish this course with a deeper understanding of photographic practice. Noequipment is necessary for enrolling in this course, as the college will provide several view cameras that students will share.Prerequisite: ARTX-115,ARTX-116, ARTX-214 or ARTX-230ARTX335Intermediate Sculpture Students may register for Intermediate Sculpture in their junior or senior year, once they have completed at leasttwo other sculpture courses and if Mold Processes is not offered during the term of registration. Individualized projects and assignments build onconcepts and skills developed in earlier courses. Emphasis will be placed on portfolio development in preparation for advanced-level work. Intermediatestudents are required to attend meetings for an introductory course in sculpture throughout the term where they participate in critiques, conduct aresearch presentation and help mentor lower-level students.Prerequisite: Take two courses from ARTX-134 ARTX-135 ARTX-234 and ARTX-327ARTX416Advanced Photography Photography taught as a creative and expressive medium from a fine art perspective.

Students in this course come together, regardlessof preferred media, to support and challenge each other as they develop their own contemporary practice. Class time is used for critiques, presentations,discussions and professional exercises and does not usually include open studio time.Prerequisite: Senior art majors with at least one 300-level studio artcourse; non-majors with permission.ARTX/SEMN496S.P.A.C.E. Experience or "S.P.A.C.E." is a senior-level civic-engagement art course that explores the relationship between Artand Activism, Social Justice, Community and/or Civic Engagement. This course is designed to be a collaborative experience for students from multipledisciplines and majors, regardless of prior experience in art. Throughout the term, students work together in small groups similar to mini "think tanks".Course content focuses on collaborative approaches to creating art for and with communities, with an emphasis on socially-just practices. Among thequestions students will investigate during the term are: "How can art facilitate our experiences in public and private spaces? Who has access to aspace? How do we share space and interact within it? What is the potential of the artist as an agent of change?" Professional skills such as responsibleengagement, grant seeking/writing and project design will also be covered. Class and project workspace is housed in the Kalamazoo CollegeCommunity Studio in the Park Trades Center. Each student will engage in a field experience, working with an organization or program in the city ofKalamazoo, for the duration of the term. This course is a Shared Passages Senior Capstone.Prerequisite: Seniors OnlyBiologyProfessors: Fraser, Girdler (Chair, W,S), Langeland, Moore (Chair F), Salinas, A. Wollenberg, M. WollenbergThe mission of our department and curriculum is to educate students in the field of biology and within the context of a Kalamazoo College liberal artseducation. Through our courses, research collaborations, and advising we help each of our students become an intrinsically motivated, self-directedlearner who enjoys a biologist's keen awareness of the natural world. Specifically, we foster development of the following attributes in our biologymajors: 1) knowledge of the diversity of living organisms and levels - from molecules to ecosystems - at which those organisms can be studied; 2)understanding of how organisms are affected by their evolutionary and developmental trajectories and how these are influenced by environmentalcontingency; 3) ability to discover new biological knowledge and then communicate it effectively to others; and 4) curiosity about and empathy towardour shared environment.Requirements for the Major in BiologyConsonant with the experiential-learning focus of the K-Plan and motivated by the biology department mission, our emphasis on an empirical approachto biology creates an environment in which students develop a strong foundation in biology. We encourage our students to ask and seek answers toprobing questions, interpret primary literature, design and perform experiments, and make original observations of biological phenomena. Thedevelopmental progression from introductory core courses through upper-level electives prepares students well for the challenges of carrying out theirSenior Individualized Projects, presenting results of those projects at our annual Diebold Symposium, and then continuing their education or seekingemployment after graduation.Number of UnitsA minimum of nine biology courses (five required and four electives) and four cognates exclusive of lab credit, all at C- or better are required tocomplete a major in biology.Among biology electives, at least three must be at the 300 level or higher, two of which must be a lab course. Other than -2019September 21, 2018Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyBiological PhysicsCommunity and Global HealthEnvironmental StudiesNeuroscienceBiology Courses for NonmajorsAll biology courses at the 100 level are open to nonmajors without prerequisite. Courses we offer for nonmajors have goals consistent with those for thebiology curriculum focused on majors. To attain those goals, general education courses directed primarily at students not majoring in biology should helpstudents:Appreciate, understand, and engage in the process of doing science.Evaluate validity of scientific communications. For example, our students should be able to read, understand, and evaluate any New York Timesarticle, especially those in the Tuesday Science Times.Be comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty.Learn that science is a fascinating human endeavor, applicable to everyday life.Biology coursesBIOL112Evolution and Genetics with Lab An introduction to principles of evolution and genetics. Includes a comprehensive overview ofgenetics from molecular, classical, and population perspectives, as well as in-depth treatment of evolutionary mechanisms, phylogenetic analysis, and thehistory of life on Earth. Laboratories include the purification and analysis of DNA, Drosophila and bacterial genetics, computer and class simulations ofevolutionary processes, and bioinformatics.BIOL115Environmental Science In this course you will (1) build a basic understanding of the physical and natural systems that make up thebiosphere on Earth (land, water, atmosphere, and life) stressing the dynamics of these interconnected systems; (2) develop a scientific understanding ofthe causes and consequences of several of the major environmental problems facing today's society; (3) acquire the tools to enable you to thinkcritically about other current and future environmental challenges you will face as a member of contemporary society. One weekend field trip isrequired. Intended for non-majors and as an entry to the Environmental Studies Concentration.BIOL123Form and Function with Lab Organism-level phylogeny, morphology, and physiology are the major subject areas of this course;organisms interacting with, and adapting or adjusting to, their environments is the underlying theme running through these subject areas. Through thiscourse students will learn how the environment, biotic and abiotic, shapes the form (morphology) and function (physiology and behavior) of organismsover ecological and evolutionary time.BIOL200Research Apprenticeship in Biology Apprenticeships intended to provide opportunities for biology majors to become regularly involvedin ongoing research projects with faculty, either with the same faculty member for a number of quarters or with different faculty in different quarters. Aminimum of 50 hours of work is expected for each quarter. Three apprenticeships earn one full unit toward graduation.BIOL222Vertebrate Biology with Lab Broad-based study of comparative anatomy and life histories of adult vertebrates and how these influenceour understanding of vertebrate phylogeny; laboratories in comparative anatomy and diversity of vertebrates. Prerequisite: BIOL-123 All courseprerequisites must be met with a minimum grade of C-.BIOL224Ecology and Conservation with Lab Ecology is rooted in natural history, the description of organisms in their environments. Ecologistsstudy interactions in nature across many levels of biological organization, from individuals to populations, communities, ecosystems, and, finally, theentire biosphere; this course is organized along this continuum. How do we explain the distribution and abundances of organisms? How do populationsof different species interact as competitors, as predators and prey, as pathogens and hosts, and as mutualists? And finally, given the planet-wideenvironmental impact of our species, how can ecologists apply their knowledge to the conservation of natural resources?Prerequisite: BIOL-123 Allcourse prerequisites must be met with a minimum grade of C-.BIOL232Plant Biology with Lab In this course we will explore the consequences of being a plant: they make their own food; generally they arestuck in one place; they are as dumb as posts; they are modular; they have some very cool genetics; they have evolved some critically importantsymbioses with bacteria and fungi. Moreover, plants can live without us, but we cannot live without them. We will review the plant kingdom generally,but we will focus on the angiosperms (flowering plants), covering broad aspects of structure, development, growth, and reproduction. Laboratory willfocus on field identification and ecology.Prerequisite: BIOL-123 or Permission All course prerequisites must be met with a minimum grade of C-.BIOL246Cell and Molecular Biology with Lab The complex workings of individual cells will be explored from a molecular perspective.

Pronunciation system, basic vocabulary, written script,fundamental grammatical structures, as well as some cultural background of the language will be studied. The goal of this course is to set a goodfoundation for making Chinese a functional language for the students. Students are asked to follow three principles: (1) make Chinese a part of dailylife, (2) use Chinese actively in class and outside of class, and (3) be creative in finding ideas for using the Chinese language.CHIN102Beginning Chinese II This course follows Beginning Chinese I. All four skills -- listening, speaking, reading, and writing -- are equallyemphasized. By the end of this course, students are expected to understand simple questions and answers, to be able to ask and respond to simplequestions, to understand simple statements, and to be able to participate in simple conversations on a few familiar topics. Students will also be expectedto read and write simple notes, meaningful sentences, and short passages constructed with basic grammatical patterns.Prerequisite: CHIN-101CHIN103Beginning Chinese III A continuation of Beginning Chinese II, this course further consolidates the essential skills in reading, writing,listening to, and speaking Chinese. The goals are to increase vocabulary, to form a clear understanding of the language through knowledge of themeaning of words and structures, and to advance the ability of students to express themselves in the language accurately and properly on some selectedtopics.Prerequisite: CHIN-102CHIN201Intermediate Chinese I This course follows -2019September 21, 2018CHIN260Women in China As in many countries subject to imperialism, women's movements in China were an important part of China'smodernization project. How, then, have Chinese feminist theories and women's movements been different from those in the West? What is it like to liveas a woman in a rapidly changing China through the 20th and 21st centuries? This course takes three approaches to explore these questions. Toexamine the characteristics and changes of gender roles we look at the representations of women in literature and film. To understand women'sexperiences we read women writers' essays, memoirs and fictions. To think about how women work as historical agents who make historical changes,we look at women activists, feminist thinkers and women's movements.CHIN295Reading of Chinese Poetry This course provides students with an opportunity to read, discuss, and enjoy Chinese poetry. All readingsare in English translation. While the primary focus is on close reading of poetic texts, students will be analyzing poetry from scholarly perspectives,writing research papers of poetic studies, and composing their own poems. Students will also acquire knowledge on the history of Chinese poetry andpoetics from the beginnings to the eighteen century. This course may be of the interest of East Asian Studies majors, students who want to learn aboutChinese culture, and those who are interested in poetry in general.CHIN300Advanced Chinese This course is a continuation of the Intermediate Chinese language sequence. The objective is to make a transitionfrom textbook Chinese to real-life communication situations. For this purpose, the course surveys materials including texts from literature, the socialsciences and cultural history, and students will be exposed to a wide variety of written and spoken styles of Chinese. Some of the materials selected areoriginal publications drawn from books, magazines and newspapers. The opportunity to work directly with lively, authentic materials will be valuable forstudying Chinese language, literature, society and culture. This course focuses on content and style with extensive discussion and frequent writtenassignments in Chinese. It will consolidate what the students have learned in the past and help them develop better reading and writing skills. In addition,the improvement of speaking and listening abilities will also be emphasized. This course may be tailored to the needs of the participants and may betaken for credit up to three times.Prerequisite: CHIN-203CHIN495Social & Cultural Issues in Today's China This course is designed for, and only open to, seniors who have returned from study inChina.

The study of the classical languages,classical Greek and Latin, is essential to this, but the department also encourages exploration of antiquity through courses in archaeology, art, history,religion, philosophy, as well as literature in translation.The department offers four majors—in Classics, Latin, Greek and Classical Civilization—and three minors—in Latin, Greek and Classical Civilization.Students intending to pursue the study of classical languages at the graduate level are encouraged to major in classics; those who are interested insecondary school teaching, divinity school, or graduate work in a cognate area are encouraged to major in either Greek or Latin. Students who discovera passion for classical history or archaeology, or who discover the field late in their college careers may be drawn to the major in Classical Civilization,which emphasizes work in translation.Majors and minors in classics often enhance their studies of the ancient world through experiences that give them a first-hand appreciation of Romanand Greek civilizations. Through participation in our study abroad programs at American University in Rome, the Intercollegiate Center in Rome andCollege Year in Athens, students learn about the ancient cities through on-site instruction, and augment their studies with courses in ancient and modernlanguages and cultures. In addition we work with students to find appropriate summer internships and archaeological fieldwork opportunities. Such asummer experience often provides the basis for a senior individualized project, which can span a wide range: creative writing, historiography,archaeological fieldwork, literary analysis, and comparative studies of literature and culture.Faculty interact with students in and out of the classroom. The classics department has an active lecture series, promotes classically themed activitiesand works with students to craft a major program that will help them attain their career goals. Our majors pursue graduate work in classics, as well ascareers in the ministry, secondary school education, business, law, and the military.PlacementAll incoming students who have previously studied Latin or Ancient Greek in high school or elsewhere must take the College’s placement test.Placement can also be determined by a student's score on the College Board's SAT II test or the advanced placement test in Latin.SAT IISAT II students with scores of 425 or lower (and with fewer than three years of high school Latin) will be placed in -2019September 21, 2018Units from Study Abroad and Transfer CreditStudents may receive up to three units of credit toward the major or the minor for classes taken on study abroad.

Critical theory is a term that describes a wide array of approaches to understandingand criticizing the myriad relations of domination characterizing contemporary society. Although there are many disagreements among critical theorists,most agree about the terrain under consideration: how do human beings create the social world, and how are they created by it, in ways thatdisempower social agents and disfigure their desires? Or, what is the relationship between structure and agency, and what does this tell us aboutrelations of power and domination? Human freedom and social justice are generally the ethical ideals animating these investigations, so that criticaltheory is necessarily both descriptive and normative in nature while it presumes a close connection between theory and practice. Most simply, criticaltheorists ask, what is wrong with our world, and how can we make it better? At a deeper methodological level, critical theorists also see themselves aspractitioners in a distinctive orientation to knowledge. Interdisciplinary in nature and drawing primarily from numerous fields in the humanities and socialsciences, critical theory offers a genealogy of social reality on one hand and a genealogy of its own critical stance within it on the other. Many criticaltheorists presume that language both creates and interprets reality, that agents are historically constituted, or that knowledge is bound up with powerrelations so that there is no objective "outside" from which to view the "truth." Thus, critical theory poses a challenge to many of the traditionaldisciplines that assume that facts can be ascertained and deployed free of a normative framework.Requirements for the ConcentrationNumber of Units6 unitsRequired Course-2019September 21, 2018East Asian StudiesProfessors: Sugimori (Director, Japan Track), Chamness, Frost (Director), WalkerEast Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary major that introduces students to the region that includes China, Japan, and Korea. Home to some of theworld¹s most ancient and complex cultures, East Asia continues to be a significant, though little understood region today. The East Asian Studies majorrequires at least two years of either Chinese or Japanese (or demonstrated equivalency) and at least six months of study aboard in China or Japan. Inaddition to language courses in Chinese or Japanese, students take courses taught in English on the literatures, histories, cultures, and societies of China,Japan, and Korea to develop both in-depth knowledge of one country (China or Japan) and broader familiarity with the region in general.

It stresses the central role that culture plays in fostering an understanding of German society, and it introduces students tothe tools and theories of cultural analysis. Readings and genres range from literature and film to documentaries, magazine articles, blogs, cartoons, andmusic, and they may be focused on a single theme across a number of time periods to provide a context toward an understanding of how a particulartext reflects cultural identities. In German.Prerequisite: GERM-203 or GERM-204GERM410German Songs and Sagas, Folk and Fairy Tales This course examines common structural and thematic elements in German epic andlyric poetry, folk and fairy tales from the Middle Ages to the Second World War. The first half of the course will be devoted primarily to a key text inthe history of German literature, the medieval epic Das Nibelungenlied. After reading the text closely (in modern German translation), students willstudy the reception of the Nibelungenlied in 19th and early 20th century German culture (through Wagner's opera and Fritz Lang's film) and itsimportance for burgeoning German nationalism. In the second half of the course, students will trace key themes from the Nibelungenlied--love and loss,honor and war, and the nature of the heroine and hero/warrior--in folk and fairy tales and in lyric poetry from the Enlightenment to the 20th century. InGerman.Prerequisite: GERM-301GERM411Writing One's Life and Times: Autobiography and Personal Writing in Germany In this course, students will engage with avariety of texts written in German in the 20th century that fall into the genre of person writing (autobiographies, journals, and letters). Readings willcenter around three themes: defining an artistic identity in the modern age, living through times of crisis, and women's struggle for social recognition anda public voice. Students will gain a critical understanding of the many and varied ways in which individuals use personal texts to communicate withothers, to define identity, to call for social change, and to come to terms with the world in which they live. Student responses to the texts under studywill take the form of informal discussions, discussion leadership, oral presentations, and formal essays, and they will also author their own shortautobiographical texts and journals or web logs. In German.Prerequisite: GERM-301GERM412German Drama Workshop The essence of drama lies in its performance. Despite the fact that dramas have often been written thatwere never performed during the lifetimes of their authors (sometimes quite intentionally so), most dramas only blossom into their full range of meaningwhen realized upon the stage by actors. It is also true that in order to gain a deep understanding of the internal mechanics of the drama, and anappreciation for the craft of the playwright, it is invaluable to take part in the production of the play in question. Here one sees the play "from the inside,"a radically different perspective than that afforded by the comfortable seat in the audience or the library. In this course students will play the parts ofboth actor and director with a view to gaining access to these deeper levels of understanding found within a selection of German dramas. Followingcollective reading and discussion of the dramas, each course participant will have the chance to act or direct a scene for him/herself. A critical elementof this course will be discussion of the cultural contexts in which each drama was originally written and performed, including comparative actingtechniques and what these tell us about the epoch of German culture in which they emerged. Taught in German.Prerequisite: GERM-301GERM420Introduction to German Cinema This course will offer an overview of German cinema through the analysis of nine films from theWeimar Republic through the post-Wende period. We will screen and discuss films from a wide variety of periods of German cinematic history duringthis course: the Weimar Era, the Third Reich, Postwar Cinema, New German Cinema, East German or DEFA Cinema, Women's Cinema, and post-Wende cinema. Our primary focus in this course will be on learning the basics of film language and analysis; developing skill in close textual reading offilm through sequence analysis; and understanding the film both as art and as cultural artifact within its historical (and film historical) contexts. InGerman.Prerequisite: GERM-301GERM421Classic German Cinema of the 1920s and 30s This course seeks to acquaint its participants with the rich world of Weimar-eraGerman culture, and specifically with the vibrant production of films during the 1920s and 30s. The German film industry was the only significantchallenger to Hollywood's domination of the big screen during this era, and it crafted its own distinctive style with directors and performers whoseaccomplishments served as cinematic milestones for world cinema. A second, but not less important, goal of this course is to instill the vocabulary andanalytical skills necessary to read and comprehend filmic texts that both filter and reflect the cultures and historical periods in which they emerged. InGerman.Prerequisite: GERM-301GERM423Topics in German Cinema This addresses a variety of topics (on a rotating basis) related to German cinema. These may include "TheFilms of Fritz Lang," "East German Cinema," and "Women in German Cinema." An important goal of the course is to instill the vocabulary andanalytical skills necessary to read and comprehend filmic texts that both filter and reflect the cultures and historical periods in which they emerged.

In the immediate postwar period thephysical map of "Japan" shrank dramatically, and a national imagination that had for decades ranged across the plains of Manchuria and far into SouthAsia collapsed in on itself. This course investigates the ways in which prominent writers (and a few filmmakers) confronted this collapse and everythingit implied, from a tentative renegotiation of Japan's place in the world (largely via its relationship with the United States), to a rapidly urbanizing society'srelationship to its own hinterlands. Authors covered include Dazai Osamu, Abe Kobo, Murakami Ryu, Tawada Yoko, and Furukawa Hideo. Allreadings, lectures, and discussions in English.JAPN239Modern Japanese Literature in Translation This course will examine a number of Japanese authors, from the late 19th centurythrough the early 20th century, who have addressed the cultural and psychic disease that resulted from Japan's encounter with the West andtransformation of Japan into a modern, nationalistic state. Authors read will include: Natsume Soseki, Mori Ogai, Higuchi Ichiyo, and Tanzaki Jun'ichiro.JAPN245Japanese Language in Society This course explores several major aspects of language use associated with Japanese culture andsociety. The course aims not only at familiarizing students with various aspects of Japanese language with reference to culture and society, but alsotheir developing an appreciation for a different culture. When discussing the inherent inter-relationship between language and culture, including thebeliefs, values, and social organization, we will focus on the ideas of power, hierarchy, gender, and history. No previous knowledge of Japanese orlinguistics is assumed or required. Readings, lectures, and discussion are all in English.JAPN250Manga/Anime and Gender in Modern Japan Why are manga/anime so popular? Let's find out. This course undertakes a criticalanalysis of manga (comics) and anime (animation). We will examine these media's historical origins, narrative features, the world's reception and muchmore. The samurai warrior, the bishônen (beautiful boy), and the sexy cyborg-gender in Japanese culture has vivid representations. This courseexplores constructions of masculinity and femininity, paying attention to the figures of the girl as the postwar descendant of the bishônen, the ostensiblyundersocialized otaku and yaoi culture and transgender manga where imagination opens the door to alternate and critical realities.JAPN301High Intermediate Japanese Language This course is the first level of the third-year Japanese language sequence, offering moreadvanced training in the four skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing.Prerequisite: JAPN-203 or equivalent placementJAPN302High Intermediate Japanese Language II This course is the second of the third-year Japanese language sequence, offering moreadvanced training in the four skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing.Prerequisite: JAPN-301 or equivalent placementJAPN401Advanced Japanese This class is an advanced level class.

Music Minors areencouraged to participate in an ensemble and to study applied music in each quarter of residency. With few exceptions, each full unit of applied musiccredited toward the Minor must be achieved by study in the same instrument. Musical performances on campus should be attended by Music Minors,including concerts by invited guests, by Music Department Faculty, and by fellow music students.Music coursesMUSC100Program Music: Stories in Sound Program music is instrumental music influenced by an extra-musical source. In other words, themusic contains a "program" or story. The program can be drawn from any source, but is usually taken from literature, myths, legends, landscapes,paintings, or personal dramas. Therefore, in addition to studying the music, this course will examine the extra-musical influences associated with themusic. To further enhance your understanding and appreciation of this genre, you will produce four programmatic works of your own by creatingmultimedia presentations using music and images in support of an original story or borrowed program. No prior training or experience in music isassumed or necessary, and the course is intended for non-majors. The cultivation of intelligent and perceptive responses to programmatic music will bethe primary focus as we explore the many aspects of this genre, be they cultural, mechanical, or expressive.MUSC105Introduction to Music Study of the language, power, and communicative properties of music in the Western tradition. Students willacquire basic skills in music literacy, theory, and aural comprehension. In addition, selected works, both popular and classical and ranging in time fromthe Middle Ages to the present, will be listened to and discussed with an emphasis on their musical style and cultural-social context.

Modern biological examination of the brain and behavior of organisms has incorporated other fields of inquiry, namelybiochemistry, psychology, physics, mathematics, computational modeling, and philosophy, making neuroscience a truly interdisciplinary effort. Aconcentration in neuroscience is offered for advanced students who want to study at the confluence of these traditional disciplines.The Concentration in NeuroscienceNumber of UnitsNineKALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Required Courses-2019September 21, 2018How do we know? (Theories of Knowledge)What ought we to do? (Ethics)What is beauty? (Philosophy of Art)What is good reasoning? (Logic and Reasoning)What is being and what is it to be human? (Metaphysics and Mind)In these courses, students are asked to identify, reflect upon, and exercise the key concepts, theories, and viewpoints that allow us to competentlyaddress ethical, epistemological, logical, metaphysical, and aesthetic issues. Subfield courses cultivate a student's ability to systematically, self-consciously, and flexibly manage a repertoire of conceptual tools to discern, analyze, and deliberate about contemporary problems. By gaining asensitivity for different ways of perceiving and thinking about a single issue, students develop an appreciation for the complexity of actual problemsolving.The department also offers specialized subfield courses under the following three categories:Applied Ethics (Ecological Philosophy, Biomedical Ethics, Philosophy of Law)Applied Epistemology (Philosophy of Science and Philosophy of the Social Sciences)Linguistics (Philosophy of Language)Political Theory (Classical and Contemporary Social Contract Theory, Human Rights and International Law, Theorizing Citizenship andImmigration)In these courses, emphasis is placed upon genuine problem solving in contemporary circumstances. The applied ethics courses introduce students to thesystematic analysis of contemporary problems encountered in jurisprudence, political legitimation, healthcare practices, and environmental stewardship.Students learn to unravel the factual, conceptual, and normative threads interwoven in current crises. They also develop the ability to reflectivelymanage different theoretical perspectives upon a single, multifaceted problem. The applied epistemology courses examine fundamental questionsconcerning the logic and practices of the natural and social sciences. The philosophical linguistics courses analyze language competencies (semanticsand pragmatics) and literary discourse (narratology).OutcomesThe philosophy program is committed to five overarching outcomes for students in our classes and in our major:1. Knowledge: Gain appropriate breadth and depth of knowledge of the major traditions, figures, issues, and theories studied.2. Skills:1. Write in a style appropriate to scholarly philosophy;2. Think clearly, rigorously, and logically about conflicting philosophical points of view;3. Engage in open, critical, cooperative discussion and interrogation;4. Cultivate philosophical impulses and insights and reflectively employ philosophical techniques;5. Comprehend, accurately represent, and originally construct arguments in the philosophical style;6. Conduct independent philosophical research;7. Present independent research in a professional setting.3. Integration:1. Connect philosophical learning to other learning abilities, career goals, daily life, and roles in the world;2. Deepen a shared commitment to critical self-reflection as a fundamental dimension of living well.4. Preparation:1. Thrive in selected post-graduate studies;2. Address vocational challenges by mobilizing critical thinking, writing, and verbal skills;3. Confront personal challenges with an awareness of philosophical resources.5. Attitude: Gain a "philosophical sense" of curiosity, a willingness to engage in "meta-level" thinking, a determination to understand complex issues,and a cooperative and constructive spirit in critical deliberation with others.PreparationPhilosophy is a sound choice for those seeking a broad liberal arts undergraduate education and for those who value the skills and outlook imparted bystudying the discipline. The major program prepares students for graduate studies in philosophy, law, social policy, and political theory, to name just afew areas of formal specialization. Students preparing for graduate studies in philosophy are strongly advised to follow a more structured majorsprogram with additional course recommendations.Transfer and Study Abroad CreditThe Philosophy Department's transfer policies are as follows. All transfer courses in Philosophy must be approved by the Philosophy faculty uponconsideration of a course catalog description and a syllabus for the course (to be provided by the student). If the course is taken during a student'senrollment at Kalamazoo College (for instance, on study abroad or during the summer), the approval must be obtained before the course is taken. Inaddition, the Department will consider only courses taught by instructors with a Ph.D. in Philosophy, or who are "ABD" (all but dissertation) inPhilosophy.Requirements for the Major in PhilosophyNumber of UnitsMinimum of 8 total units are required, which may include the SIP.Required Individual Courses-2019September 21, 20182 Required History and Traditions Courses from the following list:-2019September 21, 2018PHIL195Philosophical Explorations of Happiness What is happiness? What would it mean to live happily? Are there some conditions in whichhappiness can be realized and others in which it would be restricted? The question of what happiness entails, and what are the ways and conditions inwhich human beings can experience happiness has been a persistent concern of philosophers since antiquity to the present day. In this class, we willlook to a variety of ways that Western thinkers have responded to both the question of what happiness is and what it would mean to live happily. Wewill also examine the way in which our happiness could be tied to both the nature of our desires and the freedom that we may have to realize happiness.PHIL195Knowledge & Reality: An Introduction How much do you really know? Do you know that you are not dreaming right now? Do youknow that an intelligent evil spirit is not deceiving you right now? Do you know that your senses are not deceiving you right now as they have so manytimes in the past? Do you know that a world separate from you even exists? How about God; do you know that God exists? Come to think of it, do youeven know that you exist? And even if you do exist, can you make free choices? Can you freely decide to take this class, or it already predetermined?Readings will include classics from such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, Rene Descartes, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant, as well asmore contemporary works from such philospohers as Bertrand Russell, W. V. O. Quine, Susan Wolf, John Searle, and Jennifer Lackey.PHIL/CLAS205Ancient Philosophy A study of ancient views on nature, knowledge, soul, the self, morality, and the good life. This is a history ofphilosophy course rather than a history course; we will be studying the ideas, arguments, and theories put forth by ancient philosophers, rather thanbiographical, cultural, anthropological, or historical issues about them or their time period. We will largely be trying to understand what these thinkerswere trying to say, and why they thought what they did. In addition, we will be discussing the merits of the various positions and reasons offered.Readings will focus on selections from Plato and Aristotle, but will also include readings from the pre-Socratic and Hellenistic philosophers, all majorsources of the Western philosophical tradition. Recommended for classics students. . (This is a designated Greek literature or culture course inClassics.)PHIL206Early Modern Philosophy Historical study of the "Early Modern" period in Western philosophy (17th and 18th century). The course willexplore the profoundly influential development of rationalist and empiricist approaches to philosophical thinking; topics may include the connectionbetween mind and body, skepticism and the possibility of knowledge, the existence of God, knowledge of the external world, the nature of minds andtheir ideas, and the proper method of philosophical method. Readings from Descartes, Leibniz, Berkeley, Locke, Hume, and others. Recommended forcomputer science and psychology students. Sophomore standing recommended.PHIL20718th-Century Philosophy Study of the Enlightenment period through a critical comparison of two of its most famous 18th-centuryphilosophers -- David Hume and Immanuel Kant -- who set the stage for contemporary debates in psychology, cognitive science, and artificialintelligence. Hume proposed to study humans just as Sir Isaac Newton had proposed to study nature: namely, through observation and experimentation.We will study Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature as a manifesto for the modern, naturalistic study of human experience and judgment. We will thenstudy Kant's powerful arguments against Hume, examining in close detail Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, his demonstration that humans activelysynthesize sensory data according to rules that they "spontaneously" impose to make experience possible. The film Memento, literary narratives, andstudies of Alzheimer patients are used to illustrate the logical and temporal construction of human experience. A reading-intensive course with threeessay assignments. Recommended for psychology, computer science, and English students.PHIL20819th-Century Philosophy This course examines how 19th-century European philosophers inherit and develop Kant's radical claims that(1) human agents are radically free, (2) knowledge is constructed, and (3) hope in moral progress is rational. We will examine how Fichte, Schiller,Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche work out how humans could really be "free," "autonomous," or "self-determining" while remaining naturalanimals and socially-situated subjects. Films such as Memento, American Beauty, Waterland, Babette's Feast, The Hairdresser's Husband, and Sex,Lies, and Videotape are shown. Lecture and discussion course with three paper assignments. First-year students with strong writing skills welcome.Recommended for psychology, English, and political science students.PHIL209/-2019September 21, 2018PHIL218Analytic Philosophy & Science Historical introduction to analytic philosophers who studied the foundations of logic, mathematics,science, and linguistics as a critique of traditional philosophy. Recommended for students of the natural sciences, mathematics, cognitive science, andneuroscience interested in the analysis of scientific change and revolution. We examine (1) Frege and Russell's development of formal logic and thefoundations of mathematics, (2) Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle, and logical positivism, (3) ordinary language philosophy, (4) Quine's and Putnam'sdestruction of logical positivism and the "analytic" conception of language, and (5) formal developments such as Goedel's incompleteness theorem,Tarski's truth schema, Chomsky's generative grammar, modal logic, and direct-reference theories of meaning.PHIL291Theorizing Citizenship & Immigration This course examines normative questions raised by citizenship and immigration. The first partof the course surveys different models for political community and how they affect the way we view formal membership status in such communities.We will cover the main philosophical theories for how the ideal of citizenship ought to be conceived. The second part of the course covers refugees:How are they different from immigrants? What special claims do they have? How might recognizing these claims affect the resources and attentionnations should give to immigrants? The third part of the course covers more standard cases of immigration. We will cover key philosophical argumentsthat advocate either more or less restrictive immigration policies: arguments about the acceptable criteria that may be used in deciding who to admit,regarding how much weight the preservation of "national culture" should hold (and who decides what that is, anyhow?), about the moral (un)desirabilityand (im)practicability of open borders, on whether and to what extent receiving nations should seek to mitigate the "brain-drain" from sending nations,and finally arguments about the priority immigration reform should take vis-à-vis other reforms of issues that might "cause" mass migration (globalpoverty, weak international institutions, repressive, incompetent or exploited/exploitative governments abroad, etc).PHIL295Special Topics Special Topics offerings focus upon topics not addressed in the department's regular offerings. The course can berepeated with a different topic. Check the course schedule to see when Special Topics courses are being offered.PHIL295History and Freedom Critical examination of ancient, modern, and contemporary conceptualizations of human history in connection withthe theme of human freedom. Special emphasis is given to the contrast between dualistic conceptions of history, both theological and philosophical, andmaterialist conceptions of history that link the unfolding of time with the advent of human freedom. Readings from St. Augustine, Kant, Hegel, Marx,Nietzsche, Adorno, and Benjamin. We conclude with reflections upon contemporary emancipatory movements and their varying conceptualizations ofhow freedom might redeem, not only the future generations, but past ones as well.PHIL305Biomedical Ethics This course focuses on a variety of ethical issues brought about by modern medical technology and practice. We startby surveying the normative frameworks used by contemporary medical ethicists, paying particular emphasis to the main principles of medical ethics andthe special nature of the relationship between doctors and patients. We then apply the principles of medical ethics and our insights about the doctor-patient relationship to controversial contemporary issues such as abortion, physician assisted death/suicide, euthanasia, the limits of doctor-patientconfidentiality, the determination of organ transplant recipients, the determination of patient competence, and surrogacy contracts (among other issues).The class will often use short narrative case studies and longer court cases in order to highlight the complex nature of these issues. The course aims toemphasize that these issues are controversial precisely because very good arguments can often be made on either side, and to give students theanalytical and evaluative frameworks to make judgments on their own. Readings will include contemporary philosophical articles, court decisions,statements by medical and governmental organizations, and textbook material on ethical theories and tools. Suggested for health sciences students andrecommended for science students. No prerequisites, but junior- or senior-level reading and writing skills are recommended.PHIL306Philosophy of Language Study of 20th-century philosophy of language. Introduction to traditional semantics (e.g. reference, truth, andmeaning) will be followed by a detailed examination of speech-act theory or pragmatics. The course will focus on the complexity of speech acts and thevarious dimensions of understanding involved in successful communication. Using speech act theory, students are asked to analyze cinematographicartworks such as Twelfth Night, Glengarry Glen Ross, American Buffalo, Oleanna, etc. to examine how language and social power work together.Topics include theories of speaker meaning and reference, indexicals, direct and indirect speech acts, conversational implication, presupposition,anaphora, non-literal language use, translation, rule-following, and the relation between language and thought. Readings from Frege, Russell,Wittgenstein, Quine, Austin, Dummett, Putnam, Searle, Davidson, Habermas, and Recanati. Lecture and discussion format with three essayassignments. Recommended for foreign language, theatre arts, and English students.PHIL308Metaphysics and Mind Examination of topics in the Western philosophical areas of metaphysics and philosophy of mind, and theirintersection. Metaphysics is concerned with the structure of reality; philosophy of mind is the branch of metaphysics concerned with the nature ofminds. The topics studied could include the "mind/body problem," consciousness, personal identity, and free will and determinism. Is the mind anonphysical soul-like entity, or is the mind the brain, or is it the software that runs on the brain's hardware, or is it something else? Can the qualitativepart of our experience -- the part involving what it feels like to be in various states -- be captured in purely physical terms, or is it inescapablynonphysical? What makes you the same person over time? Does modern scientific knowledge entail that none of our actions is really free? What is itfor an action to be free, anyway? The readings for this course will consist mostly of primary scholarly articles by contemporary philosophers. Suggestedfor psychology students. Some background in philosophy recommended.PHIL310Critical Social Theory: the Dialectic of Enlightenment Introduction to the Frankfurt School of Social Criticism and its legacy as"Critical Social Theory." We begin by examining the "first generation" of the Frankfurt School, from its founding in the 1920s and '30s by Horkheimer,Adorno, Benjamin, Fromm, and Marcuse to Habermas's early writings in the '60s & '70s. We then examine "second-generation" research, JuergenHabermas's "Theory of Communicative Action," with its distinctive ideal of "undistorted communication" as the measure of social rationality. Finally, weexplore Axel Honneth's alternative, "third generation," Neo-Hegelian model of social development, with its distinctive ideal of "undamaged identities" andthe "struggle for mutual recognition" as the critical measures of social pathologies. Throughout the course, examples of U.S. social movements -- green,feminist, queer, race-based, & post-colonial movements -- will be used to assess the relative strengths of these competing diagnostic models of socialcrisis. Suggested for political science, anthropology/sociology, economics, and environmental studies students. Recommended for students with somebackground in philosophy, in particular students who have taken 19th-Century Philosophy. We recommend 19th-Century Philosophy as a prerequisite,but it's not required.PHIL311Postmodern Critical Theory: The Critique of Modernity Introduction to contemporary French philosophy, with special emphasis onthe themes of language, desire, embodiment, and sexual difference. We examine the early debate between Merleau-Ponty and Lacan on the acquisitionof language, formation of desire, and development of body images We then turn to two key post-structuralists: Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.We focus upon Foucault's transition from his "archaeology of knowledge" to his mature "genealogy of desire," contrasting his account of embodimentand social power to Pierre Bourdieu's. After reviewing Derrida's deconstructionist analysis of language, we turn to one of the following figures:Kristeva, Deleuze, Irigary, Butler, or Zizek. Films are shown throughout the course on Wednesday evenings. Media Studies concentrators areencouraged to write final essays linking philosophy and cinematography. Suggested for media studies, psychology, English, French, and political sciencestudents.

See the Kalamazoo Curriculum -> Curriculum Details and Policies section of the Academic Catalog for moredetails.Prerequisite: Permission of department and SIP supervisor required.Public Policy and Urban AffairsProfessor: Stull (Director)Centered in the social science division, the concentration in public policy and urban affairs represents an interdisciplinary approach to the study of socialproblems and public policy in contemporary industrial societies. It encourages students to focus on and get involved in the significant policy-relatedproblems confronting their generation, prepares students to think from the perspective of policy makers, and promotes public service. The concentrationis open to all students, but naturally complements study in anthropology- sociology, economics, and political science.Combining concern for both local and national policy, this concentration seeks to take advantage of the College's urban setting as well as opportunitiesfor internships and study around the country. At the local level, in part through the Center for Civic Engagement and various service learning classes,we support study, research, and internships in metropolitan Kalamazoo. The College's Study Away programs, together with its career development andSIP, provide openings for work and research in national centers. (Limits apply to the number of participants in the Study Away programs.) Off-campusexperiences will serve both to develop practical experience and to promote insights based on comparisons between different approaches to socialproblems. The Concentration in Public Policy and Urban AffairsNumber of UnitsSix units are required.Required CoursesFour core courses, one from each of the following areas:Economics:-2019September 21, 2018Anthropology-Sociology:-2019September 21, 2018RELG110Introduction to the New Testament This course explores the writings of the New Testament, their relationship to the history andculture in which they were produced, and their relevance to more recent issues in modern religious discourse. We will cover a range of topics, includingthe historical perspective on who Jesus was, the impact of Paul on Christianity, the formation of the canon, political religion in the Roman empire, ethics,and gender. We will apply several modern approaches as well as survey at various points the "afterlife" of the Christian scriptural traditions inChristianity. No prior knowledge of or experience with the subject is assumed or required.RELG111From Jesus to Christianity This class critically engages the various scholarly narratives that describe the rise of Christianity by taking aclose look at the texts used to construct these narratives, often with particular attention to the role of Christian women. How did a single "Christianity"emerge from a welter of alternatives and possibilities? Or did it? How did thinkers from Paul to Saint Anthony navigate the diverse teachings, ritualsand social practices associated with Jesus of Nazareth and his followers to produce a religious movement that was oppressed by Roman imperialauthority, but later came to occupy that authority?RELG120Religion in the Early U.S. This course is an introduction to the early religious history of the part of the Americans that became theUnited. The time periods covered in this class are the 17th, 18th & 19th centuries. Special attention is given to Native American displacement, thereligions of enslaved West Africans, and the organizational activities of Euro-Americans.RELG121Religion in the Modern U.S. This course is an introduction to the religious landscape of the United States from the latter part of the19th century through the contemporary period. Focus is placed on: the struggle of various Native American groups to keep their land and theirtraditions; Jim Crow and the Civil Rights fight; immigration; and the commodification of holidays and religious practices. U.S. Religious History I isNOT a prerequisite of this class.RELG122Religions of Latin America Using an array of primary and secondary materials, we will look into the myriad of dynamics that make upthe religious histories and narratives of Latin America. This course has been organized into seven loosely chronological themes, which will touch onvarious parts of the geographic region. These themes are: 1 - Pre-Columbian Religions; 2 - Encounter & Conquest; 3 - Slavery & Religion; 4 -Rebellion & Revolution; 5 - Progressive Catholicism; 6 - Protestant Challenges; and 7 - Continuous Diversity.RELG140Hindu Traditions This course is a basic introduction to the myriad of rituals, texts, practices, values and beliefs that make up HinduTraditions in South Asia and beyond. This class covers early Hindu history and the various textual traditions, focuses on practices and divine interactionsin the everyday lives of Hindus, and examines some of the historical and contemporary issues of conquest, integration, caste, migration and globalization.RELG150Buddhism in South Asia An examination of the historical development of the textual traditions, symbols, doctrines, myths, andcommunities of Buddhism throughout South Asia. Explores Buddhism's rise and decline in India and its development in Sri Lanka, Tibet, and otherSoutheast Asian countries through the modern period. This course uses primary sources as well as secondary, and students learn various ways to readtexts in conjunction with other types of sources that include inscriptions, art historical materials, and archeological sources.RELG160Hebrew Bible This course explores the writings of the Hebrew Bible (Christian Old Testament and Jewish Tanak), their relationship tothe history and culture in which they were produced, and their relevance to more recent issues in modern religious discourse. We cover a range oftopics, including divine encounters, worship practices, sacred space, political religion, archaeology, ethics, and gender. We apply several modernapproaches as well as survey at various points the "afterlife" of the Hebrew scriptural traditions in Judaism and Christianity. No prior knowledge of orexperience with the subject is assumed or required.RELG170Muhammad and the Qur'an In this course, we focus on the rise of Islam as a religious tradition. We ask the following questions: Whowas Muhammad? How did Islam come to emerge as a defined religious tradition? What traditions influenced the establishment of the early Muslimcommunity? What is the Qur'an? The final question asked in this course is how we should study Islam. This course examines pre-Islamic origins in theMiddle East through 692.RELG200Religion and Science This course is a historical and contemporary look into the relationships between religion and science. Beginningwith the development of science as an independent system of inquiry and also with the evolving and multiple definitions of religion, this class will tracethe contours, the moments of cooperation and the fault-lines of discourse between religion and science. This class seeks to cultivate nuanced and moresubtle understanding of religious and scientific viewpoints, and the ways in which they intersect.RELG201/-2019September 21, 2018RELG212Contemporary Biblical Studies Since the rise of the modern era in the 18th c., scholars have read the Bible as a historical text that canreveal something about ancient history. This method portrayed itself as an objective historical alternative to the theological readings informed by traditionand dogma. In the postmodern era, scholars have begun to read the Bible differently, revealing not only the political interests of so-called objectivehistory of the Bible, but also articulating new ways of readings these texts. This course examines a bit of the history of biblical studies, but paysparticular attention to feminist, queer, African American, and post-colonial biblical studies from recent decades. Prerequisite: RELG-110 RELG-111 orRELG-160RELG/SEMN213Christianity & the Family This course critically addresses contemporary debates about the centrality of the family in Christianteaching through a historical and cross-cultural survey. What is the relationship between Christianity and the various approaches to kinship and family indifferent cultures in different historical contexts? Where did our contemporary ideas about the family come from and what are Christians saying aboutnew forms of kinship? From the Bible to present day debates about divorce, sex, and same sex marriage, Christians have never embraced a singleunderstanding of the family, but rather have been influenced by broader cultural shifts in how kinship is done. This course is a Shared PassagesSophomore Seminar.Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlyRELG/HIST218American Jewish Experience This course will explore the religious, social, political, cultural, and economic history of the Jewishpeople in America from the first settlement until the present. The major themes of study will focus upon the development of Judaism in America. Wewill take into account a number of historical factors that shaped that development: the economic, social, and political evolution of American Jewry andits institutions; Jewish immigration to the United States and its consequences; American Jewish self-perception; and the relationship between Jews andnon-Jews in American society. Assignments will draw upon a wide range of materials, from secondary historical studies and primary documents tofiction and film.RELG220Catholicism in the Americas This class is a history of the diverse groups of people and practices that make up the various Catholiccommunities of the Americas. We will examine Catholic history, life, practices and beliefs through four sections: Colonialism, Saints & Syncretism;Immigration & Rebellion; Social Justice; and the Church in Crisis. Throughout this class, special attention will not only be given to the hierarchy, but tothe laity - how do Catholics live and how do they practice their devotion in their day-to-day lives. By taking an Americas approach we will be tappinginto a larger framework of Catholic history and seeing the ways in which Catholicism shaped the Americas in the past and is an important part ofAmerican life in the present.RELG221Black Religious Experiences in the Americas When enslaved people were forced over the Atlantic from West Africa to theAmericas, they did not arrive as blank slates. While the Middle Passage was horrific and tragic, humans are resilient, and during the darkest of times,divinity, rituals, practices and beliefs are not only questioned but also embraced. This class will look at which religious traditions were rejected andwhich were embraced among the enslaved of the Americas. In order to do this, we follow the journey of these slaves, from West Africa to theCaribbean and to the plantations and the urban centers of the Americas. We will also examine the religious, economic, social, political and liberativechanges that Black Americans experienced after the various independence movements in the Americas through to the contemporaryperiod.Prerequisite: Sophomore standing.RELG250Buddhism in East Asia An examination of the historical development of the textual traditions, symbols, doctrines, myths, andcommunities of Buddhism throughout East Asia. Explores the introduction and establishment of Buddhism in China, Korea, and Japan, and comparesthe different schools of Buddhism that developed in dialogue with Daoism and Shinto.RELG251Buddhas and Buddhist Philosophies This course begins with an examination of the biography of Gautama Buddha, the founder ofBuddhism. Focusing first on the traditions of Theravada Buddhism, we explore the construction of the Buddha's life story with attention to the Buddhaas a model for the attainment of nirvana. We turn next to the explosion of Buddhas in Mahayana Buddhism and to the fundamental categories of theteachings of the Buddha. Questions at the center of this course are: Why have the teachings changed over time and throughout the spread of Buddhismthroughout Asia? What remains "Buddhist" throughout the centuries? We examine these questions by examining the teachings of Theravada andMahayana Buddhism using primary sources.Prerequisite: One previous RELG course or Intstructor permission.RELG260/-2019September 21, 2018RELG270Islam in the Modern World This course examines the diversity of Islam throughout the world, keeping in mind that there are manydifferent faces of Islam. This course presumes some familiarity with the fundamentals of Islam -- Sunni and Shia -- as well as Sufi traditions, with anexamination of the Sufi mystical traditions and the roles of women. Finally, we examine the impact of colonialism on Islam in the Middle East as a wayto explore the historical and religious contexts of our understanding of Islam today.RELG/HIST/AFST274Islam in Africa This course explores the spread of Islam from the Arab peninsula to the African continent in the seventhcentury through the nineteenth century and limns the factors which facilitated this advance. It examines the methods and principles of Islam and howthe religion affected the life styles of its African neophytes and adherents. As a result of the interaction between Muslim and African civilizations, theadvance of Islam has profoundly influenced religious beliefs and practices of African societies, while local traditions have also influenced Islamicpractices. Muslims were important in the process of state-building and in the creation of commercial networks that brought together large parts of thecontinent. Muslim clerics served as registrars of state records and played a role in developing inner-state diplomacy inside Africa and beyond.RELG/HIST275/-2019September 21, 2018First-Year SeminarsFirst-Year Seminars constitute the gateway to the K-Plan and to college life for entering students and serve as the foundation of the Shared PassagesProgram. Offered in the fall quarter, these Seminars are designed to orient students to college-level learning practices, with particular emphasis oncritical thinking, writing, speaking, information literacy, and intercultural engagement.First-Year seminarsSEMN105FYS: Music and Freedom This course will interrogate the complex yet tantalizing relationship between music and freedom. What doesfreedom in music mean? Is liberation found in lyrics that express a challenge to oppression? Can transcendence be summoned from sound andimprovisation? Are artists emancipated when they follow their own voice at the expense of profit and even their own fans? Has freedom beenextinguished from music and replaced with a cheap illusion, as Theodor Adorno believed? On our search for answers, we'll talk about protest, politics,aesthetics, film, identity, spirituality, and other topics as we seek a richer, more critical understanding of the sounds and songs that allow us to feel free.SEMN106Reinvented: Urban Space, Capitalism, Art The historical processes of urbanization and industrialization forever altered modernity'scityscapes; however, the effects of capitalism-consumerism, leisure time, publicness, and spectacle-also worked to reshape experiences of everydaylife. This course examines the relationship between urban space, capital, social relations, and works of art that try to negotiate these rapidly changingsites of modernity. Taking late-nineteenth-century Paris as our case study, we ask questions about how Impressionist artists attempted to "picture" theanonymity and ennui of modern boulevard life-its rapidity and relentless newness-and how their radical pictorial vocabularies mediated the uncertaingender, sex, and class relations in Paris, "the capital of the nineteenth century." As we consider works of art that challenge capitalism and its bourgeoismorality, we will study paintings by Manet, Degas, Cassatt, Caillebotte, Monet, and Lautrec, among others and ask difficult questions about theimbalances of power in modernity's urban playground. Along the way, we will reflect on how representations of urban life and space itself can becomesites of living memory. Finally, the course will ask students to rethink their own spatial and social experiences in urban geographies under late capitalismand urban renewal. How do we re-member and attempt to "fix" or "picture" the fluctuations of our everyday lives in digital representations and socialmedia?SEMN107Fys: Memories, Secrets and Lies Why do people write about themselves? Why do we love to read "confessions"? Who gets to publishtheir life story and why? We take it for granted today that people love to talk about themselves, but our very concept of the "self" has changedthroughout history - as well as the possibilities for narrating one's life story. This course explores major issues and methods in the field of autobiographythrough a survey of first-person texts. We will investigate issues of identity, subjectivity, memory, and representation, and the problem of "truth" and"authenticity" in autobiographical writing. Readings span a wide range of life writing, including classical autobiographies, war memoirs, a graphic novel,and diaries. The authors of these texts include well-known artists and writers, as well as "ordinary" people who write to explore, manage, and representthemselves. Using these texts, we will analyze how literature reflects both the individual and her/his society. The course also includes a visit toKalamazoo College Archives and the Kalamazoo Valley Museum.SEMN108FYS: Plato to Playdoh: Great Math Ideas The ancient Greeks established some of the foundations of mathematics. In particular, theircontributions to the field of geometry are quite well-known - who hasn't heard of the Pythagorean Theorem?! But mathematics didn't stop evolving then(and no, it hasn't stopped evolving yet!). It is a dynamic subject and the great ideas of geometry morphed into a branch of mathematics called topology.Enter playdoh. While protractors and compasses may be the tools of geometry, playdoh is a more appropriate tool for studying topology. Of course,there have been many fascinating developments in mathematics since the ancient Greeks, and we'll be exploring several of them with an eye towardsestablishing some of the themes that make mathematics universal. In addition to talking about math, we'll be doing math. You don't have to be good atthe subject to take this course, but you should like it. Having had some math in high school, including algebra and pre-calculus, would be desirable.SEMN109FYS: Imagining the American West With its iconic landscape, wagon trains, buffalo, gunslingers, tepees, and saloons - the idea of theAmerican West looms large in our cultural memory and the country's identity. This seminar explores the myths and legends of the West in comparisonto the historical record. Emphasis is given to popular culture narratives, including Dime novels, paintings, photographs, films, and oral traditions. Whileexploring the topics of racism, migration, the role of women, religion, spirituality, and technology, we discover how these narratives became the storieswe tell.SEMN110FYS: What's the Universe All About? Is the universe infinite? Is there life elsewhere in the universe? How did the universe begin?How did our moon form? When will our Sun die out? In this course you will write and talk about our current understanding and lack of understanding ofthe biggest questions about the universe and the things in it such as galaxies, stars, black holes and our own solar system. The focus will be on what weknow and how we know it, and on how to communicate this information to a variety of different audiences such as children, people with no scientificbackground, people from different cultures, and your fellow students. We will also explore to what degree culture informs what questions we ask andhow we think about them.SEMN111FYS: Small Stuff, Big Questions Temple foundations, charred seeds, buried gold, bog bodies: archaeologists use the physical remains ofancient worlds and ancient peoples as a window into ancient cultures, ancient societies, and ancient minds. But how are people reflected in theirmaterial worlds? Can examining 'stuff' help us understand actual people - and what kind of questions can we ask of 'stuff' - ancient and modern - andwhat sorts of answers will it give us about ancient people (and ourselves)? In this seminar, we will try out different archaeological and anthropologicalmethods to see how we can use material evidence - "stuff" - to help us think up, ask and answer the Big Questions we have about identity, culture,patterns of thought and patterns of behavior in human history. Using case studies from the Roman world and from our own physical and digitalenvironments, we examine how everything from the layout of our streets to the images we choose to 'put up' (digitally or physically), from the contentsof our sewers to the remains of human bodies themselves, can tell us a story about ancient and modern society and ancient and modern 'selves.' Eachweek, we'll look at the self and cultural identity through a slightly different lens, and we'll examine how different approaches to culture and materialculture can open up new ways of understanding both ancient and modern identity.SEMN112FYS: Make It Stick: How Learning Works How do people learn? Perhaps more importantly, how do you learn? The fact that you arenow a K student indicates that you are able to learn and retain (at least for some time) a vast amount of information. But are you learning in the mostefficient way? Are you able to remember what you learn for a long time? Are you able to transfer your learning to new situations? Are there ways toidentify principles that guide such deep learning? If so, can we use these principles to become "better" learners? In our search for answers to all thesequestions we will study different theories of learning, the brain, instructional design, and how other cultures teach and learn. The course will useactivities, experiments, discussions, and personal reflections to explore these issues, with the ultimate goal for you to become a more "effective" learner(and hence a more successful K student).KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018SEMN113FYS: Don Quixote as 'Player One' What did virtual reality look like before modern technology? What makes a virtual world feel just as'real' - or more real - than real life? Cervantes' masterpiece, Don Quixote, is considered by many to be the first truly modern novel, but its historical andcultural context (Seventeenth-Century Spain) can seem very distant indeed. In this course, students will use contemporary theories from video gamestudies in order to explore this work with fresh eyes. Concepts like epic space, flow, medievalism, migration, virtual economies and simulation will allowus to connect with this iconic literary figure. This course is perfect for those students interested in literature, Medieval and Early Modern history or theappeal of video games today. Familiarity with Spanish is not required.SEMN114FYS: History & Future of Doing Nothing What does nothing mean? What does one do when one is doing nothing? How can we makesense of a word or category (no-thing) that in itself is a denial of thing-ness? Does nothing look different through different cultural lenses? And whatcould humans learn from thinking about nothing? This seminar will explore different views on the subject of nothingness as it has been imagined anddiscussed by artists, social theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers. We will discuss the content of nothing as a category and consider what or whocan be contained within, or excluded from it. Together, we will engage with the theory and practice of nothing in order to detect what its expressions,tensions, and contradictions might be, as well as what counts as a thing or as nothing.SEMN118FYS: There and Back Again Humans have been writing about journeys and returns for nearly as long as we have been writing downour own stories. Though such tales are found in nearly every time period and culture, it's curious the way that many deal with similar kinds of questions:Why do we think about leaving home as an adventure? Why do we often romanticize "home"? Why is coming back home sometimes so hard? We'llbegin our own journey by reading Homer's Odyssey, using it as a model for our exploration of these questions. Through a series of readings, films andsongs (and conversations with modern-day heroes) we'll work to understand why tales of homecoming have such resonance and why we keep tellingthem.SEMN119FYS: Holy War In a world where conflict seems apocalyptic and struggles between religious groups over contested territory appearconstant, the only hope is to travel through time. This course examines the crusading and jihadist movements of the middle ages so that students canbetter understand how religious change and social anxiety culminated in massive and complicated movements to contest territories of major culturalsignificance. The first half of the course will survey the history of the crusade and jihadist movements of the long twelfth century (c.1050-1250),culminating in an independent research project. The second half of the course utilizes a (prototype) student-driven role-playing exercise to engage withthe lived realities of crusaders at a pivotal period in the history of crusading.SEMN121FYS: Unraveling DNA Despite being discovered nearly six decades ago, DNA research continues to have profound impacts on all ofour lives and promises to become even more important in the future. We will examine the history of DNA and attempt to answer the followingquestions: How was DNA discovered? Who deserves credit for the discovery? What tools were needed? What information is stored in DNA? What isDNA fingerprinting? How should it be used? How can we use DNA to explore ancestry, especially for groups with no other means to do so? Do yourgenes determine who you'll become? What is genetic testing? How do we handle unintended consequences such as sex determination of embryos oremployment discrimination based on your genes? We will begin by retracing the events that lead to the publication of the seminal paper "A Structure forDeoxyribose Nucleic Acid" by Watson and Crick. We will learn about the roles that Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, James Watson, Francis Crickand Linus Pauling played in the discovery of the structure of DNA and the complex story surrounding it through reading their biographies and publicinterviews. We will examine how gender affects our perception of science and scientists. We will also learn about the tools used to discover DNA, andwhat modern approaches are used today. Warning we will discuss several deeply sensitive topics in this course, including sex selection and geneticdisorders.SEMN122FYS: Environmental (In)justice In this course we will explore the intersection between environmental and social justice. We haveentered a new geological era - the Anthropocene - marked by unprecedented impacts of the burgeoning human population on the Earth's physical andbiological systems. At the same time, global inequality has deepened: most of the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small fraction of itspeople. Communities have unequal access to environmental benefits (clean air, water, greenspace), and different exposure to environmental harms(toxic waste dumps, air pollution, fossil fuel extractive industries). Recent examples in the news include the Keystone XL pipeline being routed throughNative American lands without their permission, and the Flint, MI, water crisis that disproportionately affected poor, black residents of that city whenlead leached into drinking water. Our study of environmental "haves and have nots" will not be limited to the United States; we will explore a diversearray of writers and genres - novels, poetry, essays, memoirs - that focus on themes of environmental justice and equity in the U.S. and around theworld.SEMN123FYS: Theater and the Other This course uses works by playwrights from around the world to study issues of race, gender, sexualorientation, social class, and intercultural communication, with a particular emphasis on the voices of the subaltern, those who have been silenced by thepower structures they lived (or live) in. We will read works from Amiri Baraka, Luis Valdez, Tony Kushner, Caryl Churchill, and Lucienne GuedesFahrer, among others. While reading these plays, we will discuss ways in which theatre can help bring voices to the voiceless but also talk about how toovercome obstacles we face in the theatre creation process that inhibit our voices and those of others we try to represent.SEMN124FYS: Journeys to the West Why do people all over the world embark on journeys? What does it mean to be on a journey? Where doesa journey begin and where or how does it end? And how do we overcome the obstacles we encounter when we go on a journey, and what do we learnabout ourselves and the world through the process of overcoming those obstacles? These are some of the questions we will explore in this coursethrough a focus on Monkey's adventures in the great Chinese novel, Journey to the West. The story of Monkey, based on the monk Xuanzang'shistorical journey to India in search of Buddhist scriptures, enjoyed widespread popularity in premodern East Asia and has continued to fascinatereaders worldwide down to the present day. Together we will investigate multiple layers of meaning in Monkey's tale. We will do this by relating itsmessage about personal transformation to its religious, literary, and cultural contexts in China's past, as well as to our experiences in the present.Additionally, we will examine a diverse range of creative forms inspired by Journey to the West, including its classical Chinese fantasy "sequel," themodern Chinese animation Havoc in Heaven, Jeffrey Lau's A Chinese Odyssey film adaptations, Gene Luen Yang's graphic novel American BornChinese, and more. These various approaches to Monkey's story attest not only to its deep cultural significance in China and East Asia, but also to theways in which it can have significance for different people of all different cultural backgrounds. All readings will be in English. No previous knowledgeof Chinese language is necessary.SEMN125FYS: Telling Queer Stories This course analyzes the history of various queer social movements and the stories that people haveconstructed about them. More specifically, the class interrogates a number of queer movements that have taken shape in the last fifty years, andcompares how documentary filmmakers and literary authors have sought to represent these struggles for justice and greater equality. The course beginsby looking at the rebellions at the Stonewall Inn and Compton's Cafeteria in the 1960s, and looks at how these uprisings paved the path for the modernLGBT movement in the United States. We will then move on to the queer activism that arose in response AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s and thenlook at the same-sex marriage movement of the early twenty-first century, asking how the radicalism of the former transformed into the assimilationistpolitics of the latter. Finally, we will end with the emphatically intersectional approach undertaken by Black Lives Matter movement and its queer-identified founders. Throughout our course discussion and across several writing assignments, we will use these movements and the various texts thathave narratively represented them to learn about the history of queer people and to envision our own roles in making a more just future.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018SEMN133FYS: Drama Usa: Against the Current This course uses works by American playwrights to study issues of race, gender, sexualorientation, and social class in American society, with particular attention to dramatic authors who have sometimes struggled "against the current" tomake their voices heard in the mainstream values of the dominant culture. We will read works from among Diane Glancy, David Henry Hwang, MoisésKaufman, Cherrie Moraga, Marsha Norman, Clifford Odets, Luis Valdez, and August Wilson. Along the way we will discuss such trends in theAmerican Theatre as realism and political theatre, including feminist theatre, African-American theatre, Hispanic theatre, Asian-American theatre,Native American theatre, and gay/lesbian theatre.SEMN135FYS: Cultivating Community Novelist and environmentalist Wendell Berry has written, "A significant part of the pleasure of eating is inone's accurate consciousness of the lives and the world from which food comes. . . . Eating with the fullest pleasure-pleasure, that is, that does notdepend on ignorance-is perhaps the profoundest enactment of our connection with the world." And yet, in today's world of fast, processed food, manyof us have lost of our connection to where our food comes from. Is it possible to rebuild relationships between those who grow and harvest food andthose who eat it and gain an accurate consciousness of the connection between plate and planet, cuisine and culture? In this seminar, we will learnabout the industrial food system and explore the ways that people today are developing alternatives that use food as an instrument of social justice and away to build strong communities. We'll read Michael Pollan's influential exposé The Omnivore's Dilemma as our starting point in our exploration of foodjustice, but we will study this issue from a variety of perspectives. We will talk with local farmers, community organizers, farm workers' advocates,entrepreneurs, and anti-hunger activists and get to know the Kalamazoo community by experiencing its harvest. We will also engage in a service-learning project that will work to provide information about and access to just, local, and sustainable food for everyone in our community. Academicservice-learning combines classroom study with real world experience, allowing students to apply what they are learning to everyday life in a way thataddresses community-identified needs.SEMN136FYS: Crossing Borders: Autism and Other Ways of Knowing For the past ten years, the diagnosis of and attention to autism hasgrown exponentially. More public awareness and debate, however, does not guarantee a more complex understanding. In this class, we will exploreautobiographies, essays, clinical studies, and films about or by those with autism or Asperger's in order to gain an informed understanding of this widely-diagnosed spectrum disorder. We will move outside the borders of the class to see students within AI (autistic-impaired) classrooms and participate inservice-learning work in the Kalamazoo community. For this work, groups of students will be matched and spend time with a person on the spectrumand his or her family. In an effort to understand this way of knowing, we will consider how expectations about communication and social relationships"impair" and/or enhance an ability to live in a "neurodiverse" world. If you have a reason for wishing to take this seminar (i.e., if you have a sibling withautism, worked with or befriended someone on the spectrum, etc.), please contact Bruce Mills at bmills@kzoo.edu as soon as possible. Though it willnot guarantee a place in the class, this contact will enable us to consider specific interests or circumstances more closely. Academic service-learningcombines classroom study with real world experience, allowing students to apply what they are learning to everyday life in a way that addressescommunity-identified needs.SEMN137FYS: Co-Authoring Your Life: Writing Your Self in the Context of Others The autonomous, self-made individual is a powerfulAmerican myth. But no person is entirely self-made; all of us are embedded in various families and communities and ideologies, and we also findourselves marked by cultural conditions such as our race, class, religion, gender and sexual orientation, all of which influence who we are in variousways. The clash between the desire for autonomy and the shaping power of these social conditions makes the process of coming up with an identityextremely difficult and complex. How can we maintain a sense of autonomy while acknowledging influences? How can we be ourselves while learningfrom others? How do we write our own lives when so many other hands seem to hold, or to want to hold, the pen with us? Through novels, stories,autobiographies, essays and films, this course will explore different situations in which people struggle to form identities under intense "co-authoring"pressures. You will write analytical essays about the texts of others and personal essays about yourself.SEMN139FYS: Our Shakespeares, Ourselves Cultures often retell stories from the past as a way of thinking through the present: perhapsbecause using already existing material makes it easier to explore difficult issues, perhaps because we feel the need to "talk back" to the writers whohave so deeply inflected our culture. In this course, we'll be focusing on how modern cultures have reworked Shakespeare's plays into a 1950's sci-fifilm, an MTV inspired movie, Afro-Caribbean drama, rock and rap music, and a Julia Stiles movie set in the Deep South. In exploring how Shakespearehas been adapted to these radically different contexts, we'll also be exploring the difficult issues these adaptations focus on--race, gender, sexuality,colonialism and class. What a culture does with Shakespeare's plays can tell you a lot about that culture; so we'll be asking a number of questions: Whyis Shakespeare so popular in the United States today? What does he mean to us? What are we doing with his plays and why? What do our adaptationsof his work tell us about our own views about racism or sexism in America, for example?SEMN140FYS: Religion & Empire This course explores the role of religion in the expansion of political regimes such as the British Empire of the17th through 20th centuries and the contemporary United States. We also examine the shifts that religions undergo as political regimes shift, as we sawthe crystallization of Muslim and Hindu identities during the period of partition in India during the 1940s. Finally, we look closely at the ways in whichpolitical reformers have utilized religion as a resource to catalyze political resistance to empires, primarily in the work of Mahatma Gandhi. Authors weread include Arundhati Roy, Bapsi Sidwa, and Amitav Ghosh.SEMN141FYS: One in Three Diagnosis and treatment of cancer provides an unintended journey for one in three individuals in developedcountries. While cancer is not a modern disease, cases of cancer have risen in modern times. Is that due to environmental changes or populationchanges? How can we know? What is cancer and what have we known about it in history? What is the psychological and financial impact of cancer?How does this differ in various parts of the world? How is cancer used as an analogy in literature, film, and speech? Through reading and analysis ofshort reviews, newspaper articles, books, and book chapters this course will examine different aspects of cancer as a disease, modern affliction, andpersonal or political cause. Other readings will explore the experiences of cancer survivors in biographies and autobiographies. Students will alsointerview a local cancer survivor and prepare a mini-biography.SEMN144FYS: Truth, Lies & Politics Are truth and politics friends or foes? Does your answer differ depending on the kind of truth in question?In political matters, is it always wrong to lie? Political thinkers have been asking such questions for millennia, but in an era of echo chambers, "fakenews," and conflicting accounts of what's true, they have presented themselves with renewed urgency. In this course, we will examine the relationshipbetween truth and politics within the political theory tradition as well as in the contemporary context. We will focus in particular on strategies fornavigating the bewildering terrain of our so-called "post-fact" context, in which it seems as though politics has become a contest over reality itself.SEMN145FYS: Creativity The psychology of creativity is as complex and mysterious as it is intriguing. Whether brushing paint on a canvas,composing a poem or piece of music, launching a new advertising campaign, or making a breakthrough at the frontiers of science, some form ofcreative thinking is involved. In this seminar, we examine how creativity is expressed in domains such as art, music, film, literature, science, business,and invention-with a special focus on the topic of film music. Classic and contemporary theories and research findings will provide the materials fordiscussions, essays, and projects. Students will also apply imagination and creative problem-solving skills to a variety of puzzles and exercises. Thisseminar will challenge your basic assumptions about the nature of creativity, and expand your horizons to encompass the richness and diversity ofcreative expression in its many forms.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018SEMN146FYS: Africa and Globalization Globalization is viewed differently by scholars and policy practitioners. Humanists and Social Scientistsagree that globalization is the precipitous movement of people, goods, free market and capital flows among countries. Sub-Saharan Africa's experiencewith globalization started in the 13th century. Since the 1990s, diasporan Africans have largely influenced public policy through tools of globalization.What is the direct impact of this phenomenon on Africa's economic development? What is the effect of globalization on the socio-cultural lives ofAfricans in the 21st century? This course addresses these questions and seeks to explore the influence of tools of globalization, such as communicationequipment, automobile, computer services, transnational corporations (TNCs), among others in African societies. We will use primary and secondarysources, such as newspaper articles, government records, UN reports, journal articles and scholarly monographs to probe the above questions.SEMN152FYS: Roots in the Earth Even in the most densely populated cities, we are connected to nature. As essayist John Burroughs wrote,"We are rooted to the air through our lungs and to the soil through our stomachs." In this seminar we'll examine our relationship with the natural world.What belief systems have influenced human interactions with nature throughout history and across cultures? Is our current relationship to nature servingus as individuals and as members of a global community or could we envision new relationships that might be both more sustainable and moresatisfying? We'll grapple with how the answers to these questions affect our responses to environmental problems such as climate change, pollution, anddwindling biodiversity. Readings include Bill McKibben's American Earth: Environmental Writing Since Thoreau and Robin Wall Kimmerer's BraidingSweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants. This course will ask students to reflect on their own experienceswith nature as they engage in a service learning project in collaboration with Kalamazoo College's Lillian Anderson Arboretum.SEMN154FYS: Who Are the Samurai? On a dark, chilly night in the city of Edo, Japan in 1703, 46 men broke into the home of a governmentofficial and murdered him. The story of these men, best known as the 47 ronin (and yes, you read the number correctly), has been retold countlesstimes since that night. Outlaws to some and heroes to many, the 47 ronin have often been lauded as exemplars of true samurai. But what exactly is a"true samurai"? When you think of the samurai, what do you imagine? Is the image you have in mind the product of fact or fiction, or perhaps a little ofboth? Did you know, for instance, that the samurai included both women and children? Since most people are not familiar with the history of Japan'sfamous warriors, in this seminar we will begin by drawing from a variety of sources to explore how this warrior class-men, women, and children-lived,and how they have been viewed both within and outside Japan. We will combine our historical examinations of the emergence, evolution, demise, andreinvention of the samurai with analyses of representations of "samurai" in literature, film, sports, and business in order to gain a better sense of who thesamurai are, how they have been portrayed, and why the samurai-and especially the 47 ronin -have become such an enduring and popular symbol ofJapan.SEMN155FYS: The New World Order The seminar will study recent analyses of the New World Order in the context of theories of"globalization," focusing on causes of social strife and debates about what makes for a just society. It will examine the culture of the investment bankerswho are the New Order's main architects, the ideology of "neoliberalism" that is its blueprint, the fate of American workers whose jobs aredisappearing, and the New World as lived by some of the two billion people in shantytowns, bidonvilles, and favelas. Students will write brief review-style essays and a case study of a city or region.SEMN156FYS: Almost Human We will explore what it means to be human, by first looking at fictional accounts of those that are "almost human,"namely--robots. Karel Capek, considered to be the greatest Czech author of the first half of the twentieth century, was the first to use the word "robot,"which appears in the title of his play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots). Capek explores a host of philosophical and social issues in this play and hisshort stories and essays. Fast forward to the 1960's, and we have Philip Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, which explores similarissues. This story is the basis for the 1982 movie Blade Runner. Today, robots are fast becoming more common, and a host of contemporary moviesexplore the relationships between humans and `artificial' life. Other readings will discuss a variety of relevant philosophical issues, the cognitivedifferences between humans and other animals, and the role of culture. Our goal is to explore the essence of being human. Is it love, empathy, free will,emotion, consciousness, intelligence, or something else? Or maybe there is no essence!SEMN158FYS-Humans and Other Animals This course will look at just a few of the many facets of animal-human interaction. Many societieshave long assumed and enforced the singularity of the human being, placing our species in a position of superiority, and all others at our disposal.However the uniqueness of humans is an idea that has long existed intension with phenomena and discourses that complicate and enrich ourcoexistence with other animal species. The course will include historical and literary perspectives with which students would already have somefamiliarity. The class will also look at modernization and industrialization to focus on problems and challenges (habitat "management," factory farmingand fisheries, and research test subjects). The last section will consider how animal-human interactions are proposing new disciplinary intersections: thelimits of consciousness and cognition in animals and humans; interspecies communication; new moral debates on the treatment of other animals; andnew spaces for co-operation.SEMN159FYS: History Repeats This course will explore the recent resurgence of the 19th century in novelistic adaptations and fictionalizedbiographies of the 21st century. Crucial to this course will be an understanding of major literary texts and authors of the 19th century, which will allowfor an investigation as to why the 19th century serves as a vital literary inspiration for the 21st century, specifically how these textual re-imaginingsmight provide a particular insight into the contemporary national moment. Why does the 19th century continue to persist? What fuels this return to thepast? Is this resurgence merely a nostalgic literary trend, or does it reveal a larger significance, both for American literature as a field of study, as wellas for an American nation-space we presume to be so markedly different from that of the 19th century. This course begins with "The EmancipationProclamation," one of the formative historical texts that shaped and defined the U.S., and will be read in tandem with Seth Grahame-Smith's AbrahamLincoln, Vampire Hunter. In many ways, these texts introduce the main thematic trajectory for this course: the Civil War and slavery. As such, we willalso read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain's satire of antebellum southern society which focuses on Huck's journey to "free" a slave, andJon Clinch's Finn, told from the perspective of Huck's father, Pap. Likewise, Louisa May Alcott's Little Women finds the March women at home,waiting for their patriarch, Mr. March, to return from his role in aiding the Union's war efforts; while that novel only presents letters about Mr. March'sactivities, Geraldine Brooks's March presents Mr. March's story, those never relayed in his letters home. In addition to reading these novels, we willalso investigate the socio-political underpinnings of race and "freedom" in the 21st century, specifically how the social and political spectrum of bothterms function in the contemporary U.S.SEMN160FYS: Visions of the End Plague and hellfire; crumbling cities and avenging angels; a heavenly kingdom, golden and eternal-theseapocalyptic images are among the most stirring moments in the Bible. They have inspired countless works of art with their devastating portrayal of theworld's end. They have also maintained a constant, pervasive influence on theology, philosophy, political theory, and popular culture. In this seminar, wewill carefully read the biblical apocalypses and consider how these foundational texts have been interpreted by Jewish and Christian theologians overthe years. We will then explore a range of literary works such as Spenser's Faerie Queene and the Poetic Edda which deliberately mimic the style ofthe biblical apocalypse. And finally we will turn to some contemporary "post-apocalyptic" works such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and CormacMcCarthy's The Road in order to reflect on how current events and anxieties have radically transformed our modern visions of the end.SEMN164FYS: Building Kalamazoo The city of Kalamazoo serves as the textbook for this seminar, as we survey the built environment of the20th century via the architecture of this post-industrial Midwest city. Beginning with turn-of-the-century Victorian-era homes and ending withKalamazoo College's dramatic new building, the Studio Gang-designed Arcus Center for Social Justice Leadership, Building Kalamazoo surveys thisdynamic period through site visits, primary readings, and individual research. Throughout, the seminar will seek to understand how site and space haveshaped diverse experiences of a rapidly changing modern world.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018SEMN165FYS: Stalin & the Art of Fear From the 1920s until his death in 1953, Joseph Stalin wielded an extraordinary amount of control over thenewly-created Soviet state. He interpreted the proper implementation of Socialist economic policy, he silenced his critics with unimaginable savagery,and he took an especially keen interest in dictating the terms by which art should be made. To whom does art belong? What was it like to create art inan atmosphere of censorship? Could artists -- like poet Anna Akhmatova or composer Dmitri Shostakovich, for example -- navigate these treacherouswaters without sacrificing their creativity and artistic integrity? We will examine these and related questions through reading memoir, fiction, andhistorical accounts of the time; watching films; and closely listening to the music that spoke to and reflected this tumultuous time.SEMN167FYS: The Immigration Debate People often say they are either for or against greater levels of immigration. But immigration is a broadconcept. In simply saying "yay" or "nay" we neglect to address a lot of important, nuanced questions. This course examines some of these questions.What is the difference between a regular immigrant and an asylum seeker or refugee? Do we owe different kinds of treatment to individuals in thesecategories? What happens when someone is attempting to immigrate but is stopped en route (e.g. in international waters)? How do concerns of"internal" equality and the preservation of culture impact immigration? Is it permissible for wealthy countries to actively encourage doctors and nursesfrom poor countries to immigrate--even though this will lead to a shortfall of skilled healthcare workers in poorer countries, thereby intensifying basichealth issues? What tensions are created by the conflict between social and global justice as applied to immigration? We will investigate these questionsand many more through readings in political philosophy, documentaries and short films (all documentaries and short films will be screened outside ofclass).SEMN168FYS: Salem Possessed: the Salem Witch Trials and Their Legacies In 1692, the people of Salem, Massachusetts grew terrifiedwhen a small group of girls accused an enslaved woman, an impoverished woman, and a scandalous woman of bewitching them. Ultimately, twentymen and women were hung or pressed to death with stones and over a hundred others found themselves imprisoned. Historians have long consideredthe Salem Witch Trials a pivotal moment in American history. Countless works have offered countless reasons for the strange happenings in Salem,trying to explain why a small community in Colonial America would succumb to witchcraft hysteria long after it had died down in Europe. The SalemWitch Trials have haunted American culture. Starting in the nineteenth century and continuing into the present, writers and artists have grappled withthe various meanings of the witch hunts and the persecution of innocent persons, seeing connections between "the furies of fanaticism and paranoia" of1692 and their own time. Most famously, Arthur Miller in The Crucible used the trials to examine the persecution of alleged Communists in the 1950s.This course will examine and seek to understand the events of 1692 and the subsequent legacies of the trials in American culture through the actualdocuments from the trials, the writings of historians, and the imaginative works of novelists, playwrights, poets, and film makers.SEMN171FYS: Social Bee-ings Honeybees and humans are supremely social. But what does it mean to be social? Why are some species socialwhile others are solitary? Do social group members work for the common good or to fulfill selfish interests? Perhaps they can do both, but whathappens when these goals conflict - how is social order maintained? We will explore the origins and maintenance of social living across the animalkingdom and ask to what extent human societies represent larger scale models of other animal societies -- insects and non-human primates in particular-- and to what extent humans are unique. We will explore the political, economic, biological, cultural, sociological and philosophical elements of social lifethrough a variety of media and genres. In doing so, we will inevitably explore the human condition.SEMN172FYS: Life with Two Languages Almost half of the world's population uses two or more languages as they go about their daily lives. Inthis seminar, we will explore what it means to be a bilingual or multilingual person - how this effects our ways of communicating and our perspective onthe world. We will also investigate how different societies organize life with two or more languages. Topics include: code-switching, language attrition,language & identity, bilingual children, bilingual education, super-bilinguals, bilingualism & politics, the "English-only movement" in the USA, and minoritylanguages in the USA. Yookoso -Bienvenido- Bienvenue- Hwan-yung-hahm-ni-da - Chào m?ng This course is designed for students from a multilingualhousehold or community or those whose primary residence is outside of the United States.SEMN173FYS: Migration, Community, & Self Going to college and immigrating to a new country have much in common. Moving to a new placepresents many challenges. The immigrant (or first-year student) can experience loneliness and displacement, a yearning for home, and bewilderment athis/her new surroundings. Yet, a new environment also offers opportunities for personal growth that force immigrants to reconcile "Old" with "New."Through reading, writing, and discussion, students will seek to relate their own "migration" to Kalamazoo College to the experiences of European Jewsmoving to the United States. Along the way, the class will explore many of the universal questions raised by relocation. What motivates people to pickup their lives and move to a new place, and what happens to them when they arrive? How does the migration experience shape their view of the worldthey left behind and their view of their new environment? How do immigrants construct communities for themselves? Do women and men experiencemigration in similar or different ways? Finally, how does moving to a new place shape one's sense of self? We will explore these questions usinghistorical and cultural sources, fiction, and film.SEMN176FYS: Managing Across Cultures Suppose you have an opportunity to live and work (study) in a foreign culture, what will you need toknow in order to get along and be effective? How will the locals think and act? How will you feel and react? How will you resolve a conflict, ornegotiate a favorable outcome? What will you do if you need to give a presentation? What if you had a leadership role, how will you motivate yourteam? How will you manage team members that are different from you? Will you one day be an effective global citizen and, perhaps, a globalmanager? This seminar explores your assumptions about the best way to think and behave as we learn about ourselves and about others from differentbackgrounds. A good choice for anyone who has an interest in living and working abroad.SEMN181FYS: The Paradox of Human Desire: Philosophy and Psychoanalysis In this course, we examine how 20th-century critics challengeand reject the traditional rationalist Enlightenment ideal of human reason. Traditional "Enlightenment" or rationalist models of subjectivity assume that aperson is conscious of feelings and desires, rational in planning and executing actions, and responsible for explaining and justifying one's conduct - bothto oneself and to others. In short, rationalists uphold the Enlightenment ideal of knowing ourselves, acting autonomously, and controlling our own lives -in a word, of mastering our fate. Against this view, critics - philosophers and psychoanalyists - demonstrate the fragmented, unconscious, wild, strange,and often chaotic nature of human desire, action, and self-understanding. The so-called "dark thinkers of Enlightenment" unmask the ideal of rationalagency as a comic pretense, na&iuml;ve illusion, or, worse still, deranged delusion. In the first part of the course, we examine a sophisticated account ofrational agency as the activity of locating oneself in history, the history of one's own ability to learn about oneself, others, and the world we share. Suchautobiographical narration would be, at once, the history of reason and reason of history, the rationality of freedom and freedom of rationality. In ourfirst reading - Time, Narrative, and History - we familiarize ourselves with Hegel's argument that the history of human reason is the history of freedom,a freedom that can only be secured and exercised by agents socialized to recognize and respect others. In subsequent readings, we explore FriedrichNietzsche's and Sigmund Freud's critique of this rational model of agency by examining their views on the paradoxical nature of desire, time, action, andembodiment. More specifically, we will examine how subsequent figures such as Jacques Lacan and Maurice Merleau-Ponty have identified fourfamous paradoxes of human life: the paradox that we understand something only when it's over (time); the paradox that we first know our priorintentions only through our subsequent deeds (action); the paradox that our desires are the source of our worst nightmares (desire); and, finally, theparadox that what is closest and most familiar to us, our bodies, is often what is most distant, alien, and perplexing (body). Movies such as Memento;Apocalypse Now; la Femme Nikita; Sex, Lies, and Videotapes; and The Pervert's Guide to Cinema will be shown.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018SEMN184Fys: Slang A Discussion of Informal English Slang is the ever-changing use of informal language that is reflective of culture andsociety. Though slang is most common in spoken language, modern dictionaries have long embraced slang and recorded its usage. Notable examplesinclude the Oxford English Dictionary new entries of 'vape,' 'selfie,' and 'GIF.' In this class, we will discuss, research, and write about the informal useof slang and its role in social interactions as well as what slang represents in the lives of English speakers. We will trace American slang from itsseparation from British English up until the current age and identify the purpose of slang in a community of speakers. An important distinction will bemade regarding the environment of informal and formal language and how English speakers navigate the cultural requirements of spoken and writtenlanguage in academic settings. Through readings, videos, discussion, and writing, we will explore the fun and function of slang. This course is designedfor students whose native language is not English.SEMN188FYS: Imagining Possible Worlds Is there a difference between science fiction and fantasy? When asked to explain the difference, thegreat American 20th-century sci-fi writer, Isaac Asimov, replied "science fiction, given its grounding in science, is possible; fantasy, which has nogrounding in reality, is not." But according to the famous 18th-century Scottish philosopher, David Hume, "nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible."So, we have a philosophical puzzle: on the one hand, it seems that fantasy stories set our minds on imaginative adventures, and the very fact that we canimagine such stories suggests that they are possible. But on the other hand, science fiction stories are set within the framework of science, whichprovides them with a foundation in reality that is missing in fantasy. Our main question, therefore, will be: are science fiction and fantasy equallypossible, or is there a sense in which science fiction is more possible than fantasy? The answer to this question has surprisingly far-reaching implicationsfor science, literature, and philosophy. To attempt to answer the question, we will explore contemporary science fiction and fantasy in the form of shortstories, films, and even games. We will read such notable writers as Margaret Atwood, Stephen King, Michael Chabon, Ursula K. Le Guin, T. C.Boyle, and Gregory Maguire. We will use these experiences as the foundation for our study of possibility, which will include thinking hard about manyimportant philosophical matters such as God, evil, freedom, knowledge, person identity, and zombies. That's right; I said zombies!SEMN189FYS: The Art of Revenge The desire for revenge is only human. But there is a risk that the actual performance of revenge will initiatea chain reaction of violent reprisals whose consequences will quickly prove fatal to social life itself. The revenger understandably wants to restore thenatural order of things, to right a wrong, but his or her desire threatens to work an even greater harm. This fundamental paradox helps to explain whyrevenge is so prominent in our collective, cultural imagination from the theatre of ancient Greece to the popular cinema of modern Hollywood. Thisseminar addresses the important and often vexing questions raised by tales of revenge: What is the difference between revenge and justice? Doesrevenge amount to a social responsibility or a slip into self-destructive narcissism? What role does revenge play in current moral and political dilemmassuch as ethnic nationalism, capital punishment, and terrorism? To explore these issues, we will study a variety of works including tragedies by Euripides(Medea) and Shakespeare (Titus Andronicus), a novel by Thomas Pynchon (The Crying of Lot 49), and films by Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven), QuentinTarantino (Inglourious Basterds), and others. Warning: This seminar obviously deals with violent subject matter. The films in particular may be toographic for some students.SEMN190FYS: Science and Society This course is designed for those who are curious about the natural world. We aim to engage and enhancethat curiosity by exploring science in the world around us. We will observe with wonder, thoughtfully hypothesize, methodically test, and conclude withdeeper knowledge and more questions. We will discover roles we can take to contribute to building scientific knowledge. We will work to understanddeveloping science. We will design and carry out experiments, read about scientific discovery, and join others on citizen-science projects. This course isintended for anyone who is excited about understanding the natural world, no science background is needed.SEMN191FYS: It's Only Rock and Roll Mick Jagger said the song "It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like it)" was a response to the pressure he andthe band felt to continually exceed their past accomplishments. Who could have imagined how rock and roll (and all of its children) would succeed,exceed and change the world? In this seminar we will explore some of the fascinating relationships between current events, social, cultural and politicaldevelopments, and rock music, as expressed through the music, lyrics, art, philosophy and fashion of rock and roll. Through generous listenings,viewings, readings, discussions, and writings, we will gain a well-rounded view of the history of rock music and a deeper appreciation for the complexand evolving part rock and roll and has played and continues to play in the social, cultural, political and, of course, musical evolution of our lives and theworld.SEMN193FYS Banned: Censorship & Art Politics Art is a ubiquitous part of our society, but how exactly do we define the word "art" and whatdo we expect from it? Some might say art is solely for aesthetic enjoyment and to make us feel good, but what happens when art becomes part of theculture wars? What social conditions drive controversy around art? This course will explore art's seemingly unparalleled ability to outrage and offend.We will discuss and dissect a wide variety of historical cases where art has been deemed dangerous and/or objectionable. Through a variety of readingsand discussions we will explore such topics as: Is censorship ever okay? What can controversies surrounding art tell us about those who are offended?And, what does being offended mean in a democratic society? In this course we will learn how to unpack the context of controversial art and self-examine our personal values and what it means to have those values challenged.SEMN195FYS: Bad Religion In this course, we explore communities and practices that have been considered "loud," "superstitious," "weird,""unorthodox," and purportedly "satanic." To outsiders, bad religion is religion that seems to straddle the lines of magic and witchcraft, and religion thatdoes not stay in its sphere but seems to embroil itself in public space, business, and politics. This class does not argue that there is such a thing as "badreligion" but explores contestations over what constitutes "appropriate" religious practice, community, authority, and belief in 20th century andcontemporary America. We will explore groups from Scientologists, the Peoples Temple (known for the Jonestown suicides) to apocalyptic Catholics,Latinx devotions and Afro-Caribbean religions-groups that have drawn the ire of neighbors, established churches, media, and governmental authorities.We will explore how understandings of immigration, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality structured these communities and shaped the controversiesthat surrounded them. We will interrogate the construction of religious norms and ideas of "acceptable" religious practice across different moments inAmerican history. Students will critically analyze primary sources and media representations-from crime television shows to documentaries-to explorehow media and pop culture are operative in constructing the religious mainstream and margin in America.SEMN196FYS: Memories, Secrets & Lies Why do we love to read "confessions," watch makeover shows, read blogs, and take selfies? How dowe shape the stories we tell about ourselves, and the image of self we present to the world? Is there such a thing as a "true" or "authentic" self? In thisseminar you will work with memoirs, letters, a TV series, a graphic novel, diaries, and scrapbooks to explore how individuals present themselves andhow they tell their life stories. We start with the genre of confessions, looking at how writers draw in their audiences by claiming to tell secrets, and"nothing but the truth." We will discuss memory, its failures, and the ways we retrieve "lost time" in narrative. Other topics include performance andidentity, censorship and autobiographical scandals surrounding authors who "broke the rules" of memoir. One week we visit the Kalamazoo CollegeArchives and work with diaries, letters, and scrapbooks from college students 100 years ago-examining how their experiences may parallel or differfrom your own. We will also visit the Kalamazoo Institute of Art to view works of self-portraiture.SEMN197FYS: Byzantium The Real Game of Thrones The Roman Empire never fell--it just turned Greek. Istanbul used to be Constantinople.It's completely normal to cut out your brother's tongue to keep him from becoming Emperor instead of you. A world of assassinations, tax fraud, andadultery existed in a city that had stadiums that held more than 100,000 screaming fans and gave its citizens free lunches. Fortune favors the bold. Thebold are born for Constantinople.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA-2019September 21, 2018Sophomore SeminarsThe sophomore seminar is the second component of the Shared Passages and comes at a critical moment of challenge and opportunity in students'journeys through the K Plan. They provide a vital link between students' entry to the K experience and their other landmark K experiences - advancedwork in the major, study abroad, and a SIP.Sophomore seminarsSEMN202Who Is 'the other'? This seminar will focus on how we create and label others in our societies. Students will explore the various ways inwhich this occurs and along what lines: race, ethnicity, gender, sexual preference, socioeconomic circumstances, and others.

A grand experiment, with unfortunate consequences, is being conducted before us, as some large nations pollute withreckless abandon, and largely ignore environmental issues, while others, mostly in Europe, have made significant changes in behavior, seemingly toeveryone's benefit. Who should pay for all this? Should the United Nations intervene on the big polluters? What policy should the U.S. follow? Anintelligent discussion of these issues needs input from the fields of Science, Political Science, and Economics, and is also informed by internationalexperiences. The course is designed to bring together viewpoints from several different majors, and personal perspectives gained through internationalexperiences are also valuable. Possible careers involving environmental science, engineering and politics/policy will be discussed. Personalenvironmental impact and various choices/options will also be discussed.

Through self-designed projects,service-learning partnerships with local makers, lively discussion and reflective writing, we'll thoughtfully consider, define, and begin practicing what isrequired to sustain a joyful creative life beyond K.Prerequisite: Seniors onlySEMN/ENGL435American Indian Literature & LawSEMN491/-2019September 21, 2018SEMN499Being... While acknowledging the magnitude of the task, over time and across cultures, participants in this Senior Capstone will exploremany endings to the title of the course and the means by which those ends can be attained. Though not limited to a short list of possible endings (andends?) - such as aware, human, responsible, in transition, of use, green, a community, present, or good enough - explorations will be prescribed by timeavailable and who is participating in the course.

Itexamines Africa's post-independence democratic strides, security issues, and the failure and successes of statism. It specifically exposes students to thechallenges and the conundrum of the postcolonial state and the efforts in dealing with such challenges in Africa. The end of the Cold War as well as thedemise of apartheid affected the political landscape in Africa, thus strengthening the role of grassroots organizations and of other external forces toengage in the process of state reconstruction.AFST/HIST/SEMN271Nelson Mandela and the Anti-Apartheid Movement There are times when specific people, places and moments inhistory capture the imagination of the world. This occurs when that specificity speaks volumes to the human condition and offers lessons that we allsense are important. Such has been the case with Nelson Mandela and anti-apartheid movement.

What is it like to live in an occupiedsociety? By exploring the post-World War II occupations of Japan, Okinawa, and both North and South Korea, we will seek to address these questionsand understand how this period of occupation shaped East Asia and its people in positive and negative ways. We will examine how the goals andattitudes of the occupiers, particularly those from the US and the USSR, influenced the region. In our comparative study of these occupations we willdraw from the rich English-language archive of primary and secondary materials, including historical studies, memoirs, government and militarydocuments, as well as works of fiction, cartoons, and film.HIST285Modern Japan Study of Japanese history from the 17th century to the present.

E. It highlights Africa's role in the development and growth of Christianity as a global religion. Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlyRELG280Spirituality, Money, & Travel Travel and spirituality are well-established companions. The practice of pilgrimage is found on everycontinent, and taking a vacation to a particularly exotic locale to look at Buddhist temples, for example, is an increasingly common practice.Furthermore, travel is commonly assumed to be a function of economic surplus. Yet in the 1970s and subsequent decades, "backpack travel" emergedas low-cost alternatives, particularly to developing countries. This course examines the development of travel within a contemporary understanding ofdeveloping neoliberal economies and the academic study of spirituality and religion, analyzing the emergence of spiritual tourism and the costs for suchenterprises.RELG295Religion & Sexuality in the US Using theoretical works, historical case studies, and present-day events, we explore how ideas aboutreligion and sexuality have been constructed in U.S. history, how religion and sexuality shape one another, and how the regulation of religion and theregulation of sexuality in U.S. society are intertwined. As we examine our case studies, which move from the colonial era to the present, we will alsoexplore some of the key terms that guide the studies of religion and sexuality, including gender, ritual, and confession. By the end of the course, studentswill have a familiarity with both theoretical and historical elements of the study of religion and sexuality.Prerequisite: One previous course at the 100level in Religion highly recommendedRELG295Race, Religion, and Migration in the US This course explores religion, race, and migration in North American history. Through aseries of case studies and theoretical readings, we will explore how ideas about race and religion shaped American understandings of who had a right tomigrate from place to place; whose movements were worthy of mention in historical accounts, and which movements were seen as good or bad, legalor illegal, noble or menacing. Though our focus will be on the United States and its controversies surrounding migration, we will also seek to historicizehow U.S. boundaries came to be fixed where they are today, and how religious and racial groups span those boundaries.Prerequisite: One previouscourse at the 100 level in Religion highly recommended.RELG295Love in a Dead Language In the religious and cultural history of South Asia, poetry, drama and epic were one of the primary means bywhich religions were lived and imagined. There was no distinction between "secular" and "religious" literature; the same poem that one might read forpleasure, another would read to cultivate devotion to god or learn how to live an ethical life. The 'ancient authorities' of the Hindu tradition declared FourGoals proper for a human life: love, profit, duty and liberation. This course focuses on the first goal, love (kama), and the literature of love written inSanskrit during the early medieval period. This course will examine five major genres of Sanskrit literature-epic, drama, extended poetry, poeticminiature, and song.Prerequisite: One previous course at the 100 level in Religion highly recommended.RELG295Race and Islam in America This course traces the experiences of Muslims in North America from the sixteenth century to the present,with special focus on Islam in America after 9/11. It places particular emphasis on how Muslims have shaped American life and culture, how Muslimcommunities have been racialized in U.S. discourse, and how Muslims have sought to re-define their racial and religious identities in a U.S. context,particularly after the rise of the War on Terror.RELG295Religion and Social Struggle This course examines twentieth and twenty-first century social struggles through a religious lens. KarlMarx famously described religion as the "opiate of the masses." In practice, however, religion has been a resource for resistance as well as amechanism of control. Drawing on case studies from the U.S. and Latin America, this course analyses how both sides of a conflict understand anddeploy religious concepts. This course will examine how power and religion intersect, how those outside power structures mobilize religion, and howreligions change in different conditions. This course will also analyze such contemporary movements as the War on Terror and Black Lives Matter.RELG390Junior Seminar in Religion The study of religion is comprised of a set of intersecting questions and issues with its roots in the nineteenthcentury. This course is designed to introduce students to those questions, to wrestle with those questions again. There is no single definition of religion,but there are conversations and questions that rest at the heart of the academic study of religion. The goal of this course is to learn how to considerreligious experiences as aspects of dynamic and evolving interactions between thought and action, the immediate world and that which lies beyond, andindividuals and communities. A significant part of the course involves writing a research prospectus to best prepare the student to write a SIP in theReligion Department. This course is required for religion majors in their junior year and for students who want to write their SIP in the ReligionDepartment. Minors are required to take either this course in their junior year or RELG490, the Senior Seminar in Religion, in their senior year.Prerequisite: Two courses in Religion and Junior standing or permissionRELG490Senior Seminar in Religion Students examine a variety of theories of religion and use them to consider retrospectively some of thetopics already considered in their various courses undertaken as part of their concentration. Designed as the capstone seminar for majors and minors, tobe taken during the senior year. Required for religion majors in their senior year. Minors are required to take either this course in their senior year orRELG390, the Junior Seminar in Religion, in their junior year.Prerequisite: Senior Religion majors and minors or permission of instructorRELG593Senior Individualized Project Each program or department sets its own requirements for Senior Individualized Projects done in thatdepartment, including the range of acceptable projects, the required background of students doing projects, the format of the SIP, and the expectedscope and depth of projects. See the Kalamazoo Curriculum -> Curriculum Details and Policies section of the Academic Catalog for moredetails.Prerequisite: Permission of department and SIP supervisor required.Shared PassagesThe Shared Passages Program is a curricular thread that integrates features of the K-Plan. Required in the first, sophomore, and senior years, SharedPassages courses provide a developmental, pedagogical, and intellectual arc to the liberal arts experience and create a "backbone" to an effective,flexible liberal arts education in which the whole is greater than the sum of its component parts.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA"

In general, the Political Science Department will accept for credit only a course that is not offered at Kalamazoo College.Political Science coursesPOLS105Introduction to U.S. Politics: Theory and Practice Contemporary conceptions of democracy in the United States are often based onthe classic pluralist model of governance: individual citizens articulate interests, groups naturally form and lobby on behalf of those interests, a fairdebate ensues, and the democratic system generates outcomes reflecting a general will. While this may serve as a model of how democracy ought tooperate, it is not clear whether it is an accurate reflection of how our democracy actually operates. In this course, we will employ a multitude ofapproaches-theoretical, behavioral, and institutional-to assist you in assessing the extent to which the functioning of American democracy fulfills itspromise. Collectively, we will grapple with our conflicting visions of American Democracy, identify potential barriers we face, and debate the utility ofpotential reforms.POLS106Introduction to Comparative Politics Introduction to the structure and functioning of different systems of governance within acomparative framework. What are the various paths to political development taken by various industrialized nations? To this end, students compare andcontrast various political ideologies, cultures, and state institutions and their organizations.POLS107Introduction to International Politics An introduction to the study of international relations that focuses on the core issue ofinternational war and peace. The issue is used as a means to explore how political scientists analyze international relations. The course examinesdifferent approaches to analyzing international relations (the system, state, and individual levels of analysis), as well as the ongoing debates between theparadigms of realism, liberalism, radicalism, and feminism.POLS205The Politics of Revolution The very casual use of the term "revolution" frequently betrays its importance. What, for example, does itmean to be a "revolutionary"? Moreover, what has "revolution" meant for men and women? This course seeks to clarify its meaning(s), consider itscauses, and explore the consequences with attention to the French,Haitian and Russian revolutions. The revolutions of 1989 throughout Eastern Europewill also be considered.POLS210Comparative Political Institutions: Social Europe Examination of the political systems, institutions, and practices of European states.Emphasis is on analysis and comparison of social policies concerning immigration, the environment, healthcare and other issues.POLS220Voting, Campaigns, & Elections Representative democracies rely upon elections to establish and maintain the link between the will ofthe people and the elites chosen to represent the public will. This course will examine three interrelated concepts of the American electoral process:voting, campaigns, and elections. First, we will examine the theories and methods employed to identify likely voters and the factors that impact their votechoice. Second, we will identify the distinct factors that determine a campaign's effectiveness including: the candidate, media coverage, politicalstrategy, and broader contextual factors. Finally, we will assess the unique configuration of our electoral design, the extent to which thesecharacteristics structure electoral outcomes, and whether modifications are required.POLS225Constitutional Law The cornerstone of American democracy rests upon the U.S. Constitution. In addition to laying the blueprint for theinstitutional design of our government, the Bill of Rights, in theory, establishes the fundamental rights and liberties of all American citizens. In thiscourse, students will familiarize themselves with the structure of the federal court system, the contrasting modes of legal reasoning employed by justiceson the court, and the often competing legal, political, and societal factors that influence the Supreme Court's rulings. We will focus on three substantiveareas of constitutional law: 1) equal protection under the 14th Amendment; 2) the right to privacy; and 3) freedom of speech. By tracing the evolution ofthe law in these three key areas, students will sharpen their legal-reasoning skills, and be better equipped to evaluate the extent to which the Court hasfulfilled our Constitutional ideals.POLS229Race, Law, & US Politics This course will explore the intersection of race, law and politics in the United States. In the first half of thequarter we will develop a theoretical framework to understand each of these three interrelated concepts. First, we will examine the American judicialsystem, contrasting theories of jurisprudence, and legal reasoning and writing. Second, we will explore the complex relationship between law andpolitics. Third, we will examine theories of race, racial formation, and critical race theory. In the second half of the quarter we will turn our attention totracing the key legal precedents and statutes that have at various times in our history shaped, reinforced, and/or challenged conceptions of race. We willexamine the ways in which each has expanded and/or contracted the rights of racial and ethnic minorities. We will end the quarter by evaluating theextent to which the Court provides an effective venue for racial and ethnic minorities to pursue equal rights and access in America.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA, 225, 229, 230, or 310KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA"

Students will develop a vocabulary of core concepts and analytical skills for the study ofcultures and societies both local and global. Through readings, films, lectures, class discussions, and experiential projects, students will explore the natureof communities, organizations, and institutions; the system of meanings that form and inform them; and the interplay between individuals' lives and thesocieties in which they live. Along the way, students will be asked to apply course concepts to their own lives in a critical way, and to reflect upon howsuch issues as belief systems, social stratification, culture change, gender roles, etc play out in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world.ANSO120The Family This course examines the institution of The Family, primarily from a critical perspective. After situating The Family in culturaland historical structures of race/ethnicity, class, and gender, we explore the institution as a site for the production and reproduction of femininity,masculinity, and (hetero)sexuality. We also examine the implications of the institution and the dynamics of power embedded in it for individuals andgroups working against the dominant script.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA Introduction to Society and Culture"

Ecology This course will introduce students to the sub-discipline of political ecology, a fieldbroadly concerned with the relationships between nature and social power. In other words, this course will focus on developing an understanding of howsocial relations and politico-economic systems produce environmental problems, structure access to natural resources, the resulting struggles over'nature' and how and in whose interests these may or may not be resolved.Because the field is broad, the course has been structured into themes thatwe will explore each week.Prerequisite: Take ANSO-103ANSO234Latin America in Global Context This course will primarily examine contemporary Latin American history from an anthropologicalperspective. The first part of the course will explore the role of colonialism and imperialism in the making of Latin America. In the second part of thecourse, the role of U.S. foreign policy will be discussed, particularly the specific policies the U.S. deployed in Latin America to "contain" alternativeeconomic models deemed dangerous to U.S. capitalism. We also will examine the underlying assumptions of Western-centered development modelsimposed in Latin America and their relation to neo-colonialism and globalization. The final part of the course will explore revolutionary movements asthey respond to the encroaching forces of capitalism.Prerequisite: ANSO-103ANSO236Race and Racism This course equips students with a comprehensive understanding of "race" as a socio-political construct, and of racismas a structural and institutional process. Focusing primarily on the twentieth and twenty-first century United States, the course explores how raceoperates as an organizing principle of American life. It examines the historical development of notions of racial difference and the creation of racialinequality through science, philosophy, the law, and public policy; analyzes how contemporary social institutions perpetuate racial inequality; andconsiders the landscape of modern racial politics.Prerequisite: Take ANSO-103ANSO245Qualitative Research Methods This course provides students with the methodological tools and concepts that provide the foundation ofsound, ethical, qualitative, ethnographic research.

While eating is essential to our survival, we rarely pay attention to what we eat andwhy. We will look at the significance of food and eating with particular attention to how people define themselves differently through their foodways.We will also study food's role in maintaining economic and social relations, cultural conceptions of health, and religion. Finally, the class examines thecomplex economic and political changes in food systems and the persistence of food's role as an expression of identity, social and ethnic markers. Thiscourse is a Shared Passages Sophomore Seminar.Prerequisite: Sophomores Only. Take ANSO -103ANSO/SEMN262Real and Imagined Cities This course explores the city as an idea, as material reality and the interconnections between the two.As an interdisciplinary field, urban geography draws from theories and frameworks in urban planning, anthropology, sociology and economics.

How did this come about? What can we learn about East Asian societies, and our own,from studying sports? These are some of the questions we will be tackling as we explore the history and significance of sports in East Asia. Drawingfrom a combination of primary materials, theoretical writings, comparative studies, and secondary works focused on East Asia, we will consider sportsin terms of several issues: invented traditions, nationalism, body culture, gender, stardom, and the modern Olympics, to name just a few.ANSO290Africa in Global Context An examination of contemporary African societies. Particular emphasis is given to the ways that people andplaces on the African continent have been and continue to be connected to global dynamics and the implications of these past and present connectionsfor people's lives as they are lived today.Prerequisite: ANSO-103ANSO/SEMN292Development and Dispossession This course takes a critical approach to the study of development, focusing particularattention on the displacement and dispossession of local populations.

Students will explore the historical,social and cultural differences between ancient and modern accounts of Roman history and examine our modern desire for "watching" the ancientworld. Readings by Roman writers and secondary source material will be paired with film screenings. Special attention will be given to why we retellsome stories (i.e. Cleopatra), as well as to the way that this form of "Roman history" encourages us to visit difficult cultural topics, such as politicalimperialism, slavery, sex and gender difference, and racism.Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlyCLAS/HIST225Greek Civilization From Homer to Alexander the Great with emphasis on arts and letters.CLAS/HIST226Roman Civilization From the foundation of the Republic to the empire of Constantine.CLAS/HIST227The Roman Army and the Frontiers of Empire This course considers the Roman army from the perspectives of both militaryand social history. After a chronological survey of the development of the Roman army, case studies of the army in action in specific frontier provinceswill be considered.

Itexamines essential features of the human condition—e.g., morality, knowledge, nature, society, happiness, justice, beauty, selfhood, and friendship – allin the search for knowledge that both preserves and transforms enduring dimensions of human self-understanding. Philosophy emerges in the Westerntradition as a rational, systematic, and self-critical inquiry committed to grounding its own claim to knowledge. Contemporary philosophy continues toexamine the fundamental principles that guide our thought and action, our pursuit of knowledge, and our desire to live well. Because philosophy adopts aradically self-critical orientation to its own historical formation, philosophers often disagree profoundly about what philosophy is and how it differs fromother disciplines. Such disagreements – openly, critically, and vigorously deliberated – are vital to the type of radical questioning that characterizesphilosophy.Philosophy challenges students to (1) reflect upon naively lived patterns of thought, action, speech, and perception; (2) identify how practices,institutions, and perceptions are shaped by philosophical traditions; (3) critically examine and assess the fundamental assumptions that inform suchhuman enterprises; and (4) conduct this inquiry in the spirit of open critical communication committed to mutual understanding and respect fordifference. Students learn the basic skills of identifying and analyzing arguments, and the department actively fosters an environment committed to thevigorous, respectful exchange of ideas to protect both commonalities and differences. Philosophy also cultivates ethical responsibility by balancing (1)the articulation, justification, and application of normative principles with (2) the deepening of moral imagination and sensibility.CurriculumThe department offers eight "History and Traditions" courses that represent important periods and traditions of Western philosophy:History and Traditions CoursesAncient PhilosophyEarly Modern Philosophy18th-Century Philosophy19th-Century PhilosophyExistentialism and FilmAnalytic Philosophy and ScienceCritical Social Theory: The Dialectic of EnlightenmentPostmodern Critical Theory: The Critique of Modernity.These historical courses reconstruct the debates, issues, concerns, questions, and concepts that define a historical period from within. They also offerlinkages among historical periods, allowing students to appreciate the larger, "paradigmatic" shifts in Western philosophy. Students gain an awareness ofhow canonical philosophers characteristically address their own historical precedents and shape their views in critical dialogue with predecessors.Students are required to engage in close textual interpretation and careful critical evaluation of original texts. Instructors identify contemporaryadvocates for, or illustrations of, traditional schools of thought and, in this way, underscore the real historical effects of philosophical creativity. Studentswrite detailed, textually supported expository and argumentative essays that are graded for their balance between interpretive charity and critical acuity.Emphasis is placed upon cultivating a student's ability to first reconstruct the historical debates among canonical philosophers and to then criticallyevaluate their bearing upon contemporary concerns. Many of the Philosophy Department's history courses have interdisciplinary units of instruction thatlink historical debates to contemporary research programs within the natural and social sciences and to interpretive approaches in the Humanities.The department also offers courses in the classic subfields of philosophy: logic, ethics, metaphysics, and aesthetics. These courses explicate thefundamental conceptual tools we need to systematically address particular types of contemporary issues:KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA"

In addition, students will have acquired further confidence in their ability to speak Chinese.Prerequisite: CHIN-202CHIN215Chinese Cultural Motifs through Calligraphy Chinese scripts are windows to East Asia cultures. This course traces the etymologyand introduces the cultural background of Chinese scripts. It also provides hands-on practice of Chinese calligraphy. This course combines aesthetictraining and language learning. Students learn the Chinese scripts not only as linguistic symbols but also as cultural motifs and art forms. Learning theetymology and cultural background of the scripts helps one to understand the linguistic formation of Chinese and other Asian languages that use Chinesescripts. It further provides useful references to the value system, thinking process, and aesthetic principles behind the Chinese language. The hands-onpractice of calligraphy is a unique cultural experience. Through frequent review and constant practice, the students become familiar with Chinesescripts, learn the linguistic and cultural meanings associated with these scripts, and acquire the artistic skill of creative expression.CHIN/SEMN220Chinese Food Culture Chinese culture is among the most food-conscious ones. Through China's long history, food has alwaysbeen a means of communication, a symbol of good life, and at the same time a target of criticism for its indulgence and improper distribution.Additionally, it has been a provision for healthcare, and a rich resource of linguistic expressions and literary allusions and metaphors. These will be thetopics of the seminar, which should be a meaningful and effective pathway to the core of Chinese life and philosophy. This course is a Shared PassagesSophomore Seminar.Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlyCHIN22220th-Century Urban China This course interrogates literary and cinematic representations of Chinese cities in the twentieth century. Byexamining urban narrative in Chinese fiction, drama, poetry and film from the Republican and People's Republic periods, this class offers a newunderstanding of Chinese modernity as marked by its unique urban sensibilities and configurations.CHIN225Traditional Chinese Literature in Translation This course examines the relationship between the individual and society in traditionalChinese literature. We will read a wide selection of important texts from China's long history, including the Classic of Poetry, early assassin narratives,medieval nature poetry and romantic tales, vernacular stories, urban drama, and novels from the late imperial period. Among the more importantquestions that we will investigate is the complex role that Chinese literature played in articulating the place of the individual vis-à-vis the community andstate.CHIN235Modern Chinese Literature in Translation This course will examine the literary world of modern China by closely analyzingrepresentative stories and novels written during the 20th century. As will quickly become clear in the course, literature in modern China has had andcontinues to have a close relationship with politics as well as with a wide variety of discussions on cultural identity in post-traditional China. Among themain goals of the course will be to explore how literature comes to grips with a thoroughgoing crisis of an established culture that results in a series ofconsequences unprecedented in Chinese history. Above all, the course will seek to understand how and why literature has played the role that it has,and what implications for the meaning of literature can be determined from examining the relationship between writing and society in modern China.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA, 202, 203 (or demonstrated equivalent competence)For the Japan Track: "

CES Majors are required to theorize from multiple, and simultaneous, narratives ofsilenced peoples and epistemologies. Critical Ethnic Studies untangles and analyzes colonial and racial projects that attempt to govern the relationshipbetween people and land.Critical Ethnic Studies is an interdisciplinary field and process of engagement. The field seeks to change the logic governing the academy, and does notaccept an uncomplicated grafting of content onto a universal idea. This change is realized through the relentless pursuit of multiple means ofengagement. These processes invert, rethink, and displace universalities. Central to the field is a refusal to consume the other. Critical Ethnic Studiesrequires that scholars go beyond themselves, and devise conversations that move beyond voyeurism and consumption.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA"

Such education equips individuals to understand and appreciate the world andto meet its challenges. The study of History contributes much to these ends, maintaining that people and societies are, in important respects, theproducts of their past; therefore, the story of the past provides insight helpful to both personal and social development.History stands at the core of a liberal arts education, moreover, since one aim of that education is to integrate the various disciplines. Taking as itssubject a narrative of individuals and society in the past, History draws upon all disciplines to discuss that past. It provides a narrative framework for thestudy of other disciplines and helps the advanced student integrate various academic perspectives.AP, IB, Transfer, and Study Abroad CreditsWith department approval, one unit (AP/IB, Study Abroad, transfer, etc.) may be applied to the major or minor but cannot be used to fulfill the one-course requirement for any of the four fields.

We also recommend either supervisory or advisory involvement with the SIP.A SIP in Philosophy does not count toward minor requirements.Philosophy coursesPHIL105Ethics Ethics is a sub-field of philosophy with rather lofty goals. Among its objects of study, it investigates what is valuable, what peoplehave practical reason to do, and what is right and wrong. This course is only an introduction to part of this rich subfield: normative ethics. At the end wemay have time for a small taste of applied ethics. We start by engaging with standard attempts to question ethics (amoral-ism, relativism, egoism, etc).We then survey the main ethical frameworks: virtue ethics, utilitarianism and deontology. We will read a variety of classical texts in these traditions aswell as some more contemporary authors. The course is designed to demonstrate why ethics matters, to expose students to a variety of ethicalframeworks and to equip them with the conceptual resources to think critically about each framework.PHIL107Logic and Reasoning An introduction to methods for evaluating the validity and strength of reasoning. The course will investigate (1) thetheory and practice of constructing and analyzing arguments as they occur in ordinary, informal contexts (reasoning), and (2) the concepts andtechniques of elementary formal logic: the art of symbolizing English-language statements and arguments in terms of formalized languages and applyinglogical principles to them. Topics explored include informal fallacies, critical thinking, evaluating evidence, deciding between hypotheses, propositionallogic, natural deduction, and predicate logic. Recommended for computer science, psychology, and pre-law students.PHIL108Ecological Philosophy This course investigates the question of our understanding of, and ethical responsibility to, animals, plants,microorganisms, non-living beings, ecosystems, and "nature" as a whole. The first part of the course critically assesses whether traditional ethicaltheories adequately capture our ethical responsibilities to the environment. The second part surveys traditional Western conceptualizations of nature,reason, body, and space, which ecologists severely criticize as detrimental to developing an ecological ethic. Special emphasis will be placed upondeveloping a philosophical conception of life (bios) that is appropriate for both evolutionary biology and the development of a normative theory ofenvironmental care. Contemporary positions such as anthropocentrism, deep ecology, radical ecology, ecofeminism, and social environmentalism will bestudied. Recommended for environmental studies and biology students.PHIL109Existentialism and Film Survey of key existentialist thinkers, such as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, De Beauvior, Merleau-Ponty,and Sartre, with a special emphasis upon their radical ideals of freedom and self-responsibility. Films are shown as depictions of existentialist themes,such as alienation, authenticity, bad faith, despair, passion, anonymity, and anguish. Existentialists oppose traditional, "essentialist," "teleological," and"cognitivist" conceptions of human life, and they reject the hierarchical dualities of reason/will, knowledge/choice, mind/body, thought/being. Specialemphasis will be placed upon the existentialist analysis of interpersonal relations in contemporary circumstances. Students are required to see sevenfilms in addition to regularly scheduled classes. Discussion-based course with two writing assignments.

A couple to consider are Arcus Center for Social Justice Leadership Fund and CIP Grants for StudentProjects Abroad.Procedure for Approval1. Enroll in : Feminist and Queer Inquiries in your Junior Spring term. Discuss your plans to write a SIP in WGS with your proposed SIPadvisor or with the WGS program director, who may recommend an appropriate advisor.2. Revise your SIP proposal on the basis of your advisor's recommendations and submit it for signatures by the end of Week Eight of Spring term.The SIP proposal should be signed by the student and advisor and be delivered to the WGS program director. (Remember you must also registerfor the SIP with the Registrar).3. Keep in mind that this is a provisional plan, and while we expect you to stick to your outline and schedule of research, we do recognize that yourhypothesis and sources are a bit tentative. If your research takes a substantially different track than that proposed in your proposal, pleasecontact your advisor immediate to get his or her advice.LengthA thesis or research SIP might be comprised of 2-4 parts/sections/chapters, an introduction and conclusion, or some organizational equivalent. Thestudent may make use of Internet source materials but not exclusively. The number of required bibliographic citations will be determined by the SIPadvisor in consultation with the student. Guidelines: 1 unit: 30-50 pages of writing, excluding bibliographic materials; 2 units: 51-80 pages excludingbibliographical material.Criteria for evaluation of other kinds of SIPs should be established in advance with the SIP advisor(s) and the WGS director.EvaluationThe SIP is read and evaluated by the SIP advisor, according to the criteria set and agreed upon by the SIP advisor and the student, and on the basis ofthe student's success in meeting deadlines, completing revisions, and producing a competent piece of work.If the SIP advisor would like to recommend the SIP for Honors, another member of the WGS program or occasionally a faculty member outside theprogram reads it. If that faculty member agrees, then the SIP is awarded Honors. One and two unit SIPs are eligible for consideration for honors.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA"

This seminar will approach this visit (andBaldwin) as a site of analysis. As an actual event, the occasion left artifacts (correspondence, publicity, newspaper accounts, published essay). Theevent also can be read within the legacy of other Civil Rights era visitors to the college, including Charles V. Hamilton (co-author of "Black Power: ThePolitics of Liberation") and others. Moreover, as a writer who addressed national and international identity, racial politics (personal and cultural), andsexuality, Baldwin's various writings remain relevant even as they locate themselves within particular historical moments. Through close attention toBaldwin and his milieu, this course will invite students to engage their own experiences and disciplinary knowledge in their reading, writing, and archivalresearch. Students will also document (in film and transcript) oral histories of participants in the Civil Rights period as part of their course work.

In the Department ofReligion at Kalamazoo College, students learn about what it means to define religion as a field of inquiry.  We offer traditions-based courses inChristianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, other religions of South and East Asia, and religious traditions in the Americas.  We also offercourses on particular questions and methods, including religion and science, sexuality studies, women and feminist studies, material culture,transnationalism, and commodification.  In all of our courses and in our own areas of research, we are committed to investigations of religion andreligious experiences from a variety of angles, including questions of theology, history, linguistics, sociology, anthropology, texts, and philosophy.  Weexamine religion in a comparative context, recognizing that religion reflects and is braided throughout economic, cultural, and political dimensions ofhuman experience.  The study of religion is challenging and invigorating because of the intersections and exchanges that unfold across differentdisciplines, traditions, and faith commitments.Requirements for the Major in ReligionNumber of UnitsEight units are required, not including the SIP.

Knowledge of a second language is an important facetof the liberal arts program. Proficiency in a second language at the 201 level is a graduation requirement.German courses at all levels emphasize speaking, reading, writing, and listening while addressing topics related to German culture. The disciplinary basisfor the program, German Studies, draws on literature, history, gender studies, popular culture, music, architecture, and film (among other things) to aidstudents in the development of a critical understanding of the German-speaking world and their own. The German Studies curriculum uses a genre- andliteracy-based approach to foreign language learning that is dedicated to integrating linguistic knowledge, cultural learning and textual analysisthroughout the four-year major curriculum, top to bottom. For example, through genre-focused courses such as those on film and contemporary Germanculture, the German program recognizes the importance of new media in the 20th and 21st centuries and how these media have reshaped the nature ofGerman culture. Other advanced courses take a wider historical view, examining the changing nature of German culture through the lens of a particulargenre (such as film) or theme (such as minority cultures).Most Kalamazoo College students participate in the study abroad program; for students interested in German, there are opportunities in Erlangen andBonn. Course work and off-campus experiences are complemented by on-campus opportunities that maintain or improve a student's language skills,including conversation groups led by native speaking teaching assistants and a quarterly film series.Faculty members meet students inside and outside the classroom, participate in campus activities, and counsel students regarding career choices inforeign service, education, publishing, international business, and other fields. A number of German majors, as well as students in the German program,have been able to participate in Career and Professional Development internships with German companies, both in the United States and in Europe.As part of the study abroad program at Kalamazoo College, scholarships for one year of further study at the German universities of Bonn and Erlangenare available to qualified graduates of the College. Kalamazoo students have often succeeded in obtaining Fulbright fellowships and other support forfurther study in Germany. Competition for these scholarships is not limited to German majors.PlacementAll incoming students who have previously studied German in high school or elsewhere must take the College’s placement test in German.Students with three or more years of high school German will not be placed into "

This course examines German cinema as a reflection of one of the most dynamic, ifproblematic, nations in the modern world. Along with a basic understanding of the terms used in the formal description of film, this course providesstudents with the socio-historic background to be able to evaluate the role that films played in shaping and reflecting German cultural ideals from theearly 20h century through the present.

These two perspectives collide in texts by contemporary author Judith Schalansky, who incorporates images of natural history inher novels. Schalansky also edits a tactile series on natural history. Thus this course will consider the evolution of the book and book printing culturethrough select engagement with the book as nature and the book as material good. Central questions under consideration are the intersection of formand genre and the relationship between content and materiality.

The course can be repeated with a different topic.HIST242Enlightenment and Its Legacies This course serves both as an introduction to some key questions that characterize intellectual andcultural history and to the intellectual developments that shaped European culture, society, and political life between 1650 and 1850. We will analyze theintellectual tensions that defined this era - between, for example, traditionalism and progress, reason and the unconscious, freedom and authority,hierarchy and equality, and the individual and society. We will consider the historical context in which these intellectual tensions emerged and considerhow they spread. We will thus be reflecting critically on the relationship between philosophical ideas, artistic expression, social structures, and politicalmovements.HIST244French Revolution and Napoleon Study of France from Louis XIV to Napoleon with emphasis on structure and problems of the ancientregime, origins of the revolution itself, and the Napoleonic period.HIST252European Colonialism and Decolonization This course explores the history of European colonialism and decolonization, beginning withthe emergence of early modern empires in the sixteenth century and ending with the contradictions that have characterized the post colonial era. Wewill explore the meaning and significance of imerialism using both a chronological and thematic framework. Key themes will include military conflict andviolence; strategies of domination; resistance to imperial rule; economics and trade; relations between center and periphery; the role of beliefs aboutracial and cultural difference; the relationship between empire and the modern nation-state; decolonization; and the legacy of empire.HIST254History, Memory, and Identity in Modern Europe This course will explore historical memory's role in shaping twentieth-centuryEuropean politics and identities. We will begin by exploring theoretical approaches to the study of individual and collective memory. We will then turn tocase studies that have shaped European memory culture, including World Wars I and II, the Holocaust, European imperialism, and the collapse of theUSSR. Along the way, we will explore different "sites" of memory such as monuments, museums, memoirs, novels, and films. We will also discuss therelationship between collective memory and collective forgetting.HIST256/"

PRING 2018," DESCRIPTION: This course will investigate the history of social justice andsocial reform in the United States from 1790 to 1980. We will read widely from secondary sources about the origination of social reform in the EarlyRepublic, its progression throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and its changing focus on social justice in the mid to late twentiethcentury. The focus will be on a variety of reforms and a variety of perspectives, both progressive and reactionary. The course will also consider theeffect of these reforms on the various people they were trying to help, and the ways in which people from different backgrounds (whether based onrace, gender, sexual orientation, or class) approached reform. Rather than a comprehensive examination of all types of reform, the class is meant tohighlight important moments and changes in social reform and social justice. Since it is intended for history majors and minors, the culmination of thecourse will be an original research paper that examines some aspect of social reform or social justice in the United States, and that significantly engagesboth primary and secondary sources.Prerequisite: One course in US HistoryHIST393Seminar in Medieval History A reading- and discussion-based seminar in some topic of Medieval History, culminating in a substantialresearch paper.

Hip hop has its "heads," French opera had claqueurs, and Syrian tarab has the sammi'a (expert listeners), but is the act of listening the sameacross cultures, or is there something to the local perception of music that goes beyond style and genre? Questioning the adage that "Music is theuniversal language," this course will examine how people assign meaning and power to music. Analyzing music from around the world, we will attuneour ears to the ways in which people across cultural borders conceptualize music, sound and the act of listening. No music reading or basic theoryknowledge is required. Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlyMUSC235Music Theory & Analysis III Building upon the skills acquired in MUSC135, students will refine their facility with the extended tonalharmony of the late-19th and early 20th centuries through analysis and model composition in multiple styles, including jazz and popular music.

Sophomore standing recommended.PHIL210Classical & Contemporary Social Contract Theory The social contract tradition is a foundational pillar of modern political philosophy.Authors in this tradition hold that life without any government (the hypothetical "state of nature") would be so problematic that it motivates people to setup a "contract" of sorts with one another that institutes a system of government. This account of the move from the state of nature to governmentsupposedly explains why we have an obligation to obey existing governments. According to this tradition government and laws of some kind areprerequisites to any minimally just society. This is how the tradition differs from philosophical anarchism (another class). Although the social contracttradition is an overarching framework authors within it have very different views on topics such as just and unjust systems of government, consent togovernance, the sources and limits of political obligation, property rights and the supposed "right to revolt". We will study this tradition by readingexcerpts from Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant. We end the course by reading a few contemporary authors who critique the social contracttradition based on what it neglected to account for in terms of gender and race, and how this impacts the notion of consent to governance.PHIL211Philosophy of Law Historical examination of the two opposing paradigms in the study of legal systems: namely, factual ("positivist") andnormative ("natural law") models of law. Selected topics may include (1) the relation between law and morality, (2) the nature of legitimation andauthority; (3) the nature of juridical interpretation and legal reasoning; (4) the role of the legal system within ethical traditions, market forces, andpolitical institutions; and (5) the Critical Legal Studies challenge to liberal jurisprudence. Readings from Aquinas, Austin, Holmes, Hart, Fuller, Dworkin,Scalia, Unger, Raz, MacKinnon, and Habermas. Seminar format with an emphasis upon discussion and structured debate. Suggested for pre-law andpolitical science students.PHIL214Philosophy of Art This course introduces students to a variety of traditional and contemporary philosophical theories of art: namely,Platonic, Aristotelian, rationalist, empiricist, idealist, Marxist, phenomenological, hermeneutic, existentialist, feminist, psychoanalytic, semiotic,deconstructivist, and more contemporary "postmodernist" aesthetics theories. Such theoretical positions inform, but are also tested by, critical andinterpretive articles about particular artworks: for example, painting, sculpture, film, architecture, and handcraft. We will focus our attention upon thevisual arts -- as opposed to literary, musical, theatrical and the dance media. Students will gain an appreciation of the difficulties philosophers haveencountered in framing a theory of "aesthetic perception" and, more importantly, of the remarkable variety of visual art forms.PHIL/SEMN215Human Rights & International Law People often invoke human rights and international law in the course of debate. However,these are highly contested concepts. This course introduces some theoretical clarity with respect to their conceptual grounding, history andcontemporary practice. Our primary focus will be on different philosophical theories of human rights, with secondary attention to international humanrights law. We start with an orientation on human rights practice and try to move past some of the so-called "challenges" to human rights. This isfollowed by a look at the main contemporary approaches for conceptualizing human rights: the basic human-interest approach, the capabilities approachand the newer "political" approach (among others). We will spend a few weeks on various debates within the human rights literature as well: Whetherthere is such a thing as "group rights", whether and how there is a distinction between civil and political human rights on the one hand versus social andeconomic human rights on the other, when human rights violations might trigger external, international intervention, etc. Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlyKALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA"

As a field of academic study, Political Science is both a classical discipline and a more recently developedsocial science. The study of politics utilizes philosophical, historical, comparative and empirical analysis to examine governments, transnationalinstitutions, political movements, politics, and policies. Knowledge of these areas enables students to participate more effectively in the political processon behalf of their own values. Students also learn skills to scrutinize both their own value systems and those of others.The Political Science Department seeks to provide broad yet rigorous training in the fields of U.S. politics, comparative politics, international politics, andpolitical theory. This training provides a thorough grounding for study in graduate and professional schools (including law school), as well as preparationfor public service, nongovernmental employment, civic engagement, and political activism at the local, state, national, and international levels.Requirements for the Major in Political ScienceNumber of UnitsNine units are required, not including the SIP.Required Courses"

SEMN 209T,"he Politics of Immigration According to the UN Charter of Fundamental Rights, one has a fundamental right to leaveone's country of origin (1948, Article 13), yet there is no corresponding right to enter another country. This sophomore seminar considers theconsequence of this tension with attention to normative questions of who should be allowed entry to and citizenship within (other) states. In addition, weexplore the empirical complexities that inform and result from these judgments. This broadly international and interdisciplinary seminar privileges states,laws (domestic and international) and actual policy over the last sixty years, with particular attention to North America and Western Europe - keydestinations for migrants and thus crucial laboratories to investigate the myths, realities, policies and consequences of immigration. At a time when thereare growing pressures for increased immigration in Western Europe, we conclude by noting recent developments within the European Union toharmonize asylum and immigration policies. We ask - what are the ethical challenges and what might the future look like?POLS245Politics of Latin America This course provides an introduction to contemporary Latin American politics. The first part of the courseexamines the historical factors and socioeconomic conditions that have influenced the development of Latin American politics, including its frequentlytroubled relationship with the United States. The second part examines the principal political structures that have characterized Latin American politicsin the form of authoritarian, revolutionary, and democratic regimes.POLS/AFST248Politics of Sub-Saharan Africa This course offers an in-depth perspective on the study of Sub-Saharan African politics. Itexamines Africa's post-independence democratic strides, security issues, and the failure and successes of statism. It specifically exposes students to thechallenges and the conundrum of the postcolonial state and the efforts in dealing with such challenges in Africa. The end of the Cold War as well as thedemise of apartheid affected the political landscape in Africa, thus strengthening the role of grassroots organizations and of other external forces toengage in the process of state reconstruction.POLS/CLAS257Justice and Political Community: Classical Political Thought This course examines political thought from the Greek periodthrough the Italian Renaissance. We will pay particular attention to classical conceptions of human nature, justice, the ideal political order, and theobligations of citizens to their political communities. We will also form an appreciation for the Greek and Roman foundations of subsequent politicalsystems. Thinkers covered may include Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, St. Augustine, and Machiavelli. Offered biannually.POLS260Liberty, Equality, and Authority: Modern Political Thought This course examines political theory in the "modern" period (roughly1650-1900). Many of the works considered here are central to the "canon" of political theory, shaping not only the kinds of questions we have come toask about "the political," but how we go about asking them. In particular, liberalism has been central to the political development of the west. In thisclass we will work toward a deep understanding of liberalism as well as radical democratic, conservative, and socialist challenges to this importantparadigm. Theoretical topics covered include classical social contract theory; the emergence of the abstract "individual" endowed with natural rights;attempts to reconcile the value of equality with that of liberty; and "radical" responses to deep structural inequality. The work of Hobbes, Locke,Rousseau, Burke, Wollstonecraft, Marx, and others will be discussed and analyzed.POLS263American Political Thought In this course we will approach American Political Thought (APT) as a set of narratives and counter-narratives about the meaning and value of American freedom in relation to social, economic, and political equality. Dominant narratives about themeaning of freedom have often functioned to exclude certain groups, while resistance to that exclusion has often taken the form of contestation overthe meaning of freedom itself. We will examine the tensions within American narratives of freedom from the time of the first Puritan settlers to today.POLS/WGS265Feminist Political Theories A core course in the Women, Gender, and Sexuality curriculum, Feminist Political Theories introducesstudents to a wide variety of feminist theoretical frameworks. We will examine what it means to do feminist theory; modern feminist theories, includingliberal, radical, Marxist, socialist, and anarchist feminisms, as well as intersectionality theories; postmodern feminist thought, including queer andtransgender theories and third-wave feminisms; and postcolonial feminist theories from early modernity to postmodernity.Prerequisite: SophomoreStandingPOLS267Environment and Political Theory This course will serve as an introduction to the growing field of environmental political theory, orpolitical ecology, including the writings of political theorists past and present on the relationship between politics, humans, and non-human nature andattempts by contemporary political theorists and environmental activists to articulate principles for organizing society in relation to the natural world.Students will confront their own assumptions about the proper relationship between humans and the natural world, which are embedded in core politicalconcepts such as citizenship and democracy, and work to form reasoned judgments in relation to current environmental problems and controversies.POLS270The European Union: Institutions, Actors, Aliens and Outcomes This course offers a broad introduction to the European Union andthe politics of European integration. We move from a historical overview to a description and assessment of several basic political institutions andconclude with the impact that European integration has had (and continues to exercise) over matters ranging from agriculture and the environment tocrime citizenship, migration, gay rights, and women's rights.POLS285United States Foreign Policy The first part of this course provides an introduction to, and a historical overview of, U.S. foreign policyfrom the end of World War II to the present. Particular emphasis is given to security issues, the development of the Cold War, and the search for aguiding doctrine for contemporary U.S. foreign policy. The second part of the course examines the way in which U.S. foreign policy is made, lookingspecifically at the role of the Presidency, Congress, and the bureaucracy.POLS295Special Topics Special Topics offerings focus upon topics not addressed in the department's regular offerings. The course can berepeated with a different topic. Check the course schedule to see when Special Topics courses are being offered.POLS295Special Topics From hazardous chemicals and nuclear accidents to stratospheric ozone depletion and concern over tropical rain forestsand "sustainable development," environmental justice activists have raised our consciousness and endeavored to provide a coherent vision of policies andprograms they want implemented. How did activists express their claims, what are some of the specific challenges they faced, and how have differentstates/regions around the world responded?POLS295Constructing and Reconstructing Israel The basic introduction to Israeli politics offers a historical and ideological overview that movesus from the late nineteenth century to Israel's establishment as a state in 1948. Therefore, we explore the formation of Israel through migration, keypolitical institutions, and wars. We conclude with current challenges and thus consider some of the unanticipated consequences of Zionism.POLS295Politics of East Asia East Asia draws much attention from the world due to its interesting mix of the emerging world power (China), thethird largest economy in the world (Japan), the two democracies having experienced rapid growth and democratization (South Korea and Taiwan), andone of the most closed and secretive dictatorships on Earth (North Korea). This course is designed to provide a general understating of the politicalhistory and contemporary politics of East Asia. The main goal of this course is to help students develop their ability to analyze various politicalphenomena using concepts and approaches and prepare themselves for higher-level courses in political science courses moving forwardPOLS295Comparative Democratization The study of both democracy and democratization has become a cornerstone of American politicalscience. However, the concept of democracy, the best way to promote it, and why democratization occurs (and why it sometimes does not) are oftenhot topics of contention within the field. While a Western, procedural conception of democracy dominates American political science, alternative way ofthinking and theorizing about democratic regimes do exist. This course will critically survey literature that addresses these debates. Case studies andexamples will be drawn from all over the world and various countries' experiences with democratization. Of particular interest, however, will be theway in which democracy promotion has become a key tenet of American foreign policy.KALAMAZOO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CA"

Prerequisite: Previous coursework in Religion is desirable, but not required.RELG210Sex and the Bible This course is about sex and interpretation, focusing primarily on how Christians have interpreted the Bible aroundquestions of human sexuality. The questions that we will consider are: What does it mean to say a particular view of sexuality and sexual behavior is"biblical" given the sheer variety of possible interpretations? How have changing notions of human sexuality affected the way that the biblical text isunderstood and deployed? We will explore these questions by reading key biblical texts from the Hebrew Bible and New Testament and theirinterpretation by thinkers from antiquity up to the present.

POLS 231P,"olitics of Immigration According to the UN Charter of Fundamental Rights, one has a fundamental right to leave one'scountry of origin (1948, Article 13), yet there is no corresponding right to enter another country. This sophomore seminar considers the consequence ofthis tension with attention to normative questions of who should be allowed entry to and citizenship within (other) states. In addition, we explore theempirical complexities that inform and result from these judgments. This seminar privileges states, laws (domestic and international) and actual policyover the last sixty years, with particular attention to North America and Western Europe - key destinations for migrants and thus crucial laboratories toinvestigate the myths, realities, policies and consequences of immigration. At a time when there are growing pressures for increased immigration inWestern Europe (e.g., most recently the Arab Spring), we conclude by noting recent developments within the European Union to harmonize asylum andimmigration policies. We ask - what are the ethical challenges and what might the future look like?Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlySEMN210/"
MUSC 207L,"istening Across Cultures What does it mean to be a knowledgeable music listener? An expert listener? A nativelistener? Hip hop has its "heads," French opera had claqueurs, and Syrian tarab has the sammi'a (expert listeners), but is the act of listening the sameacross cultures, or is there something to the local perception of music that goes beyond style and genre? Questioning the adage that "Music is theuniversal language," this course will examine how people assign meaning and power to music. Analyzing music from around the world, we will attuneour ears to the ways in which people across cultural borders conceptualize music, sound and the act of listening. No music reading or basic theoryknowledge is required. Prerequisite: Sophomores onlySEMN211Crossing Cultures: How It Works We are generally unaware of ourselves as cultural beings until our own cultural values andpractices "clash" with someone else's. By studying various aspects of Intercultural Communication, by reading books and seeing films about interculturalencounters, by learning techniques for observing and interpreting other cultures, and, finally, by reflecting on these experiences, we can betterunderstand culture and anticipate how our own cultural products and behaviors might be perceived by members of other cultures - whether abroad or athome.

What is the relationship between Christianity and the various approaches to kinship and family indifferent cultures in different historical contexts? Where did our contemporary ideas about the family come from and what are Christians saying aboutnew forms of kinship? From the Bible to present day debates about divorce, sex, and same sex marriage, Christians have never embraced a singleunderstanding of the family, but rather have been influenced by broader cultural shifts in how kinship is donePrerequisite: Sophomores OnlySEMN/ARTX214Framing Difference This course will combine research and studio components, split more or less evenly. The research topic,broadly painted, will be fine art documentary practices, grounded with an entry-level hands-on studio component (using both film and digitalphotography). There are two motivations for this course: to give students creative control of photographic tools (technical, formal, conceptual) prior totheir leaving for study away, but also to explore the issues and ethics of photographic documentary practice.

However,these are highly contested concepts. This course introduces some theoretical clarity with respect to their conceptual grounding, history andcontemporary practice. Our primary focus will be on different philosophical theories of human rights, with secondary attention to international humanrights law. We start with an orientation on human rights practice and try to move past some of the so-called "challenges" to human rights. This isfollowed by a look at the main contemporary approaches for conceptualizing human rights: the basic human-interest approach, the capabilities approachand the newer "political" approach (among others). We will spend a few weeks on various debates within the human rights literature as well: Whetherthere is such a thing as "group rights", whether and how there is a distinction between civil and political human rights on the one hand versus social andeconomic human rights on the other, when human rights violations might trigger external, international intervention, etc. Prerequisite: Sophomores OnlySEMN/CLAS216Making History?

Just what thismeans to Western and non-Western cultures is at the heart of this course. What does it mean to think of Shakespeare as a colonizing force? Whatadditional ways are there to see the influence of his works? Many cultures have written back to Shakespeare, addressing race, sexuality, gender, andreligion from their own cultural perspectives. What do exchanges between differently empowered cultures produce and reproduce? We'll tackle suchquestions as we read works by Shakespeare and literary/film adaptations from around the globe. And, closer to home, how do different communities inthe United States receive and write back to Shakespeare? How do issues of race and class, especially, affect access to Shakespeare? A servicelearning project with the Intensive Learning Center of the Kalamazoo County Juvenile Home will allow your students there, and our class, to considerthose questions.
