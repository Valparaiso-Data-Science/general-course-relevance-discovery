SC 2963,"42016-172NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS UNDER THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include:1.The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access.A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. (2)The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violationof the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.A student who wishes to ask the University to amend a record should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.Note: The challenge of a student under this paragraph is limited to information which relates directly to the student and which the student asserts is inaccurate or misleading. With regard to a student’s grade, this right does not permit the student to contest a grade on the grounds that a higher grade is deserved, but only to show that the grade has been inaccurately recorded.(3) The right to provide written consent before the University discloses personally identifiable information from the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. The University discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or sup-port staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); contractors, consultants, volunteers and other outside parties to whom the institution has outsourced institutional services or functions instead of using University employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsi-bilities for the University.Upon request, the University also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.(4)The right to refuse to permit the designation of any or all of the following categories of personally-identifiable information as directory information,which is not subject to the above restrictions on disclosure: student’s full name, permanent address and telephone number, local address and telephonenumber, e-mail address, Clemson identification number (the number that begins with a C on the student ID card and is also referred to as a student's XID), username, state of residence, date and place of birth, marital status, academic class, class schedule and class roster, name of advisor, major field of study,including the college, division, department or program in which the student is enrolled, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weightand height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance and graduation, degrees and honors and awards received including selection to a dean’s listor honorary organization and the grade point average of students selected, and the most previous educational institution attended. Photographic, video,or electronic images of students taken and maintained by the University are also considered directory information.Directory information may be disclosed by the University for any purpose, at its discretion. Any student wishing to exercise his/her right to refuse to permit the designation of any or all of the above categories as directory information must give written notification to the Registration Services Office (E-206 Martin Hall) by the last day to register for the enrollment period concerned as published in the Clemson University calendar.(5)The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements ofFERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 MarylandAvenue, SW, Washington, 4-5124 Phone: 864-656-2287 FAX: 864-656-2464Transfer CreditCoursework completed with a grade of C or better at other regionally accredited institutions, including correspondence courses, telecourses, on-line courses, and exempted courses, will be evaluated for transfer credit. This does not guarantee that all courses taken at other institutions will be accepted for transfer. The acceptability of each course or exemption will be determined through an evaluation by the Office of Admissions, and will be based on content, level, comparability to Clemson courses, and applicability to Clemson degree requirements. Transfer courses are evaluated as a direct Clemson equivalent, elective credit, or not college transferable credit. Subject area electives are listed on the transfer course summary as 1999, 2999, 3999 or 4999. Courses that do not have direct Clemson equivalencies may possibly be substituted for required courses in a degree program with approval of the student’s major advisor. Ques-tions about how a course has been evaluated should be directed to the department responsible for teach-ing the course. If a course does not have a direct Clemson equivalency, the following abbreviations are used: 4. Office hours are Monday-Friday 8:00am-4:30pm.2016-1722FINANCIAL AID The Office of Student Financial Aid administers and coordinates various types of undergraduate financial aid administered by Clemson University: scholar-ships, loans, grants, and work-study employment.

Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. There-fore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.I. Academic Integrity PolicyA. Any breach of the principles outlined in the Academic Integrity Statement is considered an act of academic dishonesty.B. Academic dishonesty is further defined as: 1. Giving, receiving, or using unauthorized aid, including the inappropriate use of electronic devices, on any work submitted to fulfill academic require-ments. In examination situations all electronic devices must be off and stowed unless otherwise authorized by the instructor; 2. Plagiarism, which includes the intentional or unintentional copying of language, structure, or ideas of another and attributing the work to one’s own efforts; 3. Attempts to copy, edit, or delete computer files that belong to another person or use of computer accounts that belong to another person without the permission of the file owner or account owner;C. All academic work submitted for grading or to fulfill academic requirements contains an implicit pledge and may contain, at the request of an in-structor, an explicit pledge by the student that no unauthorized aid has been received.D. It is the responsibility of every member of the Clemson University community to enforce the Aca-demic Integrity Policy.II. Academic Integrity CommitteeThe power to hear cases of academic dishonesty is vested in an Academic Integrity Committee. A. Structure—The Academic Integrity Committee is composed as follows: 1. Two tenured faculty members from each college elected by their respective collegiate faculties. Faculty members will be elected on a staggered term basis, serving for a period of two years after initiation of staggered terms. Terms commence with fall semester late registration. 2. Two undergraduate students from each college. Student members are nominated by the Student Body President, through an application and inter-view process in the spring semester, approved by the Student Senate, and appointed by the provost for terms of two years. Students must have a 3.0 grade-point average at the time of appointment and must have completed 30 hours by the end of the spring semester. Nominations will be made in the spring semester with terms of service commencing with fall semester late registration. 3. The committee is divided into four standing hearing boards, which will hear the cases of academic Academic Regulations 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements2016-17312016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  Academic Regulationsdishonesty. Hearing boards convene on a weekly, rotational basis unless there are no cases to be heard. For summer sessions, the Associate Dean of Under-graduate Studies must maintain at least one hearing board to hear cases. 4. Hearing boards are composed of two faculty members, two students, and one chairperson. Quo-rum, for a hearing board, is one student, one faculty member, and a chairperson. Decisions by the hearing board will be by majority vote. 5. Chairpersons will be elected from within the Committee’s membership. Two chairpersons are selected from the faculty membership and two from the student membership.  6. Before hearing any cases, a new member of the committee must undergo a training session(s) with the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. 7. The Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies is the administrative coordinator of the Academic Integrity Committee.B. Procedures 1. When, in the opinion of a course instructor, there is evidence that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, that person must make a formal written charge of academic dishonesty, includ-ing a description of the misconduct, to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The reporting per-son may, at his/her discretion, inform each involved student privately of the nature of the alleged charge. In cases of plagiarism (I.B.2.) instructors may use, as an option, the Plagiarism Resolution Form available from the Office of Undergraduate Studies. 2. When, in the opinion of a student, there is evidence that another student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, he/she should contact the instructor for the course to discuss the incident. After being contacted, if, in the opinion of the instructor, there is evidence that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the instructor must make a formal written charge of academic dishonesty, includ-ing a description of the misconduct, to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The instructor may, at his/her discretion, inform each student involved privately of the nature of the alleged charge. 3. If, for any reason, the person who first discovered an integrity violation is not available to present a charge, the department chair (or designee) or college Associate Dean for the department in which the course is taught may submit the charge to the Associ-ate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. 4. When the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies has received a formal charge of an alleged violation, he/she will contact the student involved privately to notify him/her of the charge and will provide the student with a copy of the charge and a copy of the procedures that the Academic Integrity Committee has adopted, pursuant to number 7 be-low. If a student is charged with academic dishonesty, he/she may not withdraw from the course unless he/she is exonerated of the charge. If a student is found in violation of the academic integrity policy and receives a forgivable grade, he/she will not be al-lowed to have that grade forgiven under the Academic Forgiveness Policy. If the student fails to respond to the Associate Dean’s requests for a meeting within ten university working days, the student is considered to have waived his/her right to a hearing, thus admit-ting to being in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy. 5. After informing the student involved, the Associ-ate Dean of Undergraduate Studies will convene one of the boards of the Academic Integrity Committee within 14 calendar days (exclusive of University holidays) from the date that the accused student pro-vides a written rebuttal to the charge. The student will provide the rebuttal no later than five university working days following notification of the charge from Undergraduate Studies. (Students charged in the spring term, but not enrolled in summer sessions, may be given a continuance to the next fall term. Should the University schedule be interrupted due to emer-gency circumstances, academic integrity cases will be resolved as soon as possible once classes resume.) All students will be presumed not in violation of a charge until found in violation by a hearing board. Each party is responsible for having present at the hearing all witnesses that he/she wishes to speak on his/her behalf. Witnesses must have first-hand knowledge of the events under discussion. 6. A charge of academic dishonesty in a course must be made within thirty days after the beginning of the next term, exclusive of summer vacation. For cases that are not resolved before course grades are due, instructors will assign an Incomplete as a placeholder for the grade. This Incomplete grade will be replaced with the course grade once the case is resolved. 7. The Academic Integrity Committee will adopt its procedures, to be followed by all hearing boards, prior to the first case heard by a hearing board. In addition to providing the student with a copy of the proce-dures, as stated in number 4 above, the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies will provide a copy of the procedures to the involved course instructor and also the hearing board members. The Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies will also retain copies of these procedures. The procedures must afford both instructors and students the opportunity to present their cases and the opportunity for rebuttal. 8. In cases in which there is a finding of “in violation,” the course instructor may consult with the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies to consider any past precedent established regarding academic penalties levied in similar cases. Instructors must inform the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies of the academic penalty for a student found “in violation” by a hearing board. 9. The Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for notifying the registrar and all other appropriate University personnel of the finding of “in violation” and the academic penalty. The Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies retains all records of academic dishonesty cases and their findings in accordance with the University’s Records Retention Policy.C. Penalties 1. Upon a finding of “not in violation” by a hear-ing board, the student’s record will not reflect the incident. 2. Upon a finding of “in violation” by a hearing board, the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Stud-ies will notify the student and course instructor of the decision immediately. If the offense is the first for the student, then the instructor has the ability to determine the academic penalty, which shall not exceed a grade of F for the course.  3. If the finding of “in violation” is not the stu-dent’s first offense, the student will receive a grade of F in the instance of coursework, and, in all cases, will be suspended from the University for one or more full semesters, and may be permanently dismissed from the University. The hearing board will determine the period for which the student will be suspended or, if applicable, permanently dismissed. If the ac-cused student waives his/her right to a hearing and the incident is not a first offense, the student will receive a grade of F in the case of coursework and, in all cases, will be suspended from the University for one or more semesters or will be permanently dismissed, at the discretion of the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. 4. An undergraduate student who has been suspended from the University for a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy becomes immediately ineligible for University merit or need-based scholar-ship or grant aid for the remainder of the student’s undergraduate at Clemson. (See complete policy in Financial Aid section, page 22.)D. Appeals 1. Students do not have the option to appeal a decision rendered by the hearing board, whether it is the first, second, or any subsequent offense. Stu-dents do not have the option to appeal the penalty determined by the course instructor for first offenses or to appeal the grade of F for the course given for second offenses. 2. For offenses resulting in suspension of two or more semesters or permanent dismissal, students have the option to present written information to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to appeal the length of the suspension or to appeal a decision of permanent dismissal. Students must present informa-tion in their defense, as allowed in this paragraph, to the Dean within five university working days after receipt of written notification of the suspension or dismissal. However, as stated in number 1 above, students cannot appeal a decision rendered by the hearing board.ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE POLICYI. PurposeClemson University is dedicated to the fair and impartial review of grievances by students against faculty and staff. The Academic Grievance Board is responsible for reviewing and adjudicating allegations by undergraduate students of unfairness or inequity in the assigning of final grades. Only grievances that contest a final grade are considered by the Academic Grievance Board.II. StructureThe Academic Grievance Board comprises three separate entities: an Academic Grievance Panel, an Academic Grievance Committee, and an Academic Grievance Expedited Committee.The Academic Grievance Panel is responsible for the initial review of grievances and for determining which grievances will go forward to the Academic Grievance Committee (see section IV.4 below). There are faculty representatives to the Academic Grievance Panel from each college. The faculty members of the Academic Grievance Panel are appointed by the 2016-1732Dean of Undergraduate Studies for three-year terms. In addition, there are two undergraduate student representatives to the panel appointed for two-year terms. Undergraduate student representatives are selected on a rotating basis from each of the col-leges. The student representatives are appointed to the Academic Grievance Panel by the President of the Student Senate. The Academic Grievance Panel will elect a chair each year, chosen from among the faculty members on the Academic Grievance Panel.The Academic Grievance Committee is responsible for hearing student grievances, proposing resolutions to grievances, and, in the case of appeals, forward-ing recommendations to the Dean of Undergradu-ate Studies. Grievances are heard by three-person subcommittees, appointed by the Chair of the Academic Grievance Committee. The Academic Grievance Committee may hear a grievance only if a recommendation for a hearing is made by the Academic Grievance Panel. The Academic Grievance Committee consists of faculty representatives, three from each college, and student representatives, two from each college. Faculty representatives are elected by their colleges and serve three-year terms. Student representatives are appointed by the President of the Student Senate and serve two-year terms. The Chair of the Academic Grievance Committee is appointed by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.Before hearing any cases, a new member of the Academic Grievance Board must undergo a training session(s) with the Associate Dean of Undergradu-ate Studies.The Academic Grievance Expedited Committee is responsible for hearing certain grievances for stu-dents that are to be graduating in the same semester the contested grade is presented to the committee (see section V). The Academic Grievance Expedited Committee comprises the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, and two available members (one faculty, one student) of the Academic Grievance Committee. The Academic Grievance Expedited Committee will only follow the procedure established under “Supplementary Procedure for Graduating Seniors” (see section V below).III. Grounds for Academic GrievancesThe Academic Grievance Board provides for hearings on academic grievances that are based on either or both of the following claims:A. The method used for arriving at a student’s final grade was in clear violation of the method described in the instructor’s course syllabus.B. The method used for arriving at a student’s final grade was in clear violation of departmental, college or university policy. The Academic Grievance Board will not attempt to substitute its judgment for an instructor’s on such mat-ters as a) quality of the instructor’s teaching, b) quality of the student’s work, or c) quality of course content. The Academic Grievance Committee shall not hear any grievances including allegations of discrimina-tion based on age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran’s status even if the grievance falls within one of the categories noted above. All such discrimination complaints should be submitted to the Office of Ac-cess and Equity in 110 Holtzendorff, 656-3181. The Academic Grievance Committee shall refer any such discrimination complaints it receives to the Office of Access and Equity.IV. Rules and Procedures for Academic Grievances 1. Any student filing a grievance must first attempt to resolve it by consulting with the involved faculty member. In the event that the student and faculty member cannot arrive at a resolution, the student shall consult with the department chair of the faculty member and the Dean of the college of the faculty member. The department chair and Dean shall make every effort to help the student and the faculty member arrive at a resolution to the problem. Until a formal complaint is filed, the student may consult with the Undergraduate Student Ombudsman. 2. If the grievance remains unresolved, the stu-dent may bring the grievance before the Academic Grievance Board. The student must first meet with the Associate Dean in the Office of Undergraduate Studies. The Associate Dean will describe the griev-ance process to the student. If the student wishes to proceed with the grievance, the student will provide a written statement detailing the grievance to the As-sociate Dean. The written statement must specify the specific syllabus, departmental, college or university policy that the student alleges to have been violated. In addition, the student will secure, from the Office of Undergraduate Studies, a grievance checklist form. On this form, identified by complaint number, the student will document the following: (a) the dates of those consultations described in procedure IV.1 above, (b) the names of those persons consulted, and (c) the signature of the collegiate Dean attesting that no resolution could be reached. The completed checklist form will then be returned to the Associate Dean for signature. Both the written statement and the completed checklist form must be delivered to the Office of Undergraduate Studies within the first 30 calendar days (exclusive of summer vacation) of the term following that in which the student alleges to have been aggrieved. The failure of a student to file a grievance within the 30-day period will cause him/her to forfeit his/her right to file a grievance under this procedure.  3. When all procedures described in item IV.2 have been completed, the Office of Undergraduate Studies will forward a copy of the grievance to the chair of the Academic Grievance Panel. The chair of the Academic Grievance Panel shall, upon receipt of the grievance, convene the Academic Grievance Panel to review the grievance. The Office of Undergraduate Studies shall retain the original documents. 4. The Academic Grievance Panel will review the grievance and ascertain whether the complaint meets the criteria for “Grounds for Academic Grievances” (III above). The Academic Grievance Panel will handle each case in a confidential manner.  5. Following the complaint review, the Academic Grievance Panel, within 14 days of receiving the complaint, will (a) make a written recommendation to the Associate Dean to dismiss the grievance, with the grievance identified by complaint number, or (b) make a written recommendation to the Academic Grievance Committee to hear the grievance and arrive at a recommendation. In the case that the Academic Grievance Panel recommends that the grievance be heard by the Academic Grievance Com-mittee, a copy of the recommendation, identified by complaint number, will be forwarded to the Office of Undergraduate Studies. 6. If the Academic Grievance Panel recommends dismissal of the case, the Associate Dean will notify the student, the involved faculty member, the depart-ment chair of the involved faculty member, and the involved collegiate Dean. 7. If the Academic Grievance Panel recommends a hearing, the Chair of the Academic Grievance Com-mittee shall, upon receipt of the recommendation from the Academic Grievance Panel and all relevant documents, appoint a three-person subcommittee to hold a hearing on the grievance. The subcommittee will be selected from among the members of the Aca-demic Grievance Committee. The subcommittee will consist of a faculty member assigned to serve as the subcommittee chairperson, another faculty member, and a student representative to the subcommittee. If possible, the subcommittee shall include members who are not in the same college as the grievant or the faculty member against whom the grievance has been filed.  8. Prior to a hearing (see item 9 below) a repre-sentative of Undergraduate Studies will contact the student who has filed the grievance as well as the faculty member against whom the grievance has been filed. Undergraduate Studies will provide copies of the grievance to both parties, answer any procedural questions that the parties have, and also ask each party if they have anything to add to the written record prior to the hearing. If additional written materials are submitted prior to the hearing, copies will be distributed to all subcommittee members and to all parties to the grievance. The subcommittee will, to the extent possible, handle each case in a confidential manner. 9. Academic Grievance hearings shall convene at a standardized location and time, as defined by the Office of Undergraduate Studies. The hearing shall take place during the next available standard meeting time after the subcommittee has received the necessary materials. 10. The hearing of the grievance will be informal and shall be closed to the public. The Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies shall, as facilitator, take whatever action is necessary to ensure an equitable, orderly and expeditious hearing. All parties to the grievance shall be given an opportunity to be heard. In addition, the chairperson may request the presence of any other person who can supply information per-tinent to the grievance. Witnesses shall not be present during the hearing proceedings except when they are called to speak before the committee. The parties shall be permitted to question all individuals who are heard by the committee. If any witness is unable to be present at the hearing, the chairperson may, at his/her discretion, accept a written statement from that witness to be presented at the hearing. The parties shall be accorded the right to assistance of counsel of their own choice; however, counsel shall not be permitted to participate actively in the proceedings. 11. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the subcom-mittee shall reach, by majority vote, a posed solution to the grievance. The subcommittee chairperson shall then formulate the findings in writing. Copies of the written findings and recommended solution will be forwarded to both parties to the grievance for acceptance. Each party will be asked to indicate Academic Regulations 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements2016-17332016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  Academic Regulationsacceptance of the posed solution within 14 calendar days of its date. Failure to respond within 14 calendar days will constitute acceptance. In the event that both parties agree to a change in grade, the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies will also notify the Office of Records and Registration of the decision.  12. If, after the conclusion of the hearing on the grievance, acceptance of the posed solution cannot be secured, the grievance shall be referred to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. When grievances are referred in this manner, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, on behalf of the University, shall make the final deci-sion on the solution to the grievance and will then notify the student, the involved faculty member, the department chair of the involved faculty member, the involved collegiate Dean, and the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies of the University’s final deci-sion. In the event that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies decides in favor of a change in grade, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies will also notify the Office of Records and Registration of the University’s decision. 13. To the extent permitted by law, the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies shall keep in confi-dence all records pertinent to grievances. 14. The Academic Grievance Committee shall make every reasonable effort to resolve each grievance by the end of the semester that follows the semester in which the student received the grade that is being contested (summers not included).  15. These procedures can be changed by the Aca-demic Council. Such changes shall not affect any case under consideration at the time of the change. Notification of any changes to the procedure shall be given to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies of the University via the Academic Council.V. Supplementary Procedure for Graduating SeniorsThe purpose of this supplementary procedure is to offer an expedited method for graduating students to file an academic grievance that would impact their ability to graduate, as determined by the Dean of Un-dergraduate Studies. To be eligible for the following procedure, the student must file an academic griev-ance with the Office of Undergraduate Studies no later than noon the day after final grades are posted. The following procedure shall be made available for Fall, Spring, and Summer graduations. 1. Any student filing an expedited grievance should first attempt to resolve it by consulting with the in-volved faculty member. Until a formal complaint is filed, the student may consult with the Undergradu-ate Student Ombudsman. 2. In the event that the student and faculty member cannot arrive at a resolution, the student may bring the grievance before the Academic Grievance Expe-dited Committee. The student must first meet with the Associate Dean in the Office of Undergraduate Studies. If the student wishes to proceed with the grievance, the student will provide a written state-ment and grievance checklist form (IV.2 above). 3. The student and involved faculty member shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing by 6:00 pm, two days prior to graduation. Hearings will begin at 2:00 pm, one day prior to graduation. In the case that the involved faculty member cannot attend the hearing, he or she may appoint an appropriate representative. 4. Hearings shall follow the same format as estab-lished in IV. 10. 5. Following the hearing, the Academic Grievance Expedited Committee shall vote on a proposed resolution. A majority vote constitutes as a passed resolution. This decision is final, and the student and involved faculty member will be notified of the resolution. In the event that the Academic Grievance Expedited Committee decides in favor of a change in grade, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies will also notify the office of Records and Registration of the university’s decision.ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT BY FORMER STUDENTSIt is possible that an act of academic misconduct will remain undiscovered until after a degree is awarded. In such a case, Clemson University reserves the right to revoke any degree based on new revelations about scholarly issues including, but not restricted to, admissions credentials, all forms of coursework, research, theses, dissertations, or other final projects.I. Submission of Fraudulent Admissions CredentialsThe submission of fraudulent admissions credentials in the student’s application or any other documents submitted for admission to Clemson University may result in initiation of action under the Policy and Procedure on Revocation of Academic Degrees.II. Academic Dishonesty in CourseworkA. In the event that the act is alleged to have occurred within the context of a course and is consistent with the general definition of academic dishonesty presented in Sections I of the Academic Integrity Policy, the same procedures in that policy will apply except for academic misconduct listed in III below.B. Graduate Students—If the resulting penalty is either the assignment of a grade of D or F in a re-quired graduate course, or the issuance of any grade that causes the student not to possess a cumulative B average in both graduate courses and in all courses, action under the Policy and Procedures on Revoca-tion of Academic Degrees may be initiated.C. Undergraduate Students—If the resulting penalty causes the student to no longer have the necessary credit hours, coursework, or grade average for receiv-ing a degree, action under the Policy and Procedures on Revocation of Academic Degrees may be initiated.III. Falsification of Data and Plagiarism in Theses, Dissertations, or Other Final ProjectsData falsification, plagiarism (as defined in the Aca-demic Integrity Policy) and other acts of academic dishonesty in a thesis, dissertation, or other final project are serious acts of misconduct. Allegations of this type of misconduct may result in initiation of action under the Policy and Procedure on Revocation of Academic Degrees.REVOCATION OF ACADEMIC DEGREESPreambleAcademic institutions have a critical responsibility to provide an environment that promotes integrity, while at the same time encouraging openness and creativity among scholars. Care must be taken to ensure that honest error and ambiguities of interpretation of scholarly activities are distinguishable from outright misconduct. This policy is applicable to fraudulent or other misconduct in obtaining an academic degree which is so egregious that a mechanism for revoking an academic degree, either graduate or undergradu-ate, must be undertaken. The Clemson University Board of Trustees has the sole authority to revoke any degree previously awarded.DefinitionsAs used herein, the following terms shall apply:A. When the degree holder was an undergraduate student: 1. “Dean” shall mean the Dean of the academic college where student was enrolled. 2. “Committee of Investigation and Recom-mendation” shall be composed of the members of the standing University Undergraduate Academic Eligibility Appeals Committee. An undergraduate student will be appointed to the Committee of In-vestigation and Recommendation by the President of the Student Body within ten (10) calendar days of notification by the President of the Faculty Senate. Any member of the Academic Eligibility Appeals Committee who is a faculty member in the depart-ment which awarded the degree involved shall not be a member of the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation for that particular investigation. If there are fewer than three (3) non-disqualified faculty members, the President of the Faculty Senate shall appoint additional faculty members to bring the number of faculty committee members up to three (3). If the President of the Faculty Senate is from the same department that awarded the degree involved, the President-Elect of the Faculty Senate shall appoint the additional member. B. When the degree holder was a graduate student: 1. “Dean” shall mean the Dean of the Graduate School. 2. “Committee of Investigation and Recom-mendation” shall be composed of the members of the standing University Graduate Admissions and Continuing Enrollment Appeals Committee, except for the Associate Dean of the Graduate School who shall not be a member of the Committee of Investiga-tion and Recommendation. A graduate student will be appointed to the Committee of Investigations and Recommendation by the President of Graduate Student Government within ten (10) calendar days of notification by the President of the Faculty Sen-ate. Any member of the Graduate Admissions and Continuing Enrollment Appeals Committee who is a faculty member in the department which awarded the degree involved shall not be a member of the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation for that particular investigation. If there are fewer than three (3) non-disqualified faculty members, the President of the Faculty Senate shall appoint additional faculty members to bring the number of faculty committee members up to three (3). If the President of the Faculty Senate is from the same 2016-1734department that awarded the degree involved, the President-Elect of the Faculty Senate shall appoint the additional member.ComplaintAn allegation or complaint involving the possibility of misconduct can be raised by anyone. The allegation should be made in writing to the Dean.Initial ReviewThe Dean will conduct the initial review to determine whether or not the allegation has merit. The Dean may discuss the matter with the former student’s advisory committee (if any) and other faculty as appropriate. The Dean may also contact persons outside the University who may be able to provide factual information on the alleged misconduct or who may otherwise have expertise concerning issues involved in the alleged misconduct. If the Dean de-termines that the allegation has no merit, he/she will terminate the investigation. If the Dean determines that serious academic misconduct is suspected, the Dean will notify the President of the Faculty Senate in writing in a confidential manner. The Dean shall also notify the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost of the charge but will not discuss any details of the charge.Committee of InquiryThe President of the Faculty Senate shall, within (10) calendar days of receipt of the notification from the Dean, appoint three (3) faculty members to the Committee of Inquiry and notify the President of Graduate Student Government or the President of the Student Body, as appropriate, who shall appoint a graduate or undergraduate student, as appropriate, to the Committee of Inquiry within ten (10) calendar days of notification. The President of the Faculty Senate shall also notify the degree holder of the formation of a Committee of Inquiry.If the Faculty Senate President is from the same department that awarded the degree involved, the President-Elect of the Faculty Senate shall appoint the Committee of Inquiry. The faculty members will be appointed from departments which did not award the degree involved. The Committee will elect its chair-man from the faculty members on the Committee.For each allegation, the Committee of Inquiry will review the complaint and any other information provided by the Dean and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a formal charge of academic misconduct and further investigation under this policy. While the Committee of Inquiry shall not make a recommendation as to whether a degree should be revoked, the purpose is to provide a review to separate frivolous, unjustified or mistaken allegations from those requiring a more detailed and formal investigation. The Committee of Inquiry will review the evidence and must determine that the al-leged misconduct more probably than not occurred in order for the committee to recommend a formal charge and further investigation.Within thirty (30) calendar days of the formation of the Committee of Inquiry, the Committee of Inquiry will submit a written report to the President of the Faculty Senate. If the Committee of Inquiry’s report finds that the investigation should not proceed, the President of the Faculty Senate shall terminate the investigation and notify the appropriate persons. If the Committee of Inquiry’s report finds that a formal charge and further investigation are warranted, the President of the Faculty Senate shall, within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the report of the Commit-tee of Inquiry, send a copy of that report to the Dean and to the Committee of Investigation and Recom-mendation. The President of the Faculty Senate shall also immediately notify the President of Graduate Student Government or President of the Student Body (whichever is appropriate) that a student repre-sentative needs to be appointed to the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation. The President of the Faculty Senate shall also notify the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost of the Committee of Inquiry’s recommendation. No details of the charge will be discussed. Note: A majority vote of the Committee of Inquiry is necessary to recom-mend that a formal charge and further investigation are warranted. A tie vote means that the investigation is terminated as stated herein. Notification to Degree HolderThe Dean shall issue in writing, within ten (10) cal-endar days of receipt of the report of the Committee of Inquiry, a formal charge of academic misconduct to the degree holder. This written notice shall detail the factual allegations for the charge and the evidence supporting the charge. This written notice shall also inform the degree holder that if the charges are substantiated, the degree holder’s degree could be revoked. This written notice shall also inform the degree holder of his/her right to appear at a hearing as stated in this policy. The Dean shall also send with this notice a copy of this Policy and Procedure on Revocation of Academic Degrees to the degree holder. This notice shall be delivered to the accused in person or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.Committee of Investigation and RecommendationThe Committee of Investigation and Recommenda-tion shall extend to the degree holder the following process:1.

Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.The degree holder and the Dean shall be permitted to offer evidence and witnesses pertinent to the issues.The Dean shall present the case against the accused first. The accused shall then present his/her response.The chair will allow each party to ask questions of the other party and will allow each party to ask ques-tions of the other party’s witnesses at the appropriate time during the hearing as determined by the chair. Members of the committee may ask questions of any party or any witness at any time during the hearing.Within fifteen (15) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation shall submit a written report to the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost. The report shall contain findings and a recommendation as to whether the degree holder’s degree should be revoked. The Committee of Inves-tigation and Recommendation must find clear and convincing evidence that serious academic miscon-duct has been committed in order to recommend the revocation of the degree holder’s degree. If the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation does not find clear and convincing evidence of serious academic misconduct, the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation cannot recommend revocation of the degree holder’s degree and the matter shall be closed. Note: A majority vote of the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation is necessary to recommend the revocation of a degree holder’s degree. This means that a tie vote will result in the matter being closed.At the same time that the report is sent to the Execu-tive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost, the chair of the Committee of Investigation and Recommendation shall send a copy of the report to Academic Regulations 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements2016-17352016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  Academic Regulationsthe degree holder, the Dean, and other appropriate persons involved in the process.If the Committee of Investigation and Recommenda-tion recommends that the degree holder’s degree be revoked, the chair shall also send a complete copy of the hearing record to the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost.

An emergency can be related to the threat of an actual, impending, or imminent emergency, such as a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, a campus shooting, or the outbreak of an epidemic such as e-coli. An emergency can also be a situation in which a student gives sufficient, cumulative warning signs that lead the school official to believe the student may harm himself at any moment.The FERPA recordkeeping requirements require the University to record 1) the articulable and significant threat that formed the basis for the disclosure and 2) the parties to whom the information was disclosed. This record will demonstrate what circumstances led to the determination that a health or safety emergency existed and how the disclosure was justified. The record must be made within a reasonable period of time after the disclosure was made. The record must be maintained with the education records of the student for as long as the student’s education records are maintained.

Inasmuch as the educational process necessitates change, the information and educational requirements in this catalog represent a flexible program that may be altered where such alterations are thought to be in the mutual interest of the University and its students.The provisions of this catalog do not constitute a contract that may be accepted by students through registration and enrollment in the University. The University reserves the right to change without no-tice any fee, provision, offering, or requirement in this catalog and to determine whether a student has satisfactorily met its requirements for admission or graduation. The University further reserves the right to require a student to withdraw from the University for cause at any time.Each curriculum shall be governed by the require-ments in effect on the date of enrollment. If a student withdraws from the University and subsequently returns or does not remain continuously enrolled (summers excluded), the requirements in effect at the time of return will normally prevail.STUDENT RESPONSIBILITYAll colleges and departments establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. Advisors, department chairs, and deans are available to help the student understand and meet these requirements; but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. If, at the end of a student’s course of study, the requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with all academic requirements throughout their college careers and to be responsible for completing all requirements within prescribed deadlines and time limits.VISION STATEMENT Clemson University will be one of the nation’s top-20 public universities.MISSION STATEMENT Clemson University was established to fulfill our founder’s vision of a “high seminary of learning” to develop “the material resources of the State” for the people of South Carolina. Nurtured by an abid-ing land grant commitment, Clemson has emerged as a research university with a global vision. Our primary purpose is educating undergraduate and graduate students to think deeply about and engage in social, scientific, economic, and professional chal-lenges of our times. The foundation of this mission is the generation, preservation, communication, and application of knowledge. The University also is committed to the personal growth of the individual and promotes an environment of good decision mak-ing, healthy and ethical lifestyles, and tolerance and respect for others. Our distinctive character is shaped by a legacy of service, collaboration, and fellowship forged from and renewed by the spirit of Thomas Green Clemson’s covenant.UNIVERSITY DESCRIPTION Clemson University is a selective, public, research university in a college-town setting. Clemson’s desire is to attract a capable, dedicated and diverse student body of approximately 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students, with priority to students from South Carolina. The University offers a wide array of high quality baccalaureate programs built around a distinctive core curriculum. Graduate, continuing education, doctoral and research programs contrib-ute to the state of knowledge and to the economic future of the state, nation and world. The University provides bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in more than 100 majors.Clemson combines the benefits of a major research university with a strong commitment to under-graduate teaching and individual student success. Students, both undergraduate and graduate, have opportunities for unique educational experiences throughout South Carolina, as well as in other countries. Experiential learning is a valued compo-nent of the Clemson experience, and students are encouraged through Creative Inquiry, internships, and study abroad, to apply their learning beyond the classroom. Electronic delivery of courses and degree programs also provide a variety of learning opportunities. Clemson’s extended campus includes teaching sites in Greenville and Charleston, five research campuses, and five public service centers throughout the state of South Carolina, as well as four international sites.The University is committed to exemplary teaching, research and public service in the context of general education, student engagement and development, and continuing education. In all areas, the goal is to develop students’ communication and critical-thinking skills, ethical judgment, global awareness, and scientific and technological knowledge. The distinctive character of Clemson is reflected in the culture of collegiality and collaboration among faculty, students, staff, the administration, and the university board.HISTORYWhen one man of wisdom and foresight can look be-yond the despair of troubled times and imagine what could be, great things can happen. That is what the University’s founder, Thomas Green Clemson, was able to do in the post-Civil War days. He looked upon a South that lay in economic ruin, once remarking that “conditions are wretched in the extreme” and that “people are quitting the land.” Still, among the ashes he saw hope. Joined by his wife, Anna Calhoun Clemson, Mr. Clemson envisioned what could be possible if the South’s youth were given an opportu-nity to receive instruction in scientific agriculture and the mechanical arts. He once wrote, “The only hope we have for the advancement of agriculture (in the U.S.) is through the sciences, and yet there is not one single institution on this continent where a proper scientific education can be obtained.” When he was president of the Pendleton Farmers Society in 1866, Mr. Clemson served on a committee whose purpose was to promote the idea of founding an institution for “educating the people in the sciences” and “which will in time secure permanent prosperity.”When he died on April 6, 1888, a series of events began that marked the start of a new era in higher education in the state of South Carolina, especially in the study of science, agriculture, and engineering. Mr. Clemson’s passing set the stage for the founding of the university that bears his name—the beginning of a true “people’s university,” which opened the doors of higher education to all South Carolinians, rich and poor alike. In his will, which he signed November 6, 1886, Mr. Clemson bequeathed the Fort Hill planta-tion and a considerable sum from his personal assets for the establishment of an educational institution of the kind he envisioned. He left a cash endowment of approximately $80,000, as well as the 814-acre Fort Hill estate, to South Carolina for such a college. The biggest obstacle in the creation of an agricultural college—the initial expense—was removed by Mr. Clemson’s bequest.On November 27, 1889, Governor John Richardson signed the bill accepting Thomas Clemson’s gift. Soon after, a measure was introduced to establish the Clemson Agricultural College, with its trustees becoming custodians of Morrill Act and Hatch Act funds made available for agricultural education and research by federal legislative acts. The founding of Clemson Agricultural College supplanted the South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanics in Columbia, which had been designated in 1880.Thomas Green Clemson came to South Carolina when he married Anna Maria Calhoun, daughter of South Carolina’s famous statesman John C. Calhoun. Born in Philadelphia, Mr. Clemson was educated at schools both in the United States and France, where he attended lectures at the Royal School of Mines, studied with prominent scientists in the private laboratories of the Sorbonne Royal College of France, and received his diploma as an assayer from the Royal Mint in Paris. Mr. Clemson, then in his mid-20s, returned to America greatly influenced by his European studies. He became a great advocate of the natural sciences, achieving a considerable reputation as a mining engineer and a theorist in agricultural chemistry. He also was a gifted writer whose articles were published in the leading scientific journals of his day, an artist and a diplomat who represented the U.S. government as chargé d’affaires to Belgium for almost seven years.Mr. Clemson had a lifelong interest in farming and agricultural affairs. He served as the nation’s first superintendent of agricultural affairs (predecessor to the present secretary of agriculture position) and actively promoted the establishment and endowment of the Maryland Agricultural College in the 1850s. Though remembered today for these accomplish-ments, Thomas Clemson made his greatest historical contribution when, as a champion of formal scien-tific education, his life became intertwined with the destiny of educational and economic development in South Carolina. Although he never lived to see it, his dedicated efforts culminated in the founding of Clemson Agricultural College.At the time of his death, Mr. Clemson was living at the Fort Hill homeplace, which today is a national historic landmark and provides a historic centerpiece for the Clemson University campus. He had inher-ited the house and plantation lands upon the death of Mrs. Clemson in 1875.2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  General Information2016-178Clemson College formally opened in July 1893, with an enrollment of 446. From the beginning, the college was an all-male military school. It remained this way until 1955, when the change was made to “civilian” status for students and Clemson became a coeducational institution. In 1964, the college was renamed Clemson University as the state legislature and the state courts formally recognized the school’s expanded academic offerings, Ph.D. granting status and research pursuits. On November 27, 1989, the University observed the 100th anniversary of the state’s acceptance of the terms and conditions of Mr. Clemson’s bequest.The enrollment of Clemson has grown from 446 students at the opening of the University to 22,689 for the first semester 2015-2016. Since the opening of the University, 130,227 students have been awarded bachelor’s degrees. During this same period, 426 associate degrees, 36,579 master’s, 506 education specialist, and 4,595 doctor’s degrees have been awarded, a total of 172,333 degrees.Today, more than a century later, the University is much more than its founder ever could have imagined. With its diverse learning and research facilities, the University provides an educational op-portunity not only for the people of the state, as Mr. Clemson dreamed, but for thousands of young men and women throughout the country and the world.THE CAMPUSThe 1,400-acre Clemson University campus is sited on the former homestead of statesman John C. Calhoun. Nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and adjacent to Lake Hartwell, the cam-pus commands an excellent view of the mountains to the north and west, some of which attain an altitude of over 5,000 feet above mean sea level.The Norfolk and Southern Railway and U.S. high-ways 76 and 123 provide easy access to the city of Clemson and to the University. Oconee County Airport is four miles from the library. Both Atlanta and Charlotte are two hours driving time away.Campus architecture is a pleasing blend of tradi-tional and modern facilities enhanced by a beautiful landscape of towering trees, grassy expanses, and flowering plants. Academic, administrative, and student service buildings on campus represent an insured value of $627 million. Clemson University’s real estate holdings include more than 32,000 acres of forestry and agricultural lands throughout the state, the majority of which are dedicated to Clemson’s research and public-service missions.Fort Hill, the former home of John C. Calhoun in-herited by Thomas Clemson, and the Hanover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places and are open to the public. The campus also has two recognized historic districts.The Strom Thurmond Institute houses the institute offices, Senator Thurmond’s papers and memo-rabilia, and the special collections of the Cooper Library, including papers of John C. Calhoun and James Byrnes, two of the most important South Carolinians since 1787. The institute is a part of an instructional and public-service district that includes the Brooks Center for the Performing Arts and the Madren Center for Continuing Education. Clemson offers limited graduate and undergradu-ate coursework in Greenville, SC. Also located in Greenville is the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR), a 250-acre advanced-technology research campus where university, industry and government organizations collaborate.ACCREDITATIONClemson University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award bachelor’s, master’s, education spe-cialist, and doctoral degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Clemson University.Curricula are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), Accrediting Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), American Council for Construction Education, Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND), American Society of Landscape Architects, Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP, formerly NCATE), National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), National Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Recreation and Park Association Council on Accreditation (NRPA), Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available in the college deans’ offices.ADVISING POLICYAcademic advising is an on-going educational process that connects the student to the University. Academic advising supports the University’s mission of prepar-ing the student for learning beyond the confines of the academy. Academic advisors represent and interpret University policies and procedures to the student and help the student navigate the academic and organizational paths of the institution.To ensure that students receive both personal and professional assistance in navigating through cur-ricula and University requirements toward degree completion and graduation, each student is assigned to an academic advisor (either professional or faculty advisor). Advisors are available to assist students with issues related to degree planning, course selection, withdrawals, degree requirements, academic policies, academic difficulty, campus resources, internships/practicum opportunities, and career/graduate school planning. Students are responsible for adhering to academic policies, preparing for advising meetings and taking ownership for their educational experi-ence. Students receive academic advising materials from their advisors during pre-registration advising meetings. Students uncertain of their assigned advisor are encouraged to seek assistance from the departmental office/advising center for their major.

Honors students become part of a dynamic academic community dedi-cated to the study of ideas and the life of the mind.Calhoun Honors students are offered the oppor-tunity to take a wide variety of specialized honors courses. These include a series of intensive honors seminars emphasizing multidisciplinary approaches and contemporary issues; and numerous courses satisfying general education, major or minor require-ments. Honors students are also encouraged to pursue research-based programs leading to depart-mental honors.Freshman admission to Calhoun Honors College re-quires the submission of an application separate from and in addition to the application for undergraduate admission to Clemson University. In addition to the student’s application, the Honors College requires a copy of the student’s high school transcript and two letters of recommendation, one from a high school guidance counselor and one from a teacher. Admission is highly selective and is based, in part, on the quality of the applicant pool and the availability of space for freshmen in the Honors College.Currently-enrolled Clemson students may apply for membership if they are full-time, degree-seeking undergraduates and have earned a cumulative grade-point average of 3.50 or higher. In general, students must have at least four semesters remaining to com-plete their degree requirements. Additional special opportunities for honors stu-dents include study programs in Brussels, Belgium, Strasbourg, France, and Berlin, Germany; EUREKA!, a summer research program for entering freshmen, and the Dixon Fellows Program, which promotes cultural and intellectual engagement with leading faculty members. Each of these programs is competi-tive and requires a separate application.The Calhoun Honors College is institutionally responsible for nationally competitive fellowships and awards, including Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater and Fulbright.In addition to the intellectual challenge of Honors, advantages of membership include priority course scheduling, honors residential college (on a space-available basis), extended library loan privileges, a series of discussion programs, and special lectures and cultural events. Visit www.clemson.edu/cuhonors for more information.COOPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMThe Cooperative Education Program (Co-op) is an academic engaged-learning program and is one of three units which comprise the Center for Career and Professional Development. The program provides students with an opportunity to alternate semesters of academic study with semesters of paid, discipline-specific experience as they work and learn under mentors in their fields of study. Co-op assignments add a contextual dimension to the curriculum and challenge students to think critically and creatively as they engage in problem-solving activities and projects within the work setting. Through this program, companies serve as teaching partners of the University and the co-op experience becomes an integral part of the student’s education. The student’s experience is closely monitored/evaluated by the program’s academic staff throughout his/her participation. Cooperative Education, as the term implies, represents a collaborative effort between the University and participating companies.Students may qualify for the Cooperative Education Program after satisfactorily completing 30 credit hours of academic coursework and declaring a major. Transfer students may qualify after one semester of coursework at the University. Students normally enter the program as sophomores or juniors and com-plete from two to five rotations in a co-op assignment. Engineering majors must do a minimum of three rotations to complete the program. Participation in the program is a curricular requirement for some majors, such as Packaging Science. Packaging Science students normally complete two back-to-back co-op rotations during a six-month period.Students enrolled in the program register for the appropriate co-op course number (e.g. "
COOP 1010,", 1020, etc.) for each rotation and receive a grade of Pass or No Pass. Students receive academic recogni-tion on the transcript for each co-op course, although no credit hours are awarded. Students pay a program participation fee each academic term that coincides with a co-op rotation/course. In responding to ques-tions about student status related to health insurance, taxes, loans, etc., the University classifies a student on a co-op rotation as a full-time continuing student. Additional information is available at http://career.clemson.edu/cooperative_education/ or by calling 864-656-3150. The program shares space with its partner, the Michelin Career Center, located on the third floor of the Hendrix Student Center.2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  General Information2016-1710INTERNSHIP PROGRAMSAn internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates classroom knowledge with career-related work experience. Internships can be a vital link between college majors and the exploration of profes-sional opportunities. Students are able to participate in on-campus internships, domestic internships, and international internships. Specific requirements vary depending on the type of internship and a student’s major. Internships are typically offered for a specific period of time during the spring or fall semesters (14-16 weeks) or during the summer (10-14 weeks). Depending on the type of internship, students are strongly advised to begin their searches at least four to eight months in advance. Students are also advised to contact their departments, visit with a career counselor, or attend a workshop at the beginning of each semester in order to determine all available internship opportunities.Departments/MajorsInternships typically involve a structured project with a professional mentor that relates to a student’s major or career interests. Credit bearing internship courses may be available through a student’s academic col-lege or department. Some majors may also require students to complete an internship as part of the curriculum. Further inquiries about departmental internship requirements should be directed to the specific department.Center for Career and Professional DevelopmentThe Center for Career and Professional Development offers a variety of services to help students identify internship experiences. In addition to providing counseling and resources that aid in the internship search process, the Center also offers a three-credit international internship course ( Cooperative Education42016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences2016-1752Junior YearFirst Semester3 - "
INT 3010,"), and part-time and full-time, zero-credit internship courses (which are denoted on students’ academic transcripts). The full-time INT courses allow students to maintain their University enrollment status while interning. Students enrolled in off-campus intern-ships must register for the appropriate course and section number (e.g. "
INT 2010,") for each rotation to receive a grade of Pass or No Pass. Students pay a participation fee each academic term that coincides with an internship rotation. Additional information is available at http://career.clemson.edu or by calling 864-656-6000.UPICThe University Professional Internship and Co-op (UPIC) Program offers students on-campus professional learning experiences. Students have the opportunity to work with Clemson faculty and staff on Clemson’s main campus, as well as other sites across the state, while receiving an academic internship notation on their transcripts. Enrollment in the appropriate INT course and payment of the corresponding fee is a requirement of the program (e.g. "
INT 1510,"). In order to be eligible for the pro-gram, a student must have completed at least one full semester at Clemson University and be an enrolled and matriculating undergraduate student in good standing. Available internships are typically listed in ClemsonJobLink halfway through the semester prior to the experience. Additional information is available at http://career.clemson.edu or by calling the program office at 864-656-0282. CLEMSON ABROADPROGRAMSThrough the Clemson Abroad Office, students may choose from a variety of study abroad programs, Clemson faculty-directed programs, and Clemson sponsored exchange programs. Program length ranges from short-term, such as during spring break, to a summer session, to a full semester or year abroad. Programs vary to fulfill the academic and discipline-specific needs of students. There are programs for every academic major at Clemson. Exchange programs are available with top institutions around the world, such as The University of Aberdeen in Scotland; Bond University and University of Newcastle in Australia; and University of Strathclyde in United Kingdom. Programs are available in virtu-ally every country in the world: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and many more. Both Clemson sponsored programs and exchange programs allow students to enroll and pay fees di-rectly to Clemson while they study abroad. Transfer credit normally applies within the major with prior academic department approval. Financial aid and scholarships also transfer for many of the programs abroad. International internships and co-op programs are also available. Students should plan early for their study abroad experience. First priority application dead-lines are usually in September/October for spring programs, in February/March for fall, academic year, and summer programs. Interested students should contact the Clemson Abroad Office, E-301 Martin Hall, at the beginning of each semester and throughout the academic year to explore opportuni-ties abroad. Additional information is available at www.clemson.edu/studyabroad or by e-mailing abroad-l@clemson.edu.RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPSAir Force and ArmyThe departments of the Air Force and the Army maintain ROTC units at Clemson University. Their mission is to produce officers of high quality for technical and nontechnical careers in the U.S. Air Force and Army. Two-, three-, and four-year programs are available. The four-year program consists of the basic course for freshmen and sophomores and the advanced course for juniors and seniors.Scholarships, available to selected ROTC students, pay for tuition, books, and laboratory expenses, in addition to a variable stipend ranging from $300–$500 (depend-ing on their group) per month during the school year. Nonscholarship advanced Cadets also receive a stipend. Basic course credit may be awarded to students having prior military service. Reserve or National Guard duty can be guaranteed by the U.S. Army.Cadets who complete the Advanced or Professional Course and satisfy commissioning requirements are appointed Second Lieutenants.

Further, transfer students may select any curriculum adopted subsequent to that initial curriculum. After enrolling at Clemson, if a transfer student changes from one major to another, the student will complete all of the requirements included in the new curriculum that are in effect at the time of the change. If all coursework toward a degree is not completed within six years after the initial enrollment at the sending institution, the stu-dent may be required to complete additional courses.GENERAL INFORMATION Entrance ExaminationsAll freshman candidates and some transfer students must submit scores from either the SAT or ACT. For August enrollment, it is recommended that students complete the SAT or ACT no later than the preceding December. Registration materials for these tests are readily available at high schools or by contacting the College Board at 609-771-7600 or 1-800-SAT-SCOR or www.collegeboard.com or the American College Testing Service at 319-337-1313 or www.act.org. The College Board’s institutional code for Clemson is 5111. The ACT code for Clemson is 3842. All candidates must have their scores reported directly to Clemson by con-tacting the appropriate testing agency. Photocopies of student test reports or those submitted by third parties, such as high schools and colleges, are not accepted.International Baccalaureate (IB) Credit PolicyClemson University endorses the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program and awards credit for IB Higher Level scores as indicated below.College Board Advanced Placement Program The College Board Advanced Placement Program (AP) gives highly motivated high school students an opportunity to begin their college careers during the last year or two of high school. AP participants take college-level courses in high school, sit for  nationally administered examinations in the subjects concerned, and submit test grades to Clemson for credit. Credit is awarded to those earning grades of 3, 4, or 5 on AP exams.Applicants should be sure to include their social secu-rity numbers when registering for AP examinations; this will save time and ensure that credit is automati-cally awarded to their Clemson academic records.Dual EnrollmentDual enrollment courses enable high school students to take college-level courses and earn college credit before graduating from high school. Students should have official transcript(s) sent directly to Clemson’s Admissions Office from the registrar of each college or university where credit was earned. A transcript that states “Issued to Student” is considered unof-ficial. Courses that have previously been evaluated are listed on the Transfer Course Equivalency List (TCEL) at virtual.clemson.edu/groups/tcel. If a student has taken a course not listed on the TCEL, the course will be evaluated by the Office of Admissions once the student has been accepted by Clemson. Students will be notified by letter of the credit they will receive at Clemson before they enroll in the fall.Placement TestsMathematics Placement—All new freshman and transfer students are required to complete the Clemson Mathematics Placement Test (CMPT). Placement in a mathematics course is determined by each student’s CMPT score. Failure to complete the CMPT satisfactorily will result in placement in preparatory work that, in most cases, will not apply toward the general education mathematics require-ment. Placement will be adjusted as appropriate after AP and IB scores or credits for previous mathematics courses have been received by Clemson. Modern Language Placement—The Department of Languages offers placement tests that students are required to take during summer orientation. Any student who has had at least one year of a modern language and who decides to continue with the same language at Clemson, must take one of these tests. Applicants desiring advanced placement in a modern language may take the College Board’s SAT Subject Test, Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations, or the International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level Ex-amination. SAT Subject Test scores of 450 or higher enable students to exempt one or more language courses. These students will receive credit following the successful completion (grade of C or better) of a qualifying course at Clemson.

Credit loads for all other undergraduate students are determined in consultation with the student’s academic advisor, who will approve a credit load deemed in the best interest of the student based on such factors as course requirements, grade-point average, participation in other activities, and expected date of graduation.For fall, spring and summer terms, 19 is the maxi-mum number of hours in which a student may enroll during early registration (16 hours is the maximum credit load for those on probation). On the day before classes begin for a term, the maximum number of hours for all students, except those on probation, is automatically raised to 21 credits. Permission of a student’s academic advisor is required for all registration in more than 21 hours, or 16 hours for those on probation. Students are not permitted to enroll in courses with overlapping class times.Full-Time Enrollment In fall and spring semesters, enrollment in 12 or more credit hours is considered full time, and combined enrollment in 12 or more hours in summer terms is considered full time for the summer. Enrollment in fewer than 12 credit hours is part time.Advanced Placement and Credit by Examination In addition to earning credit by the usual method involving classroom attendance, a student may re-ceive credit toward his/her degree by completing a course successfully by examination only. Freshmen interested in exempting some elementary courses in this manner should participate in the College Board Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate program and have the results of these tests sent to Clemson. Certain departments will also grant credit for suc-cessful completion of College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) subject examinations, which are administered by the College Board. Enrolled students may earn credit by means of a special examination without the necessity of class attendance subject to the following requirements:1. The applicant must present evidence that he/she has received training or taken work which is approximately equivalent to that given in the course at Clemson for which an examination is requested. 2. The applicant must not have previously failed or audited the course at Clemson.3. The applicant must apply in writing for the exami-nation; the request must be approved by the instruc-tor, chair of the department in which the course is taught, and the Enrolled Student Services Office. Application forms are available in the Enrolled Student Services Office, 104 Sikes Hall.Credit (CR) will be awarded for acceptable work in lieu of letter grades in recognition of college-level achievement as determined by College Board Advanced Placement Examination, International Baccalaureate Program, College-Level Examination Program subject examination, institutional special examinations, and similar instruments.Transfer Credit Coursework completed with a grade of C or better by currently enrolled Clemson students at other regionally accredited institutions, including corre-spondence courses, telecourses, online courses, and exempted courses, will be evaluated for transfer in terms of equivalent courses included in the Clemson curriculum of the student’s choice. This does not guarantee that all courses taken at other institutions will be accepted for transfer. The acceptability of each course or exemption will be based on an evaluation by the Office of Admissions. Students should obtain approval from the academic advisor for a course prior to enrolling in the course. By obtaining advance approval, the student is assured of receiving proper credit at Clemson upon satisfactory completion of the course. Information and forms relative to this approval may be obtained in the Enrolled Student Services Office, 104 Sikes Hall. Coursework earned at different institutions will not be joined to equate with one Clemson course. No course taken at a nonbaccalaureate-degree granting institution may be used as an equivalent or substitute for any 3000- or 4000-level Clemson course. Relative to academic eligi-bility, graduation, and transcripts, only grades earned at Clemson are used in computing the student’s grade-point average. Grades earned in qualifying (i.e., non-remedial) transfer courses will be used in calculating the student’s grade-point average for South Carolina LIFE Scholarship awards. Non-remedial college classes completed while in high school are also included in this calculation.Learning experiences including, but not limited to, military service schools, non-collegiate sponsored instruction, work-related experiences, etc., will not be evaluated for transfer; however, enrolled students may request credit by examination for any non-transferable learning experience. For additional information, see Advanced Placement and Credit by Examination above.Learning ExperiencesAll “for credit” learning experiences conducted with organizations other than accredited higher education institutions must be regularly supervised by appropri-ate members of the Clemson University faculty or staff. The student must be enrolled at the time the credit is generated, and the level of credit (grade) is the responsibility of the faculty member(s) in the discipline from which the grade originates.External Education ExperiencesIn all “for credit” external educational programs that Clemson University may have with professional, vocational, technical, clinical, and foreign study, the agreements are to be agreed to through signature of the provost and the president. In such cases, learn-ing experiences for which credit is awarded must be under the ultimate control and supervision of Clemson University.GRADING SYSTEMThe grading system is as follows:A—Excellent indicates work of a very high character, the highest grade given.B—Good indicates work that is definitely above aver-age, though not of the highest quality.C—Fair indicates work of average or medium char-acter.D—Pass indicates work below average and unsatisfac-tory, the lowest passing grade.F—Failed indicates that the student knows so little of the subject that it must be repeated in order that credit can be received.I—Incomplete indicates that a relatively small part of the semester’s work remains undone. Grade I is not given a student who made a grade F on his/her daily work. The incomplete grade is calculated as an F in the student’s grade-point average until the work is made up and a final grade is assigned. Instructors and students will resolve the Incomplete grade as soon as possible, but not to exceed thirty days from the first day of classes in the next scheduled session (exclud-ing summer sessions and regardless of the student’s enrollment status). Students will contact instructors in a timely manner so that instructors can provide a reasonable opportunity to complete remaining work. Normally, only one extension for each I may be granted, and this under unusual circumstances. The extension must be submitted by the instructor of the course and will indicate the time limit. (Students under this policy are prohibited from removing the I by repeating the course.) A letter grade of I converts to F unless the incomplete is removed within the time specified.2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements Academic Regulations2016-1726W—Withdrew indicates that the student withdrew from the course or was withdrawn by the instructor after the first two weeks of classwork and prior to the last five weeks of classes, not including the examination period. Proportionate time periods apply during summer and other shortened sessions. For financial aid purposes, enrollment is defined and satisfactory academic prog-ress levels are established as of midnight on the last day to drop without a W grade. Withdrawal can negatively impact financial aid eligibility if a student does not complete a sufficient number of hours. Details are available at www.clemson.edu/finaid.P—Pass or NP—No Pass indicate a student has either passed or not passed a course approved to be taken as Pass/No Pass only. Students are not permitted to optionally take a letter-graded course as Pass/No Pass.Grade-Point Average In calculating a student’s grade-point average, the total number of quality points accumulated by the stu-dent is divided by the total number of GPA hours at Clemson during the semester, session, or other period for which the grade-point average is calculated. For each credit hour, the student receives quality points as follows: A–4, B–3, C–2, D–1. No quality points are assigned for grades F, I, P, NP or W. Dropping Classwork A subject dropped after the first two weeks of class-work and prior to the last five weeks during the fall and spring semesters is recorded as W—Withdrew. Proportionate time periods apply during summer sessions and other shortened sessions.Mid-Term Evaluation Once, near mid-term, but no later than ten days before the last day students can drop courses without receiving final grades, instructors of every undergradu-ate course shall make available for each student (a) that student’s numerical course grade or (b) that stu-dent’s letter ranking to date in that course (A–F or P/NP). More frequent feedback is strongly encouraged.Both student and instructor are to recognize that this feedback reflects the student’s performance up to that point in time, and as such, that student’s final course grade may change based upon subsequent coursework performance(s).The policy includes all undergraduate courses and applies to all terms, including summer sessions.Final ExaminationsThe standing of a student in his/her work at the end of a semester is based upon daily class work, tests or other work, and final examinations. Faculty members may excuse from final examinations all students having the grade of A on the coursework prior to the final examination. For all other students, examinations are required in all subjects at the end of each semester, except in courses in which final examinations are not deemed necessary as approved by the department faculty. Final examinations must be given or due on the dates and at the times designated in the final examination schedule, except in laboratory and one-credit-hour courses for which the final exam will be given at the last class meeting. All courses (including online courses) that specify a standard day of the week and standard meeting time are assigned a final exam date and time during exam week. All courses in regular terms that do not specify a standard day of the week and standard meeting time are not assigned a final exam date and time, and the final exam must be given during examination week at a date and time determined by the instructor. This date and time must be stipulated in the syllabus.Grade Reports Students may access their end-of-term grades online. Academic Eligibility PolicyAll students are expected to study and perform to the best of their abilities. The academic eligibility standards listed below represent minimum levels to remain enrolled at the University. A student who fails to meet these standards is not making satisfactory aca-demic progress and should seek additional assistance from an academic advisor, the Academic Recovery Program, or other appropriate University resources.Academic Eligibility DefinitionsThe following terms identify levels of academic dif-ficulty pertinent to a student’s academic eligibility.Academic Alert: A student who earns a semester grade-point average below 1.5, regardless of cumula-tive grade-point average, is placed on academic alert. No notation concerning academic alert will appear on the student’s permanent record.Academic Probation: A student who fails to main-tain a cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 or higher is placed on academic probation. No notation concerning probation will appear on the student’s permanent record. A student on academic probation may enroll in a maximum of 16 credit hours, unless permission for a higher course load is granted by the academic advisor. Students on academic probation are expected to participate in the Academic Recovery Program.Academic Suspension: A suspended student is ineli-gible to enroll in classes for the fall or spring semester immediately following the suspension notification. Suspension is for one semester only, and the student is eligible to reenroll the following semester.Academic Dismissal: A student who enrolls after a suspension is subject to dismissal at the end of the next semester in which he/she does not meet the academic eligibility criteria listed below. The period of dismissal is for one calendar year and readmission is by appeal only. A dismissed student who is readmitted and again fails to meet academic eligibility standards will be permanently dismissed. Permanent dismissal may not be appealed, and a student permanently dismissed may not apply for Academic Renewal.A student on academic probation for two consecu-tively enrolled semesters is evaluated to determine academic eligibility. Eligibility for continued enroll-ment is evaluated at the end of each semester unless otherwise indicated in this policy. Students with only one complete semester will not be evaluated.The evaluation for academic eligibility is separate from the evaluation for satisfactory academic progress required for Student Financial Aid. Further informa-tion on satisfactory academic progress for financial aid purposes is available in the Financial Information section of this catalog and at www.clemson.edu/finaid.Academic Eligibility StandardsA student on academic probation (cumulative grade-point average below 2.0) will remain academically eligible if one of the following conditions is met.1. The student passes at least 12 credit hours and earns a 2.4 or higher semester grade-point average. Duplicate credits do not count as credits passed unless otherwise required to meet an alternative departmental standard.2. The student achieves the Minimum Cumulative Grade-Point Average (MCGPA) listed below.Total Attempted Hours* MCGPA  16-29  1.75  30-59  1.85  60-89  1.95  90+  2.00*Total Attempted Hours includes all credit hours attempted at Clemson, plus any advanced standing received from transfer credits and credits based on approved examination programs. Only grade points earned at Clemson are used to calculate the MCGPA.3. The student achieves a cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 or higher.Academic Eligibility EvaluationAcademic eligibility criteria are different for students who have completed fewer than three semesters, stu-dents who have completed at least three semesters, students who have been suspended, and students returning on appeal, as described below. Conditions of academic eligibility standards are described in the previous section.1. A student who has completed fewer than three fall and spring semesters will be evaluated at the end of his/her first spring semester, unless he/she entered the university that semester. If the student has two consecutive semesters on academic probation, he/she is eligible to enroll in the subsequent summer and fall semester, but must meet academic eligibility standards at the end of fall semester to avoid suspen-sion for the following spring semester. This term of suspension is not appealable. First time students have three full semesters of eligibility. If a student withdraws for one or more semesters, those semesters are not counted as eligible semesters.2.  After a student has completed three regular (fall and spring) semesters, he/she will be evaluated at the end of each fall and spring semester. If the student has two consecutive semesters on academic proba-tion and fails to meet academic eligibility standards, he/she will be suspended for the next regular (fall or spring) semester. A student subject to suspension at the end of spring semester may enroll in summer school and will avoid suspension if he/she meets academic eligibility standards.Academic Regulations 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements2016-17272016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  Academic Regulations3. A student enrolled after being suspended is evalu-ated at the end of each fall and spring semester until a cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 or higher is achieved. A previously suspended student on aca-demic probation who fails to meet academic eligibility standards will be dismissed at the end of the following fall or spring term for one calendar year and permitted to enroll only as a result of a successful appeal.4. A student permitted to reenroll due to a successful appeal of suspension or dismissal is evaluated at the end of each fall and spring semester until a cumula-tive grade-point average of 2.0 or higher is achieved. A student who fails to meet academic eligibility standards will be suspended or dismissed, according to his/her academic situation.Appealing Suspension or DismissalIn the event a student subject to suspension or dis-missal is unable to achieve one of the above outcomes as a result of extenuating circumstances, the student may file a written appeal with the Appeals Committee on Academic Eligibility. If this appeal is denied, the student may file subsequent appeals for readmission after any subsequent semester. The Appeals Committee on Academic Eligibility meets approximately one week after final examina-tions in May and August. The committee meets in early January to read the appeals of students wishing to enroll for the spring semester. Students should contact the Office of Undergraduate Studies for further information on the appeals process. Appeals will be granted only in the most exceptional cases and may require the student to adhere to additional criteria in order to remain enrolled at the University. Grade ProtestsA student wishing to protest a final course grade must first try to resolve any disagreement with the instruc-tor. If unable to reach a resolution, the student may follow the procedures listed under Academic Grievance Policy. Grievances must be filed within 30 calendar days (exclusive of summer vacation) of the date of the last exam for the term involved.Repeating Courses Passed A student may repeat a course passed with a grade lower than B. Repeating a course graded D or C does not erase the original D or C grade. If a student elects to apply Academic Forgiveness to a course graded D, the Academic Forgiveness Policy below will apply. Otherwise, both grades appear on the record and are computed in the cumulative grade-point average. A course graded C cannot be forgiven. Credit for the same course will be counted only once toward the number of hours required for graduation. For academic eligibility purposes, duplicate credits do not count as credits passed. For financial aid purposes, duplicate credits do not count as credits completed for satisfactory progress. If a student repeats a course passed with grade of B or better, the credits and grade points earned in the repeat attempt will be removed from the cumulative summary.Repeating Courses Failed A student who has failed a course cannot receive credit for that course until it has been satisfactorily re-peated hour for hour in a class; except that in the case of co-related laboratory work, the number of hours to be taken shall be determined by the instructor.Where separate grades for class and laboratory work are given, that part of the subject shall be repeated in which the failure occurs. Successfully repeating a course previously graded F does not erase the original F grade from the student’s record. If a student elects to apply Academic Forgiveness to a failed course, the Academic Forgiveness Policy below will apply. Otherwise, both grades appear on the record and are computed in the cumulative grade-point average.Academic Forgiveness PolicyThe Academic Forgiveness Policy (AFP) allows a student enrolled beginning Fall 2013 or after to elimi-nate from the GPA calculation up to three courses in which a D or F was earned. Students enrolled prior to Fall 2013 who were under the former Academic Redemption Policy will be allowed academic forgive-ness on a modified scale. Detailed information is available at www.registrar.clemson.edu.The following conditions apply:Courses taken prior to fall semester 2003 may not be considered for academic forgiveness. While D or F grades in required courses may be eliminated before the course is repeated, any course used to meet a graduation requirement must be repeated satisfactorily at Clemson University. Both grades will remain on the transcript, degree progress report, and other official documents. For financial aid purposes, courses repeated under this policy resulting in duplicate credit do not count for satisfac-tory academic progress.The AFP shall apply only to courses taken at Clemson University. Course substitutions are not permitted. Students may not invoke the AFP after they have graduated. After graduation, students may repeat coursework, but both grades will be calculated in the grade-point average.The AFP may not be applied to a course taken on a Pass/No Pass basis or to any course in which the student was previously found in violation of the academic integrity policy.Further information on specific questions related to the use of Academic Forgiveness can be found at http://www.registrar.clemson.edu/html/acadFor-giveness.htm.CLASSWORKAcademic Advising Each student is assigned an academic advisor in his/her major area. It is the responsibility of the student to consult with his/her advisor during registration. The advisor will assist the student in scheduling courses so as to fulfill the requirements of the de-gree program; nevertheless, it is the responsibility of the student to fulfill the relevant requirements of the degree. For more information, visit http://www.clemson.edu/academics/advising/.Course Prerequisites Prerequisites for each course are enumerated in the Courses of Instruction section of this catalog. In addi-tion to these requirements, colleges and departments may also establish other standards as conditions for enrollment. It is the student’s responsibility to refer to individual college and curricular information for specific standards. Course SubstitutionsA student may request substitution of a course, whether Clemson credits or transfer credits, for a curriculum requirement in the major, the minor, or General Education. Course substitutions will be applied toward degree requirements only after ap-proval by all the appropriate academic signatories. Students should initiate the request with their as-signed academic advisor using the Form to Request Substitution for an Academic Requirement, available on the Registrar’s website, www.registrar.clemson.edu.All requests for course/requirement substitutions must be submitted and approved as early as possible and prior to the start of the student’s final semester at Clemson University (i.e., the graduation semester). It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the necessary forms have been processed and signed. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the student’s graduation being delayed to at least the following semester.Modern Language RequirementA number of Clemson University degree programs re-quire the completion of a modern language through a specific course level. Modern languages taught at Clemson University or accepted for transfer credit include American Sign Language, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. While many degree programs accept any of these modern languages for the require-ment, certain programs may have specific modern language requirements. Students should consult their program’s curriculum map for details.Attendance Policy The academic resources of Clemson University are provided for the intellectual growth and development of students. Class attendance is critical to the edu-cational process; therefore, students should attend scheduled courses regularly if they are to attain their academic goals.In the event of an emergency, the student should make direct contact with the course instructor, preferably before a class or an exam takes place. Students should speak with their course instructors regarding any scheduled absence as soon as possible and develop a plan for any make-up work. It is the student’s responsibility to secure documentation of emergencies, if required. A student with an excessive number of absences may be withdrawn at the discre-tion of the course instructor.Course instructors must implement fair grading procedures and provide an opportunity to make up missed assignments and examinations that does not unfairly penalize the student when an excused absence is accepted. Such make-up work shall be at the same level of difficulty with the missed assign-ment or examination. Course instructors shall hold all students with excused absences to the same stan-dard for making up missed assignments or examina-tions. While course instructors should seek to make reasonable accommodation for a student involved in University-sponsored activities, students should understand that not every course can accommodate absences and that absences do not lessen the need to meet all course objectives. 2016-1728Absence from class is detrimental to the learning process, so course instructors may use reasonable academic penalties which reflect the importance of work missed because of unexcused absences. Course instructors who penalize students for unexcused absences must specify attendance requirements as re-lated to grading in the course syllabus and must keep accurate attendance records. Course instructors are obligated to honor exceptions to the university atten-dance policy for students covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, as verified through paperwork issued by Student Disability Services.EnrollmentOnly students who are officially registered and have paid appropriate fees may attend classes. Students have the responsibility to insure that drop/add trans-actions are completed in a timely manner. Registered students who cease attending class will be assigned a failing grade. All students are required to attend the first scheduled day of classes and labs. Students who cannot attend the first class are responsible for contacting the instructor to indicate their intent to remain in that class. If a student does not attend the first class meet-ing or contact the course instructor by the second meeting or the last day to add, whichever comes first, the course instructor has the option of dropping that student from the roll. Students must not assume that course instructors are obligated to drop them if they fail to attend the first few days of class. Anticipated AbsencesStudents should use the Notification of Absence module in Blackboard, or other reasonable means, to notify the course instructor of a future absence from class. This communication is only for information and does not verify the student’s reason for absence or impact the course instructor’s evaluation of the student’s academic work. The student must make personal contact with the course instructor as soon as possible.If a student realizes in the first two weeks of classes that an anticipated number of absences will exceed the number of excused absences permitted in the course, the student should discuss the situation with the course instructor, the student’s adviser, and/or the academic Associate Dean in the college in which the student is enrolled. A suitable resolution should be reached before the end of the second week of the semester.Students are encouraged to inform course instructors of known conflicts as soon as possible, but no later than one week before the date of any assignment or exam.Unanticipated AbsencesStudents should use the Notification of Absence module in Blackboard to notify the course instruc-tor. This communication is only for information and does not verify the student’s reason for absence or impact the course instructor’s evaluation of the student’s academic work. If the student is unable to contact course instructors, the student (or repre-sentative) should contact the Office of the Dean of Students, who will notify the course instructors of the circumstances, providing a liaison in cases limited by medical confidentiality. A student may be excused from attending class in cases of emergency or other compelling reasons deemed appropriate by the course instructor. Excuses for emergency absences must be reported to the course instructor as soon as possible (for example, through e-mail), but not more than one week after the return to class. In certain cases, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies (or designee) may provide a letter verifying the student’s absence as excused. Course instructors are expected to excuse absences for reasons including: 1. A medical complication (pregnancy/childbirth-related, physical injury, illness, etc.) too severe or contagious for the student to attend class, when certified by an attending physician. Physicians and staff at Redfern Health Center do not provide written excuses; however, students should retain paperwork of medical visits affirming date and time. Whenever possible, students should visit Redfern as outpatients without missing class. An absence for a non-acute medical service does not constitute an excused absence. Course instructors may, at their discretion, require documentation of medical absences. 2. Death, serious illness, or emergency in a student’s immediate family (course instructors may require documentation).  3. Participation in authorized University-spon-sored activities, not to include practice for the activi-ties. Course instructors may require documentation from the course instructors or staff advisor of the sponsored University group.  4. Religious observances and practices which prevent the student from being present during a class period (advanced consultation/approval by the instructor is necessary).  5. Participation in court-imposed legal proceed-ings (e.g., jury duty or subpoena). 6. Required participation in military obligations as certified by the student’s commanding officer.In the event of a regional or national emergency (e.g., pandemic, hurricane, etc.), students missing classes may not be charged with unexcused absences if the nature and extent of the emergency is defined and disseminated by the Provost (or designee).AppealsAny student who feels that a grade has been affected by a legitimate absence that an instructor did not excuse may appeal the grade through the Academic Grievance process. Students may appeal, in writing, a course instructor’s decision not to excuse an absence to the academic Associate Dean of the academic unit offering the course. Before taking action, the Associ-ate Dean should request that the course instructor explain his or her denial in writing. Dead DaysDuring the last two class days of the fall and spring semesters, commonly referred to as Dead Days, all regularly scheduled classes are conducted; however, course testing on these days is limited to scheduled laboratory and one-semester-hour course final exams and make-up tests. Dead Days are observed during fall and spring semesters only. Dead Days do not apply to courses numbered 6000 or above.Auditing Policies Qualified students may audit courses upon written approval of the instructor. Auditors are under no obli-gation of regular attendance, preparation, recitation, or examination and receive no credit. Participation in classroom discussion and laboratory exercises by audi-tors is at the discretion of the instructor. A student who has previously audited a course is ineligible for credit by examination. Undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in 12 or more hours may audit courses at no additional charge. Others interested in auditing should verify their eligibility through the Registrar’s Office.Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s PlanStudents may reduce the time necessary to earn both degrees by applying graduate credits to both undergraduate and graduate program requirements. To be eligible, the student must have completed the bachelor’s curriculum through the junior year (minimum 90 credits) and have a minimum overall grade-point average of 3.4. A maximum of 12 credit hours of graduate courses in the master’s program may be applied to the bachelor’s program. The combined bachelor’s/master’s degree (documented on GS6BS/MS) must have a minimum combined total of 150 credit hours. This total may contain a maximum of six credit hours of master’s thesis research and all credit hours taken after receiving the baccalaureate degree must be at the 6000 level or higher. As determined by the participating bachelor’s program, graduate courses may be applied to the bachelor’s degree as electives or technical require-ments or by substitution of 7000- or 8000-level courses for required undergraduate courses. Under no circumstances may 6000-level counterparts of 4000-level courses required for the bachelor’s degree be counted toward master’s requirements. Combined bachelor’s/master’s plan students are not eligible for graduate appointments for financial aid until their bachelor’s degrees have been awarded.Procedure for StudentsSince neither all undergraduate nor graduate pro-grams participate in this academic option, seniors should consult both their academic advisor and the graduate program coordinator of the master’s program they wish to pursue. Students must officially request participation in the combined bachelor’s/master’s program by completion of Form GS6BS/MS, “Request for Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s Education Plan,” available online at www.grad.clemson.edu/forms/GeneralForms.php. Endorsements by the program coordinator or department chair of both programs are required.Procedure for DepartmentsDepartments and graduate programs desiring to participate in the combined bachelor’s/master’s program should submit a written notification to the dean of the Graduate School identifying the date on which they intend to make this option available to their students.Academic Regulations 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements2016-17292016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  Academic RegulationsSenior Enrollment in Graduate Courses Clemson University seniors meeting the accepted academic standard for graduate work (3.0 cumulative grade-point average) are eligible to request enrollment in graduate level courses. Enrollment of seniors in any graduate course is subject to approval by the department offering the course and the Graduate School. The total course workload for the semester must not exceed 18 hours, and the cumulative graduate credits earned by seniors shall not exceed 12 semester hours. The credits and quality points associated with senior enrollment in graduate courses will be part of the undergraduate record. Gradu-ate courses that are not satisfying undergraduate requirements cannot be used to meet enrollment requirements for financial aid.Seniors with a 3.4 or Higher GPASeniors with 3.4 or higher grade-point averages are eligible for participation in the combined bachelor’s/master’s plan (see “Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s Plan”). Seniors with a 3.0 or Higher GPASeniors with 3.0 or higher grade-point averages are eligible to request enrollment in graduate level courses to meet requirements for the bachelor’s degree; how-ever, courses used for this purpose cannot be counted later towards an advanced degree. Alternatively, these students may also take courses in excess of the requirements for their undergraduate degrees and may request that these courses be included as a part of their graduate program if they are subsequently admitted to the Graduate School. Courses cannot be taken at the 6000 level if their 4000-level counterparts are required for the undergraduate degree in the same academic major as the proposed graduate degree.Procedure for StudentsPrior to registration, the Graduate School will approve and register the student in the graduate level courses requested on the GS6 or GS6 BS/MS. Senior enrollment forms, GS6, Request for Senior Enrollment, and GS6BS/MS, are available at www.grad.clemson.edu/forms/GeneralForms.php. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS A candidate for an undergraduate degree is a student who has submitted a completed diploma application by the deadline prescribed in the University calendar for a particular graduation date. Candidates who do not apply by the deadline will be subject to a late fee.A student may specify up to two completed majors, two minors, and if applicable, two concentration/emphasis areas per degree when applying for gradu-ation. Second (double) majors and additional fields of study (i.e., minors, emphasis areas or areas of concentration) will not be retroactively added to a student’s record once the degree is conferred.Only candidates who have completed all graduation requirements are permitted to participate in the graduation ceremony. Residence Requirement To qualify for an undergraduate degree, a student must complete through instruction from Clemson a minimum of 37 of the last 43 credits presented for the degree. A waiver may be obtained for approved study abroad experiences through the Undergraduate Studies Office, E-103 Martin Hall.Make-up of Incompletes Received in Last Semester The 30 day makeup period does not apply to candi-dates who receive an I in the semester of graduation. All final grades for candidates must be submitted by the deadline (including all makeup grades for Incompletes) in order for a candidate to graduate on the date of graduation for that semester.Special Requirements A cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 is required for graduation. Candidates for graduation must be officially accepted in the major in which they are ap-plying for a degree no later than the date applications for diplomas are due. Bachelor of Arts degree programs require completion of a minor and four semesters (through 2020) of a modern foreign language.Awarding of Degrees PosthumouslyAn undergraduate student may be awarded a degree posthumously on the recommendation of the faculty of the college concerned, subject to the following conditions:1. The student had at least a 2.0 grade-point average at the date of last enrollment;2. Including credits scheduled in the term of last enrollment, the student (a) had satisfied 75% of the degree requirements and (b) met the residence requirement for a degree, which requires that 37 of the last 43 credits presented for a degree be earned at Clemson University; and3. The student’s death occurred within two years of the end of the term of last enrollment at Clemson University.Credit Limitation If all work toward a degree is not completed within six years after entrance, the student may be required to take additional courses.Academic HonorsHonor Graduates To be graduated with honors, a student must have a minimum cumulative grade-point average as follows: Cum Laude—3.70, Magna Cum Laude—3.85, Summa Cum Laude—3.95.Honor Lists At the end of the fall and spring semesters, the follow-ing lists shall be compiled of undergraduate students who have achieved grade-point averages of 3.50–4.00 on a minimum of 12 semester hours, exclusive of Pass/No Pass coursework. Dean’s List—3.50 to 3.99 grade-point average President’s List—4.00 grade-point averageHonors and Awards The University offers a number of awards for out-standing achievement in specific fields and endeav-ors. Recipients are chosen by selection committees and are announced at the annual Honors and Awards Day program or other appropriate ceremo-nies. Detailed information relating to such awards is available in the offices of the academic deans and department chairs.Preprofessional StudiesClemson University will award the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Preprofessional Studies to a student who is pursuing a degree in a professional school. The student must have also satisfactorily completed three years of undergraduate work in an appropriate curriculum and the first year of work in an accredited medical, dental, veterinary, or other accredited professional school, provided the student fulfills the requirements for the three-year program as follows and the other specified condi-tions are met.1. At least two of the three years of preprofessional work, including the third year, must be taken in residence at this University.2. A minimum of three years of undergraduate work (i.e., preprofessional school credit) must be presented.3. Normal progress must have been made toward fulfilling the degree requirement of the curriculum in which the student is enrolled at Clemson. 4. The student applying for the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Preprofessional Studies must be recommended by the college at Clemson in which the curriculum that he/she is majoring as a Clemson student is located or by the college in which three years of normal progress toward a degree can be identified.5. If the combination of preprofessional work taken and the work in the first year of professional school is equivalent to that which is required in some other bachelor’s degree program at Clemson, the college concerned may recommend the other bachelor’s degree.The above requirements and conditions became effective July 1, 1974, and will apply to all students who satisfy these requirements and conditions after that date.A Clemson student having left the University before receiving the bachelor’s degree (prior to July 1, 1974) and having enrolled immediately in an accredited professional postgraduate school may apply for a bachelor’s degree from Clemson and have his/her application considered on an individual basis. The college(s) at Clemson considering the application is authorized to examine the student’s entire record in both preprofessional and professional studies and exercise its own judgment concerning the three-year requirement for Preprofessional Studies.Second Baccalaureate DegreeTo complete a second baccalaureate degree, a student must complete a minimum of 30 semester hours at Clemson in addition to the greater number of hours required for either degree and satisfy all course and grade requirements for the second degree.2016-1730Double MajorA student in a Bachelor of Arts degree program may be awarded a single baccalaureate degree with a double major. The two majors may be within a single college or may involve two colleges but are limited to Bachelor of Arts degree programs. All major require-ments for both programs must be satisfied.Graduate DegreesGraduate degrees are available from all seven colleges in addition to several interdisciplinary programs. Clemson University offers more than 100 graduate degree programs. The degrees of Doctor of Philoso-phy, Education Specialist, Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Agricultural Education, Master of Architecture, Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Business Administration, Master of City and Regional Planning, Master of Construction Science and Management, Master of Education, Master of Engineering, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Forest Resources, Master of Human Resource Development, Master of Landscape Architecture, Master of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management, Master of Professional Accountancy, Master of Public Admin-istration, and Master of Real Estate Development are awarded to students who complete prescribed graduate programs. Additional information is available from the Gradu-ate School.ACADEMIC RECORDSThe student’s permanent academic record is main-tained in the Registrar’s Office and contains personal identifying information, grades, and credits. Where appropriate, statements of a corrective nature, with-drawals, suspension for failure to meet academic standards, suspension for disciplinary reasons, and graduation data are added. The academic record is a historical record of the student’s academic progress. Classification All new students are classified as freshmen unless they have attended another college prior to entrance. Students who have completed college work elsewhere will be classified on the basis of semester hours ac-cepted at Clemson rather than the amount of work presented. To be classified as a member of any class other than freshman, students must meet the credit-hour requirements below: Sophomore—minimum 30 credit hours  Junior—minimum 60 credit hours  Senior—minimum 90 credit hours Change of MajorAny undergraduate student who meets the Academic Eligibility Policy after attempting 12 credit hours at Clemson University (or who is allowed to continue by virtue of a semester 2.4 grade-point average on 12 earned credits or who is allowed to continue through appeal to the Appeals Committee on Academic Eli-gibility or by other authorization of this committee) may transfer from one major to another. Any college or department that seeks an exception to this policy must have the approval of the collegiate dean and the provost.Withdrawal from the University A student may withdraw from the University subject to the restrictions in the section on W—Withdrew. Prior to the last day to withdraw from the University without final grades, students may withdraw via the iROAR registration portal. All military service or medical withdrawals must be processed by the Associ-ate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Students should report to E-103 Martin Hall. Students receiving financial aid who withdraw from the University may have to repay significant portions of their financial aid. Students should report to G-01 Sikes Hall to determine the amount. For financial aid purposes, enrollment is defined and satisfactory aca-demic progress levels are established as of midnight on the last day to drop without a W grade. Withdrawing from the University can negatively impact financial aid eligibility if a student has not completed a suffi-cient number of hours. Details are available at www.clemson.edu/finaid.Academic Renewal The student who has not enrolled at Clemson for a period of two or more academic years may apply to the Appeals Committee on Academic Eligibility for readmission under special conditions known as academic renewal, unless the student has been permanently dismissed. Under the academic renewal conditions, the previous credits attempted and grade-point deficit will not constitute a liability in a new grade-point computation; however, no credits passed or their attending grade points will be available to the student for a degree at Clemson, and any courses previously passed may not be validated by special examination. The previous record will appear on the permanent record as well as the notation of readmis-sion under the policy of academic renewal. Students returning under the academic renewal policy who apply for financial aid should submit written notifica-tion of their status to the Office of Student Financial Aid in order to update their academic progress record. For financial aid purposes, terms enrolled in prior to academic renewal are still counted when evaluating satisfactory academic progress.Transcripts Official transcripts are issued only at the authorized, written request of the student. Requests should be directed to Transcripts, 104 Sikes Hall, Box 345125, Clemson, , 1020, 10501, 10601, , 1020, and 15 additional credits in Chemistry, at least nine of which must be at the 3000 or 4000 level, selected in consultation with the Department of Chemistry.Chinese Studies (15 credits minimum)A minor in Chinese Studies requires 15 credits selected from 3000- and 4000-level CHIN courses, including  General Chemistry3 -  General Chemistry3 -  General Chemistry3 -  General Chemistry2 -  General Chemistry3 - Arts and Humanities (Non-Lit.)

Official GED score results must be received directly from the General Educational Development Testing Service along with an official copy of the high school tran-script and SAT or ACT scores. Applicants presenting the GED will be reviewed by the Undergraduate Admissions Committee.AppealsAny freshman or transfer candidate who is denied admission may appeal for reconsideration provided the student (1) presents new information, such as improved grades and/or class rank, improved SAT or ACT scores; and (2) submits an on-line appeal form outlining the rationale for the appeal. All appeals will be processed by the Office of Admissions and referred to the Undergraduate Admissions Committee.Freshman students who are accepted to and enrolled in Clemson University in a conditional admissions program through the appeals process must meet the conditions of their admission or be subject to disenrollment.Admission ExceptionsIf it is not possible to make a positive decision on the basis of previous academic performance and SAT or ACT scores, other factors, such as special talents or high school profile, may be considered. Where appropriate, the Office of Admissions will refer such cases to the Undergraduate Admissions Committee. Student athletes who do not meet regular admissions standards may be admitted if they meet Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility requirements.College Board College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) CLEP is designed primarily for adults with nontra-ditional learning experiences. This program has very limited recognition at Clemson. A few departments accept credit for CLEP subject-matter examinations; however, CLEP General Examinations are not recog-nized. Credit is awarded for introductory-level courses according to criteria established by the following departments: Chemistry, English (composition only). Numerical scores plus essays, required when offered as part of a CLEP examination, will be evaluated by the appropriate department. CLEP credit cannot be used to meet admissions requirements.ADMISSION DEPOSITAll accepted freshman and transfer candidates for fall semester are required to submit a nonrefundable $200 admission deposit. This deposit is applicable toward tuition and other University fees and may be paid by credit card.HOUSINGAll freshmen who are under the age of 21 at the time of enrollment, who do not live with parent/guardian(s) [within a 50-mile radius of campus], are required to live in University housing for the fall and spring semesters.For the purpose of this agreement, transfer students are not considered freshmen.

All accepted students are required to attend one of the sessions. During orientation, students will have an opportunity to discuss their educational objectives with an advisor, to register for the fall semester, and to learn about student life and other co-curricular activities. All new students will register for their first semester at Clemson during orientation. For more information about the orientation programs fee structure, visit www.clemson.edu/orientation.International students are expected to attend an additional session, which is conducted by the Inter-national Services office. Additional information is available at www.clemson.edu/administration/ia/services or by emailing is@clemson.edu. International under-graduate applicants for fall semester are encouraged to apply by December 1.INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATES Admission services for undergraduate international students are provided by the Office of Admissions. International students who come from abroad or transfer from another school must meet academic, language, and financial qualifications as determined by Clemson University. Transcripts, mark sheets, and academic records must be verified by a certified U.S. educational consultant agency. Prospective transfer students must provide translated course descrip-tions for coursework to be evaluated for Clemson academic credit. The SAT or ACT is required of all international applicants (freshman or transfer). The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required of applicants from countries where English is not the native language. Financial qualifications are determined by the submission of a financial certification form and bank statements verifying adequate funding. The International Services of-fice provides visa enabling documents and advising services. For more information, visit http://www.clemson.edu/admissions/undergraduate/index.html. For International Student Procedures and Require-ments, visit http://www.clemson.edu/admissions/ undergraduate/requirements/international.html.SPECIAL STUDENT STATUSSpecial students can enroll in a limited number of undergraduate credit hours and are classified with a non-degree status. Examples of special students include: high school students wishing to dual enroll in preapproved courses, individuals wishing to take courses for personal enjoyment and professional de-velopment, and individuals needing prerequisites for professional schools. Students interested in graduate studies at Clemson who need undergraduate prereq-uisite courses should apply non-degree through the Clemson Graduate School. The special student status is not a “trial admission” status and students who have been denied regular undergraduate admission are not eligible.The number of undergraduate credit hours taken in this status may vary by program, but no more than 18 semester hours will be allowed. Once the credit hour limit has been reached, the student must apply to a degree seeking program if he wishes to take additional courses. Applicants should apply online at www.clemson.edu and supporting documents may be requested if needed. Financial aid is not available.READMISSION OF FORMER UNDERGRADUATESUndergraduate students (not special or transient students) who have previously attended Clemson, and are not currently enrolled in the current term and wish to return, must apply online at http://www.regis-trar.clemson.edu/html/formerStu.htm. The Undergradu-ate Application for Re-Admission fee is $25.00 and online instructions for payment are provided in the application. Acceptance letters and registration ma-terials are e-mailed to returning students at the e-mail address provided on the application once the student has been re-accepted. Students who have graduated from Clemson applying as former students return-ing are assigned a program of “Non-Degree Seeking Undergraduate.” These students must complete a Change of Academic Program form through the Office of Enrolled Student Services located in 104 Sikes Hall. Students who have not graduated from Clemson applying as former students returning to continue their undergraduate studies are readmitted into their previous major, but under the catalog year during which they are readmitted. Students with se-nior status—90+ hours—are readmitted into their pre-vious major and the catalog year during which they last attended the University. If a student’s previous major has been discontinued, the student is assigned a program of “Non-Degree Seeking Undergraduate” and must complete a Change of Academic Program form and select a degree-granting program. Students are required to satisfy the University’s general educa-tion requirements in addition to curricular require-ments. Any variations in curricular requirements will be considered under the substitution procedures. If all work toward a degree is not completed within six years after entrance, the student may be required to take additional courses. Other information can be obtained from the Registrar’s Office. Any student who is classified as an in-state student for tuition and fees purposes must reaffirm his or her resident status upon application for readmission to the University. If the resident status of an individual changes, that student will be classified as out-of-state for tuition and fees purposes upon readmission to the University. If the resident status is not immedi-ately clear, the student may be required to submit an application for resident status to the Office of Residency Classification.ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT PROCESSSection 59-101-430 of the South Carolina Code of Laws states:“(A) An alien unlawfully present in the United States is not eligible to attend a public institution of higher learning in this State, as defined in Section 59-103-5. The trustees of a public institution of higher learning in this State shall develop and institute a process by which lawful presence in the United States is verified. In doing so, institution personnel shall not attempt to independently verify the immigration status of any alien, but shall verify any alien’s immigration status with the federal government pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Section 1373 (c).(B) An alien unlawfully present in the United States is not eligible on the basis of residence for a public higher education benefit including, but not limited to, scholarships, financial aid, grants, or resident tuition.”In accordance with section 59-101-430 of the SC Code of Laws, also known as the South Carolina Illegal Immigration Reform Act, the Clemson Uni-versity Board of Trustees hereby institutes the fol-lowing process:I.  PROCESSAll applicants to Clemson University are required to verify on their application whether they are a U.S. citizen, Permanent Legal Resident or will be lawfully present in the United States at the time of enrollment on some other grounds. Enrollment at Clemson University for both undergraduate and graduate students is conditioned upon verification of lawful presence in the United States. South Carolina Code of Law section 59-101-430 prohibits Clemson University from independently verifying the status of any legal alien. An alien’s status must be verified with the federal government. Therefore, Clemson University will use either the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS), a Web-based technology that tracks and monitors schools and programs, students, exchange visitors and their dependents throughout the duration of ap-proved participation with the U.S. education system, or the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, Homeland Security’s online system of alien status determination or any federal source of information about lawful alien presence that becomes available to Clemson University.The Board of Trustees delegates responsibility for administering the details of this process to the Provost and the Office of Academic Affairs.2016 Summer Orientation DatesFreshmen June 13-14June 16-17June 20-21June 23-24June 27-28June 30-July 1July 7-8July 11-12July 14-15New TransferJune 15 (Bridge and Veterans Only)June 22June 29July 132016-1716FINANCIAL INFORMATIONThe annual State Appropriation Act imposes the general requirement that student fees be fixed by the University Board of Trustees. The act imposes two specific requirements on the board: (1) In fixing fees applicable to academic and general maintenance and operation costs, the board must maintain a minimum student fee not less than the fee charged the previous year. (2) In fixing fees applicable to residence hall rental, dining halls, laundry, infirmary, and all other personal subsistence expenses, the Board must charge students an amount sufficient to cover fully the cost of providing such facilities and services.The tuition and fees for all students—full or part time and auditing—are available at www.clemson.edu/cfo/student-financials/. Satisfactory settlement of all expenses is a requirement for completing each semester’s class registration, and no student is officially enrolled until all past due accounts have been satisfied. Financial aid cannot be used to satisfy balances forward from a prior academic year.Currently enrolled students who expect to continue enrollment may sign up for university housing and dining during the first half of the spring semester. For more information visit www.clemson.edu/housing-dining/.Newly accepted students who plan to reside in on-campus housing may sign up at www.clemson.edu/housing-dining/. Please note the freshman housing requirement on page 14. When signing up for uni-versity housing and dining, newly accepted students are required to pay a one-time, nonrefundable hous-ing application fee of $150, and must pay the $200 admission deposit prior to signing up for housing and dining. The admissions deposit is deducted from the amount otherwise due for the first semester expenses. (Note: Policies regarding priority to/offering of on-campus housing are subject to change.)All College of Business majors and all students majoring in Anthropology, Justice Studies, Political Science, Psychology or Sociology, and other non-majors taking 3000- and 4000-level courses offered by the College of Business or the departments of Anthropology, Justice Studies, Political Science, Psy-chology or Sociology, are required to pay a differential fee to fund significant infrastructure and program enhancements. Additional information about this fee is available at http://www.clemson.edu/finance/student-financials/tuition-fees/index.html.TUITION AND FEESDetailed tuition and fee information is available at www.clemson.edu/cfo/student-financials/. Note: A late payment fee will be assessed if fees are not satisfied by published deadlines. Full-Time Fees Students must be enrolled in 12 semester hours to pay full-time fees. Students enrolled in less than 12 hours or who drop below 12 hours may become ineligible for some student services, financial aid, or other programs. Part-Time Fees Students taking less than 12 semester credit hours will be charged according to the schedule at www.clemson.edu/cfo/student-financials/. These fees do not provide for admission to athletic events, concert series, and other such activities. Notice to Customers Making Payment by CheckIf a check is mailed for payment, it may be converted into an electronic funds transfer (EFT). This means a copy of the check will be made and the account information will be used to debit the bank account electronically for the amount of the check. The debit from the bank account will usually occur within 24 hours and will be shown on the drawer’s bank account statement. The original check will not be returned to the drawer. It will be destroyed, but Stu-dent Financial Services will retain a copy of it. If the EFT cannot be processed for technical reasons, the drawer authorizes the University to process the copy in place of the original check. If the EFT cannot be completed due to insufficient funds, the University may try twice more to make the transfer. A returned item fee of $30 will be charged and collected by EFT.Returned Checks, EFTs, and Credit Card PaymentsA check, EFT, or credit card given in payment of University expenses that is returned unpaid by the bank creates an indebtedness to the University. Student Financial Services will re-present returned items for payment of academic fees. A $30 fee will be charged for each returned item. If a check is returned or dishonored for any reason, the student’s account may be debited electronically for the amount of the check plus the $30 returned item fee.If the item is returned to the University in a timely manner with no response from the student or drawer, a written request to disenroll the student will be made to the Registrar. If the request is ap-proved, the percentage of refund will be applied to the debt. If the item is returned after the mid-point of the semester with no response, a decision will be made by the Director of Student Financial Services and the Registrar as to the effect of disenrollment. The University may restrict subsequent payment for academic and other fees by accepting only cash, certified checks, or money orders.Any individual who uses a two-party check for pay-ment of University expenses will be held responsible for that check if it is returned unpaid by the bank. Items used as payment for various University ser-vices such as meal plans, housing, etc., that are later returned unpaid by the bank, give the University the right to cancel such services and cause forfeiture of any refund.Any returned items not collected by the above proce-dures may be turned over to a collection agency, the indebtedness reported to a credit bureau and collec-tion fees will be added to the account. Transcripts and diplomas will be withheld pending payment, and the debt may be deducted from state income tax refunds.Abuse of check payment privileges may result in the restriction of such privileges for an indefinite period of time based on the frequency and/or dollar amount, as determined by Student Financial Services.Past Due Accounts Any indebtedness to the University that becomes past due, immediately jeopardizes the student’s enrollment, and no such student will be permitted to re-enroll for an ensuing semester or summer term. Billing fees and/or collection fees may be added to the indebtedness. Further, any student who fails to pay all indebtedness, including collection fees, to the University may not be issued a transcript or diploma. Unresolved debts may be turned over to a collection agency, reported to a credit bureau, and deducted from state income tax refunds. Debts include, but are not limited to, parking violations, library fines, rent, and academic fees.Refund of Academic Fees (Tuition, University Fee, and Health Fee) for Stu-dents Withdrawing, Dropping to Part Time, or Part-Time Students Dropping Credit Hours No refunds will be made on a semester’s tuition and fees after four weeks from the last day to register. In the case of a withdrawal from the University, refunds will be based on the effective date of the withdrawal. In the case of a withdrawal from a course, refunds will be based on the date the student drops the course using the on-line registration system. To be eligible for a refund, the student’s request must be received by Student Financial Services prior to the beginning of the next fall/spring semester or subsequent sum-mer term.

University housing refunds are made according to the policy above. Meal plan refunds are made on a pro rata basis. Since financial aid is expected to meet or help meet educational costs, any academic fee, housing, or meal plan fee for students withdrawing from the University up to the amount of financial aid received for that semester or summer session, will be refunded to the Financial Aid Program(s) from which the student received assistance. Students receiving Title IV Funds (Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, Federal Perkins, Federal Direct Loans–unsub or sub) or Federal PLUS Loans who withdraw from the University are subject to the Return of Title IV Funds regulations. Students with funds from any of these programs earn their financial aid dollars while enrolled. If a student withdraws prior to completing more than 60% of a term, a prorated portion of the federal financial aid dollars must be considered unearned and returned to the federal pro-grams and could cause students to owe the University a significant amount upon withdrawal.In addition to the amount of federal aid that Clemson must return, students who received financial aid for other educational costs, including off-campus living expenses, may be required to repay a portion of those funds to the federal programs. Failure to return aid owed to the federal aid programs may result in loss of eligibility for federal aid assistance.Federal aid funds to be returned are distributed to the programs in the following order: • Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan • Subsidized Federal Direct Loan • Federal Perkins Loan • Federal PLUS Loan • Federal Pell Grant • Federal SEOG • Other Title IV Programs • Non-Title IV ProgramsAfter the refund has been applied to the Title IV and non-Title IV programs, any refund balance will be refunded to the student.If debts were incurred before withdrawing, such as bad checks, unpaid traffic or library fines, etc., the refund will cover these obligations first. Academic fees, housing, and meal plan refunds for students withdrawing will be paid to the student. RESIDENT TUITION AND FEES Application for Resident Status Any undergraduate student or prospective student whose status concerning entitlement to payment of in-state tuition and fees is uncertain has the respon-sibility of securing a ruling from the University by providing all relevant information on special applica-tion forms. These forms can be obtained online, and are to be completed and returned to that office prior to the first day of class for any semester or summer term for which the student is attempting to qualify for payment of the in-state tuition and fee rate. For more information, visit clemson.edu/financial-aid/residency/index.html. Applications take several weeks to review once all documentation has been submitted. In order to receive a decision by the date bills are due, you must submit your application by the recommended deadlines: June 15 for fall, November 1 for spring, and April 15 for summer.EntitlementEligibility for payment of in-state tuition and fees shall be determined under the provisions of Sections 59-112-10 through 59-112-100, South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976, as amended. This law is set forth in its entirety as follows (subject to further amendment by the General Assembly). The residency office uses the SC Regulations 62-600 through 62-612 and guidance from the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to make determination of an application.The federal government passed Section 702 of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (Choice Act) that required state compliance by July 2015. South Carolina Act 11 allows a student to pay in-state tuition if the student or parent is a veteran discharged within three years of college enrollment. The student must be using his/her or his/her par-ent’s Chapter 30 or 33 veteran’s benefits. Also, the student must document his/her domicile in the state if living off campus. Once approved, the student will be monitored each semester to determine that he/she is still using Chapter 30 or 33 veteran’s benefits. If the benefits are exhausted or are not used, the student will revert to nonresident status. Students paying in-state fees under Act 11 are ineligible for South Carolina state scholarships. The application and instructions can be found on the residency clas-sification website. Statutes59-112-10—Definitions . As used in this chapter: A.

Rates of Tuition and Fees. A. Resident classification is an essential part of tuition and fee determination, admission regulations, scholarship eligibility, and other relevant policies of the state. It is important that institutions have fair and equitable regulations that can be administered consistently and are sensitive to the interests of both students and the state. The Commission on Higher Education hereby establishes regulations for the Statute Governing Residency for Tuition and Fee Purposes to be applied consistently by all South Carolina institutions of higher education. These regulations do not address residency matters relat-ing to in county categories used within the State’s technical colleges. B. Institutions of higher education are required by the Statute to determine the residence classifica-tion of applicants. The initial determination of one’s resident status is made at the time of admission. The determination made at that time, and any determina-tion made thereafter, prevails for each subsequent semester until information becomes available that would impact the existing residency status and the determination is successfully challenged. The burden of proof rests with the students to show evidence as deemed necessary to establish and maintain their residency status.62-601.

Citizens and Permanent Residents. A. Independent persons who have physically resided and been domiciled in South Carolina for twelve continuous months immediately preceding the date the classes begin for the semester for which resident status is claimed may qualify to pay in state tuition and fees. The twelve month residency period starts when the independent person establishes the intent to become a South Carolina resident per Section 62-605 entitled “Establishing the Requisite Intent to Become a South Carolina Domiciliary.” The twelve month residency period cannot start until the absence of indicia in other states is proven. Absences from the State during the twelve month period may affect the establishment of permanent residence for tuition and fee purposes. B. The resident status of a dependent person is based on the resident status of the person who provides more than half of the dependent person’s support and claims or, only in the case of those in-dividuals who are supported by family members who do not earn enough reportable income for taxation purposes, qualifies to claim the dependent person as a dependent for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the residence and domicile of a dependent person shall be presumed to be that of their parent, spouse, or guardian. C. In the case of divorced or separated parents, the resident status of the dependent person may be based on the resident status of the parent who claims the dependent person as a dependent for tax purposes; or based on the resident status of the parent who has legal custody or legal joint custody of the dependent person; or based on the resident status of the person who makes payments under a court order for child support and at least the cost of his/her college tuition and fees.2016-172062-604. Non-Resident Aliens, Non-Citizens, and Non-Permanent Residents. A. Except as otherwise specified in this section or as provided in Section 62-609 (1) & (2), independent non-citizens and non-permanent residents of the United States will be assessed tuition and fees at the non-resident, out of state rate. Independent non-res-ident aliens, including refugees, asylees, and parolees may be entitled to resident, in state classification once they have been awarded permanent resident status by the U.S. Department of Justice and meet all the statutory residency requirements provided that all other domiciliary requirements are met. Time spent living in South Carolina immediately prior to the awarding of permanent resident status does not count toward the twelve month residency period. Certain non resident aliens present in the United States in specified visa classifications are eligible to receive in state residency status for tuition and fee purposes as prescribed by the Commission on Higher Educa-tion. They are not, however, eligible to receive state sponsored tuition assistance/scholarships. B. Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) serves as the primary resource for defining visa catagories.62-605. Establishing the Requisite Intent to Become a South Carolina Domiciliary. A. Resident status may not be acquired by an applicant or student while residing in South Carolinafor the primary purpose of enrollment in an insti-tution or for access to state supported programs designed to serve South Carolina residents. An ap-plicant or student from another state who comes to South Carolina usually does so for the purpose of attending school. Therefore, an applicant or student who enrolls as a non-resident in an institution is presumed to remain a non-resident throughout his or her attendance and does not qualify under any of the residency provisions. B. If a person asserts that his/her domicile has been established in this State, the individual has the burden of proof. Such persons should provide to the designated residency official of the institution to which they are applying any and all evidence the person believes satisfies the burden of proof. The residency official will consider any and all evidence provided concerning such claim of domicile, but will not necessarily regard any single item of evidence as conclusive evidence that domicile has been estab-lished. C. For independent persons or the parent, spouse, or guardian of dependent persons, examples of intent to become a South Carolina resident may include, although any single indicator may not be conclusive, the following indicia: (1) Statement of full time employment;(2) Designating South Carolina as state of legal residence on military record;(3) Possession of a valid South Carolina driver’s license, or if a non-driver, a South Carolina identifi-cation card. Failure to obtain this within 90 days of the establishment of the intent to become a South Carolina resident will delay the beginning date of residency eligibility until a South Carolina driver’s license is obtained;(4) Possession of a valid South Carolina vehicle registration card. Failure to obtain this within 45 days of the establishment of the intent to become a South Carolina resident will delay the beginning date of residency eligibility until the applicant obtains a South Carolina vehicle registrations card;(5) Maintenance of domicile in South Carolina;(6) Paying South Carolina income taxes as a resident during the past tax year, including income earned outside of South Carolina from the date South Carolina domicile was claimed;(7) Ownership of principal residence in South Carolina; and(8) Licensing for professional practice (if applicable) in South Carolina. D. The absence of indicia in other states or countries is required before the student is eligible to pay in state rates.62-606. Maintaining Residence. A. A person’s temporary absence from the State does not necessarily constitute loss of South Carolina residence unless the person has acted inconsistently with the claim of continued South Carolina residence during the person’s absence from the State. The burden is on the person to show retention of South Carolina residence during the person’s absence from the State. Steps a person should take to retain South Carolina resident status for tuition and fee purposes include:(1) Continuing to use a South Carolina permanent address on all records;(2) Maintaining South Carolina driver’s license;(3) Maintaining South Carolina vehicle registration;(4) Satisfying South Carolina resident income tax obligation. Individuals claiming permanent residence in South Carolina are liable for payment of income taxes on their total income from the date that they established South Carolina residence. This includes income earned in another state or country. B. Active duty members of the United States Armed Forces and their dependents are eligible to pay in state tuition and fees as long as they continuously claim South Carolina as their state of legal residence during their military service. Documentation will be required in all cases to support this claim. South Carolina residents who change their state of legal residence while in the military lose their South Carolina resident status for tuition and fee purposes.62-607. Effect of Change of Residency. A. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, any dependent person of a legal resident of this state who has been domiciled with his/her fam-ily in South Carolina for a period of not less than three years and whose family’s domicile in this state is terminated immediately prior to his/her enroll-ment may enroll at the in state rate. Any dependent person of a legal resident of this state who has been domiciled with his/her family in South Carolina for a period of not less than three years and whose family’s domicile in this state is terminated after his/her enrollment may continue to receive in state rates, however, a student must continue to be enrolled and registered for classes (excluding summers) in order to maintain eligibility to pay in state rates in subsequent semesters. Transfers within or between South Carolina colleges and universities of a student seeking a certificate, diploma, associate, baccalaure-ate, or graduate level degree does not constitute a break in enrollment. B. If a dependent or independent person volun-tarily leaves the state, and information becomes avail-able that would impact the existing residency status, eligibility for in state rates shall end on the last day of the academic session during which domicile is lost.

Admission to Business Degree ProgramsTo be eligible for admission into the Bachelor of Sci-ence degree programs in Accounting, Economics, Fi-nancial Management, or Management, students must have completed the courses outlined in the freshman core curriculum and have a cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 or higher. Students wishing to enter the Marketing Program must have completed the fresh-man core curriculum and have a Clemson/Bridge cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or higher. Students should initiate a Request to Change Aca-demic Program form with the College of Business Academic Advising Center in G-02 Sirrine Hall after completing the freshman core curriculum. Students who fail to meet the requirements for admission to a degree-granting business program may remain in Pre-Business until those requirements are met, but only until 64 semester hours of coursework have been completed. Students who exceed 64 credit hours and still do not meet the requirements for admission into a degree program must declare another major. Transfer Credit PolicyFor upper level undergraduates business courses (3000- and 4000-level courses with the rubrics of ACCT, BUS, ELE, FIN, LAW, MGT and MKT) transfer credits will only be accepted from AACSB International and/or EQUIS accredited institutions. Transfer credits from non-US institutions that do not hold either accreditation may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.ROTC PROGRAMSAerospace Studies (AFROTC)Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) is designed to “develop quality leaders for the Air Force.” Students can earn a minor in Aerospace Stud-ies and a commission as Second Lieutenants while pursuing a bachelor’s degree. Clemson’s program has won numerous local and national awards for excellence. The program includes courses in founda-tions of the Air Force, air power history, leadership and management, and national security affairs. In addition to courses, students participate in a weekly leadership laboratory. “Lead Lab” provides students a training environment to practice leadership prin-ciples in a cadet-led Air Force wing. Throughout the program, cadets hone their communication skills through various leadership positions, briefings, and papers. The first year of the program, Foundations of the United States Air Force, introduces students to the Air Force and AFROTC. It provides an overview of the basic characteristics, missions, and organization of the Air Force. The second year, The Evolution of USAF Air and Space Power, features topics on Air Force heritage and leaders; and introduces air and space power through examination of distinct capabilities and functions. The third year, Air Force Leadership Studies, teaches cadets advanced skills and knowledge in management and leadership. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing leadership skills. Cadets have an opportunity to try out these leadership and man-agement techniques in a supervised environment as juniors and seniors. The fourth year, National Security Affairs and Preparation for Active Duty, is designed for college seniors and gives them the foundation to understand their role as military officers in American society. It is an overview of complex social and politi-cal issues facing the military profession and requires a measure of sophistication commensurate with the senior college level. Seniors are also prepared to enter active duty as they transition from student to Air Force Officer. For additional information, contact the Department of Aerospace Studies.Military Leadership (Army ROTC)Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (Army ROTC) is all about leadership. Students that complete the entire program may earn a commission as a Lieuten-ant in the Army Reserve, National Guard, or Active Army. The first two years of the program are open to all students. During the freshman year, the focus is on learning individual leadership skills such as time management, character, values, setting goals, and con-2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements College of Business2016-1790ducting meetings. The sophomore year emphasizes teamwork, team leading, communication/briefings, decision making, team values, and organizational culture and vision. Juniors primarily learn how to plan and conduct training for large groups and are evaluated in leadership positions. Seniors focus on organizational leadership as they plan and run the organization, conduct individual counseling, and evaluate the juniors’ performance in leadership positions. This prepares them for their career as an Army Officer once they graduate. A minor in Military Leadership can be earned by completing the program. Enrollment requires no military obligation until the sophomore year for those on an Army scholarship or the junior year for those without a scholarship. Additional information is available from the Military Leadership Department.ACCOUNTINGBachelor of ScienceThe program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting prepares students for careers as professional accountants. Students completing this program are well prepared to begin professional careers in corporate accounting or internal auditing or to continue study at the graduate level.Students planning to become Certified Public Ac-countants should note that the requirements for certification in South Carolina include 150 hours of collegiate education and completion of a bachelor’s degree. Other states have similar requirements. The faculty of the School of Accountancy believes these requirements are best met with a bachelor’s degree in Accounting and completion of the Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAcc) degree program. The MPAcc program also enhances the preparation of students pursuing accounting careers in areas of specialization such as assurance services and taxation.Admission to the MPAcc program is separate from admission to the undergraduate program. It is based on the student’s undergraduate record and score on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). For information, contact the School of Accountancy, 300 Sirrine Hall.In addition to accounting and business courses, the Bachelor of Science curriculum is devoted to English, public speaking, mathematics, natural and social sciences, and the humanities. Thus, students in the accounting program obtain a broad-based education that not only gives them accounting expertise but also contributes to their proficiency in analytical, communication, and interpersonal skills. Along with the general business accreditation held by the College, the Accounting degree programs offered by the School of Accountancy are separately accredited by AACSB International, the only accrediting agency for accounting programs. Students wishing to change majors into the accounting program must have a 2.0 or higher Clemson/Bridge cumulative grade-point average. Sophomore YearFirst Semester 3 - /1080; and /2070.

Strengths of this program include extensive hands-on instruction at Clemson’s six animal farms, personalized advising, and the opportunity for valued-added experiences, including involvement in research, teaching, exten-sion, international travel, and internships. Students choose from three concentrations. The Animal Agribusiness Concentration prepares students for careers in the many facets of the animal industries, including production, sales and market-ing, business management, advertising, and exten-sion. The Equine Business Concentration prepares students for such professions as trainers, managers, riding instructors, sales or media representatives, breed association representatives or for equine en-trepreneurial careers such as owners of tack shops, boarding facilities, or riding schools. The Preveteri-nary and Science Concentration prepares students to meet the requirements for most veterinary schools, graduate schools, and medical and dental schools. Students with South Carolina residency may compete for contract seats at Mississippi State, Tuskegee, and University of Georgia Colleges of Veterinary Medicine. Experienced preprofessional advising is provided for all students pursuing advanced degrees.Change of Major into Animal and Veterinary Sciences Students who change majors into Animal and Veteri-nary Sciences must have a 2.5 minimum cumulative grade-point average.College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements2016-17452016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life SciencesANIMAL AGRIBUSINESS CONCENTRATIONFreshman YearFirst Semester3 -  Business Calculus I or 4 -  Business Calculus I or 4 -  Business Calculus I or 4 -  Business Calculus I3 - Oral Communications Requirement215College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements2016-17472016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements  College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life SciencesSecond Semester3 -  Business Calculus I or 4 -  Business Calculus I or 4 -  Business Calculus I3 - Oral Communication Requirement115Second Semester3 -  Business Calculus I3 - Oral Communication Requirement115Second Semester3 -  Business Calculus I3 - Business Requirement117Sophomore YearFirst Semester3 -  Business Calculus I or 4 -  Business Calculus I3 - Arts and Humanities (Non-Lit) Requirement117Second Semester3 -  Business Calculus I3 - Oral Communication Requirement115Second Semester3 -  or 1060) by the end of the spring semester of the year the change-of-major request is made.

It is an applied science that integrates principles from physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and other disciplines to better understand the natural processes and human influences that shape our planet. Geology helps people deduce Earth’s natural history, locate natural resources needed to support society, develop sustainable approaches to energy and resource management, and predict, assess, and manage global change and natural disasters.Employment opportunities for geologists are numerous and varied. Examples include environmental and engineering consulting firms, energy exploration and production firms, mineral and metal industries, municipal, state, and federal governments, natural resource conservation organizations, and water authorities. Many students go on to graduate school in the geosciences, environmental sciences, or related fields. Geology is a professional degree and state certification as a Registered Professional Geologist is obtainable. Given the various career options that are possible, students are provided the opportunity to develop a broad range of skills and knowledge within the Geology program. The Geology curriculum provides students with a well-rounded background in geology and related fields and is built around three critical themes: (1) appreciation for spatial and temporal scales, (2) knowledge of earth materials and compositions of environmental systems, and (3) understanding of geological and environmental processes. While providing solid fundamentals within science and engineering, the Geology program is also flexible, allowing students to choose among many electives to tailor their education to specific interests and career goals. The program has been carefully designed to help students develop quantitative and other critical skills, while familiarizing them with the topics, technologies, and resources needed for a variety of career paths in the geosciences. As students progress through the program they have multiple opportunities to enhance their skills of observation, computation, synthesis, communication and problem solving. Because Geology is inherently a field-based discipline, all students are required to take one or more courses that provide them with field experience. All Geology majors also participate in a multi-semester research program that provides them with hands-on experiences conducting geologic research and solving real-world problems in their chosen area of interest. It is also possible for Geology majors to pursue the Engineering Cluster Minor; students interested in this pathway should consult with their advisor early in their program of study. Within the Geology curriculum, students who are particularly interested in environmental or water resources issues may choose to specialize in the Environmental Science Concentration or the Hydrogeology Concentration. These two concentrations provide more structured course pathways through the curriculum and help prepare students for careers in these specific areas. The Environmental Science Concentration in Geology focuses on environmental aspects of geoscience and is well suited for students interested in topics such as environmental policy, natural hazard assessment and remediation, evaluation of land use impacts, understanding geochemical cycles, and environmental systems analysis. This concentration provides a rigorous background in the sciences so that students can scientifically address environmental issues and integrate material from several fields to solve complex environmental problems. The Hydrogeology Concentration in Geology is designed for students who want to specialize in areas such as surface- and ground-water systems, treatment of water and cleanup of contaminated sites, contaminant flow and fluid transport, and water resource sustainability.Freshman YearFirst Semester4 -  Physics with Calculus II3 - Social Science Requirement13 - Hydrogeology Requirement217Junior YearFirst Semester3 -  Physics with Calculus II1 -  Physics with Calculus II3 - Arts and Humanities Requirement1 or 3 - Social Science Requirement117Second Semester 3 -  Physics with Calculus II3 - Arts and Humanities Requirement1 or 3 - Social Science Requirement117Second Semester3 -  Physics with Calculus II15-16Second Semester2 -  Physics with Calculus II1 -  Physics with Calculus II1 -  Physics with Calculus II1 -  Physics with Calculus II1 -  Physics with Calculus II1 - /2230 may substitute.Double Major in Biological Sciences/Science Teaching—Biological SciencesThe Bachelor of Arts Degree in Biological Sciences and Science Teaching–Biological Sciences prepares students for teaching biology on the secondary school level and for graduate studies in any of the life science areas.

Physics is concerned with the fundamental behavior of matter and energy. Classical physics encompasses the fields of mechanics, heat and thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, acoustics and optics. Modern physics is concerned with the study of atoms and molecules, atomic nuclei, elementary particles and the proper-ties of liquids, crystalline solids, and other materials, as well as the areas of relativity, cosmology, and the large-scale structure of the universe. The undergradu-ate Physics curricula provide students with a strong background in the classical areas of physics, as well as an introduction to the more important aspects of modern physics. PHYSICSBachelor of ArtsThe Bachelor of Arts in Physics program is ideal for students interested in acquiring a broad-based liberal education that includes a strong and solid understanding of either science or a broad exposure to engineering with a strong physics foundation.Double Major in Physics/Science Teaching—PhysicsThe Bachelor of Arts Degree in Physics and Science Teaching—Physics prepares students for teaching physics on the secondary school level and for graduate studies in physics.

As such, all classes are offered in the evenings and are delivered online using web-enhanced technologies. Classes are designed to be taken part-time and stu-dents are admitted in the fall and spring of each year. The Youth Development Studies program equips students with the competencies, knowledge and skills necessary to help young people develop into healthy, competent, coping and contributing citi-zens. Through academic coursework and practical field-based experiences, the program integrates posi-tive youth development theory with practical skills needed to design, deliver and assess intentional and effective youth-serving programs. Studies also prepare students for graduate work in a variety of youth-oriented fields, including programs such as Clemson University’s M.S. in Youth Development Leadership. The term “youth development” encompasses a spe-cific set of principles and practices that help to mold and shape the successful developmental processes of school-aged youth. These principles include a focus on building and strengthening the assets of young people, and emphasizing the strengths, abilities and potential of youth. Effective youth development programs are exemplified by supportive adult rela-tionships, healthy and stimulating environments conducive to learning and skill attainment, avail-ability of challenging programs and activities, and ample opportunity to engage young people in the process of their own development. Youth-serving organizations include those whose primary mission focuses on youth development, principally for young people and their families, during out-of-school time hours. Examples include afterschool programs; 4-H, YMCA/YWCA, Boys and Girls Clubs; health, fitness and sports programs; organized camping; mentoring programs; programs for children with disabilities; and faith-based ministries.Program ObjectivesThe B.S. in Youth Development Studies (1) pre-pares entry- and mid-career level professional youth development leaders for careers in agencies, institu-tions, schools, and community organizations that serve youth; (2) enhances youth-serving agencies and organizations by supplying professionals who are competent in child and adolescent growth and development, and who understand the connections between problem-focused and positive youth develop-ment approaches to working with youth; (3) educates and empowers students to focus on strengths and assets within the context of culturally diverse family and community structures that promote positive youth development; (4) identifies and examines physical, emotional, cognitive, environmental and social issues related to being a young person in today’s society, and teaches students to provide program-matic and policy solutions to help solve pressing youth issues; (5) provides ethical leaders with skills necessary to effect change in complex and changing environments in their communities, in the State of South Carolina, and across the nation; (6) prepares students to design, deliver and evaluate intentional, outcomes-focused youth programs and services based on national best-practices; (7) creates a com-munity of scholars and practitioners that enhances professional connections in the youth development field, and provides a forum for the development and maintenance of meaningful collaborations and partnerships with diverse individuals, families and community groups; (8) educates students in orga-nizational behavior and how governance and youth development systems work; (9) prepares students to demonstrate flexibility, resilience, adaptability, car-ing, ethical decision-making and ethical conduct; and (10) connects students to professional development opportunities in youth development for continual growth and lifelong learning.AdmissionStudents who have completed a minimum of 60 credit hours, including all Clemson University General Education credits (33 hours) and approved electives (27 hours), are eligible for admission to the B.S. degree in Youth Development Studies. Students must initiate an application to Clemson University as a transfer student, and must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.5 on all prior college coursework to be eligible for admission. All students accepted into the program are required to attend an on-campus orientation program prior to starting the program. The orientation is designed to build camaraderie among students and faculty, as well as to familiarize students with the online learning technologies that are used to deliver the program.CurriculumAs an upper-level degree completion program, the Youth Development Studies curriculum encompasses only core academic coursework and field experience in youth development and the approved concentra-tion area. All required coursework, including prereq-uisite courses, youth development core courses, and approved concentration area courses, is designed to build a set of core competencies for effective youth work. Required coursework is designed to facilitate the Ten Core Knowledge and Competencies for Afterschool and Youth Development Professionals as outlined by the National Afterschool Association (NAA) and National Institute on Out-of-School Time (NIOST).2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements College of Behavioral, Social and Health SciencesFirst YearFirst Semester3 -  Statistics in Everyday Life 3(3) Focuses on the role of statistics in a variety of areas in-cluding politics, medicine, environmental issues, advertising, and sports.

This course of study seeks to provide students with basic competence in both the relevant language and the literary and cultural heritage pertaining to that language. Moreover, students will be required to take at least two courses in cultural inquiry which are designed to sharpen their sense of cultural difference, to enhance their critical think-ing skills, and to prepare them for citizenship in a global community of diverse cultural precepts and practices. In this respect, the Bachelor of Arts in Modern Languages is intended to prepare students for a wide range of careers in the international arena as well as for the kinds of graduate programs that are an appropriate starting point for such careers.All Modern Languages students are required to study abroad with a Clemson-approved program for at least one semester in the case of Japanese and Spanish or for at least two semesters in the case of French and German.As a condition of graduation, students in the Mod-ern Languages program will be required to pass a noncredit examination and to submit an electronic portfolio in the relevant language to assess their competence in that language.

Practicing landscape architects work on a wide range of project types, including, but not limited to, urban design, com-munity design, historic preservation, ecological res-toration, parks and park systems, infrastructure and storm water management, institutional landscapes, memorials, cemeteries, industrial site reclamations, golf courses, wilderness areas and trails, residential landscapes, and gardens.The profession is both an art and a science. Success-ful landscape architects are creative professionals who hold an environmental imperative and a social conscience. They are also excellent facilitators, able to bring numerous disciplines and professions together to work on complex projects in the landscape. In the first two years of the program, students learn critical thinking, core principles and communications skills needed to pursue higher level work. In the junior year, students are required to select an off-campus, location-specific studio and co-required course work in order to fulfill their off-campus study requirement. In the students’ spring semester of their senior year, the final studio focuses on the synthesis of a final independent project.Clemson’s Landscape Architecture program is noted for a special emphasis on the art of design. Consequently, the landscape architecture design studio experience is at the center of the student’s education—42 hours of studio are required. The program leads to a nationally accredited Bachelor of Landscape Architecture degree. The program is generalist, covering the major areas of practice and building from design basics to sophisticated studio experiences, such as large scale landscape planning; parks, recreation, and open space planning; and regional, urban, and community design. The studio experience is supported by other courses inside and outside the Landscape Architecture curriculum that provide the necessary grounding in landscape history and social, cultural, environmental, and aesthetic theories. Outstanding final year students may apply for admission into a shortened Master of City and Regional Planning, Master of Landscape Architec-ture, or Master of Real Estate Development program.Accreditation and RegistrationIn the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degrees in landscape ar-chitecture, recognizes two types of degrees, the First Professional Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) and the First Professional Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA).The Clemson University College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, Department of Landscape Architecture, offers both LAAB accredited First Professional programs: BLA (124 credits) and MLA (81 credits).2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities2016-1760The next BLA accreditation takes place fall 2019 and the next MLA accreditation takes place fall 2016.Any undergraduate student who meets the Academic Eligibility Policy after attempting 12 credit hours at Clemson University (or who is allowed to continue by virtue of a semester 2.4 grade-point average on 12 earned credits or who is allowed to continue through appeal to the Appeals Committee on Academic Eli-gibility or by other authorization of this committee) may transfer from one major to another. Any college or department that seeks an exception to this policy must have the approval of the collegiate dean and the provost.

The College includes the Departments of Communication, Health Science, Nursing, Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management, Political Sci-ence, Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology, and Youth Development Studies.All Anthropology, Justice Studies, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology majors, and other non-majors taking 3000- and 4000-level courses offered by those departments, are required to pay a major and course fee that funds infrastructure and program enhancements associated with these majors. The fees are summarized at http://www.clemson.edu/finance/student-financials/tuition-fees/index.html.Modern Language RequirementA number of Clemson University degree programs re-quire the completion of a modern language through a specific course level. Modern languages taught at Clemson University or accepted for transfer credit include American Sign Language, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. While many degree programs accept any of these modern languages for the require-ment, certain programs may have specific modern language requirements. Students should consult their program’s curriculum map for details.BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE PROGRAMSBachelor of Arts degrees are offered in Anthropol-ogy, Justice Studies, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology. Bachelor of Science degrees are also offered in Anthropology, Justice Studies, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology. These programs are designed to meet the needs of students seeking a broad general education as preparation for intelligent citizenship, commercial and industrial life, govern-ment service, research, and teaching. These curricula also provide an excellent background for the study of law, journalism, and medicine.To achieve depth as well as breadth in the educa-tional experience, students select a major consisting of courses above the sophomore level. Students also choose a minor consisting of additional credit hours. Students should contact their advisor for additional information and approval before pursuing a minor. See page 88 for a list of acceptable minors.Students in Bachelor of Arts programs who plan to teach in public schools may elect education courses required for certification by the South Carolina State Department of Education. Such courses are to be approved by their own department advisors.ANTHROPOLOGYBachelor of ArtsThe Anthropology BA major prepares students for a variety of professional careers related to human resources, international business, public relations, museum and park service interpretation, health services, and other people-oriented positions in the public and private sector. In addition, the degree provides excellent preparation for graduate training in anthropology, law, health care, and business. The degree requires a total of 124-125 semester hours, including 39 credit hours in anthropology as identi-fied below. In addition, students take a modern language and nine additional hours of social science or humanities courses related to Anthropology (from a department-approved list). These additional courses provide students with a greater depth and broader diversity of interdisciplinary knowledge useful for the direct application of an anthropological perspective to potential career paths. Courses used to fulfill General Education Requirements and Departmental Social Science and Humanities courses may be used to fulfill minor requirements.Students wishing to change majors into the An-thropology BA program must have a 2.0 or higher Clemson/Bridge cumulative grade-point average.Bachelor of ArtsFreshman YearFirst Semester 3 -  are accepted).

Students who change majors to Mathematical Sciences must have achieved the Minimum Cumulative Grade-Point Average (MCGPA) by Total Credit Hour Level as defined in the Academic Regulations section of the Undergraduate An-nouncements and must have received a grade of C or better in all MATH courses taken.MICROBIOLOGYBachelor of ScienceMicrobiology deals with the study of bacteria, viruses, yeasts, filamentous fungi, protozoa, and unicellular algae. Microbiologists seek to describe these organ-isms in terms of their structures, functions, and processes of reproduction, growth, and death at both the cellular and molecular levels. They are also concerned with their ecology, particularly in regard to their pathological effects on man, and with their economic importance.The Microbiology major provides a thorough training in the basic microbiological skills. Further, students receive instruction in mathematics, physics, chemis-try, and biochemistry, all essential to the training of a modern microbiologist. Students can prepare for a variety of careers through a wide choice of electives. Microbiology graduates may enter graduate school in microbiology, biochemistry, bioengineering, or related disciplines; they may enter medical or dental schools or pursue careers in one of the many indus-tries or public service departments dependent upon microbiology. Some of these are the fermentation and drug industries, medical and public health mi-crobiology, various food industries, and agriculture.Microbiology majors planning to apply for admission to a medical or dental school should inform their advisors immediately upon entering the program.Freshman YearFirst Semester1 -  General Microbiology3 - Arts and Humanities (Non-Lit.)

This curriculum is designed to meet the requirements of the programs in the College of Health Professions at the Medical University of South Carolina and other professional schools. The program requires a minimum of 90 semester hours of undergraduate coursework. In addition, students must apply to a professional school for acceptance into its program.Because preparation for some of the concentrations, such as the physical therapy, occupational therapy, and communication sciences and disorders programs at MUSC, requires a baccalaureate degree in any area, students are advised to select a major with similar requirements after consultation with the Prereha-bilitation Sciences advisor. The following curriculum fulfills the general requirements for those fields requiring less than a baccalaureate degree. Electives should be chosen after consultation with the advisor. Professional schools may change their requirements at any time, so it is imperative that students in this major stay in close contact with their advisor.For financial aid purposes, students in the Prere-habilitation Sciences program are considered to be enrolled in a degree-seeking program.First YearFirst Semester3 -  and Senior standing in engineering.

Professional duties range from analytical problem solving to the design of components and systems. The scope of employment requires a unique breadth and depth of knowledge and technical skills, which are reflected in the Electri-cal Engineering program. This program also offers an excellent preparation for graduate education. Detailed information can be found at www.clemson.edu/ces/departments/ece/.Building on a foundation of mathematical and physi-cal sciences, students progress into the application of these in the engineering science areas of circuits, electronics, communications, controls, power, and electromagnetics. In these subjects, students also begin to apply the concepts and techniques learned to the design of circuits and systems. Senior techni-cal design courses offer the opportunity to further develop expertise in a selected area.In addition to these technical skills, students learn to communicate effectively, both orally and with the written word. Because engineers work for the benefit of society, the curriculum includes a strong component of humanities and social science courses. Also, many project design assignments enable the development of interpersonal, teamwork, and man-agement skills, which are necessary for success in a professional engineering career.Freshman YearFirst Semester4 - , 3020, 4010, and 4020. 7, 3020, 4010, and 4020. , 3020, 4010, and 4020.6Any 4000-level MATH or STAT course approved by advisor.7See General Education Requirements.8 Advanced Leadership I 4(2) Study of leadership focused on decision making, plan-ning, communicating, and executing.

South Carolina residents attending any college or university may apply through the Veterinary Medical College Application Service (VMCAS) to the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine. Currently the University of Georgia admits up to 17 students each year through arrangements with the Southern Regional Education Board. The State of South Caro-lina has a contract with Mississippi State University to admit up to five South Carolina residents. The State of South Carolina also has a contract with Tuskegee University to admit up to four South Caro-lina residents. Application must be made directly to Tuskegee University. Minimum requirements for admission to a college of veterinary medicine generally include the satisfactory completion of prescribed courses in a well-rounded undergraduate degree program. Specific requirements for admission to the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine include the following under-graduate courses: six credits of English, 14 credits of humanities and social studies, eight credits of phys-ics, eight credits of general biology, eight credits of advanced biology, three credits of biochemistry, and 16 credits of organic and inorganic chemistry. (Chem-istry and physics courses must be at the premedical level; they may not be survey courses.) To be in the best competitive position, applicants should complete courses in animal agriculture, genet-ics, nutrition, biochemistry, and advanced biology. Considerations for selection are character, scholastic achievement, personality, experience with large and small animals, general knowledge, and motivation. In the past, competition has been keen, and only those applicants who have shown exceptional ability have been admitted. Specific considerations may include a minimal grade-point average and completion of stan-dardized tests such as the Graduate Record Examina-tion and the Veterinary College Admission Test.Since out-of-state students attending Clemson are ineligible to apply to the University of Georgia or Tuskegee University under the South Carolina quota, they should contact the college(s) of veterinary medicine to which they plan to apply. They may apply at the University of Georgia for at-large admission.Veterinary schools accept students with a broad range of academic backgrounds; therefore, it is recommended that the beginning university student select any undergraduate major and simultaneously complete the courses required for veterinary school entrance and those required for completion of a BS or BA degree. For students selecting Animal and Vet-erinary Sciences or Biological Sciences at Clemson University, the basic curricula have been designed to accommodate Georgia’s entrance requirements. Fur-ther information is available from the Department of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at 864-656-3427.ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCESBachelor of ScienceThe Environmental and Natural Resources curricu-lum produces professionals who have a broad-based knowledge in natural resources and an ability to interact with other resource professionals to provide thoughtful solutions to environmental and natural resource problems. The world is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, but the problems associated with their conservation are immense. Protection of rare and endangered species, preventing and controlling invasions of exotics, protecting old growth forests, restoring degraded ecosystems, and balancing the resource demands of industry and the public are some of the environmental issues which are enmeshed in politicized environments.Three concentrations are offered within the Envi-ronmental and Natural Resources major, which is administered by the Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation. The Conservation Biology Concentration is oriented toward students who desire a greater exposure to taxa, their habitats, and their interrelationships. The Natural Resources Management Concentration emphasizes both resource management and negotiation skills. The Natural Resource and Economic Policy Concentra-tion provides more in-depth study in economics and policy applications. Graduates in Environmental and Natural Resources are well prepared for further graduate studies in natural resources and related fields. Potential public sector employers of graduates include federal, state, and municipal resource management agencies, pri-vate industries impacting land and water resources, environmental management consulting firms, and various environmental advocacy groups.Freshman YearFirst Semester3 - * Beef Production 4(3) Discusses breeding, feeding, reproduction, and management of beef cattle.

Students and faculty see their ideas expressed in a myriad of forms—as buildings and landscapes, as the written word, as music and drama, as paintings, pots, prints and photographs. They work in the very oldest media and the very newest. They work alone. They work together. They seek not only the imaginative answers, but the enduring questions.The College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities is organized into three schools. The School of the Arts includes the departments of Art and Performing Arts. The School of Design and Building includes the School of Architecture, the Department of Construction Science and Management, and the Department of Planning and Landscape Architecture. The School of the Humanities includes the departments of English; History; Languages; and Philosophy and Religion. In addition to the undergraduate and graduate degrees offered by the ten departments, an array of interdisci-plinary programs is housed in the Office of the Dean, including the doctoral programs in Planning, Design and the Built Environment; and in Rhetorics, Com-munication and Information Design.Modern Language RequirementA number of Clemson University degree programs re-quire the completion of a modern language through a specific course level. Modern languages taught at Clemson University or accepted for transfer credit include American Sign Language, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. While many degree programs accept any of these modern languages for the require-ment, certain programs may have specific modern language requirements. Students should consult their program’s curriculum map for details.SCHOOL OF DESIGN AND  BUILDING AND SCHOOL OF THE ARTSThe Bachelor of Arts in Architecture degree is the preprofessional preparation for graduate study lead-ing to the Master of Architecture degree, which is the fully accredited professional degree in the field. The accredited Bachelor of Science in Construction Sci-ence and Management program prepares students for careers as professional managers in the construction industry. A graduate program is also offered leading to the Master of Construction Science and Manage-ment. The Visual Arts program offers professional study in the studio visual arts leading to the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. A graduate program leading to the Master of Fine Arts is also offered. The accredited four-year Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and three-year Master of Landscape Architecture degree programs prepare students for careers as professional landscape architects and are offered by the Depart-ment of Landscape Architecture. The Bachelor of Arts in Production Studies in Performing Arts is a distinctive degree program that combines practical hands-on experiences in performing arts produc-tion technologies with classes in music and theatre performance, history, and theory. A graduate program in City and Regional Planning is housed within the school and accepts graduates from a variety of baccalaureate programs and prepares them for careers in both public and private sector planning through its Master of City and Regional Planning degree. The Master of Science in Historic Preservation degree is a professional degree program designed for students who will specialize in working with historic buildings, landscapes, and the decora-tive arts. The Master of Real Estate Development is a full-time, two-year professional degree jointly offered by the Department of Planning, Development and Preservation and the Department of Finance in the College of Business.In addition to the facilities housed on the Clemson campus, the College offers third- and fourth-year Architecture and third-year Landscape Architecture students the opportunity to earn credit toward their degrees at three off-campus sites. Students may spend a semester at the Charleston Architecture Center earning credit from both Clemson University and the College of Charleston. Additionally, the Charles E. Daniel Center for Building Research and Urban Studies in Genoa, Italy, and the Barcelona Program in Barcelona, Spain, provide students with an intensive program of study and travel in Europe.Architecture Charleston Program Located in Charleston, South Carolina, this program is available to qualified undergraduates in Architec-ture, Construction Science and Management, Land-scape Architecture, and Visual Arts. Studio work is oriented toward design within the historic seaport setting. Students also enroll in classes at the College of Charleston campus. The program is enriched by visiting scholars and professionals from the area.Architecture Overseas ProgramThe Daniel Center for Building Research and Urban Studies in Genoa, Italy, is available to qualified Bach-elor of Arts in Architecture, Master of Architecture, Construction Science and Management, Fine Arts, City and Regional Planning, and professional year Landscape Architecture students. The Barcelona program in Barcelona, Spain, is available to qualified Bachelor of Arts in Architecture and professional year Landscape Architecture students. In both Genoa and Barcelona, studio and classroom work is enriched by visiting scholars and complemented by scheduled field trips in the country of program origin and in continental Europe.Entrance RequirementsAdmission to degree programs in the School of De-sign and Building and the School of the Arts is based on academic performance and is limited based on space availability in the various programs. Students seeking admission are advised to apply to the Admis-sions Office early in the fall of their senior year in high school. They are also encouraged to visit the school during their senior year. Faculty are available to meet with them and their parents informally and answer questions and discuss individual programs in more detail. Prospective students may schedule appointments by calling the individual department.Advancement in ArchitectureStudents enrolled in second-, third-, or fourth-year design studios and theory courses must attain at least a 2.0 grade-point average in each year level (by repeat-ing one or both semesters, if necessary) to qualify for advancement to the next year level or, in the case of fourth-year Architecture studios, to qualify for the Architecture degree, or in Landscape Architecture at the final year, to qualify for the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture degree.SCHOOL OF HUMANITIESThe Bachelor of Arts degree is offered in English, History, Language and International Trade, Mod-ern Languages, Pan African Studies, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Women’s Leadership, and World Cinema. The Bachelor of Science degree is offered in Language and International Health.To achieve depth as well as breadth in their education experiences, students majoring in English, History, Modern Languages, Pan African Studies, Philosophy, Religious Studies, or Women’s Leadership complete at least 24 semester hours from courses above the sophomore level. As soon as feasible and not later than the end of the sophomore year, students in these fields also select a minor consisting of at least 15 additional semester hours. Courses satisfying the major may not also be included in the minor. A second major (a double major) may substitute for the minor, provided all requirements are fulfilled for each major.The modern language requirement is a proficiency requirement. Students must complete through 2020 in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japa-nese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish. Some majors allow American Sign Language to fulfill the modern language requirement.Students enrolled in degree programs offered in the humanities who expect to teach in the public schools may elect education courses required for teaching certificates by the South Carolina Department of Education. Such courses are to be approved by their own department advisors.Students may transfer into the Undeclared category in the humanities only if they have completed 45 or fewer credit hours. For more information, contact the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities Advisement Center in 101 Strode Tower. ARCHITECTUREBachelor of Arts The Bachelor of Arts in Architecture prepares students for subsequent professional education by providing a sound general education, focused design studies, complementary support courses, and the requirement to study in an off campus location. The School of Architecture emphasizes the relationship of buildings to the rest of the environment: built, natural, and cultural. The curriculum includes seven semesters of studio in addition to complementary College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities  2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements 2016-17572016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements College of Architecture, Arts and Humanitiescourses in architectural history and theory and build-ing technology. The first three studios are collabora-tive, taught by faculty in Architecture, and Commu-nication Studies. The Bachelor of Arts also includes requirements for a minor and modern language.In the first two years of the program, students learn to apply the thinking and communications skills needed to pursue higher-level work in the discipline. The curriculum in the first two years also allows students to complete most of the University’s general educa-tion requirements. In the junior year, students must select an off-campus, location-specific studio and co-required coursework in order to fulfill their off-campus study requirement. The final studio focuses on reflection and synthesis.Accreditation and RegistrationIn the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recog-nizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Archi-tecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.Clemson University, College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, School of Architecture offers the following NAAB-accredited degree programs:M.Arch. (pre-professional degree + 60 graduate   credits)M.Arch. (pre-professional degree + 61 credits)   Architecture + HealthM.Arch. (non-pre-professional degree + 90 credits)M.Arch (non-pre-professional degree + 91 credits)   Architecture + HealthThe next accreditation visit for all programs will be in 2017.Freshman YearFirst Semester3 - * Wildlife Conservation Policy 3(3) Deals with the ecological rationale and manage-ment implications of public policy designed for the conservation of American wildlife resources.

WFB 4630,"); or Senior Honors Thesis ().FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITIONBachelor of ScienceFood Science and Human Nutrition majors apply principles of basic and applied sciences to the de-sign and manufacture of high quality, sustainable, convenient, safe and nutritious foods, in addition to identifying the relationship between nutrients and human health. The curriculum allows flexibility for concentrating in one of two areas:In the Food Science and Technology Concentration, students choose to focus their program of study in one of three emphasis areas: (1) Food Packaging and Manufacturing Operations; (2) Sustainable Food, Nu-trition and Health; or (3) Culinary Science. All three emphasis areas are approved by the Institute of Food Technologies (IFT), with the Culinary Science empha-sis also being one of a few select national programs approved by the Research Chef’s Association as meet-ing the requirements for the title of Culinology™. The food industry is a global effort that requires high-ly skilled individuals with strong science knowledge and technical skills. Our program not only prepares students in these areas, but also has a focus on engag-ing students in “real world” team-led research projects and understanding the creation and development of successful global food business enterprises. The pro-gram has hands-on food business entrepreneurship, study abroad and internship opportunities.Opportunities for employment include a wide variety of career paths, such as new food product research and development, design of sustainable food systems, quality assurance management, analytical testing, operations management, food packaging applications, marketing, customer services and technical sales. Local, state and federal agencies also need graduates for positions in sustainability food safety ad regulatory positions.In the Nutrition Concentration, students choose to focus their program of study in one of four emphasis areas: (1) Dietetics; (2) Basic and Behavioral Science; (3) Community Health and Wellness; or (4) Food In-dustry. The same course plan is followed the first two years with the junior and senior years varying accord-ing to the emphasis plan. Students normally choose the emphasis by the beginning of the spring semester of the sophomore year so as not to delay graduation. The Dietetics emphasis prepares students for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship program to become a Registered Dietitian or Registered Dietitian Nutrition-ist (RD or RDN). The curriculum for the Nutrition concentration with a Dietetics emphasis is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutri-tion and Dietetics (ACEND) as a Didactic Program in Dietetics. The Basic and Behavioral Science emphasis prepares students for graduate study in nutrition and health professions. The Community Health and Wellness emphasis prepares students for careers in community nutrition interacting with healthy popu-lations. The Food Industry emphasis allows students to pair nutrition and food science knowledge for job opportunities in food product development.To become a RD or RDN, students must complete three main steps. Information on these steps is avail-able at http://www.eatrightacend.org/ACEND/content.aspx?id=6442485467.  Successful completion of Clem-son University’s B.S. in Food Science and Human Nutrition with a concentration in Nutrition and an emphasis in Dietetics fulfills only the first step of the three step process to become a RD or RDN. Students who select the Dietetics emphasis must complete a formal application process and meet specific criteria for acceptance into the emphasis. The demand for dietetic internship positions greatly exceeds the number of available positions. Due to the competitive nature of dietetic internship acceptance, minimum grade criteria in specific courses are required for Dietetics emphasis acceptance. Two application times for admission into the Dietetics emphasis are available, one at the begin-ning of the spring semester and one at the beginning of the fall semester. Acceptance and successful completion of the Dietetics emphasis curriculum will not guarantee acceptance into an ACEND-accredited dietetic intern-ship, step two in the process of becoming a RD or RDN.For Dietetics emphasis admission, students must meet the following requirements:(1) Documented attendance at a dietetics program information session discussing the steps to become a RD/RDN; (2) Complete at least 60 credit hours by the end of the semester the student is applying; (3) Have a minimum GPA of 3.20; (4) Complete  Directed Research in Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Wildlife Biology 1(3) Research problems in selected areas of aquacultural, fisher-ies, or wildlife science to introduce students to experimental design, research techniques, and presentation of research results.

BIOLOGICAL SCIENCESBiology encompasses the broad spectrum of the modern life sciences, including the study of all aspects of life from the structure and function of the whole organism down to the subcellular levels and up through the interactions of organisms to the integrated existence of life on the entire planet. Descriptive, structural, functional, and evolution-ary questions are explored through the hierarchy of the organization of life. Applications of current advances to the health and well-being of man and society, to nature and the continuation of earth as a balanced ecosystem, and to an appreciation of the place of natural science in our cultural heritage re-ceive emphasis. Majors in Biological Sciences receive classroom, laboratory, and field training in biology with an emphasis on chemistry, mathematics, and physics as necessary tools. Bachelor of ArtsThe Bachelor of Arts in Biological Sciences provides a strong foundation in biology and is ideal for students desiring a liberal education emphasizing an interdis-ciplinary approach to a thorough understanding of the life sciences.Freshman YearFirst Semester1 - , 2230,  Human Anatomy and Phys.

Biosys-tems engineers apply engineering design and analysis to biological systems and incorporate fundamental biological principles to engineering designs to achieve ecological balance.The Biosystems engineering program emphasizes two main areas – sustainable bioprocess engineering, with its basis in microbiology, and ecological engineering, with its basis in ecology. Bioprocess engineering focuses on the sustainable production of biorefinery compounds - biofuels, nutraceuticals, bioactive mol-ecules, and biomaterials - using metabolic pathways found in nature and green processing technologies. Ecological engineering focuses on the design of sustainable communities utilizing low-impact develop-ment strategies such as bioretention basins, rainwater harvesting, and bioswales for stormwater retention, treatment, and management. Both emphasis areas interface with ecologically-sound food and energy-crop and feedstock production systems. Biosystems engineers lead teams to:• Design bioprocesses and systems for biofuels (biodiesel, hydrogen, ethanol), biopharmaceutical, bioplastics, and food processing industries• Develop ecological designs (permeable pavement, bioswales, green infrastructure) to integrate storm-water management into the landscape • Integrate biological sustainability into energy, water and food systems • Provide engineering expertise for agriculture, food processing, and manufacturing industries.Biosystems engineering graduates are highly qualified to pursue graduate studies in biosystems engineering, biomedical engineering or ecological engineering fields, or medical or veterinary school.Students are urged to complete a minor and par-ticipate in the Cooperative Education, Biosystems Engineering Intern, and/or Study Abroad Programs. Those interested in medical school can fulfill require-ments with the Biosystems Engineering BS degree.Additional information is available from the depart-mental offices or at: http://www.clemson.edu/majors/biosystems-engineering.Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s ProgramUnder this plan, students may reduce the time necessary to earn both degrees by applying graduate credits to both undergraduate and graduate program requirements.Undergraduate students in Biosystems Engineering may begin a Master of Science or a Master of Engi-neering Degree in Environmental Engineering and Science or Master of Science Degree in Bioengineer-ing while completing the BS degree. Students are encouraged to obtain the specific requirements for the dual degree from the academic departments involved as early as possible in their un-dergraduate program.

It offers students a rigorous, science-based degree with educational opportunities related to management of agricultural commodities and natural resources, as well as soil and water resources. Students can tailor the program to fit their professional and academic goals by selecting one of three concentrations. The Agricultural Biotechnology Concentration integrates conventional disciplines with molecular advances in plants, pathogens, and biosystem interac-tions and responds to the educational void between the rapid adoption of biotechnology products into agricultural production and the intermediate- and end-users, farmers, and consumers. Graduates in this concentration will be competitive as scientists in emerging agricultural biotechnology industries, as educators, and as policy makers and officers in regulatory agencies.Students with a concentration in Agronomy will graduate with comprehensive knowledge to increase farm profits by decreasing the costs of crop produc-tion; build soil tilth and fertility through rotations, multiple cropping, and nutrient cycling; protect the environment by minimizing or more efficiently us-ing synthetic agrichemicals; manage crop pests and weeds with integrated, ecologically sound strategies; develop strategies for profitable marketing of agricul-tural commodities; and create a strong, diversified agriculture that is stable through market and weather fluctuations. Graduates can assume positions as self-employed farmers, farm managers, state and federal natural resource managers, research technicians, agricultural industry employees, greenhouse manag-ers, consultants in pest management and sustainable agriculture, field ecology professionals, agritourism industry specialists, extension personnel, or regula-tory officers.Students with a concentration in Soil and Water Sci-ence can address compelling problems such as land application of agricultural and industrial wastes, re-duction of contamination of ground and surface wa-ters, establishment of functional septic drain fields, and production of food and fiber crops. Graduates will be able to establish careers in traditional agrar-ian fields such as soil scientists and conservationists, extension agents, and farm consultants, and in the broader environmental arenas of DHEC, consulting engineering firms, and environmental consulting. Graduates will be well prepared for graduate work in fields ranging from soil science to environmental engineering and law.Freshman YearFirst Semester3 - * Mechanical Properties of Packages and Principles of Protective Packaging 3(3) Study of the mechanical properties of products and pack-ages and standard methods of determining these properties.

It should be emphasized that the program is not intended to indoctrinate students into one particular religion or to teach them to become religious, but is focused rather on studying how religion both historically and theoretically motivates, provides meaning for, and helps to organize human life. The program trains students to be global thinkers with a deeper understanding of the world’s cultural, political, and social differences. Historically, Religious Studies majors have gone on to pursue graduate work and employment in a number of fields, including law, medicine, ministry, non-profit and service related industries, in addition to numerous others.In addition to completing the General Education curriculum, the Religious Studies major must meet the requirements of the School of Humanities; com-plete * Drama of English Renaissance 3(3) Selected readings in non-Shakespearean dramatic literature of the 16th and 17th centuries.

The program offers students a balanced curriculum of academic coursework, studio art and art history courses in preparation for careers in studio related areas of the visual arts. The department offers course-work in a number of studio disciplines, including ce-ramics, drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture and the new media arts. First-year art students participate in a foundations program comprised of four studio classes. These classes expose first-year art students to 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D studio practices; utilize traditional and new media; and place special emphasis on drawing. Near the end of the freshmen year, students exhibit their work in a mandatory Foundations Review. In the sophomore year, students take studio courses in six disciplines, which provides an overview of the studio arts and exposes students to a broad range of studio experiences. Upon completion of this core of courses, students identify one studio discipline as their emphasis area in the Bachelor of Fine Arts program. In the junior year, students fulfill requirements in their emphasis area in preparation for the Senior Studio experience. Requirements include interme-diate and advanced courses in their chosen studio discipline. The Senior Studio experience is comprised of three courses and provides students an opportunity to focus on and refine their personal art concepts and skills, produce a cohesive body of artworks for their BFA exhibition, and develop their portfolio for graduate study or a career in studio-related art professions.Freshman YearFirst Semester3 -  Senior Seminar 3(3) Capstone-style seminar offered each fall for senior year Religious Studies majors, who conduct research, make pre-sentations, and engage in weekly discussions on a topic chosen by the faculty member organizing the seminar.

MOORE SCHOOL OF EDUCATIONA driving force in the genesis of the new College of Education is the Eugene T. Moore School of Education, a transformative leader in systematically improving education, beginning at birth. The mission is to engage students in high quality applied research, professional learning, and immersive experiences. We prepare culturally competent scholar practitioners who promote the growth, education, and development of all individuals, with emphasis on underperforming schools and underserved communities across the state and nation. Modern Language RequirementA number of Clemson University degree programs require the completion of a modern language through a specific course level. Modern languages taught at Clemson University or accepted for trans-fer credit include American Sign Language, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. While many degree programs accept any of these modern languages for the requirement, certain programs may have specific modern language requirements. Students should consult their program’s curriculum map for details.TEACHER EDUCATIONPROGRAMSThe College of Education offers NCATE accredited teacher education undergraduate programs leading to teaching licensure in early childhood; elementary; secondary English, mathematics, science and social studies; agricultural education (in cooperation with the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sci-ences), and special education.Our excellent preparation in both content and meth-odology includes many collaborative experiences in local schools. It prepares our graduates to shape the economic future of South Carolina, the United States, and the world by preparing leaders, workers, and citizens for their future roles in society.The mission of the teacher preparation programs in the College of Education is to prepare critically reflective practitioners who:• advocate for all learners,• understand the importance of students’ develop-mental and sociocultural contexts to learning,• implement research-based instructional practices, • utilize current disciplinary knowledge to integrate educational theory, research and practice,• understand the influence of educational policies on their instruction and educational system, and • stand firm in their conviction that all students can learn.Field and clinical practice are integral to teacher preparation. The College of Education is committed to providing candidates with purposeful, challenging, and diverse experiences. It is through a range of diverse, carefully constructed, and challenging field-based experiences, in conjunction with classroom instruction, that candidates recognize the inherent dignity and value of all individuals, value social jus-tice, and advocate on behalf of children and families. The Teacher Education Programs in Early Childhood, Elementary, Special Education, and secondary school programs in Agriculture, English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies are accredited by NCATE (now known as CAEP), the State of South Carolina, and discipline specialized national professional associations. Criminal Records CheckA criminal record could prevent a person enrolled in a teacher education program in South Carolina from being licensed as a teacher in this state in accordance with State Board of Education guidelines.Section 59-25-115 of the South Carolina Code of Laws specifies that before beginning the full-time clinical teaching experience in South Carolina, a teacher education candidate shall undergo a state criminal records check by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and a national crimi- nal records check supported by fingerprints by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The applicant is responsible for the cost associated with the FBI background checks. Information reported relative to prior arrests or convictions will be reviewed by the State Department of Education, and the State Board of Education when warranted, according to board guidelines. A teacher education candidate with prior arrests or convictions of a serious nature that could affect his/her fitness to teach in the public schools of South Carolina may be denied the opportunity to complete the clinical teaching experience, and thus affect eligibility for initial teacher licensure. An individual who is denied this opportunity as a result of prior arrests or convictions, after one year, may request reconsideration under guidelines established by the State Board of Education.The criminal records check will be handled through the Office of Educator Services at the South Carolina State Department of Education and will be considered phase one of a person’s application for a teaching credential. Provided the criminal records check is conducted within 18 months of the time the teacher candidate formally applies for a teaching license, the fingerprinting will not have to be repeated at the time of application. A graduate of a teacher educa-tion program applying for initial teacher licensure must have completed the FBI fingerprint process within 18 months of formally applying for initial teacher licensure or the fingerprint process must be repeated. The background check normally requires six (6) to eight (8) weeks to process. If the electronic fingerprints cannot be processed, the South Carolina State Department will inform the individual that it will be necessary to complete another electronic fingerprinting appointment.Additionally, College of Education teacher candi-dates must complete a SLED check, a National Sex Offender check and a Tuberculosis (TB) test prior to beginning field and practicum experiences in public schools. Candidates complete field and practicum experiences prior to the full time clinical teaching ex-perience. Therefore, the teacher education candidate will complete a SLED check for field and practicum experiences and a SLED and FBI background check for the full time clinical teaching experience. AdmissionProfessional—Application to the professional level of a program will be reviewed in the second semester of the sophomore year, the second year of enroll-ment in the eduction program. Admission to the professional level requirements include 60 semester hours of education program work, passing scores on all areas of the Praxis CORE and have a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.75. A candidate may exempt the CORE by meeting minimum ACT or SAT requirements as determined by the South Carolina Department of Education.Enrollment in Professional CoursesOnce admitted to the professional level, candidates must maintain a 2.75 GPA in order to continue through the coursework sequence. Please see the following pages for additional program-specific academic requirements. On occasion appeals may be reviewed by department chairs.Directed Teaching/Teaching Internship—A candi-date shall apply for student teaching with the Office of Field Experiences prior to the semester in which senior level teaching methods courses are to be sched-uled. Admission and maintenance at the professional level and completion of at least 95 semester hours is required for registration to student teaching. Change of MajorChanging majors into Education is highly competitive. Change of major decisions are made on an annual basis at the end of the fall semester. Applications are due December 1 and can only be obtained after meeting with a College of Education academic advisor. To apply, candidates must have a minimum grade-point average of 2.75.Graduation and LicensureTo graduate, a candidate must have scores for all state-mandated licensure exams on file with the College of Education’s Office of Field Experience. Candidates must pass all required Praxis II tests, including the PLT (Principles of Learning and Teaching) test, be-fore receiving recommendation for South Carolina teaching licensure.ATHLETIC LEADERHIPAND EDUCATION MINORSTwo minors are offered in the College of Educa-tion – Education and Athletic Leadership.

Genetics research takes many forms, from the study of heredity at the level of individual molecules to study at the level of cells and chromosomes, individuals, or populations. To comprehend current genetic information and to make future contributions to our molecular under-standing of life processes, students must obtain a broad background in biology and a firm foundation in chemistry and mathematics. This is the basis of the genetics curriculum.A degree in Genetics is a strong preparation for many careers. The degree provides an excellent foundation for medical, veterinary, or pharmacy school, as well as graduate research in any discipline related to biology, including bioinformatics, forensic technology, and ge-netic counseling. Because of the increasing emphasis on genetics in everyday life, a Bachelor of Science in Genetics can also be a direct path to a career in the emerging biotechnology industries (pharmaceuticals, agricultural technologies, biomimetic minerals) in research, sales, or business operations. Combined with a law degree, a genetics bachelor of science is a good background for a career as a patent attorney.Freshman YearFirst Semester5 -  Chemical Biology 3(3) Introduction to the chemical foundations of biological phenomena, focusing on bioorganic, biophysical, bioinorganic, and bioanalytic chemistry principles.

The complete objectives of the program can be found at www.clemson.edu/ce.The first two years provide students with building blocks necessary to be successful civil engineers, including proficiency in calculus, engineering me-chanics, physics, and chemistry. During the junior year, students receive a broad introduction to the fundamental areas of civil engineering (structures, hydraulics, geotechnical, transportation, environ-mental, construction materials, and construction engineering and management). Design experiences are integrated throughout the curriculum, culminat-ing in the senior year with a major capstone design project. In addition, during the senior year, students can select from available emphasis areas that serve to strengthen their undergraduate background. The Civil Engineering program prepares students to work immediately upon graduation in most areas of civil engineering or to pursue graduate degrees. Stu-dents are also exposed to issues related to professional practice, including professional registration, life-long learning, and communication and team skills. Because a concerned society demands a realistic consideration of the impacts of engineering projects, civil engineer-ing students are also educated in the broad areas of the humanities and social sciences.To be eligible for admission into the Bachelor of Sci-ence degree program in Civil Engineering, students must have completed the courses outlined in the freshman core curriculum and have a cumulative grade-point average of 2.6 or higher.The Department of Civil Engineering allows eligible students to count up to six hours of graduate credit (6000- and 8000-level courses) toward both the bach-elor’s and master’s degrees.

Mechanical engineers, in a broad sense, make major contributions to the creation of products and systems that benefit mankind. They work in a variety of areas, including bioengineering, energy systems, environmental and life-support systems, propul-sion and transportation systems, food production, materials processing, automated manufacturing, and construction. A wide spectrum of career oppor-tunities is open to them. The practice of mechanical engineering includes one or more of the following activities: manufacturing, testing, research, develop-ment, design, technical management, technical sales and marketing, construction, and teaching.Preparation for a 40  –45-year professional career requires development of the whole person through a balanced program encompassing the humanities, social sciences, communication and computer skills, physical and engineering sciences, design, and labo-ratory experience. Students start with the physical sciences and communication skills and progress through the engineering sciences, ultimately apply-ing the principles learned in such areas as energy conversion and transfer, mechanical design, and systems analysis. Throughout the curriculum, the fundamental nature of engineering as a problem-solving discipline is emphasized.Most graduates take positions in industry, govern-ment, or business. Many, however, continue their formal education in a graduate program. The De-partment of Mechanical Engineering offers study leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees.Mechanical Engineering students who have a cumu-lative grade-point average or cumulative engineering grade-point average (EGPA) below 2.0 are on proba-tion and will have restricted enrollment in classes. Students whose cumulative grade-point average is below 2.0 are subject to the regulations stipulated un-der Academic Eligibility Policy. Students on probation for EGPR below 2.0 who fail to recover in the first regular semester (fall or spring) will not be allowed to register for mechanical engineering classes. After one year, such students may petition the Mechanical Engineering Department for continued enrollment. An advising policy for students on probation is avail-able from the Mechanical Engineering Department.Additional information can be found at www.clemson. ces.edu/me.Freshman YearFirst Semester4 -  Color Science Laboratory 1(3) Introduction to common dyeing and printing methods and to some of the machinery necessary to carry out dyeing operations.

Its molecular concepts form the basis for ideas about complex material behavior. Due to the fundamental nature and extensive application of chemistry, an unusually large variety of challenging opportunities to contribute in the science-oriented community are open to students whose education is built around the principles of this discipline.The Chemistry curriculum, through the career requirement options and the large number of elec-tives, provides students the opportunity to select a coherent program of study beyond the basic courses. Career requirement options are provided for students anticipating graduate study in chemistry or related fields; employment following the BS degree in labo-ratory, production, technical sales, or management positions; professional studies (e.g., medicine); chemical physics; geochemistry; and employment in fields requiring extensive preparation in courses other than sciences (e.g., patent law and technical writing). Significant features of the curriculum are the student’s extensive participation in experimental work and the opportunity to take part in a research investigation during the junior and senior years.Freshman YearFirst Semester4 -  Chemistry Capstone3 - Chemistry Requirement13 - Elective14 121 Total Semester Hours1See advisor2See General Education Requirements.

Freshman YearFirst Semester4 - , or THEA (ENGL) 3470INTERDISCIPLINARY  EMPHASIS AREAStudents who select the Bachelor of Science de-gree in Physics with an interdisciplinary emphasis supplement their study of physics with core courses in complementary fields of study. This emphasis area is an excellent option for students preparing for direct entry into the job market or for medical, law or business school. Depending on a student’s academic goals, it may also be a good option for students preparing for graduate school or for those pursuing both a major and minor or a double major. 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements College of Science2016-17130Because students choosing the interdisciplinary emphasis have a wide variety of academic and career goals, and because the interdisciplinary emphasis requirements cannot be tracked via Clemson’s degree audit system, detailed departmental advising is vital. Students, in consultation with their advisor, must select a technical or professional emphasis area subject to departmental approval no later than the end of the second semester of their sophomore year. Additionally, all potential prerequisite courses for a minor should be completed in the student’s first or second year. For additional information, please visit http: //physics.clemson.edu.Note: Student transcripts record a Bachelor of Science in Physics; the interdisciplinary emphasis area is not included on transcripts.Freshman YearFirst Semester4 - , or THEA (ENGL) 34705Students must complete through 2020 in a modern language. See Modern Languages Requirement at Clemson University statement on page 27.6Any 2000-4000-level science course in ASTR, BIOL, CH, ENSP, GEOL, PHYS, or STS. Other science courses require departmental approval.7Students may select an approved synthesis or capstone course or directed research in their emphasis area. Students in the honors program must complete a senior thesis in physics.Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s Plan Under this plan, students may reduce the time neces-sary to earn both degrees by applying graduate credits to both undergraduate and graduate program require-ments. Both BS/MS (Master of Science) and BS/MAT (Master of Arts in Teaching) plans are available. Students are encouraged to obtain the specific require-ments for pursuing the combined degree from the Department of Physics and Astronomy (www.physics.clemson.edu) as early as possible in their undergraduate program. Enrollment guidelines and procedures can be found under Academic Regulations in this catalog.PREPROFESSIONAL HEALTH STUDIESNon-degreeThe health professions need individuals with a diver-sity of educational backgrounds and a wide variety of talents and interests. The philosophies of education, the specific preprofessional course requirements, the noncognitive qualifications for enrollment, and the systems of training vary among the professional health schools; but all recognize the desirability of a broad education—a good foundation in the natural sciences, highly developed communication skills, and a solid background in the humanities and social sciences. The absolute requirements for admission to professional health schools are limited to allow latitude for develop-ing individualized undergraduate programs of study; however, most schools of medicine and dentistry require 16 semester hours of chemistry, including College of Science 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcementsorganic chemistry, eight hours of biological sciences, eight hours of physics, and six hours of mathematics. These requirements should be balanced with courses in vocabulary building, the humanities, and social sci-ences. The basic requirements in the natural sciences and as many of the courses in the humanities and social sciences as possible should be completed by the third year so students are prepared to take the Dental Admission Test or the Medical College Admission Test prior to applying to a professional school.Undergraduates may also prepare to study optometry, podiatry, and other health professions. While the basic requirements for these professional schools are essentially the same as those for schools of medicine and dentistry, specific requirements for individual schools in these professions vary somewhat; conse-quently, interested students are advised to consult with the chief health professionals advisor. At Clemson, rather than having a separate, organized preprofessional health studies program, students are allowed to major in any curriculum, as long as the basic entrance requirements of the professional health school are fulfilled. These schools are not as concerned about a student’s major as they are about academic performance in whichever curriculum the student chooses. Professional health schools have neither preferences nor prejudices concerning any curriculum, which is evidenced by the fact that their entering students represent a broad spectrum of cur-ricula. The emphasis is placed on the student’s doing well in the curriculum chosen, and this becomes criti-cal as competition increases for the limited number of places available in professional health schools.PREPHARMACYThe two-year Prepharmacy program requires 66–72 credit hours, depending on the pharmacy school of interest. Upon completion of the program, students will be eligible to apply to a college of pharmacy, usu-ally the South Carolina College of Pharmacy (MUSC and USC campuses), and may be eligible to apply for the Bachelor of Science in Preprofessional Studies. The degree in Pharmacy is awarded by the institution attended. It is important for students to work closely with their advisor as there are variations in courses required by the pharmacy schools.For financial aid purposes, students in the Preph-armacy program are considered to be enrolled in a degree-seeking program.First YearFirst Semester3 -  Organizational Leadership II 4(2) Continuation of .

Instructional activities include lectures, recitation or discussion sessions, and laboratories. The individuals to be certi-fied include full-time and part-time faculty, graduate teachers of record, graduate teaching assistants, and graduate laboratory assistants for whom English is not the first language.A student who experiences difficulty with an instruc-tor’s written or oral English and who wishes to seek relief must do so prior to the seventh meeting of a 50-minute class and prior to the fifth meeting of a 90-minute class in regular semesters. In summer sessions, relief must be sought prior to the third class meeting.The procedure is summarized as follows:a. The student must quickly bring the problem to the attention of the instructor’s department chair either directly or through a faculty member such as the student’s advisor. That department chair will assess the complaint and, if deemed valid, offer an appropriate remedy within two days.b. A student who is not satisfied with the department chair’s decision or the relief suggested, may appeal within two days to a five-member hearing panel comprised of three faculty members and two students appointed by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.Students with questions should contact the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies, E-103 Martin Hall.EQUAL OPPORTUNITY/NON DISCRIMINATION/ AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Clemson University is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all persons and does not discrimi-nate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability, veteran’s status, genetic information or protected activity (e.g., opposition to prohibited discrimination or participation in any complaint process, etc.) in employment, educational programs and activities, admissions and financial aid. Clemson University’s policy of Non-Discrimination is intended to meet responsibilities under Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act 1964, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, Title IX of the Educa-tion Amendments of 1972, Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act of 2008, the Violence Against Women Act, and applicable provisions of the South Carolina Human Affairs Law. Clemson University conducts its programs and activities involving admission, access, treatment, employment, teaching, research, and public service in a nondiscriminatory manner as prescribed by Federal laws and regulations.In conformance with University policy and pursu-ant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974, and South Carolina Human Affairs Law, Clemson University is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer.Inquiries concerning the above may be addressed to the following:Director, Office for Access and Equity and Title IX Coordinator110 Holtzendorff HallClemson UniversityClemson, "
DC 2050,"7FAMILY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT The South Carolina Family Privacy Protection Act (SC Code 30-2-10 et. seq.) defines personal informa-tion as “…information that identifies or describes an individual including, but not limited to, an indi-vidual’s photograph or digitized image, social security number, date of birth, driver’s identification number, name, home address, home telephone number, medical or disability information, education level, financial status, bank account(s) number(s), account or identification number issued by and/or used by any federal or state governmental agency or private financial institution, employment history, height, weight, race, other physical details, signature, bio-metric identifiers, and any credit records or reports.”Some of the information in documents which stu-dents provide to Clemson University may be personal information as defined above. Pursuant to Section 30-2-40 B, students are advised that this information may be subject to public scrutiny or release. They are also advised that personally-identifiable information contained in these educational records falls under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (FERPA). If students elect to opt out of the release of directory information under FERPA, the University will not release any personal information except as otherwise required or authorized by law.Visit http://www.clemson.edu/privacypolicy.html for additional information.HARASSMENTIn general, harassment is unwelcome verbal or physical conduct, based upon race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability, status as a military veteran, genetic information or protected activity (e.g., opposi-tion to prohibited discrimination or participation in the statutory complaint process), that unreasonably interferes with the person’s work or educational performance or creates an intimidating or hostile work or educational environment.  Examples may include, but are not limited to, epithets, slurs, jokes or other verbal, graphic or physical conduct.Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 (amending the Higher Education Act of 1965) is a federal gender equity law that prohibits discrimina-tion based on sex in education programs and activi-ties that receive federal funding. Sexual harassment, which includes sexual violence and other forms of nonconsensual sexual misconduct, is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited under this law.The entire text of the University’s policy on harass-ment and additional information on Title IX and sexual harassment can be obtained from the Office of Access and Equity, 110 Holtzendorff, (864) 656-3181 or at www.clemson.edu/access/policies.html.INFORMATION RESOURCES FOR STUDENTSClemson University computing resources are the property of Clemson University, to be used for university-related business. Students have no expecta-tion of privacy when utilizing university computing resources, even if the use is for personal purposes. The university reserves the right to inspect, without notice, the contents of computer files regardless of medium, the contents of electronic mailboxes and computer conferencing systems, systems output such as printouts, and to monitor network communica-tion when1. It is considered reasonably necessary to maintain or protect the integrity, security or functionality of university or other computer resources or to protect the university from liability;2. There is reasonable cause to believe that the us-ers have violated this policy or otherwise misused computing resources;3. An account appears to be engaged in unusual or unusually excessive activity;4. It is otherwise required or permitted by law.Any suspected violations of this policy or any other misuse of computer resources by students normally should be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. That office will investigate the allegations and take appropriate disciplinary action. Violations of law related to misuse of computing resources may be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency.Notwithstanding the above, Clemson Computing and Information Technology may temporarily sus-pend, block or restrict access to an account, inde-pendent of university disciplinary procedures, when it appears reasonably necessary to do so in order to protect the integrity, security or functionality of 2016-2017 Undergraduate Announcements Appendix2016-17300university or other computer resources, to protect the university from liability, or where the emotional or physical well-being of any person is immediately threatened. When CCIT unilaterally takes such ac-tion, it will immediately notify the account holder of its actions and the reason for them in writing. The account holder may appeal the action taken by CCIT in writing to the Chief Information Officer.Access will be restored to the account holder whenev-er the appropriate investigatory unit of the university determines that the protection of the integrity, secu-rity or functionality of university or other computing resources has been restored and the safety and well being of all individuals can reasonably be assured, unless access is to remain suspended as a result of formal disciplinary action imposed through the Of-fice of Student Conduct or as a result of legal action.Use of University computing resources, including network facilities, account numbers, data storage me-dia, printers, plotters, microcomputer systems, and software for computing activities other than those authorized by the University is strictly prohibited. Unauthorized use of such resources is regarded as a criminal act in the nature of theft, and violators are subject to suspension, expulsion, and civil and criminal prosecution.Use of university computing resources, including network facilities, account numbers, data storage media, printers, plotters, microcomputer systems, and software for computing activities other than those authorized by the university is strictly prohib-ited. Unauthorized use of such resources is regarded as a criminal act in the nature of theft and violators are subject to suspension, expulsion, and civil and criminal prosecution.The following are examples of misuse of computing resources:1. Unauthorized duplication, distribution or altera-tion of any licensed software. This includes software licensed by the university and licensed software ac-cessed using the computing networks.2. Attempting to gain unauthorized access to any computing resource or data, or attempting to disrupt the normal operation of any computing resource or network – at Clemson or anywhere on the Internet,3. Attempting to use another student’s or employee’s computer account or data, without their permission.4. Using the university electronic mail system to attack other computer systems, falsify the identity of the source of electronic mail messages. Sending harassing, obscene or other threatening electronic mail. Attempting to read, delete, copy or modify the electronic mail of others without their authorization. Sending, without official university authorization, “for-profit” messages, chain letters or other unsolic-ited “junk” mail.5. Knowingly infecting any computing resource with a software virus.6. Tampering with the university computer network or building wiring or installing any type of electronic equipment or software that could be used to capture or change information intended for someone else.7. Participating in a “denial of service” attack on any other computer, whether on or off campus.8. Using university computing or network resources for personal gain or illegal activities such as theft, fraud, copyright infringement, piracy (e.g., sound or video recording), or distribution of child pornog-raphy or obscenities.PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTSAll students enrolling in Clemson University do so with the full understanding that students working on sponsored projects and/or who use Clemson Univer-sity resources other than for lecture-based coursework or other course-related assignments are subject to the Clemson University Intellectual Property Policy.1) In accordance with the University Intellectual Property Policy, student Creators* do not hold rights to intellectual property created developed, or gener-ated:i.
