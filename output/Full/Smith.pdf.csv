The club sports are a group of independent clubs under the guidance of the associate athletic director, Bonnie May. Dues, fundraiser, SGA activities, and fee allocations support them. Open to Smith students of any ability level, club sports provide a resource to learn a new sport or practice a familiar one. Presently, there are 13 clubs: Equestrian, Archery, Badminton, Cycling, Fencing, Futsal, Ice Hockey, Quidditch, Rugby, Spirit Squad, Squash, Synchronized Swimming and Ultimate Frisbee.The Campus and Campus Life 21Smith OutdoorsSmith Outdoors is the outdoor adventure program offered through Smith’s ath-letics department. Based out of the Paradise Pond boathouse, Smith Outdoors offers a variety of clinics, presentations and off-campus trips throughout the year. The focus is on providing an outdoor setting for recreation, socializa-tion, self-empowerment and education. Activities vary from foliage hikes and ice-skating to more adventurous trips like rock climbing, backpacking and whitewater rafting. Also included are open hours for recreational paddling on Paradise Pond and rock climbing at the indoor climbing wall located in Ain-sworth Gym. For more information, send email to smithoutdoors@smith.edu or visit www. smith.edu/athletics/clubsports/smithoutdoors.html.Career DevelopmentThe Lazarus Center for Career Development provides and prepares students for careers in a changing economic and technical climate. Staff work with Smith women to help them develop the skills, knowledge, and global and personal foresights needed to navigate their professional careers, even when economic and personal circumstances change. The professional staff offers advising, both individually and in groups; and services are available throughout the academic year and summer months. The center sponsors seminars, workshops and industry discussions that cover internships; non-Fulbright fellowships; career field exploration; résumé writing; effective interviewing and job search strategies; networking; and applying to graduate, medical, dental, and professional schools. They help students assess their individual interests, strengths and weaknesses; establish priorities and make decisions; and present themselves and their backgrounds effectively. The extensive career resource library and website support students in their research and exploration.Praxis Summer Internship Funding Program“Praxis: The Liberal Arts at Work,” administered through the Lazarus Center for Career Development, funds students to work at substantive, unpaid sum-mer internships related to their academic and/or career interests. By offering financial support, the college acknowledges the importance of internships in helping students explore careers, observe the practical applications of their academic studies and gain work experience that enhances their marketability to employers and graduate schools. Since the majority of internships are unpaid, Praxis stipends are intended to make it financially possible for students to work at substantive summer internships. Praxis funding is a one-time opportunity of up to $4,000. A student may use a Praxis stipend for an approved internship in the summer following her sophomore or junior year. Lazarus Center staff and resources offer guidance and assistance to students in locating opportunities that meet their individual interests. Each year approximately 400 students work at summer internships funded through Praxis.Health Serviceswww.smith.edu/healthHealth Services provides medical and psychological services for all Smith stu-dents. Through outpatient services located in the Nancy and Henry Schacht Center for Health and Wellness, students see physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses for medical problems and questions, just as they would see their own providers at home. For psychological issues, students see social workers  and graduate social work interns. A psychiatrist is also available. Health education is provided on topics relevant to students’ emotional and physical health and safety.Medical ServicesThe same standards of confidentiality apply to the doctor-patient relationship at Smith as to all other medical practitioners. Medical Services offers a full array of exams and testing; nutrition counseling; routine physicals for summer em-ployment and graduate school; immunizations for travel, flu and allergies; and on-site laboratory services.  In case of unusual or serious illness, specialists in the Northampton and Springfield areas are available for consultation in addition to service provided at a nearby hospital.Counseling ServiceThe Counseling Service provides consultation, individual and group psychother-apy and psychiatric evaluation and medication. These services are strictly con-fidential. The Counseling Service is available to all students, free of charge. It is staffed by licensed mental health professionals and supervised graduate interns.Health EducationThe wellness education program integrates innovative wellness initiatives into students’ academic, residential and extracurricular activities. The program provides opportunities for students to take leadership roles in health education on campus.College Health InsuranceThe college offers its own insurance policy, underwritten by an insurance com-pany, that covers a student in the special circumstances of a residential college. It extends coverage for in- and outpatient services not covered by many other insurance plans. However, this policy does have some distinct limitations. There-fore, we strongly urge that students consider continuing their precollege health insurance. Failure to waive the college health plan will result in automatic enrollment in it. The college maintains certain regulations in the interest of community health as outlined in the college handbook and expects all students to comply. Before arriving at the college, each student must complete her Health Pre-Admission Information Form and send it to the Health Services. It is important to note that Massachusetts law now mandates that students must get the re-quired immunizations before registration. Students accepted for a Study Abroad Program or who plan to participate in intercollegiate sports or certain exercise and sport programs may be required to have a physical exam by a college practitioner first.Religious ExpressionThe college encourages student spiritual development and many expressions of religious faith on campus. The Center of Religious and Spiritual Life (CRSL) is housed in the Helen Hills Hills Chapel. The director of the center is responsible for overseeing the program, advising student religious organizations and pro-moting a spirit of mutual understanding, respect, and interfaith collaboration.     The college has relationships with local religious liaisons who serve as advis-ers to student religious organizations and provide opportunities for students to engage with the larger Northampton community. An interfaith advisory group of students meet weekly to discuss the spiritual needs of students, plan joint activi-ties and foster dialogue. The center prioritizes contemplative practice, religious literacy, social justice and spiritual care, and also provides regular hospitality programming through its kitchen and lounge, offering meals and spaces for gathering in times of stress or need. The CSRL strives to meet the special needs of all students not just those who affiliate with an organized religious path. Cen-ter staff work with local clergy and faith leaders who help nurture the spiritual 22 The Campus and Campus Lifelives of students and provide opportunities to worship and observe. All students are welcome regardless of belief system or religious affiliation. Information about events can be found at www.smith.edu/religiouslife.     The Helen Hills Hills Chapel is home to a robust arts program as well. The Center for Religious and Spiritual Life sponsors concerts, lectures, films and ex-hibits by student and faculty musicians, and visiting artists. The college organist directs Handbell Choir rehearsals in the chapel and uses the Aolian-Skinner organ for teaching and performances. The CRSL collaborates with dining to respect dietary needs relating to religious observance. Kosher and halal meals are available to students in the Cutter-Ziskind dining room during the week. In addition, students prepare and host a kosher Shabbat meal and community gathering each Friday evening. A Jummah lunch is offered at noon every Friday for the Muslim community with the location rotating between the Helen Hills Hills Chapel and the prayer area in the basement of Wright Hall. Religious holidays such as Christmas, Ramadan, Passover, and Diwali are observed in collaboration with student and community groups.     College policy states that any student who is unable because of religious observance to attend classes, participate in an examination, study, or work on a particular day will be excused from such activities without prejudice and will be given an opportunity to make them up, provided such make-up work does not create an unreasonable burden on the college. No fees will be charged for rescheduling an examination. It is each student’s responsibility to request an excused absence from a faculty member well in advance of a religious holiday. In certain instances the CRSL will consult with students, faculty and staff when a religious consideration is in question. Students can also speak with the direc-tor of religious life/college chaplain when a religious consideration is raised with respect to housing needs.The Student Body 23The Student BodySummary of EnrollmentUndergraduate Students          Ada Comstock Class of 2018 Class of 2019 Class of 2020 Class of 2021 Scholars TotalsNorthampton area* 607 477 654 650 71 2,459Not in residence 27 146 12 0 2 187Five College course enrollments at Smith:  First semester  380 Second semester  450Graduate Students Full-time Part-time degree candidates degree candidates Special studentsIn residence 65 12 0Smith Students Studying in Off-campus Programs Florence Geneva Hamburg ParisSmith students 11 5 5 20Guest students 0 1 0 0*Guest students are included in the above counts.In accordance with the Student Right-To-Know and Campus Security Act, the graduation rate for students who entered Smith College as first-year students in Sep-tember 2011 was 88 percent by May 2017.

Each year approximately 25 percent of the graduating class is awarded the bachelor of arts degree with Latin Honors and/or departmental honors.Latin HonorsLatin Honors are awarded to eligible graduating seniors on the basis of the cumulative grade point average for a minimum of 48 graded credits earned during the sophomore, junior and senior years. Only grades from Smith College courses and courses taken on the Five College Interchange are counted; Smith Study Abroad grades are considered Smith grades. No grades from exchange programs in this country or abroad are counted. Pluses and minuses are taken into account; grades of P/F (Pass or Fail) or S/U (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory) do not enter into the calculations.     If a student spends one of her sophomore through senior years away from Smith (with the exception of the Smith Programs Abroad), the grades from the remaining two years will be used. Grades from the first year are never counted. The minimum grade point average for Latin Honors varies each year depending on the overall grade distribution in the senior class and is not published. The degree may be awarded cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude on the basis of meeting eligibility requirements and of a very high level of aca-demic achievement.    Students who wish to become eligible for Latin Honors at graduation mustelect at least one course (normally four credits) in each of the seven major fieldsof knowledge (literature, historical studies, social science, natural science, mathematics and analytical philosophy, the arts, and foreign language). Course listings in this catalog indicate in curly brackets which area(s) of knowledge a given course covers.     Please note that one year of an introductory language course or one course at a higher level satisfies the foreign language Latin Honors requirement. Students who are non-native speakers of English may, with the permission of a class dean, offer any two courses in the English department at the 100 level (or one course at a higher level in the English department, the comparative litera-ture program or in classics in translation) to satisfy the “foreign language” part of the Latin Honors requirement. The class dean will notify the registrar that such an arrangement has been approved. Any appeals should be sent to the dean of the faculty. Nonnative speakers of English are considered to be those who indicated on their advising form that English was not their first language, have had several years of education in a school where the language of instruction was other than English, and can read, write and speak this language. Eligibility for Latin Honors may be affected by the decisions of the Honor Board.Departmental HonorsA departmental honors program allows a student with a strong academic back-ground to do independent and original work in her major. The program pro-vides recognition for students who do work of high quality in the preparation of a thesis and in courses and seminars. Departmental honors students must also fulfill all college and departmental requirements.     Successful completion of work in the honors program (an honors thesis and at least one honors examination) leads to the awarding of the bachelor of arts degree with the added notation “Honors,” “High Honors” or “Highest Honors” in the student’s major subject.The Dean’s ListThe Dean’s List is made up of students who represent the top 25 percent of the student body based on the total records for the previous academic year. Students must be enrolled full-time at Smith for the full year to be named to the Dean’s List.Phi Beta KappaPhi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely recognized undergraduate honor society in the United States. The Greek initials stand for the society’s motto “Love of learning is the guide of life.” Since 1776, the mission of the society has been to foster and recognize excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The Zeta of Massachusetts Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society was established at Smith College in 1905. The rules of eligibility are set by the chapter in accordance with the national society; election is made on the breadth and excellence of overall academic achievement.     To be eligible for election, a student must have satisfied the Latin Honors distribution requirements and completed 58 graded credits of Smith course work, not counting the first year. Study abroad programs count for Smith credit only if they are Smith programs. Courses taken in the Five College consortium count as Smith credits. All other courses including those taken S/U may count for distribution requirements, but not as credits in the calculation of the GPA nor as part of the total credit requirement. Elections are held twice a year. In late fall of their senior year, “junior” Phi Beta Kappa members are elected on the basis of their academic records through the junior year. At the end of the spring semester, more seniors are elected based on their complete academic record. For questions about election criteria, students and faculty are urged to consult with the president or secretary of the chapter. More information about the Phi Beta Kappa Society, its history, publica-tions and activities can be found at www.pbk.org.Society of the Sigma XiIn 1935 Smith College became the first women’s college to be granted a charter for the establishment of a chapter of the Society of the Sigma Xi. Each year the Smith College Chapter elects to membership promising graduate students and seniors who excel in science.Recognition for Academic AchievementRecognition for Academic Achievement 27The following prizes are awarded at the Awards Convocation on Ivy Day.The Chinua Achebe Prize in Comparative Lit-erature to a graduating senior with the highest GPA in courses that count toward the comparative literature majorThe Margaret Collins Stoop Adesso Prize for the best new choral work composed by a Smith studentThe Anne Bradstreet Prize from the Academy of American Poets for the best poem or group of poems submitted by an undergraduateAn award from the Connecticut Valley Section of the American Chemical Society to a student who has done outstanding work in chemistry, biochem-istry or chemical engineeringThe American Chemical Society Analytical Chem-istry Award to a junior chemistry major who has excelled in analytical chemistryThe American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry to a chemistry major for excellence in inorganic chemistry and to encourage further study in the fieldThe American Chemical Society/Division of Or-ganic Chemistry Award in Organic ChemistryThe American Chemical Society/Polymer Ed-ucation Division Organic Chemistry Award for Achievement in Organic Chemistry to a student majoring in chemistry who has done outstanding work in the organic chemistry sequenceThe American Chemical Society Undergradu-ate Award in Physical Chemistry for outstanding achievement by an undergraduate student in physi-cal chemistry, and to encourage further pursuits in the fieldAn award from The American Institute of Chem-ists/New England Division to an outstanding chemist or chemical engineer in the graduating classThe Newton Arvin Prize in American Studies for the best long paper in the introductory course on the study of American Society and CultureThe Anita Luria Ascher Memorial Prize to asenior nonmajor who started German at Smith and has made exceptional progress, to a senior major who started German at Smith and has made ex-ceptional progress and to a senior who knew some German when she came to Smith and has made exceptional progressThe Astronomy Department Prize for Excellence in Astronomy and Astrophysics for honors theses, special studies projects, outreach or other educa-tional projects, STRIDE/AEMES projects, especially if they lead to continued involvement in the depart-ment, or exceptional performance in classes without any of the aboveThe Award for Excellence in Dance Studies for outstanding work in senior capstone project and overall contributions to the departmentThe Elizabeth Babcock Poetry Prize for the best group of poemsThe Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey Prize for innovative and collaborative approaches to solving environmental and sustainability problemsThe Sidney Balman Prize for outstanding work in the Jewish Studies ProgramThe Harriet Dey Barnum Memorial Prize for outstanding work in music to the best all-around student of music in the senior classThe Gladys Lampert ’28 and Edward Beenstock Prize for the best honors thesis in American studies or American historyThe Suzan Rose Benedict Prize to a sophomore for excellence in mathematicsThe Samuel Bowles Prize for the best paper on an anthropological subjectThe Samuel Bowles Prize for the best paper in economicsThe Samuel Bowles Prize for the best paper on a sociological subjectThe Kathleen Bostwick Boyden Prize awarded to a member of the Service Organizations of Smith who has demonstrated the best initiative in her volunteer contributions to the Smith College communityThe John Everett Brady Prize for excellence in the translation of Latin at sight; and for the best perfor-mance in the beginning Latin courseThe Margaret Wemple Brigham Prize to a senior for excellence in the study of microbiology or im-munologyThe Amey Randall Brown Prize awarded for the best essay on a botanical subjectThe Vera Lee Brown Prize for excellence in history to a senior majoring in history in regular courseThe Yvonne Sarah Bernhardt Buerger Prize to the students who have made the most notable con-tribution to the dramatic activities of the collegeThe David C.

It is also a financial chal-lenge for many families. At Smith, we encourage all qualified students to apply for admission, regardless of family financial resources. Our students come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. The Office of Student Financial Ser-vices has an experienced staff to assist students and parents in both the individ-ual financial aid application process and the educational financing process in general. We work with families to help them manage the financial challenge in a variety of ways, through financial aid, loans and payment plan options. Many Smith students receive financial assistance to pay for college expenses. Smith College participates in all the major federal and state student aid pro-grams while funding a substantial institutional grant and scholarship program from its endowment. We realize that financing a college education is a complex process, and we encourage applicants and their families to communicate directly with us. Our experienced educational financing staff in the Office of Student Financial Ser-vices is available to work with you. Inquiries may be made by calling 413-585-2530 between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Wednesdays (Eastern time). Send email to SFS@smith.edu or visit their website at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal.Your Student AccountSmith College considers the student to be responsible for ensuring that pay-ments—whether from loans, grants, parents, or other third parties—are received in a timely manner. All student accounts are managed by the Office of Student Financial Services. Initial statements detailing semester fees are avail-able online on or about July 15 and December 15. Email notifications will be sent to all students on or about the 15th of each month in which there is activity on the account. Students who wish to designate a parent or other third party to be notified of bills and to have the ability to make payments on their student account must set the designee up as an “authorized user” through their online account. Important: no paper bills are mailed. The college’s comprehensive fees associated with the beginning of the se-mester are due and payable in full by specific deadline dates, well in advance of the beginning of classes. The payment deadline for fall is August 10. For spring, the payment deadline is January 10. Payment must be received by these dates to avoid late payment fees being assessed. Checks should be made payable to Smith College and include the student’s name and ID number on the front.     After any payment is due, monthly late payment fees, which are based on the outstanding balance remaining after any payment due date, will be assessed at the rate of $1.25 on every $100 (1.25 percent) that remains unpaid until the payment is received in full, on or before the next billing month in which the student is invoiced. If you have questions regarding any charges or credits on your bill, contact the Office of Student Financial Services.     In cases where students default on financial obligations, the student is re-sponsible for paying the outstanding balance including all late payment fees, collection costs and any legal fees incurred by the college during the collection process. Transcripts and other academic records will not be released until all financial obligations to the college have been met.     IMPORTANT NOTE: Payments for each month’s bill must be received by the Office of Student Financial Services by the payment due date. If paying by mail, please allow at least five to seven business days for mail and processing time. If paying in person, payment should be made before 4 p.m. on the payment due date. Electronic ACH payments made through our online billing service are credited immediately. The college expects the student to fulfill her financial responsibility and reserves the right to place limitations on the student for failure to do so. The consequences of nonpayment include possible loss of housing assignment, and prevention of: a) registration for future semester courses, b) receipt of academic transcripts, c) receipt of diploma at commencement, d) approval for a leave of absence or study-abroad program, and e) participation in leadership training opportunities. The college also reserves the right to have the student admin-istratively withdrawn and may refer such account for collection in her name. Students and parents are welcome to contact the Office of Student Financial Services for assistance in meeting payment responsibilities.     Most credit balance refunds are issued on request, by direct deposit into the account the student has on file with the payroll office. Credit balances that result from a PLUS loan are generally issued to the parent borrower, unless that parent has authorized that refunds go to the student. With the student’s written release, credit balance refunds may be issued to the parent or the designee of the student.Fees2018–19 Comprehensive Fee (required institutional fees)  Fall Semester Spring Semester TotalTuition $26,060 $26,060 $52,120Room and Board* 8,760 8,760 17,520Student activities fee 142 142 284_________________________________________________Comprehensive fee $34,962 $34,962 $69,924* Room and board will be billed as a combined charge.As part of her expenses, a student should be prepared to spend a minimum of $800 per year on books and academic supplies. In addition, a student will incur additional expenses during the academic year that will vary according to her standard of living, personal needs, recreational activities and number of trips home.Fee for Nonmatriculated Student Per credit $1,630  Fees for Ada Comstock ScholarsTransient Housing (per semester) Room only (weekday nights) $595 Room and full meal plan (weekday nights) $1,235Tuition per semester 1–7 credits (per credit) $1,630 8–11 credits $13,040 12–15 credits $19,560 16 or more credits $26,060Student Activities FeeThe $284 student activities fee is split between the two semesters and is used to fund chartered student organizations on campus. The Student Government As-sociation allocates the monies each year. Each spring, the Senate Finance Com-mittee of the SGA proposes a budget that is voted on by the student body.Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid32 Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid2018–19 Optional FeesStudent Medical Insurance–$2,368The $2,368 Student Medical Insurance fee is split between the two semesters and covers the student from August 15 through the following August 14. January grad-uates are covered only through January 14 in their senior year. Massachusetts law requires that each student have comprehensive health insurance; Smith College offers a medical insurance plan through Gallagher Koster Insurance (www.galla-gherstudent.com) for those students not otherwise insured. Details about the insur-ance are mailed during the summer. Students are automatically billed for this insurance unless they follow the waiver process outlined in the insurance mailing. Students must waive the insurance coverage by August 10 in order to avoid pur-chasing the annual Smith Plan. If a student is on leave on a Smith-approved pro-gram that is billed at home-school fees, a reduced charge may apply. For students who are admitted for spring semester, the charge will be $1,375  for 2018–19.Other Fees and ChargesEnrollment Deposit–$500Upon admittance, a new student pays an enrollment deposit which serves to reserve her place in the class and a room if she will reside in campus housing. The $300 representing a general deposit component is held until six months after the student graduates from the college. The $300 is refunded only after de-ducting any unpaid fees or fines and is not refunded to a student who withdraws (including an admitted student who does not attend). The $200 representing a room deposit component is credited $100 in July toward fall semester charges and $100 in December toward spring semester charges. For midyear transfer students, all $200 is credited toward spring semester charges.Fee for Musical Instruction–$690 per semester (one-hour lesson per week)Music fees are covered by the college for all declared minors and majors. Students who receive need-based aid will receive a $200 grant per semester toward the cost of performance lessons. In addition, all students registered for performance lessons can submit an application to the music department for scholarship aid (for those receiving need-based aid, these funds are in addition to the aforementioned $200 grant).     Practice rooms are available to Smith College students with first preference given to those registered for music instruction. Other Five College students may apply to the chair of the music department for permission to use the facilities. Practice rooms may be available for use by other individuals in last order of preference upon successful application to the chair of the music department.     There is no charge for Five College students, faculty and staff for use of the practice rooms. For other individuals, the following fee will apply. Use of a practice room, one hour daily $25Fee for Riding Classes—per semesterRiding lessons are available to all students at the college. The lessons are held at Soneleigh-Burnham Equestrian Center in Greenfield, Massachusetts (a 20 minute ride from the Smith College campus). Smith College has vans available for students to drive to Greenfield. The Smith riding team uses this facility for practice and horse shows. The fee for each semester is $950. Questions can be directed to the Athletics Department at 585-2706.Studio Art Courses—per semesterCertain materials and supplies are required for studio art courses and will be provided to each student. Students may require additional supplies as well and will be responsible for purchasing them directly. The expenses will vary from course to course and from student to student. Required materials $138 Additional supplies $59Chemistry Laboratory Course—$25 per semesterContinuation Fee—$60 per semesterStudents on leave of absence or attending other institutions on exchange or junior year abroad programs will be assessed a continuation fee to maintain enrollment status at the college.Overdue Balance FeeAny balance outstanding for fall after August 10 or for spring after January 10 is considered overdue. Overdue balances will be assessed a late fee of $1.25 per $100 each month they remain outstanding.Insufficient Funds FeeIf a payment is rejected due to insufficient funds, a charge of $20 will be added to the student account.Incorrect Account Number FeeIf an incorrect or invalid account number is entered into our TouchNet payment system when a payer is attempting to make a payment, a $5 charge will be add-ed to the student account.Early Arrival Fee–$150Late Registration Fee–$35Students who make registration changes after the registration period will be assessed a fee for each change.Bed Removal Fee–$100Students who remove their beds from their campus rooms will be charged a bed removal fee.Health/Fire/Safety Violation–$5 per itemA minimum fine of $5 per item will be charged for items left in public areas such as corridors, stairways or entrances. These items create a hazard and vio-late compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as city and state building, fire and safety codes.Institutional Refund PolicyA refund will be calculated if a student withdraws on or after the first day of classes but before the point when the college is considered to have earned all the tuition, room, board and mandatory fees (hereinafter called institutional charges) for which the student was charged. Credit balances remaining on any account will be refunded to the appropriate person or agency.Adjustment of Institutional Charges and Institutional AidAny student who withdraws prior to the first day of classes will receive a 100 percent adjustment of institutional charges and insurance. All disbursed Title IV aid, institutional aid, state and other aid will be returned to the appropriate account by the college.    A student who withdraws after the first day of classes, but before the time when she will have completed 60 percent of the period of enrollment, will have her institutional charges and institutional aid adjusted based on the percentage of class attendance.     If a student should withdraw from an off-campus program, which is billed by Smith (for example: Study Abroad, Picker and Smithsonian Programs), the normal college refund policies apply as long as all payments can be recovered by the college. If payments made on behalf of the student to other entities can-not be recovered by the college, the student is responsible for unrecoverable costs.Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid 33 Students who withdraw from study-abroad programs that are approved, but not administered by Smith College will have a proration of charges and aid based on the enrollment dates of the program, rather than those of Smith Col-lege. After the 60 percent point of the program term, the student is not entitled to a refund of charges and is also responsible for unrecoverable costs.Students Receiving Title IV Federal AidPer federal regulations, a student earns her aid based on the period of time she remains enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than Federal Work Study, must be returned to the appropriate federal agency. During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time she remains enrolled. A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60 percent point earns all the aid for the payment period. For example, if the period of enrollment is 100 days and the student completes 25 days, then she has earned 25 percent of her aid. The remainder of the aid must be returned to the appropriate federal agency.Other ChargesIf a student has not waived, or has accepted the medical insurance and with-draws from the college during the first 31 days of the period for which coverage is purchased, and she has not used the insurance, she will not be covered under the plan and a full credit of the premium will be made. Insured students with-drawing at or after 31 days will remain covered under the plan for the full period for which the premium has been paid and no refund will be made available.     Other charges, such as library fines, parking fines and infirmary charges are not adjusted upon the student’s withdrawal. Contractual LimitationsIf Smith College’s performance of its educational objectives, support services or lodging and food services is hampered or restrained on account of strikes, fire, shipping delays, acts of God, prohibition or restraint of governmental authority, or other similar causes beyond Smith College’s control, Smith College shall not be liable to anyone, except to the extent of allowing in such cases a pro-rata reduction in fees or charges already paid to Smith College.Payment Plans and Loan OptionsSmith offers a variety of payment plan and loan options to assist you in success-fully planning for timely payment of your college bill.• Semester Plan• Touch Net Payment PlanSmith also honors parent and student loan options.Details on loan options and the payment plan can be found on the Web at www.smith.edu/about-smith/sfs.Financial AidWe welcome women from all economic backgrounds. No woman should hesitate to apply to Smith because of an inability to pay the entire cost of her education. We meet the full documented financial need of all admitted under-graduates who have met the published admission and financial aid deadlines. Awards are offered to applicants on the basis of need, and calculated according to established college and federal policies. An award is usually a combination of a grant, a loan and a campus job. Smith College is committed to a financial aid policy that guarantees to meet the full financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students who meet published deadlines. The college does operate under a need-sensitive admission policy that typically affects less than 6 percent of our applicant pool. Each applicant for admission is evaluated on the basis of her academic and personal qualities. However, the college may choose to consider a student’s level of financial need when making the final admission decision. Applicants are advised to complete the financial aid process if they will need financial help to attend Smith. Entering first-year students who fail to apply for financial aid by the published deadlines will be ineligible to receive college-funded assistance until they have completed 64 credits earned at Smith. Transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars who do not apply for financial aid by the published dead-lines are eligible to apply after completing 32 credits earned at Smith. Students may apply for federal aid at any point during the academic year. International students (not U.S. citizens or permanent residents) who do not apply for aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid at any time during their tenure at Smith.     To enable the college to determine a student’s need, a family completes both the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholar-ship Service PROFILE form, requesting that data be sent to Smith. Both forms are completed on-line. The FAFSA can be accessed at www.fafsa.ed.gov (Smith College code is 002209) and the PROFILE can be accessed at www.collegeboard.com (Smith College code is 3762).     Students must also complete the Smith Aid Application, available at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal.     We also require a signed copy of the family’s most recent federal tax returns, including all schedules and W-2’s. Other forms and documents may be required, based on each family’s circumstances. Once we receive a completed application, we review each student’s file individually. We take into consideration the number of dependents, the number of family members in college, divorced parents and other special circumstances. For international applicants, the CSS Profile and an official income statement or income tax return are required to determine financial and eligibility.     Smith College recognizes the diversity of the modern family, and requires the submission of information regarding both legal or biological or adoptive parents, as well as spouses and domestic partners of each parent. Exceptions to this policy are made on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the Office of Student Financial Services for more information.     The college makes the final decision on the level of need and awards. Fi-nancial aid decisions to entering students are announced simultaneously with admission notifications. College policy limits the awards of Smith funds to the level of billed fees.   A student who is awarded aid at admission will have it renewed each year she attends according to her need, as calculated by the college, if she is in good academic standing. She and her family apply for aid annually with Smith Col-lege forms, FAFSA and PROFILE forms, and tax returns. The amount of aid may vary from year to year depending on changes in college fees and in the family’s financial circumstances. The balance of loan, work and grant also changes, based on federal loan limits and college policy. Instructions for renewing aid are made available to all students in December. Traditional students (not Ada Com-stock Scholars) are expected to complete their undergraduate studies in eight semesters, and grant aid is limited to that period, except for special programs or in circumstances involving medical withdrawal.     Ada Comstock Scholars receiving financial aid are required to make satis-factory progress toward the degree in order to continue receiving aid—that is, completion of at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic year. Progress is evaluated on a semester basis. Students not meeting this criterion are put on financial aid warning. Students may be required to appeal in writing to continue to receive federal financial aid and may become ineligible for aid if the probationary period exceeds one year.     Unless the administrative board decides that mitigating circumstances warrant an exception, no financial aid will be available to a student who is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree.34 Fees, Expenses and Financial AidFirst-Year Applicants (U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Undocumented U.S. Residents)Any student who needs or may need help in financing her education should apply for financial aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission. Students must not wait until they have been accepted for admission to apply for aid. Each student’s file is carefully reviewed to determine eligibility for need-based aid. Since this is a detailed process, the college expects students to follow published application guidelines and to meet the appropriate application deadlines. Students and parents are encouraged to contact Student Financial Services via email at sfs@smith.edu or by phone (413-585-2530) with questions. Detailed information on the application process and deadlines is available on our website at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal.     The consequences of not applying for aid prior to being accepted for ad-mission include a 64-credit waiting period before becoming eligible to receive college grant aid. This means that only federal, state and private assistance would be available for the first two years of undergraduate enrollment at Smith. The college will consider exceptions to this policy only if you experience and can document an unexpected family emergency. Please note that this policy does not pertain to students who, prior to admission to Smith, applied for but were not granted need-based financial aid.     If an entering student applied for but did not qualify for need-based aid in her first year, that student may reapply for aid in subsequent years. This is par-ticularly important for families that experience changes in family circumstanc-es such as a sibling entering college, reductions in parent income, divorce or separation, or unanticipated medical expenses. Students who want to apply for federal aid only have a modified application process. If there are major changes to the financial resources of the family, Student Financial Services will consider a new request for aid or a review of a previous denial at any time.     The college cannot assume responsibility for family unwillingness to contribute to college expenses. There are limited circumstances that qualify a student for consideration as an independent aid applicant. Women over the age of 24, orphans and wards of the court are always considered self-supporting for federal financial aid purposes. Students who meet the federal definition of independent status are not automatically considered independent by the college. Please contact SFS to discuss questions regarding this situation.Transfer StudentsTransfer students should follow the application procedures detailed on their specific financial aid applications. Transfer students who do not apply for aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission, cannot apply for college aid until they reach junior standing and complete at least 32 credits at Smith.Ada Comstock ScholarsWomen of nontraditional college age can apply to the Ada Comstock Scholars Program. Applicants for aid should complete a Free Application for Federal Stu-dent Aid (FAFSA), the Ada Comstock Scholars program Application for Financial Aid and send us a signed copy of their most recent federal tax return, complete with all schedules and W-2’s as well as their spouse or partner’s complete tax return and W-2’s.     An Ada Comstock Scholar who does not apply for aid by the published dead-lines, prior to admission, cannot apply for institutional grant aid until she has completed 32 credits at Smith, although she may qualify for federal and state grants and loans before she has completed 32 credits. This policy does not apply to women who applied for, but were not granted, aid at the time of admission.International ApplicantsSmith College awards need-based aid to international non-U.S. citizens, both first-year and transfer applicants. There is a great deal of competition for these funds, and the level of support provided from the college ranges widely, depending on particular family circumstances. Aid is determined based on the information provided by the family on the CSS Profile, along with translated tax or income statements. International students not awarded financial aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid from the college at any time.     The application deadline is January 25.     Non-U.S. citizens eligible for aid have a family contribution calculated prior to admission. This family contribution will remain the same throughout the student’s tenure at Smith. Any increases in tuition and fees not covered by the annual increased loan or work will be covered by an increase in the grant so that the calculated family contribution will remain the same each year. (Loan and campus job amounts, which are part of the total aid package, increase each year as part of standard college policy. For application deadlines and details, please check www.smith.edu/sfs.)U.S. Citizens Living Outside the U.S.Follow procedures for applicants residing in the United States. If your parents are living and earning income outside the United States and do not file U.S. tax returns, you should submit translated tax or income statements.     U.S. citizens and permanent residents must reapply for aid each year.Policy for Review and Appeal of Need-Based Financial Aid AwardsA student has the right to request a review of her financial aid award. Domestic students must reapply for financial aid each year, and thus are automatically reviewed on an annual basis. International students are given a family contri-bution determination at the time of admission for their entire Smith career and thus are only eligible for a review at the time of admission.Domestic StudentsDomestic students may request a review of their financial aid awards at any time during their Smith careers if there has been a significant change in family circumstances since filing the application for financial aid or if the information on the original application was inaccurate.International StudentsInternational students seeking a financial aid adjustment after they have ac-cepted an offer of admission must consult with Student Financial Services (SFS) to review the situation and discuss available options. The financial aid budget for international students is fully allocated each year as of the time of admis-sion, therefore only very limited additional resources are made available to meet extraordinary circumstances. Serious consideration is only given when there has been a significant life-changing event. A life-changing event would include, but is not limited to, the death of a parent or enrollment of a sibling in a U.S. col-lege or university. If you wish to appeal your financial aid award, please begin by contacting Student Financial Services.ProcessWhen a review is requested it is conducted by the SFS Review Committee. In most cases, their decision is final. When the issue under review would require an exception to policy, a student may request it be reviewed by the Financial Aid Ap-peals Committee. Instructions for submitting an appeal will be provided by the SFS staff to the student if a policy is at issue. All reviews from international stu-dents for increased grant or loan assistance are considered exceptions to policy and will be brought to the attention of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee.     The Financial Aid Appeals Committee is chaired by the dean of enrollment and includes one member of the faculty, the dean of students and a member of the finance office. The director of SFS is a nonvoting member of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. The student must present her appeal in writing. The committee will consider the appeal as soon as possible. It normally takes one to two weeks for this committee to convene and review the appeal(s) in question. A decision will be given in writing to the student within 48 hours after the appeal is heard. The decision of the Appeals Committee is final in all cases.Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid 35Need-Based Financial Aid AwardsFinancial aid awards are made up of loans, campus jobs and grants. A loan and job, both considered self-help, are usually the first components of an aid pack-age, with any remaining need being met with grant aid.LoansMost students borrow through the Federal Direct Ford Loan Program. Some awards may also include a Smith College loan. Most parents are eligible to bor-row under the Federal Parent Loan Program. Students who receive aid of any sort from federal funds are subject to the statutes governing such aid.Campus JobsStudent Financial Services administers campus jobs. All students may apply, but priority is given to those students (about one-half of our student body) who received campus job offers as part of their aid packages. First-year students may work an average of eight hours a week for 32 weeks. Students in other classes may hold regular jobs averaging ten hours a week for 32 weeks. These monies are paid directly to each student as she earns them. They are intended primarily to cover personal expenses, but some students use part or all of their earnings to-ward required fees. Short-term jobs are open to all students. Additionally, a term-time internship program is administered by the Career Development Office. The college participates in the federally funded Work-Study Program, which funds a portion of the earnings of eligible students, some of them in nonprofit, commu-nity service positions and in the America Reads tutorial program. Smith College also provides a need-based employment program for those students eligible for need-based work, but not eligible for the federally subsidized Federal Work-Study Program.     No student, whether on federal work-study or not, is permitted to work more than the maximum 10-hours a week or one “full-time” position. First-year students may work a maximum of eight hours per week. Students receiving a stipend for such positions as STRIDE or HCA  are not eligible for a second job. This policy attempts to offer all students an equal opportunity to work.GrantsGrants are funds given to students with no requirement of repayment or work time in exchange. Most Smith College grants come from funds given for this purpose by alumnae and friends of the college and by foundations and corpora-tions. Federal and state governments also provide assistance through need-based grants such as the Federal Pell Grant and state scholarships. Smith receives an allocation each year for Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and for state-funded Gilbert Grants for Massachusetts residents.Outside AidOutside Aid Awarded on the Basis of Student Merit or Parent EmploymentSmith College recognizes your achievement in being awarded merit-based aid. Outside aid based on student merit or parent employment will first reduce or replace the self-help portion of your award (work-study and federal subsidized loan). If the outside aid exceeds the total self-help portion of your award, the aid can go toward a one-time computer purchase or toward the cost of the on-campus health insurance plan. If you do not purchase or have already purchased a computer, and if you do not accept the on-campus health insur-ance plan, or if your merit aid exceeds these costs, outside aid will replace Smith Grant on a dollar-for-dollar basis.     Note: GEARUP scholarships are considered within this category as outside scholarships.     Student Financial Services must be notified of all outside awards. If you notify SFS by June 1, the aid will be reflected in your official award and on your first bill. If you notify SFS after September 1, the outside aid may be used to re-duce Smith Grant dollar for dollar.State and Federal Grant AssistanceThese awards reduce Smith Grant eligibility dollar for dollar. Educational benefits from state and federal agencies will reduce the self-help components of the award (loan and work). Need-based loans from state or outside agencies can be used to replace dollar for dollar either the suggested federal loan or the work study award. Amounts in excess of the self-help award will replace Smith Grant dollar for dollar.Music GrantsStudents who receive need-based aid will receive a $200 grant per semester toward the cost of performance lessons. In addition, all students registered for performance lessons can submit an application to the music department for scholarship aid (for those receiving need-based aid, these funds are in addition to the aforementioned $200 grant). ROTCAir Force ROTC is available at most colleges and universities in western Mas-sachusetts, including Smith College. Air Force ROTC offers two-, three- and four-year enlistment scholarships to qualified new and continuing college students.

Admitting students who will thrive in the Smith environment remains the goal of our ad-mission efforts. We seek students who will be productive members of the Smith community, who will be challenged by all that is offered here and who will chal-lenge their faculty members and peers to sharpen their ideas and perspectives of the world. Each year we enroll a first-year class of approximately 600 able, motivated, diverse students whose records show academic achievement, intellectual curios-ity and potential for growth. Because our students come from 48 states and 73 countries, their educational and personal experiences and opportunities vary tremendously. In selecting a class, the Board of Admission, which is made up of faculty members as well as members of the admission staff, considers each student in the light of the opportunities available to her. Included in the board’s review are her secondary school record, the recommendations from her school, her essay and any other available information.     Smith College meets fully the documented financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students. About 60 percent of our students receive some form of financial assistance through grants, loans and/or campus jobs. Further information about financial planning for a Smith education and about financial aid is available in the section on Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid.Secondary School PreparationThere is no typical applicant to Smith and no typical academic program, but we strongly recommend that a student prepare for Smith by taking the strongest courses offered by her high school. Specifically this should include the follow-ing, at a minimum where possible:• four years of English• three years of a foreign language (or two years in each of two languages)• three years of mathematics• three years of lab science• two years of historyBeyond meeting the normal minimum requirements, we expect each candidate to pursue in greater depth academic interests of special importance to her. Can-didates who are interested in our engineering major should pursue coursework in calculus, biology, chemistry and physics.     Smith College will accept college-level work completed prior to matricula-tion as a degree student, provided that the relevant courses were completed at an accredited college or university and were not applied to the requirements for high school graduation. We also give credit for excellent performance in Ad-vanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and equivalent foreign exam-inations. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for further information regarding eligibility for and use of such credit.Entrance TestsSAT I or ACT scores are optional for U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. Standardized tests (SAT I, ACT, TOEFL, IELTS or PTE as appropriate) are re-quired for international citizens. SAT II subject tests are not required for any ap-plicant. If a student wishes to submit a score or is required to do so, she should take the exams in her junior year to keep open the possibility of Early Decision. All examinations taken through December of the senior year are acceptable. The results of examinations taken after December arrive too late for us to include them in the decision-making process.     Whether required or optional, scores must come directly from the testing agency or the secondary school transcript. The College Board code number for Smith College is 3762. The ACT code is 1894.Applying for AdmissionA student interested in Smith has three options for applying—Early Decision I, Early Decision II and Regular Decision. Visit www.smith.edu/admission for infor-mation about requirements and deadlines.Early DecisionEarly Decision I and II Plans are designed for students with strong qualifications who have selected Smith as their first choice. The plans differ from each other only in application deadline, recognizing that students may decide on their college preference at different times. In making an application to her first choice college, a candidate eliminates much of the anxiety, effort and cost of preparing several college applications. Candidates under this plan may initiate applications to other colleges, but may make an Early Decision application to one college only. It is im-portant to note that if accepted under Early Decision, a candidate must withdraw all other college applications and may not make any further applications.     Applicants deferred in either Early Decision plan will be reconsidered in the spring, together with applicants in the Regular Decision Plan. Offers of admis-sion are made with the understanding that the high school record continues to be of high quality through the senior year. If they have applied for financial aid by the published deadlines, candidates will be notified of financial aid decisions at the same time as the admission decision.Regular DecisionThe Regular Decision Plan is designed for students who wish to keep open several college options during the application process. Candidates may submit applications anytime before the January 15 deadline.     A student interested in Smith should apply using either the Common Ap-plication or the Coalition Application. Smith does not have a preference for one application over the other; both of these application types will receive equal con-sideration in our admission process. Please visit www.commonapp.org or www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org for all required forms and instructions.     We realize that applying to college involves a lot of time-consuming paper-work for the applicant. It is work that we review carefully and thoroughly, and we suggest that applicants do not leave it to the last moment.Advanced PlacementSmith College participates in the Advanced Placement Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for information governing eligibility for and use of Ad-vanced Placement credit.International BaccalaureateThe amount of credit will be determined as soon as an official copy of results has been sent to the registrar’s office. Guidelines for use are comparable to those for Advanced Placement.Admission 37InterviewWe recommend an interview for all candidates. For those who live or attend school within 200 miles of the college an on-campus interview is encouraged. Others should visit our website to obtain the name of an alumna interviewer in their area. The interview allows each candidate to become better acquainted with Smith and to exchange information with a member of the staff of the Of-fice of Admission or a trained alumna volunteer.Deferred EntranceAn admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith’s offer and paid the required deposit may defer her entrance to work, travel or pursue a special interest if she makes this request in writing by June 1 to the dean of admission, who will review the request and notify the stu-dent within two weeks.Deferred Entrance for Medical ReasonsAn admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith’s offer and paid the required deposit may request to postpone her entrance due to medical reasons if she makes this request in writing, explaining the nature of the medical problem, to the dean of admission prior to the first day of classes. At that time, the college will outline expectations for progress over the course of the year. A Board of Admission subcommittee will meet the following March to review the student’s case. Readmission is not guaranteed.Transfer AdmissionA student may apply for transfer to Smith College in January or September after the completion of one or more semesters at another institution.     For January entrance, she must submit her application and send all creden-tials by November 15. The suggested filing date for September entrance is Febru-ary 1, especially for students applying for financial aid. The application deadline is May 15. Letters from the financial aid office are mailed at the same time as admission letters.     We expect a transfer student to have a strong academic record and to be in good standing at the institution she is attending. We look particularly for evidence of achievement in college, although we also consider her secondary school record. Her program should correlate with the general Smith College requirements.     We require a candidate for the degree of bachelor of arts to spend at least two years in residence at Smith College in Northampton, during which time she normally completes 64 credits. A student may not transfer to the junior class and spend any part of the junior or senior year studying in off-campus programs.International StudentsWe welcome applications from qualified international students and advise applicants to communicate with the Office of Admission at least one year in advance of their proposed entrance. The initial email or letter should include information about the student’s complete academic background. If financial aid is needed, this fact should be made clear in the initial correspondence.Visiting Year ProgramsSmith College welcomes a number of guest students for a semester or a year of study. In the Visiting Student Program, students enrolled in accredited, four-year liberal arts colleges or universities in the United States may apply to spend all or part of their sophomore, junior or senior year at Smith.     International students may apply to spend one semester or a year at Smith under the International Visiting Program. Applicants must be in their final year of studies leading to university entrance in their own country or currently enrolled in a university program abroad. If accepted, candidates will be expected to present examination results—Baccalaureate, Abitur or GCSE, for example—before enrolling. Evidence of English fluency will be required of applicants whose first language is not English.     Applicants for visiting programs should complete the Common Application for Transfer students. All required forms and instructions for completing the ap-plication are available on the Common Application website. Applications must be completed by July 1 for September entrance and by November 15 for January entrance. Financial aid is not available for these programs.     Information and application material may be obtained by visiting www.smith.edu/admission-aid or sending email to admission@smith.edu.ReadmissionSee the Withdrawal and Readmission section. Ada Comstock Scholars ProgramThe admission process for Ada Comstock Scholars is competitive. Particular em-phasis is placed on academic achievement, an autobiographical essay and an exchange of information in the required interview. A candidate should schedule her interview appointment before submitting her application prior to the appro-priate deadline, November 15 for January admission or February 1 for Septem-ber admission. Interviews are usually conducted in person. Phone interviews can be arranged if distance is an issue. It is recommended that an applicant bring unofficial copies of her college transcripts to her interview appointment.     Ada Comstock Scholars are expected to have completed approximately 48 transferable liberal arts credits before matriculation at Smith. The average number of transfer credits for an admitted student is 52. Those students who offer little or no college-level work are advised to enroll elsewhere to fulfill this requirement before initiating the application process. A candidate’s status as an Ada Comstock Scholar must be designated at the time of application. Normally, an applicant admitted as a student of traditional age will not be permitted to change her class status to Ada Comstock Scholar until five years after she withdraws as a student of traditional age. A woman who meets the transfer credit guideline must apply as an Ada Comstock Scholar if she also meets the federal government’s guidelines defining independent stu-dents:• at least 24 years old by December 31 of the academic year in which they enter Smith• a veteran• responsible for dependent(s) other than a spouse A brief description of the program can be found on page 14. Information about expenses and procedures for applying for financial aid can be found in the section entitled Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid. Inquiries in writing, by phone or by email may be addressed to the Office of Admission.38 Academic Rules and ProceduresRequirements for the DegreeThe requirements for the degree from Smith College are completion of 128 credits of academic work and satisfactory completion of a major. For graduation the minimum standard of performance is a cumulative average of 2.0 in all academic work and satisfactory completion (grade of C- or higher) of a writing intensive course in the first two semesters of enrollment.  Students earning a bachelor of arts degree must complete at least 64 credits outside the department or program of the major (56 credits for majors requir-ing the study of two foreign languages taught within a single department or program). Consult the “Academic Program” section for additional detail. The requirements for the bachelor of science degree in engineering are listed in the courses of study section under Engineering. Candidates for the degree must complete at least four semesters of academic work, a minimum of 64 credits, in academic residence at Smith College in Northampton; two of these semesters must be completed during the junior or senior year. Courses taken through the Five College Interchange count toward the 64-credit academic residence requirement. A student on a Smith Study Abroad Program, the Jean Picker Semester-in-Washington Program or the Internship Pro-gram at the Smithsonian Institution is not in academic residence in Northampton. Each student is responsible for knowing all regulations governing the cur-riculum and course registration and is responsible for planning a course of study in accordance with those regulations and the requirements for the degree.Course ProgramThe normal course program for traditional-aged undergraduates consists of 16 credits taken in each of eight semesters at Smith. Only with the approval of the administrative board may a student complete her degree requirements in fewer or more than eight semesters. The minimum course program for a traditional-aged undergraduate in any semester is 12 credits. A traditional-aged student who is enrolled in fewer than 12 credits in any semester is required to withdraw at the end of that semester. The student must remain away from the college for at least one semester and then may request readmission for the following semester. Approved summer session or interterm credit may be used to supplement a minimum 12-credit program or to make up a shortage of credits. Smith stu-dents may accrue a maximum of 12 summer session credits and 12 interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree. An overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits may be applied toward the degree. A student enters her senior year after completing a maximum of six semes-ters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter the senior year with fewer than 96 credits: exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student’s return to campus for her final two semesters. A student in residence may carry no more than 24 cred-its per semester unless approved by the administrative board.Admission to CoursesInstructors are not required to hold spaces for students who do not attend the first class meeting and may refuse admittance to students seeking to add courses who have not attended the first class meetings.PermissionsSome courses require written permission of the instructor and/or chair of the department concerned before the course is elected.Academic Rules and Procedures A student who does not have the prerequisites for a course may elect it only with the permission of the instructor and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. A student must petition the administrative board for permission to enter or drop a yearlong course with credit at midyear. The petition must be signed by the instructor of the course, the student’s adviser and the chair of the depart-ment concerned before it is submitted to the class dean.SeminarsSeminars are limited to 12 students and are open, by permission of the instruc-tor, to juniors, seniors and graduate students only. At the discretion of the in-structor and with the approval of the department chair or the program director, 15 students may enroll. If enrollment exceeds this number, the instructor will select the best-qualified candidates.Special StudiesPermission of the instructor, the department chair and in some cases the de-partment is required for the election of special studies. Special studies are open only to qualified sophomores, juniors and seniors. A maximum of 16 credits of special studies may be counted toward the degree. The deadline for submission of the special studies application is the fifth day of classes in the semester. Normally students may not change the designated number of credits for a variable-credit special studies.AuditingA degree student at Smith or at the Five Colleges may audit a course on a regu-lar basis if space is available and the permission of the instructor is obtained. An audit is not recorded on the transcript.Auditing by Nonmatriculated StudentsA nonmatriculated student who has earned a high school diploma and who wishes to audit a course may do so with the permission of the instructor and the registrar. An auditor must submit a completed registration form to the registrar’s office by the end of the second week of classes. A fee will be charged and is de-termined by the type of course. Studio classes may not be audited except by per-mission of the art faculty following a written request to the department. Official records of audits are not maintained.Course RegistrationEarly RegistrationEligible students are expected to participate in the early registration periods, normally scheduled in November and April. During the two-week early registra-tion period, students may register for no more than 19 credits.Adding and Dropping CoursesDuring the first 10 class days of a semester, a student may add or drop a course with the approval of the adviser and after consultation with the instructor. Dur-ing this period, a student may register for up to 24 credits. Courses may be added online through BannerWeb during the first five class days only. From the 6th to the 10th day students may add courses with the permission of the instructor and adviser; from the 11th through the 15th day of class, a student may add a course with the permission of the instructor, the adviser and the class dean. After the 10th day of classes a student may drop a course up to the end of the fifth week of the semester under the following conditions.Academic Rules and Procedures 391. after discussion with the instructor;2. with the approval of the adviser and the class dean; and3. if, after dropping the course, she is enrolled in at least 12 credits. (This provi-sion does not apply to Ada Comstock Scholars.)After the end of the fifth week of the semester a student may not drop a course. However, on two and only two occasions during her years at the college—once during her first year; once during any subsequent year—a student may “free drop” a course at any time up to the end of the ninth week of classes, for any reason, without penalty. The drop form requires the signatures of the instructor, adviser and class dean. All add and drop deadlines for half-semester courses are prorated according to the above schedule and are published online each semester at the registrar’s office website. A student should carefully consider the work load entailed in a seminar or course with limited enrollment before she enrolls. A student who wishes to drop a class of this nature should do so at the earliest possible moment so that an-other student may take advantage of the opening. Because the organization and operation of such courses are often critically dependent on the students enrolled, the instructor may refuse permission to drop the course after the first 10 class days. A course dropped for reasons of health after the fifth week of classes will be recorded on the transcript with a grade of “W,” unless the student has the option of a free drop. A student registers for an interterm course in November, with the approval ofher adviser. In January, a student may drop or add an interterm course withinthe published add/drop period. (Please see the registrar’s office website for reg-istration and add/drop deadlines.) Otherwise, the student who registers but does not attend will receive a “U” (unsatisfactory) for the course. Regulations governing changes in enrollment for courses in the Five College Interchange may be more restrictive than the above. Instructions and deadlinesfor registration in Five College courses are published online by the registrar’soffice.Fine for Late RegistrationA student who has not registered for courses by the end of the first 10 days of classes will be fined $35, payable at the time of registration. In addition, a fine of $35 will be assessed for each approved petition to add or drop a course after the deadline. A student who has not registered by the end of the first four weeks of the semester will be administratively withdrawn.Course Work and Class AttendanceStudents are expected to attend all their scheduled classes. Any student who is unable, because of religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from such activities without prejudice and shall be given an opportunity to make them up. Students are asked to introduce guests to the instructor of a class before the beginning of the class if there is an opportunity and at the end if there is not. Absence does not relieve the student from responsibility for work required while she was absent. The instructor may require her to give evidence that she has done the work assigned. In courses in which the written examinations can test only a part of the work, the instructor may rule that a student who does not attend class with reasonable regularity has not presented evidence that she has done the work. The due date for final papers in each semester can be no later than the end of the examination period. Instructors must specify the acceptable format, exact deadline and place of delivery for final papers. If a paper or other course work is mailed to an instructor, it must be sent by certified mail, return receipt re-quested, and the student must keep a paper copy. It is the student’s responsibility to check that work submitted by email or fax has been received by the professor.Deadlines and ExtensionsOnly the class dean may authorize an extension for any reason beyond the end of the final examination period. Such extensions, granted for reasons of illness, emergency or extenuating personal circumstances, will always be confirmed in writing with the faculty member, the registrar and the student. An individual faculty member, without authorization by the class dean, may grant extensions on work due during the semester through the last day of final exams.Pre-Examination PeriodThe pre-examination study period, between the end of classes and the begin-ning of final examinations, is set aside for students to prepare for examinations. Therefore, the college does not schedule social, academic or cultural activities during this time. Deadlines for papers, take-home exams or other course work cannot be during the pre-examination study period.Final ExaminationsMost final exams at Smith are self-scheduled and administered by the registrar during predetermined periods. A student may choose in which period she wants to take each exam. Exams are picked up at distribution centers after showing a picture ID and must be returned to the same center no more than two hours and 20 minutes from the time they are received by the student. Extra time taken to write an exam is considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. A student who is late for an exam may write for the remaining time in the examination period but may not have additional time. Exams that involve slides, dictation or listening comprehen-sion are scheduled by the registrar. Such examinations may be taken only at the scheduled time. For information regarding illness during the examination period, call Health Services at extension 2800 for instructions. Students who become ill dur-ing an examination must report directly to Health Services. Further details of the Academic Honor Code as they apply to examinations and class work are given in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/handbook). Regulations of the faculty and the registrar regarding final exami-nation procedures are published online at the registrar’s office website prior to the final examination period. No scheduled or self-scheduled examination may be taken outside the regu-lar examination period without prior permission of the administrative board. Written requests must be made to the administrative board through the class dean (not to individual faculty members). Requests to take final examinations early will not be considered; therefore, travel plans must be made accordingly.Five College Course EnrollmentsStudents planning to enroll in a course at Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts may submit their requests online through BannerWeb. Five College course requests should be submit-ted during the period for advising and registration of courses for the coming semester. Course information is available online through the Five College online course guide or at the individual websites of the other four institutions. Free bus transportation to and from the institution is available for Five College students. Students in good standing are eligible to take a course at one of the other institutions: first-semester first-year students must obtain the permission of the class dean. Second-semester first-year students may take a course within the Five College system provided the student has earned a GPA of 3.0 or better in the first semester. A second-semester firstyear who wishes to enroll in two Five College courses needs permission from the first-year class dean. A traditional student must enroll in a minimum of 8 credits at Smith in any semester; an Ada Comstock scholar may take no more than half of her course program off campus. A student must register for an approved course at one of the other four institutions by the end of the interchange deadline (the first two weeks of the 40 Academic Rules and Proceduressemester). Students must adhere to the registration procedures and deadlines of their home institution. A list of Five College courses approved for Smith College degree credit is available at the registrar’s office. Requests for approval of courses not on the list may be submitted to the registrar’s office for review; however, Smith College does not accept all Five College courses for credit toward the Smith degree. Courses offered through their continuing education, extension or other nondegree pro-grams are not part of the Five College Interchange. Students may not receive transfer credit for such courses completed while in residence at Smith College, but may receive transfer credit for those offered during interterm and summer. Students taking a course at one of the other institutions are, in that course,subject to the academic regulations, including the calendar, grading option deadlines and academic honor system, of the host institution. Students taking Five College interchange courses will be awarded the credit value assigned by the host institution. It is the responsibility of the student to be familiar with the pertinent regulations of the host institution, including those for attendance, academic honesty, grading options and deadlines for completing coursework and taking examinations. Students follow the registration add/drop deadlines of their home institution. Regulations governing changes in enrollment in Five College courses are published online at the beginning of each semester at the registrar’s office website.Academic CreditSmith College complies with federal regulations defining a credit hour. Normal-ly, a four-credit course involves 12 hours per week of academically engaged time over the course of the semester. Academically engaged time is generally three class or contact hours per week plus nine additional hours of academic work for the course per week. For courses carrying more or fewer than four credits, the Smith College expectation is three hours per week of academically engaged time per credit over the course of the semester.Grading SystemGrades are recorded by the registrar at the end of each semester. Grade reports are made available online through BannerWeb at that time.    Grades at Smith indicate the following:A (4.0) C- (1.7)A- (3.7) D+ (1.4)B+ (3.3) D (1.0) B (3.0) D- (0.7)B- (2.7)  E (0.0)  C+ (2.3) S satisfactory(C- or better)C (2.0) U unsatisfactory  X official extension authorized by the class dean   M unreported grade calculated as a failure     Grades earned in Five College courses are recorded as submitted by the host institution. A Five College incomplete grade is equivalent to a failing grade and is calculated as such until a final grade is submitted. An incomplete grade will be converted to a failing grade on the student’s official record if coursework is not completed by the end of the following semester.Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory OptionCoursework in any one semester may be taken for a satisfactory (C- or better)/unsatisfactory grade, providing that:1.  the instructor approves the option;2.  the student declares the grading option for Smith courses by the end of the ninth week of classes. Students enrolled in Five College courses must declare the option at the host campus and follow the deadlines of that institution. The fall deadline also applies to yearlong courses designated by a “D” in the course number. In yearlong courses designated by a “Y” students may elect a separate grading option for each semester. Students electing the satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) option for both semesters of a yearlong course must do so each semester. Within the 128 credits required for the degree, a maximum of 16 credits(Smith or other Five College) may be taken for the S/U grading option, regard-less of how many graded credits students are enrolled in per semester. Some departments will not approve the S/U grading option for courses counting to-ward the major. Credits earned in courses with a mandatory S/U grading option are not counted toward the 16-credit limit. S/U grades do not count in the grade point average. An Ada Comstock Scholar or a transfer student may elect the S/U grading option for four credits out of every 32 that she takes at Smith College.Repeating CoursesEffective in the fall 2017 semester, students may repeat for credit a course taken at Smith in which a grade of C or lower was earned. A maximum of two courses may be repeated during the student’s period of enrollment. Permission of the student’s liberal arts or major faculty adviser and the course instructor is re-quired. A Smith course may be repeated at Smith only, not at another institution (including those in the Five College Interchange). A student repeating a course that was passed (a grade of D- or higher) and for which credit was earned will receive no additional course credit toward graduation. All grades earned in courses, including any repeated courses, will appear and remain on the student’s transcript. Only the higher grade of a repeated course will be calcu-lated into the term and cu mulative GPAs, however. It is the student’s responsibility to register a repeated course properly with the registrar’s office at the time of registration by submitting a completed course repeat authorization form. Topics and other courses that are noted as repeatable for credit in the course description or department/program catalog section are not subject to this policy, unless the student receives permission to repeat the same topic and meets all criteria above. Students should refer to the registrar’s office website (www.smith.edu/about-smith/registrar/policies-guidelines) for the complete course repeat policy.Performance CreditsStudents are allowed to count a limited number of performance credits towardthe Smith degree. The maximum number allowed is indicated in the Courses ofStudy section under the appropriate departments (dance, exercise and sport sci-ence, and music). Excess performance credits are included on the transcript but do not count toward the degree.Shortage of CreditsA shortage of credits incurred by failing or dropping a course may be made up by an equivalent amount of work carried above the normal 16-credit program, or with approved summer session or interterm courses accepted for credit to-ward the Smith College degree. In the case of failure in a course or dropping a course for reasons of health, a shortage may be filled with a student’s available Advanced Placement or other pre-matriculation credits. Any student with more than a two-credit shortage may be required to complete the shortage before re-turning for classes in a subsequent semester. A student enters the senior year after completing a maximum of six semes-ters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter her senior year with fewer than 96 credits; exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student’s return to campus for her final two semesters. A student may not participate in a Smith-sponsored or affiliated Study Abroad or exchange program with a shortage of credit.Academic Rules and Procedures 41Transfer CreditA student who attends another accredited college or university and requests credit toward a Smith College degree for the work done there:1. should make her plans in accordance with the regulations concerning off-campus study and, in the case of seniors, in accordance with the regulations concerning academic residence;2. should obtain, from the registrar’s office, the guidelines for transferring credit. Official transcripts should be sent directly to the registrar from the other institution;3. must, if approved to study abroad, have her program approved in advance by the Committee on Study Abroad.Final evaluation of credit is made after receipt of the official transcript showing satisfactory completion of the program. A student may not receive credit for work completed at another institution while in residence at Smith College, except for interterm courses and courses taken on the Five College interchange. Credit is not normally granted for online courses. Transfer credit policies and guidelines are published online at the registrar’soffice website and are available in the office. Students may not transfer credit for academic work completed at an international institution while withdrawn from the college.Summer Session CreditStudents may accrue a maximum of 12 approved summer session credits toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined sum-mer, interterm, AP and pre-matriculation credits. With the prior approval of the registrar, summer credit may be used to allow students to make up a shortage of credits or to undertake an accelerated course program. For transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars, summer session credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum.Interterm CreditThe college may offer courses for credit during the interterm period. Such cours-es will carry one to four credits and will count toward the degree. The college will consider for-credit academic interterm courses taken at other institutions for transfer credit. The number of credits accepted for each interterm course (normally up to 3) will be determined by the registrar upon review of the credits assigned by the host institution. Any interterm course designated as 4 credits by a host institution must be reviewed by the class deans and the registrar to deter-mine whether it merits an exception to the 3-credit limit. Students may accrue a maximum of 12 approved interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits. Normally, students may not take more than 4 credits during any one interterm at Smith or elsewhere. For transfer students, interterm credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum. The interterm may also be a period of reading, research or concentrated study for both students and faculty. Faculty, students or staff may offer noncredit instruction or experimental projects in this period. Special conferences may be scheduled and field trips may be arranged at the discretion of individual mem-bers of the faculty. Libraries, the Center for Foreign Languages and Cultures, practice rooms and physical education facilities will remain open at the discre-tion of the departments concerned. This period also provides time for work in libraries, museums and laboratories at locations other than Smith College. Students returning from a fall leave of absence or study elsewhere may par-ticipate in interterm, but are not guaranteed housing.College Credit Earned Before MatriculationSmith College will accept college credit with a grade of B- or better earned at an accredited college or university before matriculation as a first-year student. Such credit must be approved according to Smith College guidelines for transfer credit and submitted on an official college or university transcript. Such credits must be taken on the college or university campus with matriculated degree students and must be taught by a college or university professor. The course may not be listed on the high school transcript as counting toward high school graduation. Note that the restriction of 32 credits applied toward the Smith degree holds for any combination of Advanced Placement (AP) and/or college credit earned before matriculation. Prematriculation credits may be used in the same manner as AP credits toward the Smith degree and may not be used to fulfill the distribu-tion requirements for Latin Honors. Summer credits earned before matricula-tion will be counted in the 12-credit limit of summer credit applicable to the Smith degree. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, International Baccalaureate (IB), other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted towards the degree.Advanced PlacementSmith College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP) administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. AP credit may be used with the approval of the administrative board only (1) to make up a shortage of credits incurred through failure; (2) to make up a shortage of credit incurred as a result of drop-ping a course for reasons of health; or (3) to undertake an accelerated course program. AP credit may not be added to a student’s record to make up for a fail-ing grade received as a result of an Honor Board sanction. Credits are recorded for scores of 4 or 5 on most AP examinations. The credits to be recorded for each examination are determined by the individual department. For students entering the college in September 2012 and later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP and other prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree. Students who complete courses that cover substantially the same material as those for which AP credit is recorded may not then apply that AP credit to-ward the degree requirements. The individual departments will determine what courses cover the same material. The individual departments will determine placement in or exemption from Smith courses and the use of Advanced Placement credit to fulfill major require-ments. No more than 8 credits will be granted toward the major in any one department. AP credit may be used to count toward the 64 credits outside the major department or program but may not be used to fulfill the distribution require-ments for Latin Honors.International Baccalaureate and Other Diploma ProgramsCredit may be awarded for the International Baccalaureate (IB) and some 13th-year programs outside the United States. The amount of credit is determined by the registrar upon review of the final results. Such credits may be used toward the Smith degree in the same manner as AP credits and may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, IB, other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree.Academic StandingA student is in good academic standing as long as she is matriculated at Smith and is considered by the administrative board to be making satisfactory progress toward the degree. The academic standing of all students is reviewed at the end of each semester.42 Academic Rules and ProceduresAcademic ProbationA student whose academic record is below 2.0, either cumulatively or in a given semester, will be placed on academic probation for the subsequent semester. Probationary status is a warning. Notification of probationary status is made in writing to the student, her family and her academic adviser. Instructors of a student on probation may be asked to make academic reports to the class deans’ offices during the period of probation. The administrative board will review a student’s record at the end of the following semester to determine what action is appropriate. The administrative board may require such a student to change her course program, to complete summer study or to withdraw from the college. Any student on academic probation who is required by the Administrative Board to earn credit at another institution must earn a B- or better in each course in order for the course to transfer for credit at Smith. In general, a student on probation is advised to take no more than 16 cred-its. She may not enroll in courses through the Five College interchange, and may not run for or hold elected or selected office, either campus wide or withinher house. A student on probation is not considered to be in good academic standing, is not eligible to study abroad, and may not compete in intercollegiate athletics or club sports. Standards for Satisfactory ProgressA student is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree if she remains on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters. In addition (1) for students of traditional age, the record cannot have more than an eight-credit shortage for more than two consecutive semesters (2) for Ada Comstock Scholars, at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic semester must be completed satisfactorily. Students not meeting this criterion may be placed on academic probation or required to withdraw; if students are receiving financial aid, they will be placed on financial aid warning and may become ineligible for financial aid if the probationary period exceeds one year. Further information is available from the class deans’ office and the Office of Student Financial Services.Absence from ClassesA student who is absent from classes for more than four weeks in any semester will not receive credit for the work of that semester and will be administratively withdrawn from the college.Separation from the CollegeA student whose college work or conduct is deemed unsatisfactory is subject to separation from the college by action of the administrative board, the honor board, the college judicial board or the dean of the college. There will be no refund for tuition or room fees.Administrative BoardThe administrative board administers the academic requirements defined by faculty legislation. In general, academic matters affecting students are referred to this board for action or recommendation. The board consists of the dean of the college (chair), the class deans, the dean of the Ada Comstock Scholars, the registrar and three faculty members appointed by the president. Petitions for exceptions to academic regulations are submitted in writing to the administrative board through the class dean, with appropriate faculty ap-provals. The administrative board will reconsider a decision only on the basis of gross error in procedure, new information that was not available at the time the original decision was made or extreme bias on the part of the Administrative Board. Appeals based on disagreement of the decision will not be considered. The board has the authority to take action with respect to the academic per-formance of individual students, including the requirement that a student must leave the college.Student Academic GrievancesThe Smith College community has always been dedicated to the advancement of learning and the pursuit of truth under conditions of freedom, trust, mutual respect and individual integrity. The learning experience at Smith is rooted in the free exchange of ideas and concerns between faculty members and students. Students have the right to expect fair treatment and to be protected against any inappropriate exercise of faculty authority. Similarly, instructors have the right to expect that their rights and judgments will be respected by students and other faculty members. When differences of opinion or misunderstanding about what constitutes fairness in requirements or procedures leads to conflict, it is hoped that these differences will be resolved directly by the individuals involved. When disputes cannot be resolved informally by the parties involved, procedures have been es-tablished to achieve formal resolution. These procedures are explained in detail in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/handbook).Privacy and the Age of MajorityUnder Massachusetts law, the age of majority is 18 and carries full adult rights and responsibilities. The college normally communicates directly with students in matters concerning grades, academic credit and standing. In communications with parents concerning most matters, it is normallycollege policy to respect the privacy of the student and not to disclose informa-tion from student educational records without the prior consent of the student, consistent with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA).  At the request of the student, such information will be provided to parents and guardians. Students may authorize the release of information from their education records to their parents by completing the appropriate form at the registrar’s office. However, FERPA makes clear that information from the educational records of students who are dependents of their parents for Internal Revenue Service purposes may be disclosed to the parents without the student’s prior consent. It is the policy of the college to notify both the dependent student and her parents in writing of probationary status, dismissal and certain academic warnings. Any student who is not a dependent of her parents, as defined by the Internal Rev-enue Code, must notify the registrar of the college in writing, with supporting evidence satisfactory to the college, by October 1 of each academic year.Leaves, Withdrawal and ReadmissionOff-Campus Study or Personal LeavesA student who wishes to be away from the college for a semester or academic year must submit a request for approved off-campus study or personal leave.www.smith.edu/classdeans/guidelines_leaves.phpThe request must be filed with the student’s class dean by • May 1 for a fall semester or academic year absence• December 1 for a second semester absence.  Students in good academic standing who miss these deadlines and wish to go on leave may request a late leave through the class dean. Students are eligi-ble for leave status for one year; after that a student must withdraw. Information about readmission procedures can be on the class deans’ website. Any student studying elsewhere, either abroad through the InternationalStudy Office or elsewhere in the United States, must file a request for approvedoff-campus study by the appropriate deadline.Academic Rules and Procedures 43 Transfer students who apply 38 or fewer credits from their previous institution(s) to their Smith academic record may study abroad for a semester or a year; students who apply between 39 and 54 transfer credits to their Smith aca-demic record may study abroad for one semester. In both instances, students must work with the registrar’s office upon their return to campus to have their transfer credits adjusted. Academic residency requirements may also apply. Students should consult the “Transfer Admission” and “Requirements for the Degree” sec-tions for details. All students expecting to earn credit should have any course they wish to transfer preapproved by the registrar. The guidelines for transfer credit can be found at www.smith.edu/about-smith/registrar/transfer-credit A student who wishes to earn credit elsewhere during either semester of hersenior year must request approval by submitting a Senior Year Elsewhere formto the senior class dean that includes all the specific courses necessary for the completion of all major and minor requirements; and is endorsed by her adviser and the chair of her department. An official transcript must be sent directly from the institution where credit is earned to the registrar at Smith College for transfer credit to be applied to a Smith record. A student must be in good standing to be eligible to transfer credit to Smith.Short-Term Leave for Special Circumstances—Mid-SemesterA student who is away from campus for an extended period of time during the semester (one to two weeks) may be placed on a short-term leave status by Health Services or by the class dean. Instructors will be notified of the student’s status by the class deans office. Any student placed on short-term leave by Health Services must receive clearance from Health Services before returning to campus. Health Services may require documentation from the student’s health care provider before the stu-dent is eligible to return.  Every student placed on short-term leave for special circumstances by the dean must make an appointment with that appropriate class dean on her return in order to plan for the remainder of the semester.Withdrawal Between SemestersA student who plans to withdraw from the college should notify her class dean. When notice of withdrawal for the coming semester is given before June 30 or December 1, the student’s general deposit ($100) is refunded. Official confirma-tion of the withdrawal will be sent to the student by the class dean.Withdrawal During the SemesterAny student who decides to leave campus at any point for any reason and not finish her course work for the semester must withdraw. Official confirmation of the withdrawal will be sent to the student and her parents by the class dean.  The administrative board reviews the records of all student who withdraw during the semester from the college for any reason and may impose require-ments on the student in order to be eligible to be considered for readmission. When the student is ready to return she may request readmission through her class dean. Information and forms can be found at the class deans’ website. Should the withdrawal be due to • difficulty in meeting academic expectations • medical reasons• concerns about the student’s safety the student will be expected to provide documentation of improved functioning when requesting readmission. Readiness to return may be demonstrated by • engagement in sustained full time employment• consistent volunteer work or • study elsewhere at an accredited institution of higher learning in the United States. The student will be asked to present a plan for progress towards the degree and completion of major requirements and when appropriate articulate a plan for self-care. In the case of a withdrawal from the college for medical reasons, the director of health services (or the associate director when specified) will also request a full report from the student’s health care provider and may also request docu-mentation of improved functioning and a personal interview.  Clearance by the Health Services does not automatically guarantee readmis-sion as the administrative board makes the final decision regarding readmis-sion.  If the student leaves the college within the first five weeks of the semester, the administrative board may grant an additional semester upon the student’s return in order to complete the degree. Normally, an additional semester is not granted if the student withdraws after the fifth week.Required Medical WithdrawalThe director, the associate director of Health Services, or an Evaluation Commit-tee convened by the dean of students may require a student to withdraw during the semester when the student’s behavior or functioning is impaired to the degree that the student • cannot meet academic milestones, • poses a risk to herself or others • cannot receive appropriate and necessary treatment at the college. Further information on the policy on required medical withdrawal can be found at www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/policies/medleave.php.Readmission A withdrawn student who wishes to return to the college after an absence of fewer than six years must follow the readmission application process, as detailed on the class deans’ website. Readmission requests for return in September must be sent to the class deans’ office before March 1; for readmission in January, before November 1. The administrative board acts upon all requests for readmission and nor-mally requires that the student meet or speak with the appropriate class dean todiscuss her plans for completion of the degree. The administrative board may also request that the student contact the di-rector of Health Services before considering a readmission request. Normally, students who have withdrawn from the college must be withdrawnfor at least one full semester. A student who chooses a mid-semester withdrawalis required to be withdrawn for the entire subsequent semester. A student who was formerly enrolled as a traditional student may not returnas an Ada Comstock Scholar unless she has been away from the college for fiveyears. Students may not transfer credit for academic work completed at an interna-tional institution while withdrawn from the college.  A withdrawn student who wishes to return after an absence of 6 or more years must apply for admission through the Office of Admission. Information regarding application deadlines is available on the admission website. Such students are strongly encouraged to show evidence of recent successful comple-tion of one semester of college-level coursework at an accredited institution.  Potential candidates are strongly encouraged to make an appointment with the Office of Admission.Additional InformationThis chapter contains current information regarding Smith College’s require-ments, policies and procedures. For additional information, including updates, deadlines and required forms, consult the registrar’s office and class deans office websites. 44 Graduate and Special ProgramsIntroductionSmith College offers men and women graduate work leading to the degrees of master of arts in teaching, master of fine arts and master of science. The one-year post-baccalaureate program in mathematics is designed for women who need additional preparation before applying to graduate programs in math-ematics. In special one-year programs, international students may qualify for a certificate of graduate studies or a diploma in American studies. In addition, master of arts and doctoral programs are offered in the School for Social Work Each year more than 100 men and women pursue such advanced work.  Smith College is noted for its superb facilities, bucolic setting and distin-guished faculty who are recognized for their scholarship and interest in teach-ing. Moreover, graduate students can expect to participate in small classes and receive personalized attention from instructors.     Most graduate courses, which are designated as 500-level courses in the course listings, are planned for graduate students who are degree candidates. The departments offering this work present a limited number of graduate sem-inars, advanced experimental work or special studies designed for graduate stu-dents. Graduate students may take advanced undergraduate courses, subject to availability and according to the provisions stated in the paragraphs describing the requirements for the graduate degrees. Departmental graduate advisers help graduate students individually to devise appropriate programs of study.AdmissionTo enter a graduate degree program, a student must have a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent, an undergraduate record of high caliber, and acceptance by the department concerned. Applicants who wish to be considered for financial aid must submit all required application materials by the deadline date for their programs of interest. (Refer also to the Financial Assistance section.) The dead-line for fall entry for most programs is January 15 and spring entry November 1. If no financial aid is needed, most master’s degree programs will accept late applications for fall until April 1. Exceptions: master of fine arts in dance, Janu-ary 5, with no late applications and no spring admission; master of science in biological sciences, no late applications and no spring admission; master of arts in teaching, rolling admission beginning December 1 and ending May 1; and post-baccalaureate/mathematics, March 15 for fall, October 15 for spring.     Applicants must submit the materials listed on the application for admis-sion, including the formal application form, the $60 application fee, the official transcript of the undergraduate record, letters of recommendation from instruc-tors at the undergraduate institution, and (in some cases) the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). Applicants from non-English-speaking countries must submit of-ficial results from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the In-ternational English Language Testing System (IELTS). International applicants from English-speaking countries must submit results from the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). All candidates must also submit a paper written in an advanced undergraduate course, except for MFA/playwriting candidates, who must submit one or more full-length scripts or their equivalent. Direct correspondence and questions to the Office of Graduate and Special Programs.     Smith College is committed to maintaining a diverse community in an at-mosphere of mutual respect and appreciation of differences.Graduate and Special ProgramsResidence RequirementsStudents who are registered for a graduate degree program at Smith College are considered to be in residence. A full-time graduate student takes a minimum course program of 12 credits per semester. A half-time student takes a minimum course program of eight credits per semester. With the approval of his or her academic adviser and the director of graduate and special programs, a student may take a maximum of 12 credits for degree credit at Amherst, Hampshire or Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts. No more than two courses (eight credits) will be accepted in transfer from outside of the Five Col-leges. We strongly recommend that work for advanced degrees be continuous; if it is interrupted or undertaken on a part-time basis, an extended period is permitted, but all work for a master’s degree normally must be completed within a period of four years. Exceptions to this policy will be considered by petition to the Administrative Board. During this period, a continuation fee of $60 will be charged each semester during which a student is not enrolled at Smith College in course work toward the degree.Leaves of AbsenceA student who wishes to be away from the college for a semester or academic year for personal reasons may request a leave of absence. The request must be filed with the director of graduate and special programs by May 1 for a fall semester or academic-year leave; by December 1 for a second-semester leave. No leaves of absence will be approved after May 1 for the following fall semester or academic year and December 1 for the spring semester, and the student must withdraw from the college.     A leave of absence may not be extended beyond one full academic year, and a student who wants to be away from the college for more than one year must withdraw.     A student on a leave of absence is expected to adhere to the policies regard-ing such leaves. A student’s tuition account must be in good standing or the leave of absence will be canceled.Degree ProgramsGrade requirements vary, depending on the program. The master of science in biological sciences, master of fine arts in dance, and master of fine arts in the-ater require that all work to be counted toward the degree (including the thesis) must receive grades of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. Students in the master of science in exercise and sport studies are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or higher throughout the program, and the master of arts in teaching requires a student to have at least a 3.0 grade point average at the time of graduation in order to have earned the degree. Courses for graduate credit may not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. The requirements described below are minimal. Any department may set additional or special requirements and thereby increase the total number of courses involved.Master of Science in Biological SciencesThe Department of Biological Sciences maintains an active graduate program leading to the master of science in biological sciences. The program of study emphasizes independent research supported by advanced course work. Candi-Graduate and Special Programs 45dates are expected to demonstrate a strong background in the life sciences and a clear commitment to independent laboratory, field and/or theoretical research. The department offers opportunities for original work in a wide variety of fields, including animal behavior, biochemistry, cell and developmental biology, ecol-ogy, environmental science, evolutionary biology, genetics, marine biology, microbiology, molecular biology, neurobiology, plant sciences and physiology. Students pursuing the M.S. degree are required to participate in the Graduate Seminar (3, 413-585-3971.Master of Arts in TeachingThe program leading to the degree of master of arts in teaching is designed for students who are planning to teach in elementary, middle or high schools and those wishing to do advanced study in the field of education. The M.A.T. pro-gram combines study in the field of the student’s academic interest; the specific teaching field for students preparing to teach at the secondary or middle school levels, broader liberal arts and sciences subjects for students preparing to teach at the elementary level; with experience in teaching and the study of education theory. The departments of biological sciences, chemistry, English, geosciences, government, history, mathematics and physics actively cooperate with the De-partment of Education and Child Study in administering the various graduate programs.     The Department of Education and Child Study uses a variety of schools and settings to provide opportunities for observation, service learning and classroom teaching experiences. These include the laboratory elementary school operated by the college, the public schools of Northampton and other area communities, as well as several private schools.   Students who follow the Master of Arts in Teaching program will, in the course of an intensive five-week summer session and a full-time academic year, be able to complete the state-approved program in teacher education enabling them to meet requirements for licensure in various states.     Admission prerequisites and course requirements vary depending upon the specific program; more detailed information may be obtained from the director of graduate and special programs.     Prospective candidates should have a superior undergraduate record and should present evidence of personal qualifications for effective teaching. Those interested in the M.A.T. in secondary or middle school teaching should also pos-sess an appropriate concentration—normally a major—in the subject of the teaching field. Along with a resume, all applicants should submit a paper or other piece of work that is illustrative of their writing. Applicants with teaching experience should include a letter of recommendation concerning their teach-ing. We invite interested students to visit www.smith.edu/educ/ to learn more about our program and to find application materials.     To qualify for a degree, the candidate must have at least a 3.0 grade average at the time of graduation. Courses for graduate credit may not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.Master of Fine Arts in DanceThe Dance Department offers a two-year M.F.A. degree program. All graduate theory courses are taught for graduate students only. Choreography and perfor-mance are the focus of the course of study, with additional work in the history and literature of dance, scientific principles applied to the teaching and perfor-mance of dance, seminars and production. Required technique courses may be taken at Smith or in any of the colleges in the Five College Dance Department. All M.F.A. students are teaching fellows and teach the equivalent of three studio courses at the undergraduate level each year. To count toward the degree, all work must earn a grade of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. The thesis includes a public presentation of original choreography along with supporting production elements.     An audition is required for entrance into the program. Interested students may consult the Smith and Five College Dance websites: www.smith.edu/dance and www.fivecolleges.edu/sites/dance, or contact the Dance Department directly: Dance Department, Smith College, Northampton, 3; phone 413-585-3232.Master of Fine Arts in PlaywritingThis program, offered by the Department of Theatre, provides specialized train-ing to candidates who have given evidence of professional promise in playwrit-ing. The Department of Theatre places great emphasis on collaborative work among designers, performers, directors and writers, thus offering a unique opportunity for playwrights to have their work nurtured and supported by others who work with it at various levels.     Sixty-four credit hours, including a thesis, and two years of residence are required. In a two-year sequence, a student would have eight required courses in directing, advanced playwriting and dramatic literature and a total of eight electives at the 300 level or above, with the recommendation that half be in dra-matic literature. Electives may be chosen from acting, directing and design/tech courses and from courses outside the department and within the Five Colleges. To count toward the degree, all work must receive a grade of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. Interested students may consult the graduate adviser, Leonard Berkman, Department of Theatre, Smith College, Northampton, 3; 413-585-3206; email: lberkman@smith.edu.Master/Ph.D. of Social WorkThe School for Social Work offers a master of social work (M.S.W.) degree, which focuses on clinical social work and puts a heavy emphasis on direct field work practice. The program stresses the integration of clinical theory and prac-tice with an understanding of the social contexts in which people live. It also emphasizes an understanding of the social policies and organizational structure which influence our service delivery system. In addition, the school offers a doctoral program designed to prepare MSWs for leadership positions in clinical research, education and practice. It also has extensive postgraduate offerings through its Continuing Education Program.

A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 must be maintained throughout the program.Post-Baccalaureate Program: The Center for Women in Mathematics at Smith CollegeThe Post-Baccalaureate Program is for women strongly considering graduate school in the mathematical sciences but who did not major in mathematics or whose mathematics major was light. It provides an opportunity to study math-ematics intensively at the advanced undergraduate level. As part of the Center for Women in Mathematics, the program is nested in a mathematical community that is supportive, friendly, fun and serious about mathematics. The program builds the skills and confidence needed to continue to graduate school in the mathematical sciences. Each student has a faculty mentor. There are sessions on taking the GREs, applying to graduate school and surviving graduate school. Each student has the opportunity to join a research team supervised by a Smith faculty member. The program is for one or two semesters. Admission is competitive but open to all women who have graduated from college with coursework in mathematics that includes some upper-level mathematics (usually, at least Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus). RequirementsStudents must take at least 12 math credits each semester including math 300 and math 301. A Certificate of Completion is awarded to students who success-fully complete two semesters including or placing out of at least one course in algebra, one in analysis, and one at the level of 310 or higher. Students failing to make satisfactory progress in one semester will not be funded for a second se-mester. Passing 12 mathematics credits with grades of B- or higher and contin-ued serious interest in pursuing higher mathematics or statistics are necessary for satisfactory progress.Applications and Contact InformationFor more information, or to request application materials, please contact Julianna Tymoczko, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Smith College, Northampton, 3, telephone: 413 585-3775, email: math-chair@smith.eduFinancial AidScholarships are available to admitted post-baccalaureate students.

From the 11th through the 15th day of class, a student may enter a course with the permission of the instructor, the adviser and the director of graduate programs. After the 10th day of classes, a student may drop a course up to the end of the fifth week of the semester (October in the first semester and February in the second semester): 1) after consultation with the instructor; and 2) with the ap-proval of the adviser and the director of graduate programs. Instructions and deadlines for registration in Five College courses are distrib-uted by the registrar’s office.Policy Regarding Completion of Required Course WorkA graduate student who is unable to complete required course work on time must submit to the director of graduate programs a written request for an ex-tension before the end of the semester in which the grade is due. The request should include the reason the extension is needed and a specific date by which the student proposes to complete the work. The instructor of the course should also submit a statement in support of the extension. If the extension is granted, the work must be completed by the date agreed on by the director, instructor and student. No extensions may exceed one calendar year from the time of initial enrollment in the course. The initiative in arranging for the completion of course work rests with the student. 48 The Board of TrusteesThe Board of TrusteesKathleen McCartney, PresidentNorthampton, MA Deborah L.

A thesis is also required of each candidate for this degree. It may be limited in scope but must demonstrate scholarly competence; it is equivalent to a two-se-mester, eight-credit course. A copy must be presented to the committee for deposit in the library. The thesis may be completed in absentia only by special permission of the department and of the director of graduate and special programs.Master of Science in Exercise and Sport StudiesThe graduate program in exercise and sport studies focuses on preparing coaches for women’s intercollegiate teams. The curriculum blends theory courses in exercise and sport studies with hands-on coaching experience at the college level. By design, the program is a small one, with only 15 to 20 candi-dates in residence. This makes it possible for students to work independently with faculty and coaches. Smith has a history of excellence in academics and a wide-ranging intercollegiate program composed of 14 varsity sports. Entrance into the two-year program requires a strong undergraduate record and play-ing and/or coaching experience in the sport that a student will be coaching. Individuals who do not have undergraduate courses in exercise physiology and kinesiology should anticipate work beyond the normal 51 credits. For more information, contact the Department of Exercise and Sport Studies, Smith Col-lege, Northampton, ) and are expected to undertake a course of study, designed in conjunction with their adviser, that will include appropriate courses both within and outside the department.Additional information can be found in the Graduate and Special Programs section and at the following link:www.smith.edu/biology/graduate.phpAdviser: Jesse Bellemare Seminar on Recent Advances and Current Problems in the Biological SciencesStudents in this seminar discuss articles from the primary literature representing diverse fields of biology and present on their own research projects. Journal articles will be selected to coordinate with departmental colloquia. In alternate weeks, students present talks on research goals, data collection and data analysis. This course is required for graduate students and must be taken both years. Credits: 2Steven A. WilliamsNormally offered each fall"

The minor is structured to give the student interdisciplinary training within key fields of knowledge: literature and the arts, social science and historical studies.Requirements: Six semester courses on Africa are required. One course must be drawn from each of the following three fields:Arts, Literature and Humanities; Historical Studies; Social SciencesNo more than two courses from a student’s major may be counted toward the minor. At the discretion of the adviser, equivalent courses at other colleges may be substituted for Five College courses.Language. Students interested in African studies are encouraged to study French, Portuguese or an African language. In addition, a student who has achieved inter-mediate-level competence in an African language may petition for this to count as one of the required courses in the field of arts, literature and humanities.Students with required language proficiency may apply for the Five College Afri-can Studies Certificate.Study Abroad. Students are encouraged to spend a semester or more in Africa. Information on current programs may be obtained from the African studies director and should be discussed with the minor adviser.Arts, Literature and Humanities"
CLT 100," Introduction to Comparative Literature: The Pleasures of ReadingTopics course. May be repeated once with a different topic.Cannibals, Witches and VirginsAn examination of the rewritings and adaptations of the three iconic figures of Shakespeare’s The Tempest—Caliban the demi-devil savage other, Sycorax the devil-whore, and Miranda the virgin-goddess—by writers from different geographies, time periods and ideological persuasions. Using texts such as Aimé Césaire’s A Tempest, Rachel Ingalls’ Mrs. Caliban, Lemuel Johnson’s Highlife for Caliban, Gloria Naylor’s Mama Day and Michelle Cliff’s No Telephone to Heaven, we seek to understand how postcolonial, feminist and postmodern rewritings of The Tempest transpose its language and characters into critiques of colonialism, nationhood, race, gender and difference. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered each academic year Introduction to Comparative Literature•  Introduction to Comparative Literature: The Pleasures of ReadingTopics course. May be repeated once with a different topic.Natives, Nationals and Nobodies: Home, Food and Belonging in the Cultural ImaginaryThis course considers the many ways in which we experience and (re)create “home”: as the place where we are born, where we seek refuge, where our families are, where we emigrate. Food plays a central role in how we think of home—how do scents, spices, rituals, and preparations inform our sense of self and community? Studying selected works of fiction, film, oral history, and essays, we will explore the ways in which you, as well as refugees, migrants, immigrants, exiles, and émigrés, understand and conceptualize home, belongig, and “otherness.” {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years  Introduction to Comparative Literature: The Pleasures of Reading  Islands, Real and Imaginary Introduction to Comparative Literature: The Pleasures of ReadingCannibals, Witches and VirginsMembers of the departmentNormally offered each academic year"
CLT 205," 20th-Century Literatures of AfricaA study of the major writers and diverse literary traditions of modern Africa with emphasis on the historical, political and cultural contexts of the emergence of writing, reception and consumption. We pay particular attention to several questions: in what contexts did modern African literature emerge? Is the term “African literature” a useful category? How do African writers challenge Western representations of Africa? How do they articulate the crisis of independence and postcoloniality? How do women writers reshape our understanding of gender and the politics of resistance? Writers include Chinua Achebe, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiong’o, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele and Ama Ata Aidoo. We also watch and critique films such as Blood Diamond, District 9, Tsotsi and The Constant Gardener.{L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered each fall 20th-Century Literatures of AfricaA study of the major writers and diverse literary traditions of modern Africa with emphasis on the historical, political and cultural contexts of the emergence of writing, reception and consumption.

Stu-dents are exposed to a literary form that achieved popularity and cultural pres-tige early on, was then significantly challenged and diversified, and is presently enjoying a resurgence. We consider fictional and nonfictional accounts reflect-ing various geographies of travel and migration. While early voyagers tended to assert the relative superiority of French culture, subsequent generations of trav-elers abandoned discovery for self-discovery, and critiqued colonialism instead of indigenous cultures. Countries and regions surveyed include the Holy Land, Turkey, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Central and West Africa, the United States, Iran, France, Indonesia and Thailand. {F} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years Topics in French Cultural StudiesTopics course.Immigration and SexualityThis course explains how gender and sexuality have been politicized in im-migration debates in France, from the 1920s to the present. Students examine both cultural productions and social science texts: memoirs, psychoanalytical literature, activist statements, sociological studies, feature films, fashion, per-formance art, blogs and news reports. France has historically been the leading European host country for immigrants, a multiplicity of origins reflected in its current demographic make-up. Topics include: the hyper-sexualization of black and brown bodies, France as a Mediterranean culture, immigrant loneliness in Europe, intermarriage and demographic change, the veil and niqab, as well as sexual nationalism and homo-nationalism. {F} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsFrance in AmericaWhat is l’Amérique française?

Yet at one time, people in New England and Louisiana spoke French, lived and laughed in French, cried and died in French. Must French now be translated in America? Through what cultural mechanisms is Frenchness expressed by Americans? In what language(s) does one write French America today?

How does the violence of colonialism and decolonization reframe our understanding of childhood innocence? How do African childhood narratives represent such crises as cultural alienation, loss of language, exile and memory? How do competing national and cultural ideologies shape narratives of childhood? Texts include Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions, Zoë Wicomb’s You Can’t Get Lost in Cape Town, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiongo’s Weep Not Child and Tahar Ben Jelloun’s The Sand Child.

Departing from ethnographic approaches that mask the identity of individual musicians and treat African societies as collectives, this course em-phasizes the contributions of individual West African musicians whose stature as master musicians is undisputed within their respective communities. It exam-ines the contributions of individual musicians in the ever continuous process of negotiating the boundaries and identities of African musical practice. Musicians covered this semester include Akan female professional singers in Ghana; Yous-sou N'Dour (Senegalese musician) and Babatunde Olatunji, the late Nigerian drummer. The variety of artistic expressions of selected musicians also provides a basis for examining the interrelatedness of different African musical idioms, and the receptivity of African music to non-African styles. {A} {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsHistorical Studies Topics in World MusicThe Music of JapanMembers of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years Topics in World MusicTopics course.Popular Music of the Islamic WorldMusic is a thorny issue in many Islamic societies. There is often tension between hardliners who believe that music has no place in Islam and thus try to prohibit it and those who tolerate it, albeit within well-defined parameters. The debate intensifies in the case of popular music. Despite this, there is an incredible va-riety of vibrant popular music traditions throughout the Islamic world. In this course, we engage with Islamic debates on popular music, explore music in a variety of cultures (e.g., Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Senegal and Turkey), and examine the ways they illuminate different themes (forms of Islam, issues of diaspora, gender considerations, musical diversity, etc.). No prerequisites, though  Topics in World MusicTopics course.African Popular MusicThis course focuses on twentieth century African popular music: it examines musical genres from different parts of the continent, investigating their relation-ships to the historical, political and social dynamics of their respective national and regional origins. Regional examples like highlife, soukous and mbaqanga will provide the basis for assessing the significance of popular music as a cre-ative response to the colonial and postcolonial enviromnet in Africa. Themes explored include the use of music in the construction of social identity and the interaction of local and global elements. No prerequisites.

Lamothe, Ph.D.  Assistant ProfessorSamuel Ng, Ph.D  Visiting ProfessorDiana Burnett, Lecturer  Tara Bynum, Lecturer  Flavia Santos de Araujo, Lecturer  MissionThe Department of Africana Studies investigates the social, historical, cultural and aesthetic works and practices of populations of African descent throughout the diaspora. A multidisciplinary endeavor, our interrogations begin not with race as an assumed concept but as a site of profound social formation that must be considered in relation to gender, class, nation, ethnicity, religion and sexual-ity. We understand our mandate to be two-fold: to provide a coherent, grounded body of knowledge for our majors and minors as well as to serve the broader academic and cocurricular needs of the college. In all of these endeavors, we emphasize the need for students to develop their analytic capacities.A student in our department is first a critical thinker, one who learns to ask ques-tions, seek connections, unpack what is invisible or ignored. Our courses empha-size close reading, research and writing, and our curriculum expects students to think about the Caribbean, Africa and diaspora communities in Europe and else-where. In support of this expectation, we encourage students to travel abroad.The MajorRequirements for the Major• An Africana Studies major will have experienceStudying closely classic texts or figures or historical periods or movements• Considering the aesthetic principles undergirding 19th- and 20th-century African American culture• Engaging texts, movements or events from many disciplinary standpoints• Considering the impact of gender, class, nation, sexuality on African Ameri-can culture• Thinking intellectually about the diasporaA major is also strongly encouraged to study abroad as well as to take courses in all seven areas of Latin distribution.1. The major consists of 11 four-credit courses as follows:Three required courses: 111, 117 and 201.2. General concentration: four 100- and 200-level courses at least one of which must have a primary focus on the African diaspora. (Courses at the 300-level may also be used when appropriate.)3. Advanced concentration: three courses organized in one of five areas or pathways: history, literature/cultural studies, social science, black women’s stud-ies or diaspora studies. Of the three courses, at least one must be at the 300-level; and at least one must have a primary focus on the African diaspora.4. The designated capstone seminar in the junior or senior year. The course is required of all majors including honors thesis students.The MinorRequirements for the MinorThe minor consists of six 4-credit courses as follows:1. Two of the three required courses: 111, 117, 201.2. Four elective courses, at least one of which must be a seminar or a 300-level class; and at least one of which must have a primary focus on the African dias-pora.Pathways Through the Major1. History"

AFR 201," Methods of InquiryThis course is designed to introduce students to the many methods of inquiry used for research in interdisciplinary fields such as Africana studies. Guided by a general research topic or theme, students are exposed to different methods for asking questions and gathering evidence.Soul and Post-SoulBeginning with Nelson George in 1992 scholars have invoked “post-soul” to describe black culture and politics after the civil-rights era.  Scholars use "post-soul" to frame discussions of the socioeconomic and political changes arising after the 1960s; conceptualize cultural identity by differentiating it from black arts/soul era arts and politics; and theorize black aesthetic productions of the pe-riod (e.g. literature, performance, visual arts, music). Using soul and post-soul as organizing conceits, this course will give students an introduction to, and practice in, the tools of intellectual investigation in the study of African-Amer-ican history and culture/ racial formations. Students will read, attend lectures and learn from scholars whose work is based in particular disciplines (especially history, literature, cultural studies and the social sciences). You will also learn the challenges and opportunities made possible by doing interdisciplinary re-search. Through the multi- and interdisciplinary approach to a single topic or text (in the case of this semester, soul and post-soul), students will learn how scholars in each discipline ask certain kinds of research questions, take certain kinds of research approaches; and how to put these various methods in conver-sation with each other. Finally, students will also have an opportunity to develop their own research project related to the focus of this course (race, ethnicity, and the social construction of identity) by means of library and media-based research. {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsApproaches to the African DiasporaUsing theories and conceptualizations of the African diaspora as a case study, this course gives students an introduction to and practice in the tools of intel-lectual investigation in the study of black history and culture/racial formations in the United States and internationally.

To do this, we consider different historical periods and cultural forms; we think about gender, sexuality, class, religion, region; we think about genre and nationalism, as well as death and dying’s not-too-distant relatives: memory, agency, loss, love. Not open to first-year students. Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"

These autobiographical accounts provide rich portraits of individual experience at a specific time and place as well as insights into the larger socio-historical context in which the authors lived.

AFR 366," Seminar: Contemporary Topics in Africana StudiesTopics course.Afro-Brazilian CultureConsidering the myth of a “racial democracy”, how have black Brazilian art-ists constructed memory and identity through their artistic production? How do the politics of race, gender, class, sexuality, and national identity shape Afro-Brazilian cultural (con)texts? This course explores a multi-genre selection of Afro- Brazilian literary texts from the 20th and 21st centuries to examine the connections between cultural production and identity politics. Our study will also consider other types of Afro-Brazilian artistic expressions such as music, performance, and visual culture. This course also provides an opportunity for students to develop comparative inquiries on the black diasporic experience. {H} {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsBlackness, Being and BecomingThis class uses canonical literature, as well as cultural productions and critical theory, in order to explore blackness as a modern racial formation (i.e. an idea with material consequences) and an identity. Beginning with the 19th century slave narrative tradition, and moving through the 20th and 21st centuries, we will explore how African Americans use written, sonic and visual languages to resist Eurocentric projections of otherness onto black bodies. Using theoretical frames—such as fugitive and unmoored subjectivity, demonic grounds, and the black interior—students will critically engage representational works that mediate on “blackness” not only in terms of nonbeing, but also in terms of becoming. In other words, we will treat the black imagination as a critical site of inquiry because of its construction of racialized subjectivity as varied, complex, and evolving. Examples from sonic and visual culture will be drawn from mul-tiple sources. Readings may include Douglass, Jacobs, Hurston, Morrison and Whitehead, among others. {H} {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years78 Africana StudiesSeminar: Anthropology of Blackness in the AmericasIn this course we investigate and build a critical working vocabulary about 20th-century black migrant communities. Central to our work is exploring the tension between how these communities have been defined (via notions of pa-thology, disease and death) and how they have defined themselves through their spatial and environmental practices around belonging, collectivity and place. These are queer or non-normative modes of urbanism, and they challenge dominant idioms of territoriality. We glean these practices by interrogating plan-ner documents; reading critically anti-racist texts; and analyzing music, poetry and vernacular architectural practices.  {H} {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsSeminar: The Politics of GriefWhat role has grief played in the black freedom struggle?

A concentration, that links academic integration with agency and action, is a natural means by which to achieve this mission, and CEEDS offers two environmental concentrations with topics that change every four years.Many world leaders, scientists and analysts of all types agree that global cli-mate change is perhaps the most significant challenge confronting human life and well-being and the stability of life on Earth. The climate change concentra-tion builds on strong student and faculty interest, pulling together the many diverse fields and disciplines that bear on this complex subject.Students and faculty participating in the climate change concentration can explore connections among such themes as:• socioeconomic and historical factors affecting climate change including the Industrial Revolution, the environmental movement, global fossil fuels in-dustries, national and global financial institutions, world economic models, and the military-industrial complex;• political and governmental aspects of climate change such as the Kyoto Protocol, the relative balance between developing and developed nations of responsibility for causing and for responding to climate change, the ongoing debate in the United States over “cap and trade” and carbon tax systems, and the IPCC;• psychological factors affecting personal behavior including political affilia-tion, education and perceived normative decisions among peer groups; and• cultural reflections of and influences on global climate change including literature, film, theater, and visual arts;• the science of global climate change including atmospheric physics and radiative transfer, sources of greenhouse gases, biological system responses to climate change, and the prehistoric geologic climate recordFor more information, see www.smith.edu/climate.RequirementsThe environmental concentration in climate change has four components: a gateway course, an academic core, practicum experiences and a capstone.1.

This course surveys 19th-century African diasporic authors’ and orators’ engagements with medical and legal theories on issues of slavery, emigration, crime and revolution. Supplementing our readings of slave literature, crime narratives, emigration writings, poetry and fiction, we study contemporary and current theories of race and racial science, the human, non-human, and post-human, environmentalism, colonization, pain, disability, gender, sexuality and legal personhood. Our literary travels take us from colonial West Indies, Jamaica, and the antebellum U.S. to colonial Canada, Cuba and the Bahamas. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years, 229, 230, 236, 239, 241, 246, 248, 249, 267, 277, 278, 282, 309, 312, 319, 334, 387,391, "

ARH 258,". This class examines the architectural history of French colonialism from a global historical perspective. French colonialism marked the longest episode of French interaction with the non-European world. This class encourages a broader understanding of its architectural impact through approaching the buildings, towns and cities that emerged during French imperialism. We engage colonial iterations of “high style,” or official, governmental architecture, in addition to examining vernacular forms engendered because of the blending of building traditions. We consider sites in Africa, North America, the Caribbean, Asia and the Indian Ocean. We think through the social and economic factors that caused architectural and urban typologies to display marked continuities despite geographical distinctions.

FYS 148," Migration Stories: Border-Crossing and Becoming in African-American LiteratureThis course explores how histories of migration have shaped the formation of black cultures and identities. African American culture and identities have always been produced in the crucible of migration, both forced and voluntary. Black people and black cultures have always been on the move and have always been in the process of formation and reformation. African peoples arrived in the “New World” as captives of the transatlantic slave trade. This historical event was devastating, yet it was also an occasion for new cultures and identities to be formed. Migration has compelled black peoples to refashion themselves, transform their environments and make their mark on the art and cultures of their new societies. Among the topics covered are: the transatlantic and domestic slave trades, fugitivity, the Great Migration from the South, the post–Civil Rights era “reverse migration,” and more recent immigrations by people from the Caribbean and Africa. We use literature, history, music and film to ask how these stories help us understand the intricacies of this rich history. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

Yet the central historiographical question remains: why didn’t U.S. slaves overthrow enslavement like Haitian slaves did on Santo Domingo? Enslaved people challenged slavery in a variety of ways including violence, revolts, maroon communities, truancy, passing, suicide and day-to-day resistance.

How did 70- through 90-year-old former slaves remember their childhoods and young adulthoods during slavery? And how do scholars make sense of these interviews given they were conducted when Jim Crow segregation was at its pinnacle?

Most importantly, students explore debates that swirl around the interviews and challenge their validity on multiple fronts, even as they remain the richest sources of African American oral history regarding slav-ery.

IDP 102," Race and Its Intersections With Class, Gender and SexualityThis course offers an interdisciplinary, critical examination of race largely in the context of the United States. Although race is no longer held by scientists to have any essential biological reality, it has obviously played a central role in the formation of legal codes (from segregation to affirmative action), definitions of citizenship, economics (from slavery to discriminatory loan arrangements), culture (dance, fashion, literature, music, sport) and identities. Where did the concept of race come from? How has it changed over time and across space? What pressures does it continue to exert on our lives? How does it intersect with gender, sexuality, social class, religion and abilities? By bringing together faculty from a variety of programs and disciplines—and by looking at a range of cultural texts, social studies and historical events where racial distinctions and identities have been deployed, constructed and contested—we hope to give the students an understanding of how and why race matters. This course meets for 10 sessions, beginning in the second week of the semester and ending on the penultimate week. (E) Credits: 2Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"

Students read and practice creative writing (essays and pieces of fiction) with the aid of fictional and biographical pieces written by Spanish women from the 12th century to our day. Its goal is to develop introspective writing, students’ competence and self-confidence in the analysis of short and longer fiction in Spanish, knowledge of the history of women’s writing in Spain, and acquisition of linguistic and cultural literacy in Spanish through playful fiction writing.

This course uses short fiction, documentary and film from the Spanish-speaking world (the Americas and Spain), as well as film from the Portuguese-speaking world, where appropriate, to explore the ways in which women’s transnational domestic labor has shaped new cultural subjects and political identities in the public as well as the private sphere. Students work independently and in groups on the theme of women’s domestic labor from the perspective of their choosing (for example, human rights, migration policies, racial and gendered labor regimes, neoliberal reforms and resistance).

This class will explore the origins of this idea, in terms of how the representative strategies associated with magical realism devel-oped historically to approach the conflictive realities of Latin America. Students will read literary works associated with magical realism, including One Hun-dred of Solitude, by Gabriel Garcia Márquez, as well as theoretical texts from authors who have reflected on the meaning of this concept. They will also learn about how more recent Latin American authors engage critically with magical realism. Fulfills the writing requirement for the major.

Through the study of primary sources and some recent re-interpretations of historical events, the class reflects on how Latin American culture was shaped by the legacy of colonialism and the persistent struggle to leave it behind. Special attention is paid to the clashing interactions between the indigenous populations, creole elites in a conflicted dialogue with the cultures of Europe and North America, and Africans brought to the continent as slaves. Class discussions will center on how cultural practices were traversed by notions of race, gender and social class, as well as by the larger geopolitical world context. Prerequisite:  or equivalent.

In this regard, we con-sider four particular aspects: the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and the activism that engages this crisis; the explosion of underground and mainstream art (visual art, music, literature, film, theater) that showcases an interest in thinking about sexuality, gender and gender normativity, sex and eroticism, and intersection-ality; the decade’s culture of conservatism, especially in relationship to the legacy of the ’60s and the ’70s; and the emergence of queer studies scholarship.

It is expected that several courses in the major will explore issues outside the theme.American StudiesBecause American studies courses are located primarily in two divisions, hu-manities and social sciences, students are to balance their studies with courses in each. Courses taken S/U may not be counted toward the major.Requirements: 12 semester courses, as follows:• 201 and 202.• Eight courses in the American field: at least four must be focused on a theme defined by the student; at least two must be in the humanities and at least two in the social sciences; at least two must be devoted primarily to the years before the 20th century; at least one must be a seminar, ideally in the theme selected (340/341 does not fulfill the seminar requirement). Students writing honors projects are exempt from the seminar requirement.• International comparison: in order to foster international perspectives and to allow comparisons with the American experience, all majors must take a course dealing with a nation or society other than the United States, preferably in the area of the student’s focus.• 340 or 341.Adviser for Study Abroad: Advisers for the MajorHonors Director: Christen Mucher Shamans, Shapeshifters and the Magic IfTo act, to perform is to speculate with your body.

How do we define citizenship, its rights and responsibilities? How do race, gender, class and other differences affect the drawing of these boundaries, and the contents of consciousness? This course introduces some of the exciting and innovative approaches to cultural analysis that have emerged over the last three decades. Students apply these methods to a variety of texts and practices (stories, movies, American Studies 83television shows, music, advertisements, clothes, buildings, laws, markets, bodies) in an effort to acquire the tools to become skillful readers of American culture, and to become more critical and aware as scholars and citizens.{A} {H} Credits: 4Christen MucherNormally offered each fall.

It gives students a broad view of dance in preparation for a professional career or further study. Students are exposed to courses in dance history and culture, creative and aesthetic studies, scientific aspects of dance, the language of movement, and dance technique and performance. A dancer’s instrument is her body and it must be trained consistently; at least five dance technique courses are required for the bachelor’s degree. (Ten are allowed for credit toward the g.p.a.) Students should reach intermediate or advanced level in at least one form. A single level of technique courses may be taken for credit up to three semesters. Advanced technique courses (levels V and VI) require a placement exam. A minimum of 48 credit hours are required for the major. Students may substitute no more than one course from another department to fulfill a dance major requirement. Substitute courses must be approved by the dance department faculty.History: 171 Studies in Dance History: European and North American Concert Dance (1900s–Today) and 272 Dance and Culture serve as the introduction to the major. At the advanced level is 377 Advanced Studies in History and Aesthet-ics with rotating topics. These courses examine the dance itself and its cultural context.Creative and Aesthetic Studies: 151, 252, 353, 209 and 309. This sequence of courses begins with the most basic study of dance composition—space, time, energy—and focuses on tools for finding and developing movement. The sec-ond- and third-level courses develop the fundamentals of formal choreography and expand work in the manipulation of spatial design, dynamics, phrasing, rhythm, content and accompaniment. The movement materials that a student explores are not limited to any particular style. This sequence also includes 4-credit repertory courses at the intermediate and advanced levels.Scientific Aspects of Dance: 241 and 342. These courses are designed to de-velop the student’s personal working process and her philosophy of movement. The student studies selected aspects of human anatomy, physiology, biomechan-ics and their relationships to various theories of technical study.Music for Dancers: 287. Sharpens understanding of music fundamentals and makes these applicable to dance.Major Course of Study: Students in the Bachelor of Arts in contemporary dance are urged to pursue a breadth of study in their technique courses and, in consul-tation with their advisers, make connections to other art departments.RequirementsTheory: Must take each of the following:151  Elementary Dance Composition171  Studies in Dance History: European and North American Concert Dance (1900s–Today)241  Scientific Foundations of Dance252  Intermediate Dance Composition272  Dance and Culture287  Analysis of Music From a Dancer’s Perspective200  Dance Production201  Dance Production 399  Senior Seminar in Dance (Choreography or Research)Five dance technique courses are required for the bachelor’s degree (Ten are allowed for credit toward the g.p.a.)

AMS 220," ColloquiumTopics course. Dance Music Sex Romance: Popular Music, Gender and Sexuality from Rock to Rap Since the 1950s rock ‘n’ roll and other forms of youth-oriented popular music in the U.S. have embodied rebellion. Yet the rebellion that rock and other popular music styles like rap have offered has often been more available to men than women. Similarly, the sexual liberation associated with popular music in the rock and rap eras has been far more open to “straight” desires over “queer.” This course will examine how popular music from the 1950s to the present has been shaped by gender and sexuality, and the extent to which the music and its associated cultural practices have allowed artists and audiences to challenge gender and sexual norms, or alternately have served to reinforce those norms albeit with loud guitars and a heavy beat.

This course interrogates the intellectual, political and pedagogical bases of literature, museums and public history in the U.S. from the 18th century to today. We devote part of our time to the theoretical readings that will ground our inquiry: texts range from mu-seum studies, anthropology and sociology, to history, literary studies and cultural studies. The other part focuses on specific historical and present-day case studies, such as PT Barnum’s American Museum, Wanamaker’s Hiawatha Shows, the President’s House and the Pop-Up Museum of Queer History. {A} {H} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years  Colloquium  Dance Music Sex Romance: Popular Music, Gender and Sexuality from Rock to Rap  Cultural Studies of New Media  Curating American Memories ColloquiumTopics course.

AMS 225," Corporate Capitalism, Media and Protest in AmericaThe U.S. Constitution recognizes a free press as the lifeblood of democracy with a mandate to inform citizens and hold the powerful accountable. But there is widespread distrust of the media in American society today. This course analyzes the transformation of the press into a corporate enterprise over the past 150 years, and the opposition this has provoked. Examining key developments (the creation of multinational media conglomerates as well as new digital media alternatives) and focusing on case studies such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the 2016 Elections, we examine the influence of the media on American political, economic, and cultural life. {H} {S} Credits: 4Kevin L.

AMS 227," Trade and Theft in Early AmericaA seventeenth-century engraving imagines an encounter between two men wearing feathers and holding onto the same string of shells: depending on your perspective, this image looks like a scene of trade or one of theft at knife-point. In understanding moments from the past, representation and perspective shape not just interpretation, but sources themselves. Seeing moments as both trade and theft opens them to tellings and analyses from multiple perspectives, exposing overlooked elements and revealing the ways in which histories are made. This course introduces students to Early American history (c 1500–1800) through the themes of trade, theft, representation, and perspective.

AMS 230," Colloquium: The Asian/Pacific/American ExperienceThis course is open to anyone particularly interested in learning about Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) history. The objective of the course is two-fold.

The second is to introduce them to the various themes as well as methodological and theoretical frameworks used by scholars in the field of A/P/A Studies in order to encourage them to either work toward a Five College A/P/A Studies Certificate or pursue further studies in the field. {H} {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years, "
AMS 232," American Conservatism in the Age of TrumpThis course surveys the recent history of political conservatism in the United States, with an emphasis on the present moment. Topics include the various ideological strains that inform American conservatism (traditionalism, Christian evangelicalism, neoliberalism, neoconservatism, reform conservatism, Alt-Right); affective styles and strategies that animate conservative politics; institutional networks that support conservative coalition-building and the propagation of conservative ideas (media, think tanks, PACs); the “tribal” polarization of the American political parties around issues such as race, gender, sexuality, climate change, and gun control. We will seek especially to analyze and interpret the election of Donald Trump as the nation’s 45th president. Enrollment limit of 25.

AMS 235," American Popular CultureThis course offers an analytical history of American popular culture since 1865. We start from the premise that popular culture, far from being merely a frivolous or debased alternative to high culture, is an important site of popular expression, social instruction and cultural conflict. We examine theoretical texts that help us to “read” popular culture, even as we study specific artifacts from a variety of pop culture sources, from television shows to Hollywood movies, the pornography industry to spectator sports, and popular music to theme parks. We pay special attention to questions of desire, and to the ways popular culture has mediated and produced pleasure, disgust, fear and satisfaction. Alternating lecture/discussion format.

AMS 236," Difference and the Digital MediaIn this course, we will examine the ways that “difference”—race, gender, sexuality, disability, and class—is produced and reproduced in an era of digital media. Some questions to guide our inquiry include: How do digital technologies and digital media contribute to the intersectional production of gender, sexuality, disability, and race, particularly as these categories overlap 84 American Studieswith converged media, consumption, capital, labor, citizenship, participation, and surveillance? How are concepts of difference embodied in technology? In addition, we will trace how people use technology to resist and challenge racial, gender, and sexual norms. Enrollment limit of 20.

AMS 241," Disability in Popular CultureFrom butt-kicking warriors like Imperator Furiosa, to state leaders like New York governor David Paterson and former president FDR, to ultra-glamorous models like Jillian Mercado and Nyle DiMarco, images of and persons with disabilities have shaped the discourse of American popular culture. Though popular literary genres have long framed disability as tragic or pitiable, disabled writers have successfully appropriated popular, commercial styles to leverage critiques against dominant conceptions of disability. The purpose of this course is to investigate what arguments these popular texts make, whether implicitly or explicitly, about disability. Enrollment limit of 20.

AMS 253," Native Literacies to 1880This course explores the meaning and use of writing—in many forms—within Native communities in the Americas. We challenge the conventional understanding of writing by examining texts not usually considered as such—like hieroglyphic codices, wampum belts, khipu, and winter counts—alongside poetry, sermons, memoirs and treaties. To facilitate this work, the course is arranged thematically by tribe, technology, or text, rather than chronology, allowing us to deepen our knowledge about the peoples and histories concerned each week. In addition, we immerse ourselves in current-day debates over language study, textual recovery, cultural heritage and scholarly ethics.

AMS 340," Symposium in American StudiesTopics course. Limited to senior majorsCulture and CatastropheAccording to a growing number of social theorists and scientists, the critical task of our time is to grasp the environmental conditions, economic systems, techno-logical developments, and political ideologies that have set us on a path to con-verging and compounding catastrophes: climate change, resource exhaustion, inequality, social fragmentation, and political repression.  This course begins by examining how these conditions have shaped American culture, and asks why news broadcasts, the entertainment industry, and social media so often respond to crises with distraction, diversion, disinformation, fear-mongering, and scape-goating.  We explore the efforts of artists and activists to devise expressive forms (in visual arts, fiction, poetry, essays, movies, music) to constructively confront social and environmental hazards. {H} {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered each fall"
AMS 341," Symposium in American StudiesTopics course. Limited to senior majors.Performing Deviant BodiesThis course examines how individuals whose bodies deviate from privileged norms in U.S. culture-whether because of race, gender, sexuality or disability-put their bodies on display.  We define non-normative embodiment broadly; though, since embodied differences are very often linked to disability in some way, this course heavily  discusses embodiment through different conceptions of disablement, health, illness or fitness.  We investigate how and why disabled or chronically ill authors so frequently engage theatrical genres, are we look at how their texts function both artistically ad politically.  The overarching ques-tions that guide our discussions of the course are: How does one move through the world in a body marked as non-normal?  How does one perform non-nor-mative embodiment in daily life, or in more traditional performance genres like drama or film? {H} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered each spring"

This seminar examines the history, functions and meanings of museums in society, focusing primarily on the art museum in the United States. Drawing on the ever-growing literature on museology, we look critically at the ways that museums—through their policies, programs, architecture and exhibitions—can define regional or national values, shape cultural attitudes and identities, and influence public opinion about both current and historical events. As the course is concerned with both theory and practice, and the intersection of the two, we make use of the rich resources of the Smithsonian as well as other museums in Washington, D.C. Class discussion is balanced with behind-the-scenes visits/field trips to museums, where we speak with dedicated professionals who are engaged in innovative and often challenging work in the nation’s capital.

Starting with HBO's Rome (2005–2007) and Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), we'll explore the multiple sources of the visual tropes used to construct this universe and seek to analyze it in aesthetic, historical, and ideological terms. Their twentieth-century counterparts from films of the silent era to Hollywood epics like Spartacus (1960) and Cleopatra (1963) as well as cult classics like Caligula (1979) will be scrutinized in order to gain an under-standing of how the Romans functioned cinematically as cultural signs in vary-ing historical contexts.

Through a combination of academic coursework, practical experience and independent research projects, students learn about the institutions and repositories that shape knowledge and understanding of our collective pasts through the collection, preservation, interpretation and display of artifacts, manuscripts and representation of historic sites. The concentration creates an interdisciplinary community of students engaged in first-hand use of primary sources in the arts and architecture, medicine, law, history, social activism, the histories of institutions, communities and professional organizations. Through a sequence of courses, students gain knowledge of the theory and practice of archives and public history methods through which these materials are shaped into compelling narratives. Through practical experiences in two internships, students learn about archival acquisition, processing and description skills, and building finding aids that make collections available for scholarly use. Students in disciplines in which archival research is already featured (such as history, American studies, and the study of women and gender) as well as in the sciences and a wide array of social sciences are encouraged to apply.Requirements1.

ANT 226," Archaeology of FoodThis course explores (1) how and why humans across the globe began to domesticate plant and animal resources approximately 10,000 years ago, and (2) new directions in the archaeology of food across time and space. The first part of the semester focuses on the types of archaeological data and analytical methods used to understand the “agricultural revolution.” Case studies from both centers and noncenters of domestication are used to investigate the biological, economic and social implications of changing foodways. During the remainder of the semester, emphasis is placed on exploring a number of food-related topics within archaeology, such as the relationship between agriculture and sedentism, food and gender, the politics of feasting, and methods for integrating archaeological and ethnographic approaches to the study of food across the globe. This course is also offered at Mount Holyoke College in fall 2018 ( Archaeology of Food"
ANT 229," Africa and the EnvironmentIn Western discourses, African environments are defined by violence, famine, and degradation—symptoms of African cultures that resist Western values such as private property, democracy, and environmentalism. This course encourages students to think critically about such portrayals by learning about specific environments in Africa and how humans have interacted with them across time. The syllabus is anchored in cultural anthropology, but includes units on human evolution, the origins and spread of pastoralism, the history of colonial conservation science, and more. Topics covered include gender, race, land grabbing, indigenous knowledge, the commons, the “cattle complex,” desertification, oil, dams, and nationalism. {H} {N} {S} Credits: 4Colin B.

ANT 317," Seminar: The Anthropology of Landscape—Space, Place, NatureLandscapes have long figured as a backdrop for anthropological studies, but recently the landscape has emerged as an object of deeper interest. From abandoned city blocks in Detroit, the shores of Walden Pond, the savannas of Eastern Africa, or the Chernobyl exclusion zone, landscapes are potent social and material phenomena. In this course, we explore theories of landscape from different disciplinary perspectives, and then use them to think through the ways that landscapes present themselves to anthropologists and their subjects. Topics include post-industry, colonial gardens, the US “West,” invasive species, environmental racism, time, capitalism, cartography and counter-mapping, and environmental conservation.

ANT 340," Seminar: Topics in AnthropologyTopics course.Ethnographic WritingAnthropological writing must convey the life-worlds of people and the textures of ethnographic encounters and fieldwork, and engage with and refine an-thropological theories. How can writing do all of this at once? And as we craft a narrative, what do we leave out? Do we really describe ethnographic “reality” or do we create anthropological fictions? Why then do we look to ethnographic accounts to understand societies and cultures? Anthropological writing has dealt with these questions and more since its inception but most profoundly since the 1980s. In this class, we read pieces that reflect on and innovate with writing as anthropological praxis, the doubts that have riddled it and the larger develop-ments these doubts have engendered around issues of fact versus fiction, repre-sentation, narrative style, writing as a form of political action and the creation of knowledge. We also workshop ethnographic writing in class to observe these tensions in our own work, understand them as rites in the creation of anthropo-logical knowledge and work through them to craft anthropological narratives. {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"
ANT 342," Seminar: Topics in AnthropologyTopics course.Biopower, Biopolitics, and GovernanceThe obesity epidemic, personalized cancer treatments, and the commercializa-tion of surrogate pregnancy represent manifestations of Foucault's conception of biopower or the regulation of the lives of individuals and populations.  While institutions like law, medicine, and public health can make visible state interests in bodies and population, more indirect social processes operate to the same ends.  For example, advertising and consumer products indirectly shape norms and ideals convergent with government interests.  This seminar explores the workings and limitations of biopower, biopolitics, and governance through case studies drawn from anthropology.

TCM, however, has un-dergone numerous transitions and transformations throughout its history. TCM has also traveled throughout the world where its principles and theories have been adopted in the development of medical systems in Japan and Korea among others. In the past 30 years, TCM has gained increasing popularity and credibil-ity in the U.S. and Europe. This course examines how Traditional Chinese Medi-cine, much as any medical system of theory and practice, responds to historical and contemporary social, economic and political forces within China and in countries such as Japan and the U.S. Students explore the broad question as to what constitutes TCM through time and across cultures as a means to better un-derstand the processes of translation and transformation of theories, beliefs and practices in different cultural, political, economic and social contexts.

A core question is whether there is a meaningful distinction between an anthropology of medical ethics and an anthropology in medical ethics. Students select a medical ethics issue to explore in depth, with the goal of determining the sociocultural context that has shaped the way the issue is framed. {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"

ANT 352," Seminar: Topics in AnthropologyTopics course.The Anthropology of MulticulturalismIn the United States, the idea of multiculturalism has come to symbolize the right of communities with distinct cultures to maintain their own ways of liv-ing in a diverse national society. Similar politics of difference have developed in other countries in the world. But is multiculturalism the same idea in every national context? How do the different histories of countries in North or South America, Europe, Asia or Africa influence the way that these different national multiculturalisms develop? How do trans-national trends in the politics of cul-ture and diversity get adapted to work in these different contexts? The course will 92 Anthropologyfocus on specific historic and ethnographic studies that document the relation-ship between the culture and history of different national and local communi-ties and trends of contemporary multicultural traditions. A range of readings will introduce general topics which students will apply to specific contexts for their own research. {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate yearsPolitics of LanguageLanguage policies have emerged as a particularly contentious space in which national and minority groups express their sense of collective identity and rights.

In this seminar, each student develops a case study of language rights issues based on a particular language or language group.

Consequently, equal weight is given to studio practice and historical analysis. Courses focus on images and the built environment and seek to foster an understanding of visual culture and human expression in a given time and place. There is one art major, which may be taken in one of three variations: Plan A (History of Art, ARH), Plan B (Studio Art, ARS), or Plan C (Architecture, ARU).No course counting toward the fulfillment of the major or minor may be taken for an S/U grade. Courses associated with a concentration (such as IDP, MUX, etc.) cannot be counted toward the completion of the art major.Plan A.

Group A  {A} {H} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate yearsFrom Eyes to I: The Art of Portraiture A major artistic genre, portraiture invites us to examine historically changing notions of identity, personal and collective, private and public. Within a broad time span (antiquity to contemporary practices), the main focus is on Western paintings created between 1400 and 1900. Through the combined study of visual examples and art historical approaches, we explore such issues as: strate-gies of self-fashioning; tensions between norm and individuality, realism and idealization; the roles of portraits and self-portraits in cementing social roles and manufacturing gendered bodies. Group A  {A} {H} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate yearsHistory of European Decorative Arts, 1400-1800Costly raw materials and boundlessly creative workmanship were deployed to fashion and acquire cameos and engraved gems, ceramics, clothing, embroi-dery, enamel, furniture, ivory, jewelry, luxuriously bound manuscripts and print-ed books, medals, metalwork and tapestries, among other objects. This course examines these and other “minor” arts with an eye toward reconstructing their rich cultural, symbolic and aesthetic charge; their role in the conduct of diplo-macy and statecraft; and original contexts of production, marketing, patronage, use, collecting and display.

Among the topics considered are the indissoluble Plinian link between art and nature on the one hand, and cabinets of curiosities (Kunst- und Wun-derkammern) on the other; the art market; the design of purpose-built galleries, museums, and libraries; the illustrated recording or publication of renowned collections ("paper museums"); the nineteenth-century foundation (or reconsti-tution) of national and municipal art collections.

Starting with HBO's Rome (2005-2007) and Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), we'll explore the multiple sources of the visual tropes used to construct this universe and seek to analyze it in aesthetic, historical, and ideological terms. Their twentieth-century counterparts from films of the silent era to Hollywood epics like Spartacus (1960) and Cleopatra (1963) as well as cult classics like Caligula (1979) will be scrutinized in order to gain an under-standing of how the Romans functioned cinematically as cultural signs in vary-ing historical contexts.

These powerful visualiza-tion tools produce compelling seamless worlds, but ones which raise challenging questions of interpretation. By seeking to understand the models and assumptions on which these visual worlds are based, we delve into contemporary and ancient modes of viewership, identity and spatial experience.

By lack, excess, or hybrid permutations, they unsettled the boundaries between the human, the animal, and the mon-strous, opening up a creative space for the deployment of the marvelous, written as well as visual. Broad questions about cultural identity and alterity are exam-ined through the prism of case studies that draw on a broad range of sources, from illuminated manuscripts, sculpted works, world maps to encyclopedias and travel accounts.

She must present a portfolio of work to the Portfolio Review Committee. Portfolios will be reviewed each semester, just before the advising period. Students who receive a negative evaluation will be encouraged to take an additional studio course or courses, and resubmit their 100 Artportfolio at a subsequent review time. Students who receive a negative evalua-tion may resubmit their portfolios in subsequent reviews up to and including the last portfolio review available during their sophomore year. These students will be offered suggestions for strengthening their portfolios through additional studio coursework in the same or other media represented in the portfolio. The additional studio courses will count toward fulfilling the major requirements.  Mapping the Plan B major Upon receiving a positive portfolio evaluation, a student should select and meet with a Plan B adviser. Together they will discuss her interests and review her studio work to date, and select an area of studio in which she will concentrate. In exceptional cases the student and her adviser may design a sequence of studio courses that draws from several areas of con-centration.The following courses are repeatable with different course content and instruc-tor, for a maximum of 8 credits:  Senior Exhibition WorkshopThis one-semester capstone course is required of senior and j-term junior Plan B majors.

Through iterative and digital processes which engage light and air as their main references, students integrate drawingand making to construct and reconstruct lines in both virtual and physical space, and in two and three dimensions. Materialization of digital processes is tested through multiple full-scale, physical models. Through the act of making and remaking constructed lines, students oscillate between intuitive and critical modes of thinking, while further developing foundation level design skills including analytic drawing, digital fabrication, and issues relating to scale and site specificity.

Readings, class discussion and assignments juxtapose different, sometimes conflicting, interpretations of art-works, highlighting how these reflect intellectual and ethical assumptions about what matters most in art—and, by extension, society in general. From formal analysis to more recent art historical approaches, informed by gender and sexu-ality studies, our investigation brings us to consider the merits and limitations of studying the ‘‘canon’’ and what, if anything, remains to be said about Impres-sionism.

We also compare later innovations from Labrouste’s Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris to Snøhetta’s award-winning 2002 Bibliotheca Alexandrina on the site of the ancient library, to Maya Lin’s reno-vation of Neilson Library in analyzing how the buildings themselves make systems of knowledge manifest.

It focuses on bestiaries or treatises on ani-mals, the genre from which modern zoology would emerge. Themes include the depiction of animals; classifications of the animal kingdom; the collecting of animals in menageries and of animal parts in cabinets of curiosity.

Kellum, Ph.D., Professor of Art, Director  John Slepian, M.F.A., Associate Professor of Art  Fraser Stables, M.F.A., Professor of Art  Steve Waksman, Ph.D., Professor of Music  The arts and technology minor engages students and faculty from across the campus and from all three academic divisions. The emphasis is on arts plural, including art, music, dance, theater and film, and on technology broadly con-ceived, including computer science, engineering, mathematics and statistics, physics, and other interested departments.This interdisciplinary minor provides students with a strong foundation in media arts and technology studies, while laying the groundwork for more advanced work in this area. Two primary strengths of the minor are the broad range of topics and approaches to which students are exposed, and the indi-vidualized nature of each student’s trajectory through the minor. The field of arts and technology is by nature diverse and rapidly changing, and therefore requires broad exposure, as well as self-direction and high motivation from the student. With careful and attentive advising, our students are able to navigate this complex field successfully, while developing the background and experience necessary for more advanced work.Although each student’s path through the minor is unique, all students must meet certain core requirements. The requirements entail six courses structured into three layers: a specific foundational level, a flexible intermediate level and a culminating Special Studies. Students take one or more of the foundation-level courses to discover how technology is employed in various fields of art, to experi-ence the process of art critique and to identify the areas of creativity in which they are interested. The intermediate-level courses provide a progressive inter-disciplinary structure that guides students to embrace at least two disciplines, at increasingly advanced levels of artistic and technological stages. The sixth course is a Special Studies the student designs with her advisers. There are many exciting possibilities, including collaborations with other students, and venues for performance, exhibitions, demonstrations and publications.The MinorRequirementsSix semester courses: at least one foundational course, at least three intermedi-ate courses, and a culminating Special Studies. Students are encouraged to incorporate appropriate Five College courses and to design their intermediate course plan in consultation with an arts and technology minor adviser. 1.

Working with the premise that film has been arguably the most influential, powerful and central creative medium of the age, the course examines how film has been influenced by, and how it has influenced, interacted with, critiqued, defined, and been defined by other media. Historically we examine how film has moved from a marginal to a mainstream art form, while still often maintaining a very active avant-garde practice. We’ll look at how cinema and other moving images have consistently and trans-historically grappled with certain fundamental issues and themes, comparing the nature of cinematic investigations with those of other media. Over the course of the semester, we shall also attend to the idea of “film” in rela-tion to the larger category of “moving image.” {A} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"

Students entering with a particularly strong background in physics should confer with a member of the department about taking a more advanced course in place of one or more of our introducto-ry courses.  Students with scores of 4 and 5 on the Advancement Placement tests in physics B and C may apply that credit toward the degree unless they complete 117 and 118 for credit, respectively.The MajorAdvisers: Members of the department Physics is crucial to understanding our world. Physics challenges our imagina-tion, provides insight into our most important challenges and leads to great dis-coveries and new technologies. Physicists are problem solvers whose analytical skills and training make them versatile and adaptable. A foundation in physics provides a gateway to interdisciplinary careers incorporating many scientific and educational fields, including astronomy, engineering, biology, chemistry, climate science, environmental science, geoscience, mathematics, medicine and teaching.The undergraduate physics curriculum at Smith stresses the fundamental principles, concepts and methods of physics with emphasis placed on analytical reasoning, problem -solving and the critical evaluation of underlying assump-tions in theory and experiment. Built around the core courses that achieve this goal, the major allows options within the requirements that provide flexibility to students primarily interested in interdisciplinary applications of physics. The requirements for the major are as follows: 117, 118, 210, 215, 240, 317, 318, 319, 327, 350 (at least 4 credits), 360 (or an approved 300 level alternative in physics or a related field), and 399.While students are typically discouraged from taking PHY major requirements S/U, it may be allowed, after consultation with a student's major advisor and approval of the Department.

Course substitutions require approval of the student’s adviser and assistant director or director of the engineering department.Liberal Arts BreadthAs with all BA degrees at Smith, the Engineering Arts degree requires 64 credits outside of the major.The major requires a total of 13 courses (or the equivalent).Engineering Science, Bachelor of ScienceAdvisers: Members of the Picker Engineering ProgramSmith offers an undergraduate curriculum leading to an ABET-accredited de-gree in engineering science, the broad study of the foundational scientific and engineering principles that govern the practice of all engineering disciplines. The bachelor of science degree program is accredited by the Engineering Ac-creditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The American Society for Engineering Education, identifying the critical need for broadly educated engineers, points out that the design of an engineering curriculum should “rec-ognize the pitfalls of overspecialization in the face of an increasing demand for graduates who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets.” An integral component of the program is the continuous emphasis on the use of engineering science principles in design. This culminates in a final capstone design project that incorporates broad-based societal aspects. Students are encouraged to pursue a corporate and/or research internship to complement their classroom instruc-tion. Engineers must be able to communicate effectively and work in team settings. Smith’s highly-regarded writing intensive first-year curriculum ensures that engineering students begin their engineering curriculum with appropriate communication skills that will be refined during the remainder of their studies. Every engineering course offered at Smith incorporates elements of teamwork and oral/written communication.Director, Picker Engineering ProgramAndrew John Guswa, Ph.D.  ProfessorsJudith B.

How do scientists, decision makers and the public communicate with each other, and how can scientists do better at it? What should the role of scientists be in advocacy and social movements? How does scientific information influence lifestyle and behavior choices among the public at large? We focus on three topics with close ties to astronomy: (1) global climate change, which involves basic atmospheric physics; (2) light pollution, which wastes billions of dollars per year and ruins our view of the starry sky without providing the safety it promises; and (3) controversial development of mountaintop observations such as the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea, HI.

In this seminar, we focus on the central question of what can be achieved by approaching biol-ogy from an engineering mindset. Specifically, what can be learned by treating biological components (proteins and nucleic acids) and systems (signaling and metabolic networks) as interchangeable machine-like parts? We study examples of this intellectual and experimental approach and how its application has en-hanced our understanding of cell biology. Harnessing biological systems for the production of pharmaceuticals and hydrocarbon fuel sources is also considered. Finally, we explore the prospect of affecting and interacting with cells using engineered nanoscale devices made from biological building blocks and the po-tential application of these techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

Independent research is also highly recommended in preparation for graduate school. BiochemistryPrehealth Professional ProgramsStudents may prepare for health profession schools by majoring in any area, as long as they take courses that meet the minimum requirements for entrance. For most schools, these are two semesters each of English, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, math and biology. The science courses must include laboratories. The requirements for the biochemistry major include several of the courses necessary for entrance into health professional programs, making the major an excellent choice for students applying to programs in medicine, den-tistry, pharmacy or veterinary medicine. Other courses often required or recom-mended include biochemistry, calculus and statistics, and social or behavioral science. Because health profession schools differ in the details of their require-ments, students should confer with a prehealth adviser as early as possible about specific requirements.Advisers: David Bickar, Nate Derr, David Gorin, Adam Hall, Elizabeth Jamieson, Stylianos Scordilis, Cristina Suarez, Christine White-Ziegler and Steven WilliamsHonors Director: David Bickar Honors ProjectCredits: 8Members of the departmentNormally offered each academic year Honors ProjectCredits: 8Members of the departmentNormally offered each academic year"

The spread of diseases such as Ebola, Chikungunya, Dengue Fever, West Nile, SARS, avian influenza, malaria, river blindness and many other parasitic infections is also a worrisome trend. What can we learn from the great pandem-ics of the past (the great influenza of 1918, the Black Death of the Middle Ages, the typhus epidemic of 1914–21, and others)? How can modern biotechnol-ogy be applied to the development of new drugs and vaccines to prevent such pandemics in the future? In addition to natural infections, we now must also be concerned with rare diseases such as anthrax and smallpox that may be introduced to large populations by bioterrorism. The challenges are great but new tools of molecular biology (genomics, proteomics, RNA interference, next-generation sequencing and others) provide unprecedented opportunities to un-derstand infectious diseases and to develop new strategies for their elimination.

It allows for a deeper focus in Buddhism, offering an interdisciplinary complement to one’s major as well as an important credential for graduate admissions. Complete details about the Buddhist studies program are available at www.smith.edu/buddhism/Requirements"
BUS 120," The Study of Buddhism is required of all Buddhist studies minors. The minor also requires 24 additional credit hours drawn from at least two disci-plines, including anthropology, art history, literature, philosophy, religion and sociology, or others where appropriate, chosen in consultation with the minor adviser. Buddhist studies is interdisciplinary, and students must understand mul-tiple approaches to the field in order to study it successfully.Students should study Buddhism as it is practiced in at least two of the fol-lowing four geographical areas: South and Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Tibeto-Himalayan region, and the West. Buddhism is constituted differently in different cultures, and it is important to understand this diversity in order to make sense of Buddhism's development and dissemination.The minor should comprise study of both classical and contemporary Bud-dhism. The Buddhist tradition cannot be understood without an appreciation of its rich history and evolution. Nevertheless, any understanding of Buddhism would be incomplete without a sense of its contemporary manifestations and role in world culture.No language study is required for the minor. A maximum of 8 credits to-wards the minor may be satisfied by the study of a language relevant to Buddhist studies (to be approved by the minor adviser). This language might be a ca-nonical language, or a modern language that facilitates research in Buddhism. Buddhist studies relies on linguistic competence, and students who intend to pursue graduate studies in Buddhist studies are strongly encouraged to study languages. Credit for language will only be given for courses at the second-year level or above.At least 8 credits in the minor must be taken at Smith; up to 12 credits of overseas study may be counted. The minor requires one seminar addressing a topic in Buddhist studies.Courses The Study of BuddhismThis course introduces students to the academic study of Buddhism through readings, lectures by Smith faculty and guests, and trips to local Buddhist centers. We critically examine the history of Buddhist studies within the context of numerous disciplines, including anthropology, art, cultural studies, gender studies, government, literature, philosophy and religion, with a focus on regional, sectarian and historical differences. Materials to be considered include poetry, painting, philosophy, political tracts and more. This course meets during the first half of the semester only. Graded S/U only.

GRK 100Y," Elementary GreekA yearlong introduction to ancient Greek through the language of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the two 8th-century epics that represent the culmination of a long and rich tradition of oral poetry. The ancients regarded these poems as unparalleled masterpieces; the great tragedian Aeschylus called his own plays "crumbs from Homer's table," and both epics have endured over the millennia and are still alive and relevant. Identity, love, seduction, loyalty, the tension between individualism and community, between home and adventure—these are some of the very human issues the Odyssey explores.

Two practical experiences, which may include:• A minimum of a semester, or equivalent, studying abroad in the foreign language and culture.• An internship or independent research project that focuses on translation/interpretation or cross-cultural issues; that engages the foreign language in a significant way; and which may be undertaken while on study abroad.Financial support for internships or practical experiences are available through Smith’s own study abroad and consortia, Praxis, and International Experience Grants, as well as a number of other grants for specific regions available for stu-dents studying or interning abroad or in immigrant communities in the United States. The Study Abroad programs, the Office for International Study, and the Lazarus Career Center have built databases of students who have worked, in-terned or studied abroad with organizations or companies and that offer a ready resource for concentrators.Demonstration of achievement in the foreign language[s] from which the student translates. Student must reach a high intermediate level or B2 level according to the Common European Framework of References for Languages. Students are encouraged to take the officially recognized tests whenever pos-sible, for example, when studying abroad on Smith’s Study Abroad programs. Normally, advanced-level courses (at the 300 or above level) will be considered to be equivalent to the B2 level of the CEFRL. For students working in “critical languages”—or non-Western languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Ko-rean, Russian, Turkish, Urdu—the level of achievement should be the 300-level at Smith and with consultation with their adviser. International students, or students whose native language is other than English, should consult with their concentration adviser on how best to show they have attained the equivalent of a B2 level in English, the language from which they will translate.E-Portfolio Language PassportStudents will be expected to develop an e-portfolio Language Passport with the guidance of the Director of the Concentration. Students may include the fol-lowing in their e-portfolio: a detailed language self-assessment; a reflection on their language-learning; a reflection on how their practical experiences have deepened their understanding of the language and culture they are studying; a shortened version of the introduction to their final translation project.Capstone: A choice of three possibilities:1. An independent translation project (10 pages minimum, depending on the type of translation) with a substantial introduction that reflects on the ob-stacles, difficulties and successes of the task of translation.2. An extra translation project within the context of an existing seminar or 300-level course in the language or culture of the student’s translation focus. (If students choose this option, the course will be in addition to the other four academic courses required for the concentration.)3. An Honors thesis that is a translation project or reflects on translation.Whichever of the three options the student chooses for the capstone, she will consult with her concentrator adviser.

Yamamoto, M.A. (Art)  The Community Engagement and Social Change (CESC) concentration allows each participating student to connect an interdisciplinary area of interest to practical work in communities. Examples of areas of interest include immigra-tion and citizenship, public health, education, law and policy, community or-ganizing, community narratives, environmental justice, activist science, social movements, and arts and activism.Through a combination of carefully selected coursework, practical experi-ences, independent research projects and guided reflection, students (1) expand and deepen their understanding of local, national and global issues that affect communities, and (2) develop the skills, attitudes and knowledge necessary to collaborate mindfully with these communities as citizens and leaders.The CESC concentration draws on the rich curricular offerings at Smith College and in the Five Colleges, as well as the resources and expertise available through the Jandon Center for Community Engagement, other centers and offices at Smith, and the Smith College School for Social Work. For more infor-mation, see the CESC concentration webpage.RequirementsThe CESC concentration is open to any student by application. The application is available online at the JCCE website.

Helen plays a cameo role, while Clytemnestra is regularly invoked as a negative example. Together these women define a spectrum of female roles and possibilities: the faithful wife, the bride-to-be, the temptress, the adulteress, the murderer. We begin with a careful reading of the Odyssey, then study the afterlife of its female characters in the Western literary tradition. Readings are drawn from authors both ancient (Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Ovid) and modern (H.D., Robert Graves, Louise Glück, Margaret Drabble). This course counts toward the classics, classical studies and study of women and gender majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4Scott A.

Theorists and practitioners continue to debate how to bring community issues into the classroom and how best to bring students into the neighborhoods surrounding their colleges and universities. This course considers these issues through exposure to both the literature of community engagement and the experiences of those who practice its different forms.  serves as a gateway course for the Community Engagement and Social Change concentration. As such, one of the primary purposes of the course is to give students exposure to the varied opportunities available at the college for engaging with communities. Specifically, the course focuses on volunteer opportunities, course-based engagement and examples of community-based research. Within and across these different approaches, we identify and explore the ethical issues that characterize community partnerships and the best practices that attempt to address these issues. Students also interact with peers, faculty, guest speakers, and community members who provide firsthand perspectives on the local practice of CBL and the critical needs in surrounding communities.

We compare how these translations transform the original novel and question the concept of original text as it interacts with the culture and the language into which it is translated. Students are responsible for presenting essays that focus on the particular challenges of translation that they have encountered in their individual project. Open to students in the Concentration in Translation Studies and students in Comparative Literature. Enrollment limit of 12 students. Prerequisite: , a 4-credit course spring semester of their final year in the concentration. The course will include readings on issues of translation and focus on discussion of the students’ projects. Offered every spring semester.Urban Studies 369Urban StudiesAdvisersRandall K.

It is designed with enough flexibility to allow a student to choose among many possible combi-nations, but requires her to experience at least three different disciplinary ap-proaches.The minor consists of six courses from at least three different departments or programs. Courses offered at other Five College campuses may be included in the minor, with the approval of one of the advisers. A sample listing of approved Smith courses can be found on this site under the “Courses” tab.

CLT 340," Problems in Literary TheoryTopics course.Comparative Literature in the Age of CosmopolitanismsThe concept of cosmopolitanism has recently gone through a process of democ-ratization. Dismissing the singular “cosmopolitanism” as a form of Eurocentric universalism, critics today study a plurality of cosmopolitanisms, focusing on transnational experiences, both elite and subaltern, Western and non-Western. How can we study comparative literature within this new framework? If the Western canon is no longer setting the standards, what are the new aesthetic values? How can we avoid the pitfalls of both cultural relativism and Oriental-ism, that is, reading unfamiliar literatures through an exotic lens? Does “World Literature” promote reading in translation at the expense of original languages? Authors may include Appiah, Apter, Casanova, Chakrabarty, Damrosch, Moretti, Nussbaum, Robbins, Said, Coetzee, Maalouf, Pamuk and Zadie Smith. The sem-inar is required of senior majors.

We then move to the late 19th century to consider the first modern examples of Japanese women’s writing. How does the existence of a “feminine literary tradition” in pre-modern Japan influence the writing of women during the modern period? How do these texts reflect, resist and reconfigure conventional representations of gender? We explore the possibilities and limits of the articulation of feminine and feminist subjectivities, as well as investigate the production of such categories as “race,” class and sexuality in relation to gender and to each other.

Subjects that belong today to separate academic disci-plines were rarely so separated in the Middle Ages, and it is therefore appropriate that students be given an opportunity to bring these subjects together again. The great diversity of regional cultures in medieval Europe was balanced by a con-scious attempt to hold to a unified view of the world that embraced religious and social ideals, Latin and vernacular literature, and music and the visual arts.The medieval studies major and minor provide students with an opportunity to re-create for themselves, through courses in a variety of related disciplines, an un-derstanding of the unity and of the diversity of European civilization in the Middle Ages. The medieval studies major and minor are designed so that they can form valuable complements to a major or minor in one of the participating departments.The MajorLatin Requirement:All medieval studies majors are expected to achieve a working knowledge of the Latin language. This requirement may be satisfied by taking at least one Latin course (4 credits) at the 200 level or above. If a student has no prior Latin or is insufficiently prepared for a 200-level course, she will take Latin 100d (8 credits) in order to fulfill this requirement. However, all students are urged to continue Latin at the 200 level. A biblical or Koranic language (Greek, Hebrew, Arabic) can substitute for Latin with permission of the adviser. The student must pursue the classical or scriptural form of the language, not modern Greek, Hebrew or Arabic. Required Courses:A total of 10 semester courses from the following list of approved courses, ex-cluding the Latin requirement, distributed in four areas as follows:• Two courses in medieval history: normally these are . {M} {QS} Credits: 5Katherine H.

MTH 206,". Education is increasingly data driven—data is used to evaluate classroom pedagogy, student achievement, teacher efficacy and school failure. It is important for educators then, to be able to interpret complex data and make research-based decisions. This course fosters student’s ability to critically interpret education-related data by concentrating on the application of critical thinking skills to arguments involving statistics in education. The student emerges as a knowledgeable consumer of statistics rather than a producer of statistical calculations. Course activities focus on the interpretation, evaluation and communication of statistics in educational research literature, standardized tests, and real-world situations. Prerequisites: "

Engineers must have the understanding needed to address the cultural, political, and economic realities of our times, along with the technical depth to appropriately frame complex problems using ethical reasoning. The preparation for such a path is argued to be effectively achieved in a liberal arts setting.At Smith, the engineering degrees offered are based on rigorous plans of study integrated with the liberal arts and sciences. There are two possible paths for the study of engineering at Smith College. The first is the ABET-accredited bachelor of science (S.B.) in engineering science, and the second is the bachelor of arts (A.B.) in engineering arts. More detailed information about both degree options can be found below.The Picker Engineering Program’s educational objectives are to produce gradu-ates who, within a few years of graduation, will:1. incorporate their knowledge and understanding of the natural sciences, hu-manities, and social sciences in the application of their engineering education;2. apply their engineering education in service to humanity; 3. enter the engineering profession or graduate school if they choose one of those pathways;4. consider the impact of their professional actions on society;5. demonstrate leadership in their personal and professional endeavors; and6. have advanced their professional development by acquiring new skills and knowledge.Prior to graduation, all students majoring in engineering science are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (the FE), adminis-tered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying.The MajorsEngineering Arts, Bachelor of ArtsAdvisers: Members of the Picker Engineering ProgramThe Purpose of the Major. The bachelor of arts in engineering arts is offered for those students who recognize the increasing importance of engineering and design in today’s world, who want to better understand the engineer’s role in service to humanity, and who do not intend to pursue professional practice as engineers. The bachelor of arts is not an ABET-accredited degree.The Importance of the Liberal Arts. The possibilities of coupling the bachelor of arts in engineering arts with other disciplines are boundless. The bachelor of arts coupled with a focused set of studies in the liberal arts is a particularly well-suited course of study for preparing students to address the complexities of the world in which we live.Requirements for the Major in Engineering ArtsMath / Basic Science• "

Both programs share the goal of producing leaders for the 21st century, as well as the belief that successful engineers can identify the needs of society and direct their talents toward meeting them. Students typically exchange in the spring semester of their junior year.Prior to applying for admission to the program, a student will discuss the course and research opportunities with their academic adviser. Applications must be submitted to the engineering program during the sophomore year on the same schedule as applications for junior year abroad. Adviser to the Princeton–Smith Exchange: Martin J. GreenHonorsDirector: Susannah HoweThere are three distinct pathways to honors within engineering. A student may earn honors through only one of these pathways. Seminar: Atmospheric ProcessesThe atmosphere is among the most critically important parts of our environment. Atmospheric processes control our weather and climate, provide the nutrients for nearly all life on earth, and determine the quality of the air we breathe. This seminar explores key topics including atmospheric circulation, global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion and urban air pollution. How does ground-level ozone form and why is it harmful to people and agriculture? What are high-pressure systems and why are they associated with fair weather? How do clouds form and what impact do they have on our climate? What instruments are being used to measure the properties of the atmosphere and how do these instruments work? This course is recommended for anyone with a solid grounding in math and science and will be of interest to all students who want a better understanding of the environment.

During their study of literature at Smith, English majors are also encouraged to take allied courses in classics, other literatures, history, philosophy, religion, art, film and theatre. Fuller descriptions of each term’s courses, faculty profiles, and other important information for majors and those interested in literary study can be found on the department’s Web page, accessible via the Smith College home page.Most students begin their study of literature at Smith with English 120 or a first-year seminar before proceeding to one of the courses—199 or 200—that serves as a gateway for the major. First-year students who have an English Literature and Composition AP score of 4 or 5, or a score of 710 on the Critical Reading portion of the SAT, may enter one of the gateway courses in the fall semester. Those first-year students who have taken a gateway course in the fall may, after consultation with the instructor, elect a 200-level class beyond the gateway in the spring.The MinorThe minor in English consists of six courses to be distributed as follows: two gateway courses ("
ENG 199,", 200); three additional English courses (no more than two of which can be writing workshops) chosen in consultation with the minor adviser; one seminar. Only one elective course may be at the 100 level ( and  Methods of Literary StudyThis course teaches the skills that enable us to read literature with understanding and pleasure. By studying examples from a variety of periods and places, students learn how poetry, prose fiction and drama work, how to interpret them and how to make use of interpretations by others. English 199 seeks to produce perceptive readers well equipped to take on complex texts. This gateway course for prospective English majors is not recommended for students simply seeking a writing intensive course. Readings in different sections vary, but all involve active discussion and frequent writing. Enrollment limited to 20 per section. WI {L} Credits: 4Floyd D. Cheung, Jina Boyong Kim, Richard H.

ENG 120," or a FYS in literature). No course counting toward the minor may be taken for an S/U grade.The MajorAdvisers: Members of the departmentMajor RequirementsThe English major requires at least ten semester courses. The following re-quirements aim to provide majors with a broad understanding of literatures in English, acquaint them with the key questions and intellectual strategies that shape the discipline of literary study, and offer them the opportunity to work independently at an advanced level.I. Major in English with a Literary Emphasis1. Majors take two gateway courses: English 199 (Methods of Literary Study) provides foundational methodological training in interpretation; English 200 (The English Literary Tradition I) offers an historical survey of English literature from its origins through the 18th century.2. Because their writing has been so crucial to the history of literary study and so generative for later writers, we require at least one course wholly devoted to works by Chaucer, Shakespeare or Milton.3. Because the spread of the British Empire has made English a global lan-guage with a rich array of divergent postcolonial literary traditions, and because multiple racial formations in North America have generated differ-ent ethnic American and diasporic literatures, we require at least one course at the 200-level (or above) with a focus on the global/racial as a central category of analysis.4. To encourage our students to move toward independence and sophistica-tion as they pursue their studies, we require, as capstone experiences, one 300-level seminar in literature and one of the following: a four-credit special studies course, a second seminar, an honors thesis, a long-term Kahn Insti-tute project, or a relevant four-credit concentration capstone course.5. At least four additional courses, one of which may be in creative writing.II. Major in English with a Creative Writing Emphasis1. Two gateway courses: English 199 (Methods of Literary Study) and English 200 (The English Literary Tradition I).2. At least one course wholly devoted to works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, or Mil-ton.3. At least one course at the 200-level or above with a focus on the global/racial as a central category of analysis.4. At least three writing workshops, two of which must be at the 200 or 300 level.5. At least one additional course in literature.6. As capstone experiences, one 300-level seminar in literature and one of the following:  a 4-credit special studies, a second seminar, a year-long Kahn Institute project, a relevant concentration capstone, or a thesis in creative writing, to be completed in the senior year, and7. Completion of ,  Colloquia in LiteratureEach colloquium is conducted by means of directed discussion, with emphasis on close reading and writing. Priority is given to incoming students in the fall-semester sections of the colloquia. Other students should consult the course instructor about possible openings. Enrollment in each section limited to 20.Reading and Writing Short PoemsPoet Dean Young encourages the poet to “riot in the unattainable.” In this class students are encouraged to riot (on the page) while reading widely, from Basho to Bishop, in order to understand the ways in which poetry gives voice to the ordinary and the ineffable. Students study a variety of poetic forms and styles as well as the essential elements of craft. In addition to writing short analytical essays, students write and revise their own original poetry. Enrollment is limited to 20. WI {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered both fall and spring semestersReading and Writing Short StoriesWriting comes from reading. In this course, we explore how other writers have used the short story form and, in so doing, have become part of a tradition—a tradition that students in the class, as writers themselves, will join. While we work on at least one analytical paper, much of the work in this class involves the creation of short stories. We work on such elements as plot, theme, characteriza-tion, description and dialogue. Students are welcome to explore any genre they wish in their own writing.

ENG 135,") or one FYS taught by a mem-ber of the English Department may count toward the major.  Introduction to Writing Creative NonfictionStudents learn to use literary techniques to write factual, engaging narratives that read like fiction. Based on research, interviews and personal experience, creative nonfiction encompasses a wide range of genres, including memoir, travel writing, nature writing, science writing, food writing and biography. Prerequisites: one WI course. Enrollment in each section limited to 16. Course may be repeated once on a different topic. (E)Creative Nonfiction About Place and TravelIn creative nonfiction writing, authors of fact-based essays and memoirs use the same craft tools as novelists—from description and dialogue to reflection, scene, structure and exposition—to tell a story. We sharpen these tools with writing and reading assignments that draw from the linked themes of place and travel, and how the passage of time changes perspectives on both. You don't have to be a seasoned traveler to join the course: you can write about any place at all, including home. We also use the Smith College Archives to write about the place we all know and share at different times in its history. Students may respond to assignments and prompts in traditional written essays; graphic essays (comics); or digital essays. Either way, be prepared to write frequently in class and out, read well, participate in class discussion, and be ready to explore your world with new eyes. Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsWriting About the ArtsStudents write true stories about art, music, theater, film and dance that read like a novel. Writing assignments include a profile of an artist or performer, a review of a performance or an exhibit, and a personal essay exploring how a work of art, theater or music influenced the author. The essays read like fiction, relying on character, pacing, scenes, structure and sensory details. Unlike fiction, these sto-ries are based on facts gathered through research, observation and interviews. The course offers tools and an approach to writing to help students develop a writing process that works for them. Enrollment limited to 16. (E) Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsWriting About Health and Healthcare in the U.S.This course teaches students how to use the tools of narrative nonfiction to write compelling, engaging, informative pieces about issues and ideas surrounding health and healthcare. We read and discuss works that illuminate the experi-ences of health and illness, and that examine how American society and the medical establishment respond to these. Each student develops her voice, her sense of purpose and her authority as a writer, while strengthening her relation-ship with her reader. Students practice revising for style, structure and accuracy. Enrollment limited to 16. Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsWriting About SportsThrough reading, in-and-out-of-class writing, and editing one another's work, students learn different forms of creative non-fiction essays through a focus on the topic of sports. Among other subjects, students may explore their own sports backgrounds, the dynamics of individual sports, sports ethics, the lives and careers of sports figures, and subjects like momentum: where does it come from and where does it go? Students are encouraged to use sports-related material in the Smith Archives and explore our sports rich environment, including Smith athletics and local landmarks such as the Basketball Hall of Fame. Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsWriting About the SensesSight, sound, touch, smell, taste: Everything we know reaches us through our senses. We share a world filtered through a million sensibilities—finding the words to convey what we hear, see, smell, taste, and feel is one of the most fun-damental skills a writer can develop. In this class, we will hone our descriptive powers to go beyond the obvious and uncover language that delights and sur-prises us even as we write. We will learn to use one sense to write about another, combine them in powerful metaphors, and explore how our senses shape the narratives that drive us.

ENG 118," does not count. No course counting toward the major may be taken for an S/U grade. We strongly recommend that all students take at least one historical sequence:  may be repeated, but only with a different instructor and with the per-mission of the director. Colloquia in WritingIn sections limited to 15 students each, this course primarily provides systematic instruction and practice in reading and writing academic prose, with emphasis on argumentation. The course also provides instruction and practice in conducting research and in public speaking. Particular sections of this course are designed to support nonnative speakers and bilinguals, who are strongly encouraged to consider those sections. Priority is given to incoming students in the fall-semester sections. Course may be repeated for credit with another instructor.Map My Words: Writing About Borders and BelongingThis course is designed to get you thinking about maps to generate ideas for your writing. Our main focus will be learning to write logical, complex aca-demic essays, and assignments will include four essays, blog posts, and a presen-tation, accompanied by lessons on rhetoric, revision, structure, grammar, and research basics. Questions addressed in discussions, readings, and essays will include: Is a map a rhetorical document? Is there bias in the language of maps? How do maps and essays hide the process of creation? What histories of explora-tion and exploitation are communicated (or silenced) by the act of mapping? (E) WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsHope and Fear: The Power of PersuasionWe are immersed in a culture of persuasion: advertisers make claims, politi-cians' promises. Yet, despite what we believe about how we make decisions, successful persuasion is often based more on emotion than logical evidence. We examine the rhetoric of persuasion from the ancient Romans to the intention-ally addictive nature of social media in order to separate the hype from the con-tent and to develop our own, authentic persuasive styles.

Home is where we live in every sense: the physical sense, yes, but also the spiritual, romantic, ideal and maybe even mythical. All of these aspects of home, hometown, home coun-try, or adopted home serve to shape our identities. In this course, we explore the importance of these spaces, be they physical or metaphysical, to the construction of “home” and how these terms, whether we accept them wholly, shun them entirely or experience them via travel, dictate to us and others a sense of self and identity. Can be repeated for credit with a different topic. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsYouth Activism, New Media and Social ChangeReading and writing analytical essays about the topic of global youth activism, new media technologies and social change.

(E) WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsAll the World’s a StageWe live in a world where everybody seems to be performing. We see this in the political arena and on reality TV shows. We see it on websites like YouTube and on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. In this class, we look at how our lives have grown more performative in the advent of new concepts like “reality,” “sincerity,” “self” and “friend,” and what that means for us as indi-viduals and as a society. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsWater: Science and PoliticsThe management of global water resources presents a major challenge for the 21st century. Water defines the boundaries of the livable world. It’s crucial for drinking, energy, travel, irrigation and food. But water can also transmit disease, flood homes and spread contamination. Students in this course hone their science-writing skills while exploring contemporary problems related to water. They focus on presenting scientific data, reasoning and controversies in accurate but lively language, while learning and writing about the politics surrounding water use. Sources include scientific research papers, government reports, news-paper articles, and op-ed pieces. May be repeated once for credit with a different instructor. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsNo, Seriously... What’s so Funny? Writing About HumorNietzsche called maturity the rediscovered seriousness of a child at play. What is the meaning of comedy, in light of this “seriousness of the child at play?” Why do we laugh, at what and in what way? How do we distinguish silly comedy from serious comedy? This course examines such questions on comic platforms including film, music, videos, short stories and cartoons. We explore the “struc-ture” of the comic moment as viewer or listener encounters surprise, transgres-sion or enchantment, especially in 20th-century comedy, and the affectivity of the comic encounter from pure “clowning” to savage social commentary.

WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered both fall and spring semestersWorth a Thousand WordsThis course explores and analyzes the popular saying, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” The saying is generally interpreted to suggest that a complex idea can be expressed in just one picture. But it also raises questions about the complex meanings of pictures and the complex process of interpreting them. We analyze images and discuss essays about the politics of interpretation. There may be opportunities to bring some of your own pictures into the course. Bilin-gual students and nonnative English speakers are especially invited to register for this section.

WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsBad HistoryGeorge Santayana famously wrote, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,” but can anyone remember all the past? Which past should I remember? Whose past? Maybe history isn't one memorizable narra-tive, but billions of individual stories and perspectives. Even if you told your own life story, which events would you include or leave out? Would you tell it as a tragedy? Comedy? Coming-of-age story? In this class, we consider the distance between history and myth, story and storyteller, the event and how it's remem-bered. We uncover histories, doubt histories, and write our own.

Our discussion will center on Daniel Gilbert’s Stumbling on Hap-piness, and will include essays by scientists, neurologists, philosophers and psychologists—all of whom engage meaningfully and surprisingly with the interplay of our senses, emotions and acculturation. By the end of the course, students will have a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the ways emotion-ality affects our lives and decisions. (E) WI Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsHow to LiveThrough wide-ranging readings from ancient philosophy to contemporary memoirs, we engage this most essential question: How are we to live our lives? Philosophers and artists, farmers and writers, religious leaders and political activists have given us a rich variety of approaches to this question, envisioning utopias both large and farm-small, proposing maxims to live by, conducting private and public experiments, condensing hard-won knowledge into prose. The range of forms of these provocative writings leads to this class’s second question: How are we to write about matters? Can be repeated for credit with a different topic.

ENG 231,", 233, 235. Students interested in graduate school in English literature would be well ad-vised to take a course in literary theory and should be aware that most doctoral programs in English require a reading knowledge of two foreign languages.  Students interested in high school teaching would be well advised to take both the English (200, 201) and the American (231, 233) literature surveys and a course in literature in English outside Britain and America. Those considering an MFA program in creative writing would be well advised to take literature courses in their chosen form or forms and to consult with their advisers about building a portfolio of selected writings.HonorsDirector:Naomi Miller (2019-2020) Inventing America: Nation, Race, FreedomThis course will focus on the extraordinary burst of literary creativity that coincided with the emergence of a new American nation. From its conflicted founding episodes to the crisis of the Civil War, American writers interpreted and criticized American life with unmatched imaginative intensity and formal boldness, taking as their particular subject both the promise of freedom implicit in the nation's invention—and the betrayals of that promise: in the horrors of slavery, and in the subtler entrapments of orthodox thinking, constricted vision, a self-poisoning psyche, and a repressive or unjust social life. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"

The motif of the post-Apocalyptic novel has become common, yet its roots go back as far (and further than) Jack London’s The Scarlet Plague and Mary Shelley’s The Last Man. In the works we will be examining, we witness the attempts of the few survivors of catastrophe to create a new world, or merely to live in a world in which the past casts a vast shadow over the present. The society that comes forth from these worlds can be anarchic, dystopic, utopian or a combination of these. Some works we explore include Alas, Babylon; On the Beach; Riddley Walker; The Postman; A Canticle for Leibowitz; The Chrysalids; The Road and others.

Any serious examination of the period, though, reveals not the fact of tranquility so much as the act of tranquilizing as Cold War tensions roiled internationally and political and social unrest continually erupted in the domestic sphere. Studying selected works of art and literature from the 1950s, this course explores some key episodes of this dynamic of conflict and conformity. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

The image belongs to George Eliot, who in Middlemarch suggested we couldn’t bear it; we would die of a sensory overload, the “roar on the other side of silence.” The novelists of the generations that followed tried to live in that roar: to explore the stream of consciousness, to capture the way we make sense of experience and order out of our memory’s chaos.

We analyze the shifting definitions and cultural work of the Gothic in contemporary American literature in the context of political and cultural events and movements and their relation to such concerns as race, gender, class, sexuality and disability. From the New Mexican desert to the rural south, from New York City, San Francisco and the suburbs of Atlanta to cyberspace, these literary encounters explore an expanse of physical, psychological, intellectual and imagined territory. {A} {L} Credits: 4Andrea Stephanie StoneExpected to be offered in the next 3 years Contemporary American Gothic LiteratureAndrea Stephanie StoneExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
ENG 228," Children's LiteratureShapes speak to us. Prose shapes us. From the picture book to the chapter book, we will explore the ways in which literature for children invents the child reading that literature. And we will attempt to break through our natural nostalgia for works we know to rediscover their innovative and experimental nature. In so doing, we will see these works work their magic on themes that will become familiar throughout the semester: identity, nostalgia, interiors and exteriors, authority, independence and dependence and, of course, the nature of wild things. Works may include Peter Rabbit; Where the Wild Things Are; Winnie-the-Pooh; Alice in Wonderland; Peter Pan; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; The Secret Garden; The Giver. {L} Credits: 4Gillian Murray KendallExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
ENG 229," Turning Novels Into Films: Imperialism, Race, Gender and Cinematic Adaptation“Not as good as the book,” is a frequent response to film adaptations of novels. Adaptation studies, an interdisciplinary field that combines literary and film studies, rejects this notion of “fidelity” (how faithful a film is to its source) and instead reads literature and film as equal but different artistic and cultural forms, where the film may translate, transmute, critique, or re-interpret the novel. This course will look closely and analytically at some paired fiction and film adaptations that focus on issues of imperialism, race, class, and gender. We’ll begin with some classics (Austen’s Mansfield Park, Forster’s Passage to India), move to international postcolonial fiction and film (Tagore’s Home and the World, Ondaatje’s The English Patient), and end with U.S. texts about non-white, hyphenated citizens (Lahiri’s Namesake, Stockett’s The Help). We will also read some critical and theoretical essays to frame our key concepts and conversations.

But sometimes the fog parts—and then comes scandal. We'll begin with Dickens' anatomy of the city in Bleak House; move on to sensation novels by Wilkie Collins and Mary Elizabeth Braddon, which contest and subvert the period's gender roles; look at murder with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Jekyll; urban bombings with Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent; and end with a neo-Victorian novel by Sarah Waters.{L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"
ENG 233," Re-forming America: Region, Race, and EmpireRe-forming the nation after the Civil War was no easy feat. During the period between 1865 and 1914, how did regions recently at war with one another view America differently? How did people of different races, classes, genders, and other identities define their relationship to the nation? What role did empire-building, science, and industrialization play in the re-forming of America into the superpower that it would become in the twentieth century? This course engages American writers as they explore these and other questions of meaning, value, and power—with an emphasis on writers who shaped, critiqued, and stood apart from their rapidly changing society. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"

How can poetry provide new ways for thinking through extinction, conservation, and environmental justice? We explore these issues by reading a selection of environmental poetry in conversation with key texts from the environmental humanities. Central to the discussions: the sublime and the aesthetics of landscape and wilderness; garbage and the poetics of waste; the ethics of representing animal and plant life; the relation between landscape, labor, and power; and how ecopoetry intervenes in debates about climate change. {L} Credits: 4Lily Gurton-WachterExpected to be offered in the next 3 years  Environmental Poetry and Ecological Thought"

ENG 247," Race, Suburbia, and the post-1945 U.S. NovelThis course aims to identify, analyze, and complicate the dominant narrative of U.S. suburbia vis-à-vis the postwar American novel. While the suburb may evoke a shared sense of tedium, U.S. fiction positions suburbia as "contested terrain," a battleground staging many of the key social, cultural, and political shifts of our contemporary age. Reading novels and short stories by writers like Toni Morrison, Hisaye Yamamoto, John Updike, Chang-Rae Lee and Celeste Ng, we assess the narrative construction of the suburb as a bastion of white domesticity, as well as the disruption of this narrative through struggles for racial integration.

ENG 264," FaulknerThe sustained explosion of Faulkner’s work in the dozen-odd years between The Sound and the Fury and Go Down, Moses has no parallel in American literature. He explored the microtones of consciousness and conducted the most radical of experiments in narrative form. At the same time he relied more heavily on the spoken vernacular than anyone since Mark Twain, and he made his “little postage stamp of native soil” in northern Mississippi stand for the world itself. We read the great novels of his Yoknapatawpha cycle along with a selection of short stories, examining the linked and always problematic issues of race, region and remembrance in terms of the forms that he invented to deal with them. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
ENG 267," Asian American LiteratureAlthough we sometimes think only of modern-day authors like Amy Tan or Jhumpa Lahiri when we think of Asian American literature, in fact Asian Americans have been writing and publishing in English since at least 1887. In this course, we read selected Asian American poetry, novels, short stories, plays and films produced from the late 19th century until the present. We consider how works engage with issues that have always concerned Asian Americans, like identity development and racism. Also, we pay attention to how works speak to concerns specific to their period, such as the exclusion acts of the 1880s, the proletarian movement of the 1930s, the decolonization of South Asian and Southeast Asian countries since the 1940s, and the increasing size and diversity of the Asian American population in the late 20th century.

ENG 273," Bloomsbury and SexualityMembers of the Bloomsbury movement led non-normative (what many now call queer) lives. The complexity and openness of their relationships characterized not only the lives but also the major works of fiction, art, design, and critical writings its members produced. “Sex permeated our conversation,” Woolf recalls, and in Bloomsbury and Sexuality we’ll explore the far-reaching consequences of this ostensible removal of discursive, social, and sexual inhibition in the spheres of literature, art, and social sciences. The course will draw from the art of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, the writings of E. M.

ENG 274," The Pleasures of Not Thinking: Romanticism and the IrrationalRomantic writers were obsessed with uncertainty, ignorance, and the irrational, unthinking mind. Concerned with the unusual ideas that surface when we are sleeping or spaced out, absorbed or intoxicated, Romanticism embraced reason’s alternatives: forgetting, fragmentation, stupidity, and spontaneous, uncontrollable emotion. From Wordsworth’s suggestion that children are wiser than adults to Keats’s claim that great writers are capable of remaining uncertain without reaching for fact or reason, Romantic poets and novelists suggested that we have something to learn from not thinking. We will read texts by Austen, Blake, Burke, Coleridge, Cowper, De Quincey, Freud, Kant, Keats, Locke, and Rousseau. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
ENG 275," Witches, Witchcraft and Witch HuntsThis course has two central ambitions. First, it introduces themes of magic and witchcraft in (mostly) American literature and film. We work together to figure out how the figure of the witch functions in stories, novels and movies, what witches and witchcraft mean or how they participate in the texts’ ways of making meaning. At the same time, we try to figure out how witches and witchcraft function as loci or displacements of social anxiety—about power, science, gender, class, race and politics. Since the identification of witches and the fear of witchcraft often lead to witch panics, we finally examine the historical and cultural phenomenon of the witch hunt, including both the persecution of persons literally marked as witches and the analogous persecution of persons (Communists, sexual outsiders, etc.) figuratively “hunted” as witches have been. Open to students at all levels, regardless of major. (E) {L} Credits: 4Michael T. ThurstonNormally offered in alternate years"
ENG 277," Postcolonial Women WritersA comparative study of 20th-century women writers in English from Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia and Australia. We read novels, short stories, poetry, plays and autobiography in their historical, cultural and political contexts as well as theoretical essays to address questions such as: How have women writers addressed the dual challenge of contesting sexism and patriarchy from within their indigenous cultures as well as the legacies of western imperialism from without? How have they combined feminism with anti-colonialism? How have they deployed the act of writing as cultural work on multiple counts: addressing multiple audiences; challenging different stereotypes about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity? What new stories have they told to counter older stories, what silences have they broken? How have they renegotiated the public and the private, or called attention to areas often ignored by their male contemporaries, such as relations among women, familial dynamics, motherhood, bodily desire, or the gendered effects of migration and diaspora? Writers include Anita Desai, Kamala Das, Thrity Umrigar, Deepa Mehta, Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head, Nawal el Saadawi, Jamaica Kincaid, Michelle Cliff, Zadie Smith, Sally Morgan. Prerequisite: a WI course. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"
ENG 285," Introduction to Contemporary Literary TheoryWhat do we do when we read literature? Does the meaning of a text depend on the author’s intention or on how readers read? What counts as a valid interpretation? Who decides? How do some texts get canonized and others forgotten? How does literature function in culture and society? How do changing understandings of language, the unconscious, class, gender, race, history, sexuality or disability affect how we read? “Theory” is “thinking about thinking,” questioning common sense, critically examining the categories we use to approach literature or any discursive text. This course introduces some of the most influential questions that have shaped contemporary literary studies. We start with New Criticism but focus on interdisciplinary approaches such as structuralism, poststructuralism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, New Historicism, postcolonialism, feminism, queer, cultural, race and disability studies with some attention to film and film theory. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate work. {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"

Enrollment limited to 12.Fiction Through PhotographyThis course uses concepts and methods of photography to advance students' fiction-writing abilities and comprehension. Students take photographs as a way of grappling with issues of focus, framing, depth of field, point of view, "flatness," timing, and other precepts of photography that are transferable to writing, and include their photographs in their fictional pieces. The point of the course is not to improve students' photo abilities (and no pre-req skills or special equipment are required), but to use photography to enhance writing skills and understanding. Final product is a publishable short story. {A} {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate yearsFactual FictionEven the most imaginative fiction is grounded in a tangible world, and writing it well requires skilled observation as well as expression.  is a creative-writing course that will advance students' fiction-writing abilities by refining techniques of observation.

ENG 310," Studies in Early Modern Literature and CultureTopics course by the visiting Kennedy ProfessorRenaissance Color Across MediaSince Newton's experiment with prisms in 1666, color has been considered a matter of physics (light rays at frequencies between 700 and 420 nanometers) and physiology (stimulation of rods and cones in the retina). During the two centuries preceding Newton, however, such assumptions were challenged by chromaticism in musical lines, coloratura singing, and the deployment of rhetorical colors in verbal texts. This seminar will study cross-media examples of color in verbal fictions, paintings, dramatic performances, and music. Participants contribute one 1000-word response paper, accompanied by five questions for class discussion, and a final 3500-word paper pursuing one theme or concern across at least two media.

ENG 318," Blackness and the Long PoemAmid the political and cultural discourses of racial struggle, justice, and equality during the twentieth century, poets of the African diaspora turned frequently to the epic tradition and the genre of the long poem as a means of exploring and expressing complex Black histories and identities. This seminar surveys the emerging tradition of the long poem of Blackness from Aime Cesaire to Harryette Mullen, situating individual poetic projects in the specific cultural conjunctures that provoked them and theorizing the peculiar values of the long poem for these poets' moments and purposes. Prerequisite: "
ENG 327," Robin Hood: Legendary OutlawIn this seminar, we trace the evolution of the legend of the greenwood outlaw with his merry men and (later) his intrepid ladylove, through medieval popular tale, ballad, drama, lyric, novel, and film—from first mention in the late Middle Ages to recent works and current events. Everyone knows the social bandit who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, hated by the authorities and loved by the people, but few have read the early formative texts that first inspired this unceasingly popular legend. We also explore and add to the rich legacy of Robin Hood criticism. Permission of the instructor required.

ENG 361," Poetry of WarThis course studies a range of poetic representations of war. After reviewing some of the writings of Homer, Virgil and Shakespeare that were most influential for British poets of the 19th and 20th centuries, the course moves from Tennyson, Hardy and Kipling to the poets of the first and second world wars (Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and others). We situate the poetry with relevant historical and theoretical materials, as well as prose responses to war by authors such as Vera Brittain and Virginia Woolf. We end by reading poets who did not see combat (W.B. Yeats, W. H. Auden, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath) but whose work is nevertheless profoundly concerned with the complex relation of the martial to the lyrical, the destructive to the creative.

ENG 387," Seminar: Asian American AutobiographyAnti-MemoirLike many ethnic American groups, Asian Americans first entered the U.S. publishing marketplace by offering works in the genre of autoethnography, or self-culture-writing.While many writers have valued this genre as a gateway, others have viewed it as a prison. While some see it as an opportunity to express themselves, others feel constrained by mainstream expectations. Hence, a few Asian American writers have played with the genre, sometimes in radical ways, in order to do new kinds of aesthetic and cultural work. Memoirs and anti-memoirs for consideration include those by Maxine Hong Kingston, Agha Sha-hid Ali, Paisley Rekdal, Amanda Ngoho Reavey, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Thi Bui, Bao Phi, and Lynda Barry.

Millington, Helen and Laura Shedd Professor of English Languages and Literature, DirectorFirst-Year Seminars are interdisciplinary courses that enable faculty and first-year students to engage in extensive inquiry about an issue, topic or problem. First-Year Seminars are writing intensive and focused on the seminar-style of investigation; they are not survey courses or introductions to a specific disci-pline. They afford the faculty and students an opportunity to explore a subject broadly and intensively.First-Year Seminars are voluntary, but we encourage students to enroll in them since they aim to give new students a unique introduction to college-level learning. First-Year Seminars are small (normally 16 students) and are restricted to first-year students. They incorporate the development of intellectual capacities that form the foundation of a successful liberal arts education. In addition to focusing on writing, the seminars help students develop some or all of the following skills: critical thinking, speaking, research and working inde-pendently and collaboratively. First-Year Seminars are also effective in showing students how to integrate student support services into their academic pursuits. ScreenwritingIntermediate and advanced script projects.

ENV 101,"  Environmental Integration I: PerspectivesENV/  Sustainability and Social-Ecological Systems Sustainability and Social-Ecological SystemsWe have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, characterized by the accelerating impact of human activities on the Earth’s ecosystems. All over the globe, humans have transformed the environment and have sometimes created catastrophic dynamics within social-ecological systems. Scientists have studied these phenomena for decades, alerting both the general public and policy-makers of the consequences of our actions. However, despite convincing evidence of environmental degradation, humans continue to radically transform their environment. This course explores this puzzle and asks how we can remodel our social-ecological systems to build a more sustainable and resilient future.

David Smith, Camille Washington-Ottombre and Gregory WhiteThe environmental science and policy (ES&P) major is designed for students with interests in the environment and sustainability and a commitment to scientifically-based problem solving and policy analysis. The objectives of the major are to prepare students to transcend disciplinary boundaries, combine analytical and communication skills with a well-rounded understanding of the environment, and translate this knowledge into meaningful action and innova-tive solutions. Four integration courses form the intellectual and organizational core of the major. Each course brings together frameworks, proficiencies and knowledge from natural and social sciences in an explicitly integrative fashion to explore and analyze important environmental topics at local, regional, na-tional and global levels. Additional introductory courses provide breadth in the natural and social sciences, humanities, and statistics, and introduce students to fundamental aspects of disciplines important to understanding human-envi-ronment interactions. Students gain depth of knowledge by choosing a coherent sequence of electives with a clear environmental focus. Students are strongly encouraged to engage in environmentally oriented internships, independent research or study-away opportunities. Prospective majors should consult with an ES&P faculty adviser in choosing their courses. In their first semesters, students are encouraged to enroll in one of the introductory courses (see list) and an appropriate integration course (101), as well as statistics.Requirements: The ES&P major requires 14 courses. These include the following:• Four environmental integration courses (101, 201/202, 311, 312)• Three introductory courses in the natural sciences from different areas (BIO, CHM, GEO, PHY/EGR), two of which must include labs (see list)• Two introductory courses in the category of social sciences, humanities and policy from different departments (see list)• One course in statistics (see list)• Four electives that create a coherent sequence with a clear environmental fo-cus.

FMS 250," Global Cinema after WWII satisfies this requirement. Other courses in the Five Colleges may as well; confer with your adviser.3.  Global Cinema After World War IIThe post-war period was a time of increasing globalization, which brought about a more interconnected and international film culture. But it was also a time during which certain key national cinemas defined, or redefined, themselves. This course examines both trends, as well as focuses on the work and influence of significant directors and landmark films, emphasizing not only cinematic and cultural specificity, but also cross-cultural, and transhistorical concerns. What makes a film Italian or Brazilian or British? How does national identity help shape any country’s cinema, and how do films help shape national identity? How do films circulate through other cultures and what kinds of conversations do films from one nation or culture have with others? How and when is the idea of nation a counterproductive way to think about cinema? How do ideas of history and self inform cinema, and vice versa? How do we need to adjust our own spectatorship as we engage with films from other places and times? We examine films, filmmakers, and film movements including: Italian Neo-realism, French New Wave, New German Cinema, Brazilian Cinema Novo, Chinese Fifth Generation, Hong Kong Action Cinema, and the films of Ousmane Sembene, Thomas Gutierrez Aléa, Satyajit Ray, Akira Kurosawa, Julie Dash and Spike Lee.

In other words, what are the broad approaches scholars have taken to the study of media, and what specific methodological strategies have proved most effective? We begin with theory as one such method—one that zooms out to ask broad questions about the essential nature of a medium.

Introduction to Film and Media Studies is the prerequisite for any production course and for Theories and Methods of Film and Media Studies.One course must centrally address alternatives to commercial media (e.g., docu-mentary or experimental/avant-garde work). Only one component course may count for the major.  (A core course is one in which the moving image is the primary object of study; a component course is one in which the moving image figures significantly but is not the central focus of the course). The FocusThe three-course focus allows Film and Media Studies majors to concentrate in a particular area, as designed by the major in consultation with the adviser. Normally the focus should be chosen by the second semester of junior year. At least one course in the focus must be at the advanced level. Focus areas include, but are not limited to: • Theories of film and/or other media• Production• National/transnational cinemas and/or other media industries• Intersectionality (emphasizing some meaningful conceptual combination of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, ability, age, and more)• Moving image audiences and cultures• Comparative genres• Avant-garde/experimental• Documentary/non-fiction• Media histories• Media industry studies The MinorThe Film and Media Studies Program provides the opportunity for in-depth study of the history, theory and criticism of film and other forms of the moving image. Our goal is to expose students to a range of cinematic works, styles and movements and to help them understand the medium’s significance as an art form, as a technology, as a means of cultural and political expression, and as symptomatic of social ideologies.Requirements: Six semester courses to be taken at Smith or, by permission of the director, elsewhere among the Five College institutions.Required courses: Introduction to Video ProductionThis course will provide a foundation in the principles, techniques, and equipment involved in making short videos, including: development of a viable story idea or concept, aesthetics and mechanics of shooting video, the role of sound and successful audio recording, and the conceptual and technical underpinnings of digital editing.

FMS 243,"  After the End of the World: Transnational/Transmedia Studies in Science FictionPerhaps no genre has addressed the prospect of the world’s end more fully than science fiction. In many science fiction narratives, the end of the world spells disaster. A future is imagined in which sinister forces threaten the continuation of life as we know it. In other narratives, leaving the world behind may represent a kind of liberation: from the tedium of everyday life, or from oppressive contemporary social and political systems. This course presents a series of investigations focused on compelling moments, themes and expressions within the wider universe of science fiction. Each case study enables us to imagine the world’s end from a different perspective. Each also demands that we carry out our investigation across and between various forms of media. {A} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
FMS 244," Global Media: The Musical!This course examines the film musical as a global genre traversing a range of media, not only including film but also theater, television, social media and recorded music. Since the advent of synchronous sound film, the musical has become one of the global film industry’s most enduring and profitable genres. What has made the musical so successful the world over? Though much critical and scholarly attention has been paid to the Hollywood studio-era musicals of the 1930s–’50s, the scope of our investigation is global and our focus is on more recent iterations of the genre. {A} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
FMS 246," The Western and American Identity after World War IIThis class examines the relation of perhaps the defining American film genre to questions of both American cinema and American identity. How are Westerns reflective and symptomatic of vital issues in United States history and culture? How does the genre help shape and define how Americans think of themselves? How did the genre change over the post-war period, and what does this tell us about the changing needs, ideas, and ideologies of both American filmmaking and the United States itself? We consider the classical films of John Ford and the revisionist work of Sam Peckinpah and Robert Altman, as well as other canonical Westerns, considering the way they were used to think through historical and cultural events like the Red Scare, Civil Rights and the development of a more robust Queer Public Sphere. We also consider more recent developments and changes in the genre as produced by Reagan’s tenure as the Cowboy President (including US foreign policy in Latin America) and, currently, shifts in the genre affected by digital technology and the Age of New Media. {A} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
FMS 247," American Film and Culture from the Depression to the SixtiesThis course explores the relationship between film and culture during some of the most crucial decades of "The American Century." It looks at the evolving connection between films and their audiences, the extent to which films are Film and Media Studies 221symptomatic of as well as influential on historical periods, major events and social movements, and the ways in which film genres evolve in relation to both cultural change and the rise and fall of the Hollywood studio system. Among the questions we'll consider: How did the Depression have an impact on Hollywood film style and form? How were evolving ideas about American motherhood puzzled out in American cinema of the period? What were some of the important differences between the way mainstream U.S. cinema and European film represented World War II? How did Civil Rights and the Red Scare become appropriate topics for Westerns? Did the lighthearted veneer of the fluffy sex comedies of the sixties actually hide some serious questions about labor, independent female subjectivity and heteronormativity? Particular and sustained attention will be paid to relations among gender, genre, race and class. {A} {L} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
FMS 248," Women and American Cinema: Representation, Spectatorship, AuthorshipA survey of women in American films from the silent period to the present, examining: 1) how women are represented on film, and how those images relate to actual contemporaneous American society, culture, and politics; 2) how theoretical formulations, expectations, and realities of female spectatorship relate to genre, the star and studio systems (and other production and distribution modes), dominant and alternative codes of narration, and developments in digital and new media modes; and 3) how women as stars, writers, producers, and directors shape and respond to, work within and against, dominant considerations of how women look (in every sense). {A} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
FMS 249," Queer Cinema/Queer MediaFrom the queer avant-garde of Kenneth Anger and Su Friedrich, to The Kids Are All Right and Glee, the queer in film and television is often conflated with gay and lesbian representation on screen. Instead of collapsing queer cinema into a representational politics of gay and lesbian film and television, we look at theories and practices that uphold what queerness means in a contemporary framework of America neoliberalism and transnational media. Screenings include the New Queer Cinema classics Paris Is Burning, It Wasn't Love and Poison, and work by multimedia artists including Shu Lea Cheang, Issac Julien, Carmelita Tropicana and PJ Raval. Readings by Alexander Doty, Thomas Elsaesser, Kobena Mercer, Jasbir Puar, B. Ruby Rich, J. Halberstam, Jose E.

FMS 260," Digital Media and Participatory CultureAmong the claims made for the newness of new media is the assertion that new media are interactive, turning the passive consumers of “old” media into active, engaged participants. This course explores the shape of this technologically-enabled “participatory culture” and will also investigate cracks in the foundation of the alleged digital utopia. To what extent are new technologies democratizing and to what extent do they offer new forms of surveillance and control to the powers that be? What social and economic factors govern “convergence culture?” How have fan cultures evolved as their material networks of conventions and zines go digital? {A} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
FMS 261," Video Games and the Politics of PlayAn estimated 63% of U.S. households have members who play video games regularly, and game sales routinely exceed film box office figures. As this medium grows in cultural power, it is increasingly important to think about how games make meaning. This course serves as an introduction to Game Studies, equipping students with the vocabulary to analyze video games, surveying the medium’s genres, and sampling this scholarly discipline’s most influential theoretical writing. The particular focus, though, is on the ideology operating beneath the surface of these popular entertainment objects and on the ways in which video games enter political discourse.

FMS 265," Film in the Digital AgeFilm, a dominant entertainment form in the twentieth century, faces sweeping changes in the twenty-first. Digital technologies are widely replacing film cameras and projectors, theatrical exhibition continues to decline as audiences watch movies on smaller and smaller screens, and the list of other entertainment forms competing for the public’s attention grows longer each year. Appropriating Peter Greenaway’s provocation, “Cinema is dead, long live cinema,” this course will consider the challenge digital media present to film’s primacy, but also the ways in which film has survived and thrived during this and previous periods of dramatic technological change. Prerequisite: "
FMS 270,"  Making KnowledgeThis colloquium examines the life cycle of knowledge  making: studying what it means to produce knowledge, how one decides how (and with whom) to share one’s knowledge, and the implications of having the privilege to engage in such projects. We study a range of questions: Who desires knowledge, and why? When do data and information become knowledge? How does knowledge become wisdom? Students work collaboratively and independently on public scholarship projects, develop expertise in digital critique and seminar  style discussion, and present work to a range of different publics.

FMS 285," ScreenwritingThis class explores modes of screenwriting that give weight to cinematic elements usually ignored by orthodox screenplay form. We treat the pictorial and audio-visual as content rather than mere style, and we explore ways to write the visual in addition to dialogue. Throughout the class, the emphasis for student writing is on personal content and human-scaled stories rather than historical film genres. Weekly writing exercises includes both original content and scenes for established characters in finished films or TV shows. There are also specific technical exercises built on structural film elements like time-lapse, etc. A first workshop in narrative screenwriting. Weekly short writing assignments and in-class workshops of student scenes. Longer final project. Prerequisite: "
FMS 345,"  Violence, Mortality and the Moving ImageIf cinema is, as André Bazin writes, “change mummified,” violence and death are among the most dramatic physical changes it can “mummify.” This course studies the long, complex relationship between cinema and these bodily spectacles. How has censorship impacted the way violence has been screened? How can cameras make the internal processes of death externally visible? What are the ethics of filming “real” violence and death in a documentary mode? How are cultural attitudes toward violence and death reflected in and shaped by films? As a cautionary note, this course necessarily includes graphic representations of violence and death. Prerequisites: "

A student who wants to create a bridge between two majors, one of which is in a foreign language and culture and the other in a dif-ferent discipline, will also find the concentration to be an important supplement to her curriculum. Student concentrators may not only be drawn to the literary side of translation; they may also seek to link their knowledge in the social sci-ences or sciences to their practice of a foreign language, translating governmen-tal or legal documents, working with immigrant or refugee communities who need the help of a translator or interpreter, or translating scientific papers.The translation studies concentration encourages study in a broad range of scholarly disciplines, including courses in the various departments of foreign languages and cultures, comparative literature, classics, film studies, American studies and English. The Poetry Center, the Five College Center for East Asian Studies, and the Five College journal Metamorphoses: A Journal of Literary Translation provide opportunities for guest translators as well as for student in-ternships. Other resources include the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages (www.fivecolleges.edu/fclang) and the UMass Translation Center (www.umasstranslation.com).The requirements for the concentration are deliberately flexible to allow students to pursue the translation practice that most suits their interests or needs—from literary to technical translation to the ethical complexities that arise in interpretation.Courses"

Yet, despite such labels and accolades she was a deeply independent individual who was not comfortable with the strictures of her fame. Although a graphic artist and sculptor, she was also a free-thinker who drew inspiration and insight from German and European culture. She was active in social and political causes of her time and wanted her art to effect real change in German society. This seminar will trace her evolution as an artist and as a witness to the tumultuous times in which she lived. Conducted in German. Prerequisite: "

Normally offered each fall.Recent Latin American Films: Bridging the Public and the PrivateThis course looks at recent Latin American films dealing with subjects that blur the boundaries between the public and the private spheres. We will make refer-ence in particular to films that portray experiences of loss, dealing with topics such as grief, memory and recovery. The class will study films dealing with both public and private loss, reflecting on the differences and similarities between the two. Films looking at losses that resulted from events that affected the whole nation turn their attention to those events. By contrast, films dealing with in-dividual loss tend to privilege the characters’ emotions. In both cases the focus on loss allows for reflections on identity, memory, and the future—reflections that blur the apparent boundary between the private and the public. Focusing mainly on films from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, students will reflect on the wider social significance of these films in reference to the context where they were made.

Members of this seminar explore these questions by focusing on local museums and exhibitions. From a behind-the-scenes look at the Smith College Museum of Art to an examination of hidden gems like the botanical sciences herbarium collection or that cabinet of curiosities which is Mount Holyoke’s Skinner Museum, we research the histories of these collections and analyze the rationale of varying systems for ordering objects. By learning the critical skills of visual analysis and by grappling with the interpretations of art historians, anthropologists and psychologists, we attempt to come to an understanding of how knowledge is constructed in the context of display and how visual juxtapositions can generate meaning.

The debate about the moral and political uses and misuses of theater animated the public, the philosophes and their critics, as well as the state, from the mid-17th century until the Révolution, and on to today. We will study the way authors, critics and the theater itself responded to the debate, from the classical drama of Racine and Molière, to the street theater of the Paris fairs and the influence of the Comédie italienne, from the new genres of the drame bourgeois to the liberation of the theater during the Revolution, and in the 20th and 21st centuries from the uses of theatre to resist the German occupation during WWII to the recent debate about the censoring of a new staging of Voltaire's Le Fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète, and the contemporary theatre of Ariane Mnouchkine which aims to raise the political consciousness of an audience to the crisis of global migration today.

Characterized by self-help construction methods and inadequate access to public services, these communities grew out of protest and have etched themselves into the permanent landscape and fabric of Brazil. Intrinsically, the culture of slavery, which was successfully maintained through terror and spectacular punishment, continues to inform the favelas today as many actors including local lead-ers, politicians, the Church, drug traffickers, militias, NGOs, residents, and the police have tried to govern these sprawling communities with varying degrees of success. Through articles, books, films and guest lecturers, this course will introduce the rich history of favelas and describe how the distinct spectacle of violence, commodification and speculation is deeply embedded in the (re)pro-duction of favelas in Brazil.

GOV 268," Utopian/Dystopian Visions and Political TheoryThomas More penned his novel Utopia in 1516, and in  1868 John Stuart Mill coined 'dystopia' as the antithesis of More's idyllic vision. But the word utopia literally translates as "nowhere land." This course will explore the question how the exploration of "what could be" has been and remains a central focus in the work of much of political theory. Serving as both an exemplar and a warning of planned political societies, utopian and dystopian literature is always engaged in the work of making, unmaking, and remaking the possibilities for the original political question, "How should we govern?"

GOV 366," Seminar in Political TheoryTopics course.The Politics of Heterosexuality This course explores the social and political construction of heterosexuality; it’s interaction with race, class and gender; and the queer resistances to heteronor-mativity that have formed to oppose it. Examining heterosexuality as a form of social and political privilege, we explore the ways in which it acts as a coercive yet successful cultural norm, often disappearing as a category of investigation altogether. Attention is paid to rendering visible the historical, political, economic and social forces that have contributed to the construction and maintenance of a coerced and coercive heterosexuality, while simultaneously exploring the unique-ness produced through the intersections of heterosexuality with race, class and gender. These intersections reveal the many ways that heteronormativity has been deployed as a form of political organization of the body politic, even as it pro-duces multiple locations of resistance for politicized bodies. {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsThe Political Theory of Michel FoucaultThis course examines the work of Michel Foucault (1926–84), French philoso-pher, social critic, historian and activist, and generally acknowledged as one of the most influential of the thinkers whose work is categorized as poststructural-ist. Foucault’s various inquiries into the production of knowledge and power have formed the paradoxically destabilizing foundation for much of the work on the status of the human subject in post-modernity. We explore the theoretically rich and dense approaches undertaken by Foucault, as well as illuminating his central ideas that seem to challenge much of what political theory accepts as a given. From The Birth of the Clinic, The Order of Things and Discipline and Punish to his later works including The History of Sexuality, The Use of Plea-sure, and The Care of the Self, attention is given to how his works simultane-ously advance and critique much of the canon of political theory.

LSS 230," Urban LandscapesStudents in this course investigate the production of the built environment and the landscape of cities, focusing on key actors such as neighborhood activists, real estate developers, city officials, and environmentalists, among other advocates and interested parties. Organized thematically and supplemented by readings in urban theory and related fields, the course tackles questions of how urban places are made, why different cities look and feel the way they do, and who shapes the city. Prerequisites:  Urban LandscapesSociology"
LSS 240," Cultural Landscapes and Historic PreservationDebates over the meaning, interpretation and management of unique, artistic, historic and/or culturally significant places take center stage in this course. Students consider how and why some landscapes and buildings get preserved and protected while others are redesigned, ignored, neglected or demolished. Major themes in the course include continuity and change in the built environment, notions of cultural heritage and the concept of authenticity. Readings include theoretical and historical perspectives on the topic supplemented by case studies 278 Landscape Studiesand field investigations. Prerequisites: "
LSS 245," Place Frames: Photography As Research Method In Landscape StudiesPhotography and landscape are intertwined. Scholars, design professionals, artists, and journalists use photographs as evidence, as a means of representing sites, as a design tool, as source material for project renderings, and as a device for documentation and record keeping. This course focuses on how photography is a part of field observations and research techniques, how photographs are used in landscape studies, and how text and image are combined in different photographic and scholarly genres. Students will take their own photographs and examine the works of photographers, including landscape architects, urbanists, artists, and journalists. The course will include field exercises in combination with workshops, discussions, and research at the Smith College Museum of Art. Major themes include cultural landscapes, topography and land forms, transportation, sense of place, aerial and satellite photography, suburbia, patterns on the land, abandonment and decay, and the image of the city.

Areas of concentration may focus on the religion, history, politics, cultures (literature, film, music, art), or may explore an interdisciplinary topic such as gender in the Middle East, ethno-religious diversity of the region, etc. Students design a concentration in consultation with an adviser. (16 credits) 4.  ElectivesFour elective courses, of which at least three must be in areas other than the student’s concentration. Advanced study of a Middle Eastern language may count towards the elective courses (16 credits). Additional Guidelines: 1. All courses taken for major credit shall be drawn from courses listed or cross-listed by the Program in Middle Eastern Studies. Any First-Year Seminar cross-listed in MES may count towards the major.2. Students will take at least one course with a primary focus on the Middle East beyond the Arab world (Iran, Israel, Turkey) in the fulfillment of major requirements.3. Courses in the major may not be taken S/U.4. Capstone: Majors must take one 300-level seminar or research based  special studies course in their field of concentration. When  functions as the capstone for the major it must be a research intensive course approved as the capstone by the major adviser.5. No more than four courses in the major may be applied toward a double major.6. Language study beyond the requirements of the major in Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, or Turkish at Smith or within the Five Colleges is strongly encouraged. Students may apply to the Middle East Studies Committee for funding of summer language study (e, g., Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, Turkish).  In addition, courses in Arabic dialects offered by any of the Five Colleges or by the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages may be applied toward the major, with approval of the student’s adviser. If a course offered by the FCCSWL is worth less than 4 credits, students will be expected to make up the credit shortfall through supplemental language instruction. Participation in study abroad programs offering intensive language instruction may count toward the MES major language requirement, on approval of the student’s adviser.7. Students proficient in Modern Standard Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi or Turkish may take a placement exam in lieu of coursework. Students who place out of the MES major language requirement are expected to make up 8 credits of coursework through electives or the study of a second, approved regional language. 8. Normally, at least half of a student’s courses towards the major shall be tak-en at Smith. Students who study abroad may petition the Program in Middle East Studies should they seek credit toward the major of non-Smith courses that exceed half of those required by the major.Study AbroadThe Program in Middle East studies encourages students to explore study abroad opportunities which allow them to deepen their understanding of Middle Eastern languages, history and cultures.

A list of recommend-ed summer language programs is available on the MES program website.Two Tracks for Students Interested in the MinorMinor in Middle East Studies and Minor in ArabicMinor in Middle East StudiesThe Middle East studies minor at Smith provides students with the opportunity to complement a major with a concentration of courses that treat the region in its historical, political, social and cultural complexity. The minor provides the opportunity to study the region in an interdisciplinary fashion, with attention to key fields of knowledge. 296 Middle East StudiesRequirements:  Six semester courses are required. Language (1 course)Completion of at least one year of college-level Arabic or modern Hebrew. Only the second semester of the beginner’s language sequence counts as one of the six courses required for the minor, though students earn course credit towards overall Smith degree requirements for the full year. Additional language study of Arabic and Hebrew at the intermediate and advanced levels at Smith or within the Five College consortium is strongly encouraged. Students may petition the MES Committee to substitute the minimum requirement of a year of Arabic or Hebrew with the study of another Middle Eastern language (Farsi, Turkish, etc).Breadth Requirements (2 courses)1. A course on classical Islam or pre-modern (prior to 1800) Middle Eastern history, broadly defined. (Courses do not necessarily have to be offerings from the history department, but must be historically oriented.)  2. A course on modern history, contemporary politics/economics/cultures/soci-ology/anthropology or modern/contemporary Islamic thought.Electives (3 courses)In consultation with their adviser, students may choose additional electives in religion, literature, arts and/or history and the social sciences.

And normally no more than three courses can be taken away from Smith.Minor in ArabicThe minor in Arabic is designed for students wishing to achieve proficiency in modern Arabic. Requirements: Six semester courses (4 credits each) in Arabic. Students may count only the second semester of Elementary Arabic as one of the six courses to be counted towards fulfillment of the minor.Students must complete the equivalent of a full year of both Intermediate Arabic and Advanced Arabic.Capstone course: At least one course, offered in Arabic, should be a non-language course which focuses on a topic or issue. Such courses, which may consist of a special studies, might include Media Arabic, Arabic literature, Arabic translation, Arabic linguistics (syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analy-sis), aspects of Arabic culture, film, religions or philosophy.Special studies in Arabic may count for as many as two of the six courses, so long as the special studies is worth 4 credits.Courses in Arabic dialects offered by any of the Five Colleges or by the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages count toward the minor.

Writers at the intermediate level are characterized by the ability to meet practical writing needs, such as simple messages and letters, requests for information, and notes. In addition, they can ask and respond to simple questions in writing. At the intermediate level, listeners can understand information conveyed in simple, sentence-length speech on familiar or everyday topics while readers at the same level can understand information conveyed in simple, predictable, loosely connected texts. Readers rely heavily on contextual clues. They can most easily understand information if the format of the text is familiar, such as in a weather report or a social announcement. Speakers at the intermediate level are distinguished primarily by their ability to create with the language when talking about familiar topics related to their daily life. They are able to recombine learned material in order to express personal meaning. Students should expect text assignments as well as work with DVDs, audio materials and websites. Exercises include writing, social interactions, role plays, and the interplay of language and culture. Prerequisite is .

The course may cover other styles such as: blackface minstrelsy, Tin Pan Alley, folk, jazz, classical or varieties of Latino music. Throughout, we attend to musical aspects of these styles, and connect them to larger historical themes and social issues concerning race, class, gender and the making of “American” identity through music.

Why is music a fundamental means of connecting with our own lives, our communities and the wider world in which we live? Through in-depth reading and in-class discussion, we study the institutions of music (concerts, recording studios) and the varied practices of music making (classical, popular; amateur, professional) in order to construct a picture of the musical worlds around us and to understand what they tell us about the societies in which we live. {A} {S} Credits: 4Margaret SarkissianNormally offered each spring308 Music"

We will study music written to commemorate victims of war, state violence, and illness, from requiems to 9/11 memorial works. We will also consider how composers, performers, and listeners have participated in monumentalizing historical or political occasions, from composer anniversary celebrations to national anthems. {A} {H} Credits: 4Andrea MooreExpected to be offered in the next 3 years"
MUS 205," Topics in Popular MusicTopics course.Improvising History: The Development of JazzThe course combines exploration of jazz music with examination of topics in the social and cultural history of jazz. Musically, the development of jazz is traced from the early styles that took root in New Orleans and Chicago to the challenging "free jazz" sounds of the 1960s and the 1970s, and into the current "postmodern" moment of jazz history. Historically, the course considers such issues as the key importance of race to the social development of jazz, the shift-ing status of jazz as "popular" or "art" music, and the nature and significance of improvisation as a medium of creative expression in 20th century American culture. Some previous knowledge of African American music and history or permission of the instructor required.

In this course, we explore metal and punk as interrelated musical responses to the "crisis" that beset post-1960's rock, and use the two genres as a lens for examin-ing the nature and definition of popular music genres, the status of rock music as commodity, the politics of "noise," and the shifting qualities of the rock audience from the 1970s to the present.

MUS 231," From Goat Songs To Flash Mobs: Music and TheaterMusic and theatre are both time-based arts that involve bodies in motion in front of an audience. Though they may be considered separate disciplines, the full extent of what they share often makes them wonderfully indistinguishable. This course probes the intersections of music and theatre through a survey of genres, works, artists, and practitioners. While material covered will include clearly relevant genres such as musicals and opera, the focus will be on more difficult to categorize topics such as performance art, immersive theatre, and experimental music, in an open-minded examination of what makes this alliance so compelling.

PHI 204," Philosophy and DesignDesign is one of the most pervasive human activities. Its effects—intended or unintended—permeate our lives. Questions abound about the role of design and the significance of being able to exercise it and of being subject to it. For example: Are there particular pleasures, as well as special responsibilities, characteristic of designing? What is the nature of deprivation imposed upon people when they lack the opportunity or the knowledge to share in the design of their living or working conditions? How much control do designers actually have over the meaning and use of what they design? {S} Credits: 4Elizabeth V. SpelmanNormally offered in alternate years"

PHI 234," Philosophy and Human Nature: Theories of the SelfTopics course.DesireFor many philosophical and religious thinkers, desire has been a source of some anxiety: depicted as being by their very nature powerful and insatiable, desires appear to weaken people’s capacities to control themselves and at the same time to open up opportunities for other people to control them. Focusing especially on the importance of desire to a consumer society, we examine questions such as: Is it possible to make a clear distinction between need and desire? To what extent are desires plastic, pliable, amenable to reshaping? Are we in any sense responsible for our desires? {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"

Humor can be a forceful in-strument, often deployed by the powerful in their attempts to control the power-less and by the powerless to topple the powerful. Humor tends to operate in such a way as to include some and exclude others. Its effects, intended or unintended, can be benign or hurtful. Closely examining texts from a variety of philosophi-cal perspectives, we will explore questions such as: What have been the hopes for, and worries about, what humor achieves? Who has taken it upon themselves to offer instructions about the proper objects of and occasions for humor and laughter? What reasons have they given for doing so? Recommended prepara-tion: at least one course in philosophy. Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered each academic yearRace in Contemporary PhilosophyThis course will survey discussions of race in contemporary philosophy.  We will examine issues such as whether races exist (Anthony Appiah), the status of mixed race people (Naomi Zackj), mixed race families (Sally Hasinger), race as a social construction (Ron Mallon), and racial realism (Joshua Glasgow).  We will also look at treatments of race by philosophers in Brazil, South Africa, India, and Malaysia.

This course examines the notion of blasphemy—its meanings, the invisible boundaries it presupposes both in some of the world’s major religious traditions and in secular contexts, and the different ways of seeing it often signifies. Based on case studies, it explores contemporary public uses of the term, the competing understandings of the “sacred” it often assumes, and the cultural and political challenges the term presents in a globalized society. The course considers the implications of the public charge of blasphemy in light of issues such as: the religious and the secular; humor and satire; commodification and consumerism; “insiders,” “outsiders,” and cultural appropriation; art, film, and the sacred; museum conservation and display; free speech and human rights.

Pryor, Ph.D., Associate Professor of History  Director: The chair of the program committee will serve as the director of the major and the minor and will verify completion of the major and the minor on recommendation of the student’s adviser.The MajorThe Program for the Study of Women and Gender examines gender, race, class and sexuality as important and simultaneous aspects of social worlds and hu-man lives. This examination requires inquiry into the construction and opera-tion of power relations, social inequalities and resistances to injustice in both national and transnational contexts. We understand women, gender, feminism and  queer as politicized terms. As categories of analysis they help reveal how subjects become racialized, sexualized, gendered and class located.Building on its origins in women’s studies, our program continues to examine the experiences, ideologies, works and actions of women in a variety of national, cultural, historical and political contexts. As an interdisciplinary endeavor, the study of women and gender shows students how different academic disciplines view the operation of gender in the labor market, the family, political systems and cultural production. Research and theory emerge from these everyday reali-ties and, in turn, feminist theory informs our analysis of political choices and our understanding of the forms of activism around the globe.RequirementsThe major requires the completion of 10 semester courses, including at least two 300-level seminars, totaling 40 credit hours. These courses shall comprise SWG prefix courses and department-based courses chosen from a list of possibilities compiled yearly by the Program for the Study of Women and Gender. These courses must include: 1.  "
SOC 220," The Sociology of CultureDrawing upon a variety of sociological perspectives and analytical methods, this course considers the place of culture in social life and examines its socially constituted character. Culture, will be viewed along three dimensions: 1) as the customary practices of particular social groups; 2) the expression of symbolic representation in society, and 3) through the practice of artistic and creative expression. Culture activities will be considered in a range of social, historical and institutional settings and in different forms, including high and popular cultural forms, mass culture, counter culture, and cultures of opposition. The course will consider such matters as the relationship between culture and social inequality, culture and social change, the commoditization of cultural goods, the workings of global cultural markets, and the complex processes by which cultural forms may be used, appropriated and transformed by social groups.

A recurring theme throughout the course is meritocracy. We consider how merit is defined in education, factors that affect who succeeds in the educational system and whether meritocratic education is a viable goal. Course readings include current empirical research in the sociology of education and both classical and contemporary sociological theories of education. Enrollment limited to 35. Prerequisite: "

The writings of Latin American and Latina feminists will comprise the majority of the texts; thus we are limited to the work of those who write and/or publish in English. (Students who are proficient in Spanish or Portuguese will have an opportunity to read feminist materials in those languages for their written projects.) Prerequisites: "
LAS 100," or "
SOC 246," The Sociological ImaginationAccording to C.W. Mills, the "sociological imagination" allows us "to grasp history and biography and the relations between the two within society." This course will help students develop their sociological imaginations by reading memoirs written by both U.S. and international authors who’ve published in English, and asking sociological questions of the stories being told. We will move beyond appreciation for the "troubles [that] occur within the character of the individual and within the range of [their] immediate relations with others" to a recognition and analysis of social facts, geo-political issues and social problems illuminated through these individual stories. Prerequisite: "
SOC 250," Theories of SocietyThis course introduces majors to widely used theoretical perspectives that inform the sociological imagination. It focuses on how these perspectives analyze core facets of social life, such as structure and stratification, power and inequality, culture, agency, self and identity.

SOC 270," Media, Technology and SociologyThe mass media are an important social institution that reflects and shapes norms and values. But the processes governing media production and reception are often taken for granted, immersed as we are in a highly mediated social world where preconceived notions about "the media" and its effects hold sway. This class will challenge conventional wisdom about how media and communication technologies work by critically exploring the history of media institutions, assesing the media's powers of persuasion, focusing on media as an occupation, and examining the struggles over media representation by marginalized groups across traditional media and new digital platform.

We will look how politi-cal and other institutions affect gender and sexuality, and at social movements addressing gender and sexuality from both the right and the left.  We will look at movements including queer, feminist, anti-racist, anti-interventionist move-ments on the left, and racial supremacist, pro-military intervention, anti-LGBT, and conservative evangelical movements on the right.  Theoretical frameworks are drawn from social movements, intersectional feminist and queer theories.   {S} Credits: 4Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate years"

SWG 227," Feminist and Queer Disability Studies In the essay “A Burst of Light: Living with Cancer,” writer-activist Audre Lorde forges pioneering connections between the work of social justice and the environmental, gendered, and healthcare inequities that circumscribe black and brown lives. Following Lorde’s intervention, this course examines contemporary feminist/queer expressive culture, writing, and theory that centrally engages the category of dis/ability. It will familiarize students with feminist and queer scholarship that resists the medical pathologization of embodied difference; foreground dis/ability’s intersections with questions of race, class, and nation; and ask what political and social liberation might look like when able-bodiedness is no longer privileged.

SWG 250," Methodologies of Gender Studies This course introduces students to the theory and practice of research in gender, queer, and women's studies. The course begins with an introduction to key terms and debates in the field about how knowledge is produced. We focus particularly on how the power relations of gender combine with related relations of inequality/domination/oppression, such as race, class, sexuality, religion and nation. We then examine the distinguishing qualities of feminist methodologies in the social sciences, arts, humanities and sciences. The course gives particular attention to the interdisciplinary focus of feminist research and future directions of feminist methods. Prerequisite: "
SWG 290," Gender, Sexuality and Popular CultureIn this course we will consider the manner in which norms of gender and sexuality are reflected, reinforced, and challenged in popular culture. We use theories of knowledge production, representation, and meaning-making to support our analysis of the relationship between discourse and power; our engagement with these theoretical texts helps us track this dynamic as it emerges in popular culture. Key queer theoretical concepts provide a framework for examining how the production gender and sexuality impacts cultural production. Through our critical engagement with a selection of films, music, television, visual art, and digital media we will discuss mainstream conventions and the feminist, queer, and queer of color interventions that enliven the landscape of popular culture with which we contend in everyday life. Prerequisite: "
SWG 314," Documenting Queer LivesThis course examines visual and literary documentations of queer life by reading memoirs and screening short and feature length documentaries films.

SWG 318," Women Against EmpireAnti-imperialist movements across the globe in the 20th century carried with them multiple projects for the liberation and equality of people. These movements sought to build sovereign nations independent of colonial power and to develop radically new social orders. For women in these movements, the problem of empire had complex regional and local inflections that began with the politics of reproduction. This course will look at three sites of women’s involvement contesting empire: first, the struggles of anti-imperial movements, second, women in the nationalist movements after formal independence and third, women’s movements in the current age of empire that has developed alongside the stealth of economic globalization and remote-control warfare.

How have various dispossessed peoples—slaves, immigrants, women, racial and ethnic minorities, colonized populations—looked to the ideals and practices of U.S. freedom to sustain their hopes and inform their actions? How have progressive and conservative reform movements fashioned myths of freedom to support their aspirations? How have ideals of freedom shaped the various roles the United States plays in the world? How should we assess the institutional framework that underlies the implementation of freedom as a “way of life” in the United States—that is, democratic politics, representative governance, and market capitalism?
