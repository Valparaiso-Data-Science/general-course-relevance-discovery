Fontbonne University complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-380, as amended.   FERPA (THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment, is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. It applies to all schools that receive funds from the United States Department of Education. Education records are records that contain information directly related to a student and that are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. Education records do not include private notes, law enforcement records, medical and counseling records, employment records, or alumni records.  In accordance with the Family Rights and Privacy Act, certain information designated as “directory information” may be released without the prior consent of a student, unless the student has forbidden its disclosure in writing by completing a Request to Withhold Release of Directory Information form available in the office of the registrar. This form must be turned in to the registrar’s office within two (2) weeks of the start of the semester. It will stay in effect until the fall term of the next academic year. The university will assume that a student does not object to the release of directory information unless the student files this written notification.  A complete listing of directory information items is included in the FERPA policy which is posted on the Fontbonne website at: https://www.fontbonne.edu/academics/academic-resources/registrar/   Students should read the FERPA policy to know their rights and responsibilities as they pertain to their education records. Questions should be directed to the office of the registrar   GENERAL NOTICE This catalog represents information about Fontbonne University at the time of publication.

In a spirit of partnership with the family, the Fontbonne financial aid policy attempts to supplement the resources of the family whose funds do not meet the student’s educational costs.  Fontbonne financial aid awards may consist of scholarships, grants, loans, and employment.   Financial aid will attempt to meet demonstrated need up to budgeted tuition and fees for commuting students and up to budgeted tuition, fees, room, and board for resident students.  Filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) determines the family’s expected contribution (EFC) toward meeting the student’s costs of education. The EFC is then subtracted from the student’s budgeted cost at Fontbonne University. The difference between the total budgeted cost and the EFC determines the student’s need for financial assistance.     Total budgeted cost of attending Fontbonne – Expected Family Contribution (EFC)             =  Financial need  Current regulations do not permit unclassified (non-degree seeking) students to receive any type of federal aid. While most programs are limited to full-time students, undergraduate students with less than full-time enrollment may qualify for aid through the Pell Grant program, Teach Grant program, Federal Direct Loan (subsidized and/or unsubsidized) program, or the Direct Plus Loan Program. A student enrolled in a teacher certification or recertification program is considered the same as a fifth-year undergraduate student, but can only receive aid through the Federal Direct Loan (subsidized and/or unsubsidized) program.  APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND DEADLINES Applicants must first be admitted to Fontbonne University in a degree program; graduation from high school or issuance of a GED certificate is required. At the same time the FAFSA form should be completed at the following web site: (www.fafsa.gov). Please include Fontbonne’s school code: 002464, on the FAFSA to ensure that we receive your results.

Fontbonne advises early application to receive full consideration. Applications received after the deadline will be considered for financial assistance according to available funds.  The FAFSA renewal application must be made each year with a new determination of EFC. Yearly awards will be made according to the availability of funds.

Repeated courses are counted as hours attempted each time the course is taken and reported on student’s transcript. 4. If hours are provided with transfer hours, they will be counted when calculating the quantitative standard.  Maximum Time Frame 1. All programs of study must be completed within 150% of the published length of the educational program; i.e., a program requiring 120 credit hours Fontbonne University Page 27  2018-2019 Catalog must be completed with no more than 192 attempted credit hours to maintain financial aid eligibility. 2.

Faithful to the mission, values, and vision of Fontbonne University, the honors program (known as TELOS) seeks to foster a community of thinkers for motivated and intellectually curious students in and outside the classroom. TELOS is a holistic program that focuses not only on classroom experiences but also on leadership, service and social justice, and personal and professional development so that students can apply their education to their highest purposes.  Through the program, students who display outstanding intellectual curiosity in and outside their major fields of study have the opportunity participate in a community of shared scholarship and exploration to build a shared community and develop professional networks. Graduates of the program are recognized as such on their transcripts and at commencement and honors convocation.  The TELOS program is designed to help motivated students gain the most from their Fontbonne education. The flexible nature of the program will allow students to design their particular requirements in consultation with their academic advisors and the program director. Students will have opportunities to deepen their work in their major fields; to do interdisciplinary thinking in fields outside their majors; and also to explore personal, professional, service, and leadership activities.  These requirements will be filled by coursework and/or related co-curricular activities.   Active members of the program also have the privilege of early registration for all classes, have access to shared space for study and community building, and participate in personal development and professional networking activities developed for students in the program. The program also sponsors or co-sponsors a variety of co-curricular activities, such as lectures, field trips, and performances or readings, intended to support the intellectual lives of honors students and to enrich the culture of the entire campus.  JOINING THE PROGRAM A small number of first-year students will be invited to join the TELOS program on the strength of their academic, service, leadership, and creative experiences in high school. The program will assess students holistically, not focusing solely on grade point averages or test scores but on the potential for contribution to a thriving community of learners engaged in active exploration of a world in need.  A student may apply to the program at any point prior to the completion of 75 hours of college credit (or, in the case of transfer students, within two semesters after matriculation) and may complete requirements in a flexible amount of time, in consultation with the student’s advisor and the TELOS director.   In addition, faculty and staff may nominate students who are considered good candidates for the program.  To remain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a grade of C or better in all honors courses, maintain enrollment in a zero-credit honors section, and remain in good disciplinary standing with the university.  PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Honors Coursework Honors students will complete a minimum of 9 credits of honors coursework, at least 6 of which must be honors seminars. Students may complete 3 hours of honors coursework via honors sections of general education courses.  Honors courses promote intellectual curiosity and exchange across a range of major fields and academic interests. They will also tend to focus on how one’s learning can be applied to a world in need. Valuing liberal education, honors courses emphasize experiential learning, critical exchange, interdisciplinary approaches, and moral and ethical understanding. Students not enrolled in the honors program may be permitted to take honors courses if space is available and instructor permission is granted. Honors courses are not graded differently than other courses. Some honors seminars will also offer general education credit.  Senior Honors Project The senior honors project is usually accomplished in conjunction with the capstone experience in the academic discipline and offers students an opportunity to pursue in depth an interest developed in the course of their education. The student will pursue a research project, a scientific experiment, a field experience, a series of readings, creative writing, the production of a film, or some similar culminating experience that will result in a product or artifact. Students combining the senior project in the major discipline with the senior honors project do so with the understanding that the project will exceed the ordinary requirements defined by the department for such work. It will be completed under the direction of a faculty advisor in the student’s major program and coordinated with the TELOS director.  Departments will formalize expectations for students who are pursuing honors. The TELOS director will approve all projects in consultation with students’ respective academic advisors. TELOS students will also be expected to share their senior honors projects at the TELOS showcase.  Fontbonne University Page 35  2018-2019 Catalog Customized Experiential Portfolio Students will design a portfolio of experiences that will help them meet their own personal highest purposes.  Experiences that will satisfy the portfolio are planned and pre-approved in consultation with the director.   Transformation: Experiences or coursework related to personal, spiritual, and/or creative growth Exploration: Experiences or coursework related academic inquiry outside the major field or general education requirements, encouraging breadth of knowledge and perspectives Leadership: Experiences or coursework related to understanding a variety of forms of leadership (e.g., introverted, extroverted) and influence and students’ unique leadership qualities and how to employ them  Occupation: Experiences or coursework within their academic major fields that allow students to deepen their preparation for their professional lives Service and Social Justice: Experiences or coursework related to applying one’s education and personal experiences to a world in need, on and off campus  The specific ways in which students fulfill these categories will vary by student interest and need. Students may fulfill some categories through coursework but may also apply extracurricular and co-curricular experiences to their portfolios.  Students will document their experiences and create written or creative work that expresses the ways in which these experiences or courses met the learning outcomes and help to shape personal and professional goals. Students will register for a 1-credit Portfolio Development course in their final semester.  Active Participation Students are expected to participate regularly in the community life of the program.   Each semester, the student will enroll in a zero-hour TELOS course to indicate their ongoing participation in the program; this designation will not require coursework but will allow the student to maintain his or her membership. Students who fail to maintain registration must reapply to the program at a later date, within the first 75 hours of course work, and will not be guaranteed reentry.  Students will also present at the TELOS showcase at least twice before graduation; one of these presentations will share the student’s senior honors project.

The learning environment is an asynchronous one, giving flexibility to the online course. The asynchronous nature of the course does not mean that the course lacks structure and/or deadlines.   Students are expected to participate in class discussions and activities and have weekly assignments and deadlines. Course requirements may include weekly group discussions, online quizzes, individual and/or small group assignments, readings, problem solving, or the critiquing of articles.  Online undergraduate courses may require proctored testing on campus or at an approved location.  Fontbonne also offers several degree programs in a blended format. This requires some on-campus meetings. The number of face-to-face meetings varies depending on the program.  Prior to taking the first online course at Fontbonne University, a student must complete the Blackboard Tutorial, a free tutorial, which introduces the student to Blackboard, the online course environment, to our sponsors, the Sisters of St. Joseph, and to Fontbonne University history. Students who register for online courses, or courses for which the Blackboard Tutorial is a prerequisite, will automatically be enrolled in the tutorial. The Blackboard Tutorial is available beginning several weeks before the start of every semester and before each eight-week term. Access information will be sent to all students enrolled in the tutorial; this information will be sent to the students’ Fontbonne University email address.   Students should prepare themselves to begin all online courses on the first day of the semester or the first day of the scheduled course duration. For new online students, this preparation includes completing the Blackboard Tutorial in advance of the semester start date. Students must complete the Blackboard Tutorial at least one business day (Monday thru Friday) before the start of courses to be prepared to begin their course on time. Students who do not participate in their online course on the first day will be reported to the Registrar’s Office for non-attendance and may be dropped from their course.

Most Fontbonne financial aid awards offered to graduate students will be from the Federal Direct Loan Program.  Financial aid will attempt to meet demonstrated need up to budgeted tuition and fees for commuting students and up to budgeted tuition, fees, room, and board for resident students.  The filing of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) determines the families expected contribution (EFC) toward meeting the student’s costs of education. The expected family contribution (EFC) is then subtracted from the student’s budgeted cost at Fontbonne University. The difference between the total budgeted cost and the EFC determines the student’s need for financial assistance.     Total budgeted cost at Fontbonne – EFC (Expected Family Contribution)    = Financial need  Current regulations do not permit unclassified (non-degree seeking) students to receive any type of federal aid.  APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND DEADLINES Applicants must first be admitted to Fontbonne University in a graduate degree program; graduation from an accredited college or university with a baccalaureate degree is required.

Full-time graduate: A student who carries six or more credit hours per semester. Part-time graduate: A student who carries fewer than six credit hours per semester.  RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS All required coursework for a master’s degree must be completed at Fontbonne University with the exception of the credit hours that may be transferred (see Transfer of Credit below). The final semester/term of graduate coursework must be completed at Fontbonne, regardless of the number of credit hours taken.  The deadline for the receipt of the official transcript(s) must be met for the student to graduate.

Each course must have been completed with a minimum grade of B-. A transfer course must be comparable in content to the Fontbonne course. The Fontbonne course replaced by the transfer course will be determined by the program director and approved by the college dean or department chair. Some programs may have more strict policies for transfer of credit.  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS After official acceptance into a degree program, a graduate student must complete all the requirements for the graduate degree within six years of the date of the first course taken.  SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS To earn a Fontbonne University graduate degree, a student must complete all requirements for the specific graduate program and the degree.  Federal regulations require the university to establish standards for satisfactory academic progress as an eligibility requirement for financial assistance.  A degree-seeking graduate student at Fontbonne University is expected to perform at a satisfactory academic level by:  earning grades of B- or above in all graduate courses,  achieving and maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0, and  following all academic requirements specific to the graduate program.  The following policies apply: C and/or F Grades A student who earns a grade of C in a graduate course will immediately be sent a letter of concern by the graduate program director with a copy sent to the advisor and a copy placed in the student’s file. A student who earns a second C will be dismissed.  The student may appeal the dismissal and request immediate reinstatement to the program by petitioning the college dean and with their permission may retake one of the two courses in which the C was earned as soon as the course is available. The dean may set the conditions for retaking the course, including which of the two courses should be repeated.   A student who earns an F in a graduate course will be dismissed from the program and the university.  Repeating Graduate Courses A graduate student may repeat one graduate course and repeat that graduate course one time only.  Since many graduate courses are not offered each academic semester/term, the student who earned a first grade of C in a graduate course may, with the approval of the graduate program director, be allowed to take a limited number of additional graduate courses until he/she has the opportunity to repeat the course in which the C was earned. Additional conditions pertaining to continued enrollment may be set by the program. A letter stating the conditions will be sent by the program to the student, the Office of Academic Affairs, and the advisor, with a copy placed in the student’s file.  Fontbonne University Page 229  2018-2019 Catalog GRADUATE ONLINE & BLENDED COURSES Fontbonne University offers fully online, accredited, graduate degree programs in multiple disciplines   Fontbonne University’s online courses are student-centered, just as the traditional face-to-face courses are. The learning environment is an asynchronous one, giving flexibility to the online course. The asynchronous nature of the course does not mean that the course lacks structure and/or deadlines. Students are expected to participate in class discussions and activities and have weekly assignments and deadlines. Course requirements may include weekly group discussions, online quizzes, individual and/or small group assignments, readings, problem solving, or the critiquing of articles.  Online undergraduate courses may require proctored testing on campus or at an approved location.  Fontbonne also offers several degree programs in a blended format. This requires some on-campus meetings. The number of face-to-face meetings varies depending on the program.  Prior to taking the first online course at Fontbonne University, a student must complete the Blackboard Tutorial, a free tutorial, which introduces the student to Blackboard, the online course environment, to our sponsors, the Sisters of St. Joseph, and to Fontbonne University history. Students who register for online courses, or courses for which the Blackboard Tutorial is a prerequisite, will automatically be enrolled in the tutorial. The Blackboard Tutorial is available beginning several weeks before the start of every semester and before each eight-week term. Access information will be sent to all students enrolled in the tutorial; this information will be sent to the students’ Fontbonne University email address.   Students should prepare themselves to begin all online courses on the first day of the semester or the first day of the scheduled course duration. For new online students, this preparation includes completing the Blackboard Tutorial in advance of the semester start date. Students must complete the Blackboard Tutorial at least one business day (Monday thru Friday) before the start of courses to be prepared to begin their course on time. Students who do not participate in their online course on the first day will be reported to the Registrar’s Office for non-attendance and may be dropped from their course.  Please contact Jo Ann Mattson for more information about blended or online degree programs at Fontbonne or if you have any questions regarding the Blackboard tutorial: jmattson@fontbonne.edu or 314-889-4514   If you experience issues with Blackboard in any of your courses, or to ask a question about Fontbonne University email or other technology issues please contact AskIT at:  askIT@fontbonne.edu or 314-719-8095.

VISION   Fontbonne University aspires to be a preferred destination, committed to providing a holistic learning experience rooted in excellence, for those seeking to be educated as leaders to serve a world in need and for those dedicated to educating them.   VALUES  Fontbonne University honors the values and heritage of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet by fostering excellence, integrity, respect, diversity, community, justice, service, faith, and Catholic identity.  COMMITMENT   Fontbonne University is committed to:  Achieving academic and educational excellence.  Advancing historical remembrance, critical reflection, and moral resolve.  Promoting dialogue among diverse communities.  Demonstrating care and respect for each member of the community.  Serving the larger community.  Preparing individuals to be an ethical and responsible presence to the world.  UNIVERSITY LEARNING GOALS Fontbonne University Graduates will: 1. Develop critical thinking, professional ethics, dispositions, and knowledge of core concepts relevant to one’s field of study and the pursuit of life goals. 2. Apply knowledge, ability and skills in contribution to the common good and the development of right relationships. 3. Articulate and act upon a personally authentic ethical framework which honors the values of integrity, diversity, inclusion, respect, justice, and service to others. 4. Demonstrate ability to critically analyze, synthesize, and communicate information both within and across areas of learning, personal development, and expertise.   CATHOLIC IDENTITY STATEMENT Fontbonne affirms its identity as a Catholic university. Sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, it is founded on the beliefs that all creation reveals God, that the ministry of Jesus began a process of redemption that extends to this day, and that the Holy Spirit continues to impart grace through the daily experiences of women and men. Among the many signs of God’s grace are teaching and learning, which at Fontbonne are pursued by people sharing a variety of religious beliefs and an understanding of the importance of education.    Catholic means universal and throughout the whole, like leaven permeating bread. The permeating quality of Fontbonne is our commitment to know, to love, and to serve the truth that unites faith and reason, nature and grace, the human and the divine. The desire for a greater understanding of creation and its Creator is one of the most profound expressions of human dignity. In this sense, to learn is to augment one’s capacity for love so that the thoughtful and loving acts of an educated person are a witness to the transformation of the world that began with the Resurrection and continues with the enlivening of humanity. What makes us truly human helps to unite us with the divine as we seek to understand, love, and serve God and neighbor without distinction.  The permeating and universal nature of Catholicism gives rise to the mission and vision of this university. Because Fontbonne is Catholic, we embrace openness and inclusiveness. Because Fontbonne is Catholic, we pursue educational excellence. And because Fontbonne is Catholic, we seek to recognize the presence of God in all creation and to participate in the continuing transformation of ourselves and a world in need.  DIVERSITY STATEMENT Fontbonne University maintains a strong commitment to diversity to increase the number of faculty, staff, and students from all backgrounds. Every person, regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability shall be treated with respect and dignity.  Therefore, Fontbonne University will strive to:  Create a learning environment that promotes, nurtures, and supports the understanding, recognition, and Fontbonne University Page 9  2018-2019 Catalog appreciation of contributions to society made by diverse individuals and groups    Increase recruitment and retention of diverse students, faculty, and staff  Promote and foster effective communication and  interaction among diverse populations  The Fontbonne core documents may be viewed at:  https://www.fontbonne.edu/about/fontbonne-mission/and the diversity statement at:  https://www.fontbonne.edu/campus-life/service-diversity-and-social-justice/  Fontbonne University Page 10  2018-2019 Catalog AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING  PAST AND PRESENT Fontbonne University derives its name from Mother St. John Fontbonne, refounder of the Sisters of St. Joseph after the French Revolution, who, in 1836, sent six sisters from France to open a mission at Carondelet in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1917, the state of Missouri granted a charter for a liberal arts college to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Louis Province. A college for women was the inspiration of Sister Agnes Gonzaga Ryan, CSJ, the superior general who initiated the purchase of the land at the corner of Wydown and Big Bend Boulevards in 1907 and 1908. College classes began at the Carondelet Motherhouse in 1923 with nine students and nine faculty members. Ground breaking at the present site took place in April 1924; 44 students moved to the new campus in 1925. The original campus comprised five buildings: Ryan Hall, the Fine Arts and Science buildings, the gymnasium, and the powerhouse. Additional buildings and ongoing interior and exterior modifications to the buildings preserve the classic style of the original campus. The original Fine Arts building is now referred to as the East building and houses academic departments, classrooms, and the newly developed Center for Teacher Therapist Education (CTTE). The former Southwest Hall has been totally renovated for the Fine Arts Center.    Founded as a college for women, Fontbonne evolved into a coeducational institution, admitting male students to all degree programs in 1974. The college provided undergraduate degree programs until 1975, when the first master’s degree in communication disorders received approval. Since then, Fontbonne has developed additional bachelor’s and master’s degrees and programs in traditional and accelerated formats for both traditional-age and adult students. Fontbonne College officially became Fontbonne University on March 14, 2002.   In 2007 Fontbonne was approved to offer its first online master’s degree program. Fontbonne University has continued to experience significant changes, such as the development of a computer commons on the first floor of the the Jack C. Taylor Library, the addition to the curriculum of a theme-oriented dedicated semester each fall, the creation of a center for excellence in teaching and learning (CETL), the addition of the social work department, restructuring of the university into three colleges, including the Eckelkamp College of Global Business and Professional Studies, the College of Education and Allied Health Professions, and the College of Arts & Sciences, and the creation of new majors, minors, concentrations, and certificates at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including online degree programs.    The 2011 renovated science building, now Anheuser-Busch Hall, houses the first of the three colleges, the Bonnie and L.B. Eckelkamp College of Global Business and Professional Studies, the department of Social Work, the department of biological and physical sciences, the department of family and consumer sciences, the Monsanto greenhouse, and a student lounge.  CAMPUS/OFF-CAMPUS SITES Situated in a residential section of Clayton, Missouri, the 16-acre main campus makes an attractive addition to the area. Red Missouri granite, trimmed with Bedford stone, enhances the majority of the ten campus buildings.   In addition to the main campus in Clayton, an off-campus site in Brentwood houses student art studios and theatre rehearsal space.  A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Fontbonne University is a vibrant academic community dedicated to a holistic education for all students. In an atmosphere committed to excellence, students are challenged to think critically, act ethically, and communicate effectively both in and out of the classroom by faculty who are both scholars and mentors.  Graduates of Fontbonne are well-equipped to play a leadership role in meeting the challenges of a global society.  First-time, transfer, and adult learners all have a home at Fontbonne.  The University offers dozens of undergraduate degree programs in face-to-face settings, and graduate degree programs in both face-to-face settings and online.   The evening programs attract students who are interested in completing their degrees through accelerated formats. Regardless of their choice of major or degree, students at Fontbonne are part of a caring community.  Students are offered the opportunity to learn outside the classroom as well. Study abroad opportunities are available during the academic year, for the summer, and over spring break.  Service learning trips are scheduled at both national and international sites.  Practicum and internship experiences are a part of many academic programs. Students have the opportunity to participate in groundbreaking research, help to set up language screening programs in Central America, work in classrooms in England, and participate in experiential learning at sites throughout the metropolitan area.  The main campus, in the heart of Clayton, is in close proximity to many cultural and business venues that contribute to out-of-classroom learning. The zoo and Fontbonne University Page 11  2018-2019 Catalog museums of Forest Park, the business community of downtown St. Louis, the county government center of Clayton, nearby concert locales, educational and health care institutions, and non-profit organizations play a vital role in a Fontbonne education.  ACADEMIC CONVOCATION At the beginning of the academic year students, faculty, staff, and administrators gather to recognize, celebrate, and strengthen our identity as a Catholic institution of higher education and to focus the charism of the Sisters of St. Joseph into one mission/vision: educating leaders to serve a world in need. The celebratory daytime event and a corresponding event for evening students include a keynote speaker, a commissioning ceremony, and the bestowing of stoles and pins on students; students attending for the first time receive a stole and returning students receive a pin representative of the university.  DEDICATED SEMESTER Fontbonne University is proud to offer a unique learning opportunity each fall semester. The Dedicated Semester is a collaborative venture that includes coursework, guest speakers, special events, and co-curricular opportunities that focus on a single theme. Beginning in 2007, topics have included: Judaism and its Cultures (2007); the U.N. Millennium Development Goals (2008); Immigrant Experiences (2009), Happiness: Traditions and Tensions (2010); The Disability Experience: Quest for Empowerment (2011); Foodology: The Culture, Economics and Science of Food (2012), Sustainability:  Small Steps, Giant Leaps (2013);  Civil Rights: Then and Now (2014); The Future (2015); Security, Privacy, and Freedom (2016) and We, Myself, and Why: Exploring Identity will occur in 2017.  Faculty, staff, and students with special interests are encouraged to develop proposals for future dedicated semesters.   JACK C. TAYLOR LIBRARY The Jack C. Taylor Library provides materials and resources to support research, instructional assistance that complements the curriculum, and attractive and comfortable spaces for reading and research. Library resources concentrate on student learning and faculty teaching.  The Library subscribes to hundreds of journals and magazines and several newspapers of local and national interest in paper format.

Student Complaint Policy Fontbonne University is dedicated to providing an excellent educational experience for all students. The university recognizes the importance of resolving student concerns and grievances in a timely and effective manner. In registering concerns and filing appeals, Fontbonne students must follow the policies and procedures that have been established by the university or within the unit about which the concern is being filed. Generally, these policies and procedures require that students begin by discussing the matter with the staff, faculty, or department in which the issue originated. Notable exceptions include complaint alleging discrimination or harassment.   If a student believes that a policy or procedure has been incorrectly or unfairly applied in his/her particular case, or a complaint does not fall within a specific policy, and efforts to resolve the concern have not been successful, the student may file a formal complaint. A formal complaint must:   Be made in writing using the Fontbonne University Student Complaint Form and signed by the student;  Include the name and contact information of the person filing the complaint, and a brief description of the circumstances including who has been involved and the current status;  Be submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs. Upon receipt in the Office of Academic Affairs, formal complaints about a faculty or staff member in an academic department or regarding a course or academic program will be directed to the Dean of the college housing the object of the complaint. Other formal complaints will be directed to the Vice President responsible for the department of individual against which the complaint is made. Formal complaints about a Vice President will be directed to the Office of the President.   Upon receipt of a formal complaint, the office of that Dean or Vice President will acknowledge the complaint and maintain a record of when the complaint was received, any actions taken, and the final resolution. Students should receipt an official response to complaints within 30 days. The receiving office will send notice of the final resolution to the Office of Academic Affairs, which maintains a record of all formal complaints.  The Missouri Department of Higher Education serves as a clearinghouse for postsecondary student complaints. This webpage contains information about the complaint process and includes instructions on how to file a formal complaint.

In its review of student credentials, the university looks for those students who show evidence of successful completion of prior academic work, self-motivation, academic aptitude, and promise.  Fontbonne accepts applications for most undergraduate programs for both the fall and spring semesters. The university operates on rolling admission and will notify an applicant of a decision as soon as possible after the receipt of all required credentials. All credentials submitted for admission must be on file no later than one week prior to final registration for the term in which the applicant wishes to begin.  Accepted applicants indicate a decision to attend Fontbonne by forwarding a $100 tuition deposit to the university. Tuition deposits for fall semester are refundable until May 1. Tuition deposits for spring semester are refundable until December 15.  The vice president for enrollment management welcomes correspondence from candidates for admission, high school and college counselors, and academic advisors. All correspondence regarding application for admission and all application credentials should be addressed to:   Admission Office Fontbonne University  6800 Wydown Boulevard  St. Louis, MO 63l05-3098 314.889.1400 Fax: 314.889.1451 fbyou@fontbonne.edu  FIRST-YEAR STUDENT ADMISSION Fontbonne considers as first-year students those degree-seeking students who are graduates of an accredited high school and who have not previously enrolled in a degree program at an accredited college or university. Students dually enrolled at a community college while completing high school will still be considered first-year students.  Candidates for admission should begin application procedures early in the fall of the year preceding that for which they seek admission. To complete their application, each first-year student must submit the following: 1. A completed undergraduate application for admission.  2. An official copy of an accredited high school transcript which includes the sixth semester grades, class rank if applicable, and the cumulative grade point average.  3. Score results of the American College Test (ACT) or Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Applicants are encouraged to take the ACT or SAT examinations no later than the fall of their senior year of high school. 4. A recommendation letter or form completed by a high school teacher or guidance counselor is recommended but not required.   Additional information may be requested after review of the applicant’s file.  Recommendations for Admission as a First-Year Student: To be admitted the student should have:   An ACT assessment composite score of 20 or a minimum SAT composite score of 950 (critical reading and math).  A high school GPA of 2.5 or greater on a 4.0 scale as determined by Fontbonne.  Completed the following recommended core requirements:   Four units of English  Three units of mathematics  Three units of social science  Three units of science (one must include a lab)  One unit of visual/performing arts  One unit of practical arts  One unit of physical education  Six units of academic electives (including foreign  language).  When first-year student applicants fail to meet any one or more of these standards, their applications receive consideration by the undergraduate admission standards and review committee. The committee will decide if the applicant should be admitted to the university and, if so, under what specific conditions.  All accepted candidates currently enrolled in high school must successfully complete all work in progress and submit, upon graduation, an official high school transcript showing all work completed, including their date of graduation. This transcript must be on file in the admission office at least one week prior to the beginning of the academic school year or semester in which the student enrolls.  Fontbonne University Page 16  2018-2019 Catalog GED/HISET APPLICANTS Applicants must earn a 2350 on the General Educational Development (GED) examinations. The ACT is required if students wish to be considered for scholarships.   In 2014, most states started using the HiSET® passing criteria which means to pass the HiSET exam, you need to:  Score at least 8 out of 20 on each of the five subtests  Score at least 2 out of 6 on the essay  Achieve a total scaled score on all five HiSET subtests of at least 45 out of 100  TRANSFER ADMISSION  Fontbonne welcomes transfer students from a wide variety of backgrounds, from two-year and four-year, public and private colleges and universities. A transfer student is one who (1) has obtained a high school diploma or the GED, (2) has previously attended an accredited postsecondary institution [or institutions] at the undergraduate level, and (3) is entering Fontbonne University for the first time.  (A student who has completed college courses while still in high school/dual enrollment is considered a first-time first-year student, not a transfer student.) Transfer applicants should begin application procedures at least two months prior to final registration for the term in which they seek admission.  Transfer candidates must have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale and preliminary approval from their intended major department at Fontbonne. The department provides preliminary approval by virtue of a tentative transcript evaluation of transfer coursework meeting major requirements.   Course credits from another institution will, in general, be accepted under the following conditions. The credits must:   be completed from an accredited, degree-granting institution of higher learning;  be college level courses (100 level or above);  have a grade of D or better. Coursework meeting major, minor, or concentration requirements must have a grade of C- or better.  A student may transfer a maximum of 64 credit hours to Fontbonne University from a community college.  The major department determines the number of hours and the specific courses that will be accepted for transfer into the student’s intended major. All candidates should be aware of the need to meet the minimum GPA requirements in their intended major field of study for major approval, for continuing in the program, and for graduation.  Transfer students must complete all Fontbonne degree requirements and the residency requirement of a minimum of 30 credit hours. All courses taken during the semester of degree completion/graduation must be completed at Fontbonne University.  For application, transfer candidates must submit: 1. A completed application for admission. 2. An official transcript from each accredited college or university previously attended (including college credit or AP credit received while in high school) showing all work completed to date. Students who have completed fewer than 30 semester hours must also submit an official high school transcript. Official transcripts must be stamped with the institution’s official seal.                                      3. Recommendations from authorized school administrators or others who can evaluate the applicant’s academic abilities and personal characteristics. Although optional, these recommendations prove particularly helpful to the admission standards and review committee, especially if the recommendations help to explain or mitigate weaknesses in the student’s past academic record.  Candidates receive an official evaluation of transfer credit upon acceptance. All accepted candidates currently enrolled elsewhere in college-level courses must successfully complete all work in progress and submit an official college transcript showing the additional courses completed. This transcript must be on file prior to final registration for the semester in which the student enrolls.   Transfer students are exempt from placement testing in any area in which transfer credits are accepted to meet a Fontbonne requirement. Transfer students who are not exempt from the computerized university placement tests must take the tests before registering for courses. The tests assist the university in evaluating, placing, and advising incoming students.  Fontbonne University accepts the Missouri General Education Block and the Illinois Articulation Initiative as completing its Culture and the Common Good General Education Requirements.  Transfer students are responsible for completing other graduation requirements, including a religion or theology course.  EARLY ADMISSION  Fontbonne admits for summer school and to the first-year student class qualified candidates who have completed at least six semesters of high school. In evaluating candidates for early admission, the university requires evidence of a high level of motivation, strong academic credentials, and a level of maturity that will enable the candidate to succeed at Fontbonne.  Fontbonne University Page 17  2018-2019 Catalog Candidates for early admission must present score results from the American College Test (ACT) or Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests (PSAT), and have achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or above as determined by Fontbonne University.

Especially capable and qualified students are urged to pursue their education at Fontbonne through the assistance of a variety of scholarships. Academic scholarships are based on the individual’s performance and potential without regard to financial circumstance. These scholarships range from $1000 up to full-tuition.  Academic scholarships are competitive. The university determines the amount of scholarship assistance awarded through an evaluation of the depth, scope, and quality of the applicant’s academic ability, leadership potential, and scholastic aptitude.   The university considers degree-seeking, full-time, first-time students and transfer applicants for scholarships. Scholarships apply to the following academic year with one-half of the award applied to each semester. To receive renewal of the award for subsequent semesters (up to the value of the scholarship), the recipient must enroll full time at Fontbonne and maintain the required cumulative university and program grade point average. If a student moves to part-time status in either or both of the semesters a scholarship is awarded, the student will no longer be eligible to retain the scholarship.  If a student starts at part-time status and moves to full-time, their prior transcripts and Fontbonne transcripts may be reviewed for scholarship consideration.  Fontbonne encourages scholarship applicants to apply for financial aid consideration based on demonstrated need. Awarded scholarship funds become a part of the student’s financial aid package. Any scholarship offered by Fontbonne may be reduced in order to retain a student’s full eligibility for state and federal assistance and in keeping with the financial aid policy of the university.  Students receiving scholarship or grant funds from sources other than Fontbonne must report this information to the financial aid office. Outside scholarship funds may be used against the loan or work portion of a student’s financial aid package. Any remainder will reduce a Fontbonne scholarship or grant.

It serves to assist students to identify and achieve their educational goals, while creating collaborative relationships with other institutional departments, faculty and staff.  The advising process is an on-going and developing one, whereby both the advisor and advisee share responsibilities.  In the event that an advisor/advisee arrangement does not work effectively, a student may petition the director of academic advising for a new advisor.  The advisor’s role is rooted firmly in education, providing the necessary information regarding policies, degree programs, courses, schedules and registration.  Advisors must reach out developmentally as well by engaging students in self-directed learning, creating academic plans and strategies, discussing personal goals and referring individuals to the appropriate campus resources.  Students may not register for courses until being cleared by their advisor.  With the support and guidance of their academic advisor, advisees are expected to learn and practice the habits of successful students.  This includes maintaining regular contact with all of their academic stakeholders, taking responsibility for consulting the University Catalog, making final decisions about choices regarding their academic careers, preparing in advance for relevant meetings, gathering all pertinent information, following through on referrals, asking questions and striving to be an ethical and contributing member of society through critical thought and action.  Additional information may be obtained through the advising website: https://www.fontbonne.edu/academics/academic-resources/academic-advising/   GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Culture & the Common Good:  A Liberal Arts Education at Fontbonne University  Fontbonne University is committed to the liberal arts tradition. The general education requirements seek to infuse an appreciation of the liberal arts into the academic and educational fabric of the institution. General education at Fontbonne University includes a common core that integrates mission into the curriculum, highlights our distinctiveness, employs high-impact practices to increase student engagement, and prioritizes the concerns of global citizenship in the 21st century. General Education requirements include Mission Core, Foundations, Pillars, Bridges and Writing Intensive courses.  View the most up-to-date course lists for meeting these requirements at:  http://my.fontbonne.edu/academic-resources/curriculum-guides/?role=faculty.  Copies are also available in the Registrar’s Office or The Office of Academic Advising.  Mission Core:   The purpose of the Mission Core is to bring a distinctively Fontbonne perspective to the general education program. The values and heritage of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, the founders and sponsors of Fontbonne University, and the Catholic Intellectual Tradition and Catholic Social Teaching as they apply to the liberal arts and professional programs are key elements of Mission Core courses.  Foundations of Knowledge: Foundations requirements -- communication, mathematics, and managing information -- build critical skills that support all academic disciplines.  Pillars of Knowledge: Pillars requirements expand upon the Foundations to more fully prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century through coursework in the humanities, fine arts, philosophy, the social and behavioral sciences, and physical and biological sciences.  Bridges of Knowledge: Bridges courses ensure that students have an opportunity for interdisciplinary study across campus or off-campus, integrating academic knowledge with community and/or global experiences.  Requirements: These requirements apply to all undergraduate degree programs and consist of a minimum of 42 credit hours of academic course work taken within the following components:  MISSION CORE: 6 CREDITS.  These courses integrate Fontbonne’s Mission, Vision and Values and a global perspective into the curriculum.  Mission Core I: 3 credits. The goal of Mission Core I: Culture & the Common Good is to prioritize attention to issues of historical remembrance, social justice, and diversity, to build alliances with individuals and organizations that are bringing about positive changes in the global community, and to integrate the liberal arts with professional education. Completion of this requirement partially fulfills the state Valuing requirement.  Upon completion of this requirement, students will be able to: 1. Identify links between Fontbonne's mission, as supported by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, Fontbonne University Page 39  2018-2019 Catalog and the principle of the common good, a principle of Catholic Social Teaching. 2. Articulate the challenges of reconciling divergent ideas about the common good within a pluralistic society.  3. Determine one's personal ideas about the common good by examining the idea in multiple contexts. 4. Prioritize one's personal and professional goals in light of one's potential contributions to the common good.  5. Demonstrate effective use of campus resources to foster personal and professional development.  Mission Core I - One course is required of all students with fewer than 30 credit hours of college credit. ! http://my.fontbonne.edu/msoffice (Scroll down to locate information.)   Some courses require the purchase of additional course-specific software; this information should be listed in the course schedule or course syllabus.

A program director may decide whether to substitute one course for another or waive a course. The degree modification form, obtained from the registrar’s office, must be completed, including all signatures required, and returned to the registrar’s office. The total number of hours required for completion of the degree may not be waived.  DUAL UNDERGRADUATE/ GRADUATE ENROLLMENT A Fontbonne undergraduate student may be eligible to earn graduate academic credit for graduate level courses with permission from the department that is offering the graduate course.  To be eligible for dual enrollment, a Fontbonne undergraduate student must be classified as a senior (a minimum of 90 credit hours earned) and have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. Enrollment in graduate courses must be approved by the graduate program director, since preference is given to students enrolled in the graduate program.  Graduate credit hours may not be used toward the 120 hour requirement for an undergraduate degree. However, a maximum of nine graduate credit hours taken during dual enrollment may be applied to the total credit hours required for the master’s degree.  PRE-REGISTRATION/ REGISTRATION PROCEDURES The scheduled dates for pre-registration are listed in the fall, spring, and summer course schedules. A student must be advised and obtain registration clearance before the student is able to register. Academic advisors and support staff are readily available to assist students during these pre-registration/registration times.   CHANGES IN REGISTRATION Any change in registration, including withdrawal from a course, must:  be made on the appropriate form available in the registrar’s office;  give the supportive reason for the change or withdrawal;  be approved by the academic advisor, and signed by the business office, the financial aid office, and, if applicable, by the office of academic affairs; and  be returned to the registrar’s office before the deadline date specified in the course schedule.  INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent study courses, available to qualified degree-seeking students, allow students to pursue interests not available in the established curriculum. An independent study course may take the form of research, a reading program, or a special off-campus project. Each independent study must have an instructor. Each independent study must be approved by the director of each program.  A formal independent study application, available in the registrar’s office, must be completed and on file in the registrar’s office at the time of registration. See academic departments for independent study course numbers and descriptions.  CLASS ATTENDANCE/PARTICIPATION Responsibility for participation in class rests on the individual student. Fontbonne University expects regular attendance/participation. Faculty who use regular attendance/participation as part of the course requirements for evaluation purposes will notify the students of the policy in writing on the course syllabus distributed at the beginning of the course.  Each instructor is expected to give reasonable consideration to the feasibility of make-up work. Students are directly responsible to instructors for class participation and for work missed.  If a student chooses to stop participating in a course without officially withdrawing from the course (i.e., completing a change in registration [drop/add] form obtained from the registrar’s office) the student will receive a grade of AF for the course.  Note: The last date of attendance as recorded by the instructor may have financial aid implications for the student.  Fontbonne University Page 231  2018-2019 Catalog GRADE DEFINITIONS The following grading scale and definitions are used for graduate programs at Fontbonne University: A Superior graduate work A- B+ B Satisfactory graduate work  B- C Less than satisfactory graduate work F Unsatisfactory work; no academic credit AF Failure due to absence *P/NP  Pass is defined as a grade of B or better I Incomplete W Withdrawal WI Involuntary withdrawal  *Pass/No Pass (P/NP) Grading Option: The only courses a graduate student may take P/NP are courses designated as such by the department.  GRADES AND QUALITY POINTS To express the quality of a student’s work in numerical form, letter grades are translated into quality points. Each grade carries a specific number of quality points. Fontbonne uses the following grades/quality points:  Grade Quality Points A  4.0 A-  3.7 B+  3.3 B  3.0 B-  2.7 C  2.0 F  0.0 AF  0.0  GRADE POINT AVERAGE The grade point average (GPA) is calculated by dividing the quality points earned by the credit hours attempted. The grade point average is computed on the basis of credit hours attempted, not credit hours passed. Grades of pass (P), no pass (NP) and incomplete (I) do not carry quality points and are not computed in the GPA.  In the case of a repeated course, both the original and repeated course will appear on the transcript. Only the higher grade will be calculated in the GPA; the total credits earned will be incremented only once.  Note: Repeating a course may affect a student’s eligibility for federal financial aid.  INCOMPLETE (I) If a student is earning a passing grade in a course, but does not complete the requirements of the course in a timely manner due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., serious illness) that occur within the last two or three weeks of the semester, the student may request an incomplete (I).   The student must obtain the request for an incomplete form from the registrar’s office and complete the form with the instructor, obtaining all of the required signatures before submitting the form to the registrar’s office.  An unchanged incomplete (I) will become a grade of F if the incomplete has not been changed to a letter grade by the close of day one week following the mid-semester date. In extenuating circumstances, the office of academic affairs, in consultation with the program director or the director of evening programs, the instructor, and the student, may extend the incomplete, but not beyond two months.  DEFERRED GRADE If, for some reason, the grade from a particular course cannot reach the registrar’s office in time for the semester report, the student will receive a deferred grade (X). As soon as the instructor completes the change of grade form, the grade will be recorded on the student’s transcript.  GRADE CHANGE Once a semester is over, a grade may not be changed because a student submits additional work or submits work that was due during the semester. Grade changes should occur only under any of the following three conditions: 1. To convert an incomplete (I) to a letter grade. The required change of grade form, available in the office of the registrar, must be completed by the instructor according to the date listed in the semester course schedule. (See incomplete above.) 2. To convert a deferred grade (X) to a letter grade. The required change of grade form, available in the office of the registrar, must be completed by the instructor as soon as possible, generally within the week grades are due.  (See deferred grade above.) 3. To correct an incorrect grade awarded due to an instructor’s calculation or recording error. The required change of grade form, available in the office of the registrar, must be completed by the instructor by the end of first two weeks of the following semester.  COURSES TAKEN ACROSS DEPARTMENTS WITHIN FONTBONNE A student must receive prior written approval from each of the program directors to enroll in another graduate program’s course that is not specifically required for the student’s program.  Fontbonne University Page 232  2018-2019 Catalog CHANGE OF GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAM A graduate student who wishes to change his or her graduate degree program must notify his/her current program director in writing of the intent to do so. The student must then complete the appropriate application materials required by the new program of choice.   When changing a graduate program, a student may be required to follow the current catalog if different from the catalog in effect at the time of the student’s initial matriculation.  LEAVE OF ABSENCE A degree-seeking graduate student who has a pre-determined need to leave Fontbonne for one or two semesters (not including summer session) with the expectation to return may request a leave of absence.   The student must complete a request for leave of absence form obtained from the registrar’s office. The student with an approved leave of absence may return under the same catalog and program requirements in effect at the time of the initial matriculation. If the student’s program curriculum has changed due to an accrediting/approval agency mandate, the student must follow the new requirements. To re-enter Fontbonne, the student must contact the registrar’s office to request reinstatement and to obtain registration materials, beginning at the time of pre-registration. The student must contact an advisor to obtain approval and web clearance to be eligible to register.  WITHDRAWALS Withdrawal from a Course A student who, with proper authorization, withdraws from a course (see changes in registration under the registration procedures in this section) before the date specified in the semester course schedule receives a designation of W. A student who stops attending at some point after the third week of class does not complete the authorized withdrawal process receives a grade of AF.  A student may not request a withdrawal after the date specified in the semester course schedule. However, a student with appropriate and verifiable documentation may request, from Office of Academic Affairs, an exception to this policy. (See Withdrawal for an Extenuating Circumstance below.)   For financial aid purposes, the instructor must be able to provide the last date of attendance when a student stops attending or petitions to withdraw from a course.  Note: A student should be aware that failure to attend class does not constitute a withdrawal and may affect the student’s federal financial aid status. A student must notify the financial aid office, business office, and registrar’s office immediately upon the student’s decision to stop attending a course.  Withdrawal for an Extenuating Circumstance A student may request to withdraw from Fontbonne  University at any time throughout a session of enrollment (fall, spring, summer) for an extenuating circumstance.   An extenuating circumstance is an unexpected or unusual situation beyond a student’s control which makes it impossible for the student to complete his or her coursework during the enrollment term. Personal or immediate-family medical or non-medical issues, financial problems, trauma, and military deployment are examples of extenuating circumstances.  A graduate student must obtain information, procedures, and forms concerning a withdrawal for an extenuating circumstance from the office of academic affairs. At the latest, the withdrawal procedures must be completed and all documentation submitted to the office of academic affairs within 30 business days following the last date of exams for that enrollment session.  Involuntary Withdrawal for  Non-attendance A student who registers for a course and never attends the course will be withdrawn from the course ordinarily after the third week of classes. The registrar’s office will notify the student in writing of non-attendance; the student will have one week to respond by either immediately attending the course or immediately withdrawing from the course. Failure to officially withdraw from the course will result in the student receiving an involuntary withdrawal (WI).   A student receiving a WI will be responsible for any incurred costs. A student who receives a student refund must return the refund to Fontbonne University. (See the university’s refund policy in the semester course schedule.)  An involuntary withdrawal will result in a change in a student’s registration. Based on federal financial aid  regulations, this may require a recalculation of the student’s financial aid package and adjustments to the student’s aid award. These adjustments may result in aid being removed from the student’s award and a balance due on the student’s account.  Fontbonne University Page 233  2018-2019 Catalog DISMISSALS Academic Dismissal See: Satisfactory Academic Progress and Statute of Limitation above in this section.  Non-Academic Dismissal A student may be dismissed at any time from Fontbonne University for a variety of non-academic offenses. These include, but are not limited to, behavior or attitudes unworthy of a good campus citizen, an unsatisfactory financial record, or violation of any policy of Fontbonne University.  ACADEMIC APPEALS PROCESS A graduate student, who wishes to petition the academic appeals committee for a hearing for a final grade appeal or for a hearing for an academic matter other than a final grade, must consult with Office of Academic Affairs which will provide the student with a copy of the academic appeal policy, procedures, and timelines.  The academic appeals committee, comprised of five elected faculty members and eight students selected by the office of academic affairs in consultation with department chairs, serves to offer a fair hearing to the student. Three faculty and three graduate students are selected from the committee to serve with the committee chair at any hearing.  Appeals ordinarily are not heard in the summer session.  Academic Appeal Regarding Matters Other Than Final Grades or Dismissal If a graduate student wishes to appeal an academic issue other than a recorded final grade or dismissal, the student must consult with the office of academic affairs as to the appropriate process to follow as it relates to the appeal issue. Within one calendar week following this consultation the student must provide a formal letter of appeal to the office of academic affairs, who will then direct the letter to the appropriate individual/committee for resolution.  Final Grade Appeal If a graduate student wishes to challenge a recorded final grade, the student must obtain a written copy of the academic appeals process for a grade appeal from the Office of Academic Affairs. This written copy of the process must be obtained no later than the end of the first three full calendar weeks of classes of the fall or spring semester following the semester (including the summer session) in which the grade in question was issued. The request by students in traditional courses for the written copy of the appeal process is handled preferably in person; the request by students in online courses may be handled by email or fax.  Appeal Regarding Dismissal A student who is dismissed from a graduate program and the university may appeal the decision by submitting a letter of appeal to the Dean of the college in which the student is seeking a degree within thirty calendar days of being dismissed as indicated by the date of the dismissal letter.  Appealing a dismissal is not a guarantee of re-admission.  Appeal letters should be formally written and include at least the following information:  1)  The reasons for the student earning the grades that led to their dismissal, and 2)  What has changed that will alleviate the reasons listed for point number one.  Second dismissals are final, and therefore appeals will not be considered for second dismissals.    READMISSION Requests for readmission will be considered only after clearance has been obtained from the Business Office and Registrar. Additionally, students applying for financial aid must obtain clearance from the Financial Aid Office.  Once these clearances are acquired, the student may proceed to their advisor for registration.  APPLICATION FOR DEGREE All students who wish to apply for a degree to be conferred must file their applications in the registrar’s office by August 1 for December conferral of degree, December 1 for May conferral of degree, and May 1 for August conferral of degree.  Commencement ceremonies are held in May.  COMMENCEMENT/CONFERRING OF DEGREES Fontbonne University confers bachelors’ and masters’ degrees at the annual commencement ceremony in May.  All graduate students who will have completed their degree by May or will complete their degree in August and who have enrolled in the courses required to do so are eligible for participation in the commencement ceremony the May preceding their August completion.  All other students who wish to participate in commencement before completing all requirements may direct an appeal to walk in the commencement ceremony to the Office of Academic Affairs. Students may only participate in one commencement ceremony.  RECORD OF WORK AND TRANSCRIPTS A student receives a semester grade report online after the close of each semester, and can access unofficial copies of their transcript through the student portal.  A student may request official copies of the transcript for a fee. To protect the right to privacy of a student, a student must make a written request for transcripts. A request should be submitted at least one week in advance of the time the transcript is needed. Fontbonne will not issue any transcripts until all indebtedness to the university has been settled in full. Fontbonne University Page 234  2018-2019 Catalog To be considered an official transcript, a transcript must include the institution’s seal and be either received directly from another institution or sent directly to another institution.  Fontbonne will not release official transcripts from other institutions filed for the purpose of admission to Fontbonne. These become the property of Fontbonne University.  ACADEMIC INTEGRITY/HONESTY According to its mission, Fontbonne University is committed to graduating students who are prepared to think critically, to act ethically, and to assume responsibility as citizens and leaders. Fontbonne University expects the highest standards of integrity from its students.  A violation of academic integrity includes, but is not limited to, any act of cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, dissimulation and any act of aiding and abetting academic dishonesty. In cases where academic integrity is in question, the following definitions and policies will apply.  Cheating is a purposeful deception in the preparation and/or submission of papers and assignments and the taking of exams, tests, or quizzes.  Plagiarism is the representation of the words and ideas of another as one’s own in any academic exercise. Plagiarism includes failing to give a citation for using work from another person or source. Modifications and rephrasing do not reduce the requirement for giving a citation. This also applies to information obtained electronically, such as from the Internet.  Fabrication is the deliberate falsification or invention of any information or citation in any academic exercise, such as making up a source, giving an incorrect citation, misquoting a source.  Dissimulation is the disguising or altering of one’s own actions with the intent to deceive another about the real nature of one’s actions concerning an academic exercise.  Examples include fabricating excuses for such things as missing classes, postponing tests, handing in late papers, turning in a paper for one class that was originally written for another class (when original work is requested).  Individual instructors will set specific policies regarding academic integrity. In general, students may expect to receive a zero (0) on any assignment, exam, test, or quiz and perhaps fail a course when a violation of academic integrity has occurred.  Broader violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to:   Abuse of resources is the damaging of any resource material or inappropriately limiting access to resource material that is necessary for academic work. Abuse includes hiding library materials; removing non-circulating material from the library; hiding or stealing another person’s textbook, notes, or software; failure to return library materials when requested.  Forgery of academic documents is the unauthorized  changing or construction of any academic document, such as changing transcripts, changing grade books, changing grades on papers which have been returned, or forging signatures. Other examples include completion of an application for any academic program that omits or falsifies any requested information. Such violations can result in the revocation of the application even if approval was previously granted on the basis of fabricated information.  Sabotage is the damaging or impeding of the academic work of another student. Sabotage includes ruining another student’s lab work; destroying another student’s term paper.  Aiding and abetting academic dishonesty is knowingly facilitating any act defined above.  Violations of academic integrity have a broad impact on the university and will result in university review and action. Faculty who observe violations of academic integrity are asked to report all violations to the office of academic affairs where records of violations will be maintained for five years. University review and action may include tutorials on the appropriate use of materials, academic probation, or expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. All procedures for disciplinary action are detailed in the Griffin Scratch and Fontbonne policy manuals.  ASSESSMENT To ensure the continuing quality of a Fontbonne degree, the university regularly collects data on academic programs, advising, student activities, and campus climate. Examples include course evaluations and advising evaluations which all students are expected to complete.  Student participation in periodic assessment, such as surveys and achievement tests, is expected and may be required for graduation. Because of the random sampling methods used to identify participants, not all students will be required to participate in the same assessment activities. Along with formal assessments, student work samples from individual classes may also be collected to provide authentic artifacts for internal and external program review.  The assessment program is designed to assist faculty, staff, and administrators in improving student learning, as well as the delivery of all campus services. Academic programs and student services are reviewed and revised based on a regular analysis of the data obtained from the assessment process. In this way, both the individual student and the institution benefit from assessment.Fontbonne University Page 235  2018-2019 Catalog College of Arts and Sciences  DEPARTMENT OF FINE ARTS DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE    Dr. Adam G.

Prior learning assessment is a concept based on accepted principles of adult learning and serves to validate the professional competence achieved by men and women outside the classroom. Credit for prior learning may be earned as a result of professional training and college/university-level learning gained through experience, military training, and/or validated by various tests. Prior learning credit will be awarded only if the work assessed meets or exceeds “C” level coursework.  A maximum of 32 credit hours will be accepted in PLA credit opportunities at Fontbonne. Students may not count PLA credit toward the 30-hour residency requirement at Fontbonne or toward a program’s core requirements, and may not receive credit more than once for the same learning/competency achievement. Fees charged for PLA credit are subject to change.  The standards and criteria established by Fontbonne for assessing college/university-level learning were developed in conformance with guidelines set forth by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL). Fontbonne University cannot guarantee how another college or university might interpret transfer credit awarded through Prior Learning Assessment.  Standardized Tests Students may earn credit through the assessment of their college/university-level learning by the following methods of testing. Students cannot earn credit for an examination if they have taken a college/university course of equal or higher equivalency in that area prior to the exam. The testing methods recognized by Fontbonne are defined as follows:  College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Students may earn credit for CLEP general and subject examinations to fulfill certain course requirements according to the respective college or department policy. Official test scores must be received by the registrar’s office directly from the testing agency. Credit is awarded if the score received is at or above the American Council of Education (ACE) recommended score.   International Baccalaureate (IB) Students who earn an acceptable score on the IB exam as approved by the appropriate college dean or department chairperson may be awarded university credit.  Advanced Placement (AP)  Students who score three, four or five on Advanced Placement tests may be awarded university credit through Fontbonne, subject to the approval of the appropriate college dean or department chairperson. Each college/department in which the course is housed, in consultation with the Office of Academic Affairs, will determine the test score and the number of credits accepted for the equivalent course (s) offered in their department.  A student who scores one or two on AP tests will not receive advanced placement or earn university credit. Official test scores must be received by the registrar’s office directly from the testing agency.  A list of the Fontbonne courses that are satisfied by advanced placement courses is available in the offices of the coordinator of prior learning assessment, admission, registrar, and academic affairs.  Advanced Subsidiary (AS-Level) and Advanced Level (A-Level) Credit Students who have successfully completed Advanced Subsidiary or Advanced Level (A-Level) may be awarded credit based on their exam results as determined by the college dean or department chairperson.  Non-Standardized Exams/Credit from Accredited Institutions and Organizations and Military Experience College/university credit can be awarded for military courses and enlisted ranks/military occupational specialties (MOS) which adhere to the standards of and have been evaluated by the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide. When available, submission of the ACE registry transcript is required. If ACE is unable to provide a transcript, the DD214 and/or a transcript of in-service training is required.  Professional Training College/university credit may be awarded for professional training courses sponsored by business and industry, government, and labor which adhere to the standards of and have been evaluated by the American Council on Education (ACE) or the New York State Program on Non-collegiate Sponsored Instruction (PONSI).  Credit by Exam Fontbonne will accept undergraduate credit by exam for non-standardized examinations given by accredited institutions. The course number, title, and credit hours must appear on the official transcript. Determination as to the fulfillment of certain course requirements will be reviewed and considered by the appropriate department chair in consultation with the college dean. Fontbonne University Page 44  2018-2019 Catalog  Department Proficiency Exams Several departments offer proficiency exams for specific Fontbonne courses. Students who satisfactorily complete the proficiency exam for a specific course may petition to have the requirement met and to receive credit for the particular course.  Portfolio Evaluation The portfolio evaluation is available in two formats:  (a) Portfolio I: Documented Learning and  (b) Portfolio II: Narrative Essay. If students believe they have already acquired the competencies of specific university courses, they may petition for credit through the portfolio evaluation. Students can earn credit for courses listed in the Fontbonne University catalog as well as for college/university-level courses listed in the catalogs of an accredited degree-granting college or university, provided there is a Fontbonne faculty member who can evaluate the request relative to learning outcomes. The prior learning assessment coordinator provides guidance in portfolio preparation and submission procedures. The portfolio must contain detailed evidence of learning outcomes, supporting documentation, and descriptions of personal and professional experience.  Portfolio I: Documented Learning   Students must prepare a portfolio of their learning experiences, which can be documented by licenses, certifications, or transcripts from non-accredited or professionally accredited colleges and schools.   Professional training programs through local corporations, which have not been evaluated by ACE/PONSI, may be included in this portfolio.   The documented learning portfolio should have content congruent to the established Fontbonne  University specific course for which credit is being petitioned. Credit awarded for the documented learning portfolio must not be greater than the credit assigned to the specific course as listed in the Fontbonne catalog.    Portfolio II: Narrative Essay  If the student has extensive knowledge which cannot be supported through areas of learning covered under the Portfolio I description, Portfolio II must be prepared for assessment. The narrative essay portfolio relies on the student’s explanation of the learning outcomes and the practical application of the experiences. Examples of supporting documentation include work samples, certificates of completion of workshops/seminars, and verification from superiors.  For additional information on prior learning assessment, please contact the office of Academic Affairs at 314.889.1401.  INTER-INSTITUTIONAL CROSS REGISTRATION Fontbonne University participates in an inter-institutional agreement with the following universities: Lindenwood, Maryville, Missouri Baptist, and Webster. Undergraduate students may take courses at these host institutions only during the fall and spring semesters under the following conditions:  The student must take 12 or more credits (including the inter-institutional course) and pay full tuition at Fontbonne.  The inter-institutional course is not offered at the home institution during the semester the student wishes to take the course.  The host institution must have room in the course.  The student is limited to six credits or two courses per semester at the host institution.  The student does not pay additional tuition for the inter-institutional course (unless it brings the total credits over 18), but must pay the host institution any incidental fees such as for laboratory or studio materials.  The student should not take inter-institutional courses during the semester in which the student expects to graduate due to the unavailability of a timely final transcript from the other institution’s registrar’s office. The Fontbonne registrar’s office handles registration for inter-institutional courses. Required forms are available in the registrar’s office.  CHIROPRACTIC.

The student may not take CLEP or apply for any externally granted credit through Prior Learning Assessment during the semester in which the degree is to be conferred.  CONTINUOUS ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENT Fontbonne University requires a reasonable degree of continuity in attendance at Fontbonne for all students. The university reserves the right to establish time limits on degree programs and courses. Fontbonne may invoke more recent degree and/or other requirements, such as:  If considerable time has elapsed since the student achieved degree-seeking status.   If the degree requirements have changed substantially since the student began the program.  If the student leaves the university without an approved leave of absence and re-enters at a later date, the student must follow all requirements stipulated in the catalog in effect at the time of re-entry.  WAIVER/MODIFICATION OF DEGREE REQUIREMENTS A student may request a waiver or a modification of a degree requirement. The waiver/degree modification form must be obtained from the registrar’s office and be completed, providing a clear rationale as to why the requirement should be waived or modified.

A student must successfully complete, at Fontbonne University, all certificate requirements.  COLLEGE/DEPARTMENTAL AND MAJOR REQUIREMENTS An individual college or department may establish requirements (beyond general education and other institutional/graduation requirements) for students whose majors are in that unit. A college or department reserves the right to interpret requirements if questions arise. It is the student’s responsibility to know, understand, and fulfill the requirements of the major.  An academic department defines and administers the requirements for the majors, minors, concentrations, and certificate programs within that department.   A student must earn a minimum grade of C- in each course required for the major, minor, concentration, or certificate.  DOUBLE MAJORS Since many Fontbonne major programs provide an opportunity for a student to choose electives, a student may work simultaneously toward majors in two different areas or disciplines. Both majors must lead to the same degree. The student must fulfill all requirements for both majors in addition to specific degree and graduation requirements.  A student who wishes to pursue two majors leading to different degrees (e.g., BA and BS) must take the additional 24 credit hours required for dual baccalaureate degrees. (See dual baccalaureate degree requirements above.)  DUAL UNDERGRADUATE/GRADUATE ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS A Fontbonne undergraduate student may be eligible to earn graduate academic credit for graduate level courses with permission from the department that is offering the graduate course.  To be eligible for dual enrollment, a Fontbonne undergraduate student must be classified as a senior (a minimum of 90 credit hours earned) and have a minimum Fontbonne University Page 50  2018-2019 Catalog cumulative grade point average of 3.0. Enrollment in graduate courses must be approved by the graduate program director, since preference is given to students enrolled in the graduate program.  Graduate credit hours may not be used toward the 120 hour requirement for an undergraduate degree. However, a maximum of nine graduate credit hours taken during dual enrollment may be applied to the total credit hours required for the master’s degree.  UNDERGRADUATE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS Undergraduate certificate programs are designed for undergraduate students and for individuals who have completed a baccalaureate degree but are not enrolled in a graduate program. A certificate is defined a narrowly defined set of disciplinary or interdisciplinary classes that constitutes a discrete body of knowledge as determined by the department(s) in which the certificate is housed.  Requirements for the completion of a certificate: 1. A student must earn a minimum grade of C- in each course required for the certificate. 2. Completion at Fontbonne of a minimum of 50 percent of the credit hours required for the certificate, culminating in a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. An individual department may establish a higher cumulative grade point average for a specific certificate program. 3. Courses that fulfill the requirements for a certificate may also be used to fulfill major requirements, but may not be used to fulfill requirements for a minor, concentration, or another certificate.  Fontbonne policies and regulations apply to certificate-seeking students.  ADMISSION FOR POST-BACCALAUREATE CERTIFICATION ONLY (MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SECONDARY EDUCATION/COUNCIL OF ACCREDITATION OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS) OR VERIFICATION ONLY (ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS) An applicant who already holds a bachelor’s degree may desire admission to pursue post-baccalaureate teacher certification (see the department of education/special education in the graduate program section in this catalog and the teacher certification at Fontbonne University section immediately following the graduate program section in this catalog for information regarding programs which combine teacher certification with an advanced degree) or to meet the minimum academic requirements for receipt of a Verification Statement by the Accreditation Council for the Education of Nutrition and Dietetics, the accrediting agency for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. See the admission section of undergraduate information in this catalog for admission requirements.  Admission as a candidate for pursuit of teacher certification or for completion of dietetic verification requirements is dependent upon the approval of the respective department. The department in which the student wishes to study will determine which courses from the first bachelor’s degree will be accepted toward fulfillment of the certification or verification requirements. The student is exempt from taking the placement test, from completing the Fontbonne general education requirements, and from the graduation requirement of a religion or theology course. The student must complete a minimum residency requirement of 24 credit hours at Fontbonne University. Students interested in receiving a Verification Statement in dietetics must also successfully complete a portfolio.  A student contemplating either teacher certification or dietetic verification should check with an advisor regarding the various master’s degree programs at Fontbonne University which might be of added value.  Full information on teacher certification may be found in the section titled Teacher Certification at Fontbonne  University following the graduate programs’ section in this catalog. This includes policies and procedures for students in teacher certification programs, acceptance into the teacher certification program, and final assessment information in teacher certification at Fontbonne University.  AUTHORIZATION FOR STUDY AT ANOTHER INSTITUTION A student seeking approval to study at another institution while a student at Fontbonne University must complete the authorization for study at another institution form which may be obtained from the office of the registrar or at:  https://www.fontbonne.edu/academics/academic-resources/registrar/  POLICIES RELATED TO TRANSFER CREDIT AFTER ENTERING FONTBONNE UNIVERSITY 1.

Undergraduate Student Classifications Degree-seeking: A student pursuing a degree Unclassified: A student not pursuing a degree Full-time: A student who carries 12 or more credit hours per semester Part-time: A student who carries fewer than 12 credit hours per semester  Class Status First-year: Fewer than 30 credit hours earned Sophomore: 30 to 59 credit hours earned Junior: 60 to 89 credit hours earned Senior: 90 or more credit hours earned  COURSE NUMBERING GUIDELINES First-year and sophomore level courses are designated by 100 and 200 course numbers and generally have no prerequisite. These courses are typically introductory to a discipline or subject and focus on general elements or principles. The 200-level courses may build on prior knowledge or skills in 100-level courses, be a second course in a sequence, and/or be an introduction to sub-disciplines or to special topics. These courses are concerned with knowledge and comprehension and may or may not have a prerequisite.  Junior and senior level courses are designated by 300 and 400 course numbers and usually have prerequisites. The 300-level courses focus on specialized content or skills, are the intermediate link between general introductory content and advanced content, and may be the third in a sequence of courses. The 400-level courses provide in-depth content, a synthesis or application of prior courses, may be the fourth course in a sequence, and include capstone, internship, and student teaching courses. These courses are concerned with application, analysis, and synthesis.    Ordinarily, a first-year student may not take courses at the 300 or 400 level.  DECLARING MAJOR APPROVAL A student is not officially accepted into a major until the student has declared a major and completed the major approval process.  A first-year student must obtain major approval during the spring semester of the sophomore year, that is, after completion of 45 credit hours at Fontbonne. A transfer student or a student seeking a second degree must also declare a major and obtain major approval. Ordinarily, this is done after completing the equivalent of one full-time semester (a minimum of 12 credits) at Fontbonne.  A student pursuing two majors must declare both majors and obtain major approval from the college dean/department chair of each major in order to assure proper advising.  The student must complete an application for major approval form (available in the registrar’s office) and obtain the required signatures. To receive and continue major approval the student must be in good standing and meet and maintain the college/department requirements for the major through degree completion. A college or department may choose to add acquisition of major approval as a prerequisite for a specific upper division course.  A student who does not meet or maintain the requirements for major approval may be accepted into the major or remain in the major with qualifications that must be met within a designated period of time as specified by the department chair and the college dean; or be designated by Fontbonne University Page 52  2018-2019 Catalog the department chair and the college dean as ineligible to complete the respective major requirements.  No department is obligated to approve a request for major approval merely because a student has accumulated the specified minimum number of credit hours in that area.  CHANGE OF MAJOR/CONCENTRATION/ MINOR/CERTIFICATION A student who wishes to change his or her major, concentration, minor, or certification must obtain a change of major/concentration/minor/certification form from the office of the registrar and complete the form in its entirety. The registrar’s office will notify the former advisor to forward the student’s file to the new advisor if a change of advisor occurs.  When changing a major, concentration, minor, or certification a student may be required to use the current catalog if different from the catalog in effect at the time of the student’s initial matriculation.  PRE-REGISTRATION/REGISTRATION PROCEDURES Each fall and spring semester Fontbonne schedules two weeks for pre-registration (including academic advising) and web-registration for returning students. The scheduled dates are listed in each semester course schedule. Before being able to register, a student must be advised and obtain registration clearance. The scheduled times and dates for summer registration are listed in the spring and summer course schedules.  Change in Registration Any change in registration, including withdrawal from a course, must:  Be made on the change of registration (drop/add) form available in the registrar’s office;  Include a supportive reason for the change;  Be approved and signed by the academic advisor, the business office, the financial aid office, and, if applicable, by the Office of Academic Affairs; and  Be returned to the registrar’s office before the deadline specified in the semester course schedule.  EARLY PROGRESS REPORT At the fifth week of every fall and spring semester, instructors report students’ unsatisfactory academic progress to the registrar’s office. The registrar’s office will notify instructors that early progress reports must be submitted via the web one week prior to the mid-semester date for students who show unsatisfactory academic progress. The names of students who have one or more unsatisfactory reports will be sent to the office of academic advising and to the student’s academic advisor for intervention. This policy assumes that instructors will give and grade at least one substantial assignment or multiple smaller assignments prior to the mid-semester date of each semester. Providing early feedback on student progress facilitates student success.  EXAMINATIONS Examinations are given at the discretion of the instructor. Ordinarily each instructor determines the value and importance of the final examination depending on the nature of the course and its objectives.  The final exam, whether unit or comprehensive, must be given at the time scheduled by the registrar’s office. If an instructor chooses not to give an exam, the scheduled exam time must be used for a class meeting. A student who has more than three exams on a given day should work with the instructors to petition for one to be moved to another day.  It is the responsibility of the instructor to determine whether a student may make up missed tests or examinations.  GRADING AND EVALUATION At the first class period of each semester/term, the instructor will inform the students of the factors taken into consideration for grading. Methods of grading and evaluations must be included in the course syllabus. Fontbonne University Page 53  2018-2019 Catalog Grade Definitions for Undergraduate Courses  Grades   Interpretation   Comments A, A-  Excellent Applies to all courses B+, B, B-   Good Applies to all courses C+, C, C-   Satisfactory Applies to all courses D  Poor Applies to all courses F  Failure Applies to all courses—used when a student earns a failing grade P  Pass Applies to courses selected for the P/NP option; pass is defined as a grade of D or better   NP  No Pass Applies to courses selected for the P/NP option; NP is assigned when a student fails.  No credit is earned.  W   Withdrawal Applies when a student, with proper authorization, withdraws from a course by a specified date WI Involuntary withdrawal Applies when a student who does not officially withdraw is withdrawn by the office of the registrar X Deferred grade   Applies when institutional circumstances prevent awarding a grade in a timely manner AU     Audit Applies when a student takes a course for no credit; not available for all courses NA   Never attend Student never attended; no authorized withdrawal; no basis for evaluation AF Failure due to absence Applies when a student fails a course due to lack of satisfactory attendance. Faculty will provide a last date of academic activity when assigning this grade.  GRADES AND QUALITY POINTS To express the quality of a student’s work in numerical form, letter grades are translated into quality points. Each grade carries a specific number of quality points. Fontbonne uses the following grades/quality points:  Grade       Quality Points   A  4.0  A-  3.7  B+    3.3  B      3.0  B-  2.7 C+    2.3 C  2.0 C-     1.7 D      1.0 F  0.0 AF  0.0   Grade Point Average The grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the quality points earned by the credit hours attempted. The grade point average is figured on the basis of credit hours attempted, not credit hours passed. Grades of pass (P) and no pass (NP) and the incomplete (I) designation do not carry quality points and are not computed in the GPA.  Pass/No Pass (P/NP) Grading Option A student who has a minimum of 30 credit hours may choose the pass/no pass (P/NP) grading option for selected courses, not to exceed six courses. This policy allows a student the opportunity to explore unfamiliar discipline areas. A student may not choose the P/NP grading option in courses required for the major, minor, concentration, or certificate unless the student first obtains approval from the department chair and college dean.   In some cases such as practicums and internships, Fontbonne may require P/NP grading for all the students in the course. When the university requires P/NP grading in a course, this course does not count as part of the six courses which a student may choose to take for a P/NP.    A course taken for P/NP cannot meet a general education requirement or the religion/theology requirement for graduation.  Fontbonne University accepts grades of pass (P), in transfer, as elective credits, not to exceed six courses.  Incomplete (I) If a student is earning a passing grade in a course, but does not complete the requirements of the course in a timely manner due to an extenuating circumstance beyond the student’s control (e.g., serious illness) that occurs within the last two or three weeks of the semester, the student may request an incomplete (I) for the course. The student must obtain the request for an incomplete (I) form from Fontbonne University Page 54  2018-2019 Catalog the registrar’s office, complete the form with the instructor, and obtain all of the required signatures before submitting the form to the registrar’s office.  An incomplete (I) will become an F if the procedures on the application form for an (I) are not followed. In extenuating circumstances, the chair may approve an extension of the incomplete, but not beyond two months.  Deferred Grade (X) If, for some reason, the grade from a particular course cannot be reported to the registrar’s office in time for the semester report, the student will receive a deferred (X) designation. As soon as the instructor completes the change of grade form, the grade will be recorded on the student’s transcript.  Grade Change Once a semester is over, a grade may not be changed because a student submits additional work or submits work that was due during the semester.  A grade change should occur only under one of the following three conditions:  1. To convert an incomplete (I) to a letter grade. The required change of grade form, available in the office of the registrar, must be completed by the instructor according to the date listed in the semester course schedule. (See incomplete above.) 2. To convert a deferred grade (X) to a letter grade. The required change of grade form, available in the office of the registrar, must be completed by the instructor as soon as possible, generally within one week after grades are due. (See deferred grade above.) 3. To correct an incorrect grade awarded due to an instructor’s calculation or recording error. The required change of grade form, available in the office of the registrar, must be completed by the instructor by the end of first two weeks of the following semester.  REPEATED COURSES An undergraduate student may choose to repeat a maximum of two courses in which the student has received a grade of C-, C, or C+.  A student who earns a D or F grade in a course may be required to repeat the course as determined by requirements established by a specific academic department. The department chairperson will decide if or when a course from another institution may be used in lieu of a course repeated at Fontbonne.   If, upon repeating the course, the student makes a D or F grade when a higher grade is required, to take the course a third time at Fontbonne or at another institution, the student must obtain the written approval from each of the following: the advisor, department chairperson and dean overseeing the student’s major, the department chairperson and dean overseeing the course in question.  Both the original and the repeated course grades will appear on the transcript. Only the higher grade will be calculated in the GPA; the total credits earned will be incremented only once.  Note: Repeating a course may affect a student’s eligibility for federal financial aid.  AUDITING A COURSE Auditing a course allows a student, for a fee, to participate in all the classroom activities of the course. Ordinarily a student auditing a course does not take tests and complete assignments unless the instructor specifies otherwise. The student accrues no credit for an audited course. The audit designation of AU will be listed on the student’s transcript. Generally courses with studio or laboratory classes are not available for audit. Tuition and/or fees for auditing a course are available in the undergraduate expenses section in this catalog and in the semester course schedules.  Students auditing a course are expected to attend classes per the instructor’s attendance and tardiness policies and maintain a respectful demeanor in the classroom. An auditing student may be withdrawn by the instructor at any time in the semester if the auditing student fails to meet these expectations.  CLASS ATTENDANCE Responsibility for attendance at class rests on the individual student. Fontbonne University expects regular attendance. Faculty who use regular attendance as part of the course requirements for evaluation purposes will notify the students of the policy in writing on the course syllabus distributed at the beginning of the course.  Each instructor is expected to give reasonable consideration to the feasibility of make-up work. Students are directly responsible to instructors for class attendance and for work missed during an absence for any cause.  If a student stops attending a class without officially withdrawing from the course by completing a change in registration (drop/add) form obtained from the registrar’s office, the student will receive a grade of AF for the course. Faculty members are responsible for reporting the last date of academic activity when assigning a grade of AF.   Fontbonne University Page 55  2018-2019 Catalog CLASS ATTENDANCE – EIGHT-WEEK COURSES A student athlete is not allowed to register for an eight-week face-to-face course during the season of the student’s sport without the written consent of the athletic director and the faculty athletic advisor.  FACULTY UNANNOUNCED ABSENCE/LATENESS FOR CLASS An instructor is encouraged to note the following policy on the course syllabus:  For courses which meet two or more times per week, students must wait a minimum of 15 minutes before leaving a class for which the instructor has not arrived.  For courses which meet only once per week, students must wait a minimum of 30 minutes before leaving a class for which the instructor has not arrived.  One student in the class will assume responsibility for starting a dated attendance record for student signatures and for seeing that the attendance record is submitted to the registrar’s office immediately following the students’ leaving the classroom.  LEAVE OF ABSENCE An undergraduate degree-seeking student who has a pre-determined need to leave Fontbonne for one or two semesters (not including summer session) with the expectation to return may request a leave of absence.   The student must complete a request for leave of absence form obtained from the registrar’s office.   The student with an approved leave of absence may return under the same catalog and general education requirements in effect at the time of the initial matriculation. If the student’s program curriculum has changed due to an accrediting/approval agency mandate, the student must follow the new requirements. To re-enter Fontbonne, the student may go directly to the registrar’s office for a change of status and registration materials, beginning at the time of pre-registration. The student must see an advisor and obtain the advisor’s signature and web clearance to be eligible to register.  WITHDRAWALS Withdrawal from a Course A student who, with proper authorization, withdraws from a course (see changes in registration under the registration procedures in this section) before the date specified in the semester course schedule receives a designation of W. A student who stops attending at some point after the third week of class does not complete the authorized withdrawal process receives a grade of AF.  A student may not request a withdrawal after the date specified in the semester course schedule. However, a student with appropriate and verifiable documentation may request, from Office of Academic Affairs, an exception to this policy. (See Withdrawal for an Extenuating Circumstance below.)   For financial aid purposes, the instructor must be able to provide the last date of attendance when a student stops attending or petitions to withdraw from a course.  Note: A student should be aware that failure to attend class does not constitute a withdrawal and may affect the student’s federal financial aid status. A student must notify the financial aid office, business office, and registrar’s office immediately upon the student’s decision to stop attending a course.  Involuntary Withdrawal for  Non-attendance A student who registers for a course and never attends the course will be withdrawn from the course ordinarily after the third week of classes. The registrar’s office will notify the student in writing of non-attendance; the student will have one week to respond by either immediately attending the course or immediately withdrawing from the course.   Failure to officially withdraw from the course will result in the student receiving an involuntary withdrawal (WI). A student receiving a WI will be responsible for any incurred costs.   A student who receives a student refund must return the refund to Fontbonne University.  An involuntary withdrawal will result in a change in a student’s registration. Based on federal financial aid regulations, this may require a recalculation of the student’s financial aid package and adjustments to the student’s aid award. These adjustments may result in aid being removed from the student’s award and a balance due on the student’s account.  Withdrawal for an Extenuating Circumstance A student may request to withdraw from Fontbonne University at any time throughout a session of enrollment (fall, spring, summer) for an extenuating circumstance.  An extenuating circumstance is an unexpected or unusual situation beyond a student’s control which makes it impossible for the student to complete his or her coursework during the enrollment term. Personal or immediate-family medical or non-medical issues, financial problems, trauma, and military deployment are examples of extenuating circumstances.  Fontbonne University Page 56  2018-2019 Catalog An undergraduate student must obtain information, procedures, and forms concerning a withdrawal for an extenuating circumstance from the Office of Academic Affairs. Students seeking withdrawal for extenuating circumstances must initiate the process on or before the last day of regular courses, before the final exam period begins. At the latest, the withdrawal procedures must be completed and all documentation submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs within 30 business days following the last date of exams for that enrollment session.  Official Withdrawal from the University A student who wishes to withdraw from all courses must go through the Withdrawal Process. Students must first visit the Registrar’s website where they will find all student forms. Click on the link for Withdrawal Process to find the withdrawal survey which begins the process. At the end of the survey students are directed to the Withdrawal Form which must be completed with all the necessary signatures. The form must be turned in to the Registrar’s Office before the last day to withdraw from the semester.  The purpose of completing an official withdrawal form is to ensure that the student receives a withdrawal (W) from the courses rather than an F and that all financial arrangements and required loan exit interviews are complete.  A student who withdraws from courses within the first 50 percent of the fall or spring term may be entitled to some refund. The refund policy and the complete schedule of percentages of refund are published in each semester course schedule.  PROBATIONARY STATUS AND DISMISSALS The Undergraduate Academic Committee reviews the academic status of all full and part-time degree seeking students at the end of the fall and spring semesters. Each undergraduate student must maintain a minimum Fontbonne (FBU) cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 to remain in good standing at Fontbonne. The University reserves the right to assign Probation status of Dis miss students who do not maintain the minimum academic standards.  Probationary Status Probation is defined as an FBU cumulative GPA lower than 2.00 on the semester immediately following a semester in good standing. Continuing Probation (CP) is defined as the semester GPA greater than or equal to 2.00 immediately following the Probation semester, yet the cumulative GPA remains lower than 2.00.  The University reserves the right to require mandatory academic support activities, including a maximum course load and/or specific courses, when a student is on Probation or CP. Students on Probation (first-time probation) are automatically enrolled in a one credit hour course,  Developmental Psychology (3 credits)  Developmental Psychology (3 credits)  Developmental Psychology (3 credits)  Developmental Psychology (3 credits) A study of the nature of human development across the life span.

Students graduating with a focus in deaf education are not certified to teach. Students graduating with a focus in speech-language pathology might meet Missouri requirements for certification as a Speech-Language Pathology Assistant (SLPA) depending on which electives are completed.  Major requirements include:  Residency, Major, General Education, and Graduation Requirements as described in the Fontbonne University Catalog.    A minimum GPA of 2.0 in the major is required for graduation.  A minimum of 19 hours of course work in the area of emphasis, 15 hours of electives as defined by the CDDE Department, and a capstone experience.

INT 104,", Strategies for Self-Directed Learning. A student who is on Probation or CP is also required to repeat failed courses (if available) in the semester of Probation or CP status. A student who is on Probation or CP is ineligible to participate on a sports team, or to hold a leadership position as president, vice-president, secretary or treasurer in a student organization, association or club.  Academic Dismissal Students earning an FBU cumulative GPA below 1.00 will be dismissed for academic deficiencies without first being placed on Probation. Dismissal letters will include a process for guiding the student during the appeal process.  Students whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.00 after returning to Good Standing will be dismissed. Student on CP failing to earn a cumulative GPA of 2.00 after two semesters of CP will be dismissed. A student who is dismissed may appeal the decision by sending a letter of appeal to the Office of Academic Affairs within the timeline of the dismissal letter. The dismissed student may apply for readmission to Fontbonne University one full calendar year after dismissal. The student must apply to the Office of Admission for readmission consideration by the Undergraduate Academic Committee. Students who have been dismissed, appealed, and readmitted to the university twice may not appeal a third dismissal.  Probationary Status and Dismissals in Intensive English Program Students in the Intensive English Program (IEP) must achieve a grade of PASS in each class to be considered to be in good standing.  If a student achieves a grade of NOT PASS in a class, the student is allowed to repeat the class. If the student receives a grade of NOT PASS a second time for the same class, the student will be is reviewed by the IEP academic review committee. The committee reviews the student’s entire academic record in the IEP Program. Upon review, if the committee determines that the student’s NOT PASS grade is due to a lack of attendance or failure to do the required work, the student is dismissed. If it is determined that the student’s grade is not due to lack of attendance and/or failure to do the required work, the student may be allowed to enroll in the class a third time. If after enrolling in the class a third time, the student does not achieve a grade of PASS, the student will be dismissed from the Intensive English Program and the university. Fontbonne University Page 57  2018-2019 Catalog  The academic status of students in the ESL Program is subject to review by the undergraduate academic committee at the end of the fall and spring semester, and is subject to the same policies as are all degree-seeking students. (See the university’s policies on probationary status and dismissals in the academic policies and regulations section of this catalog).   Non-Academic Dismissal A student may be dismissed at any time from Fontbonne University for a variety of non-academic offenses. These include, but are not limited to, behavior or attitudes unworthy of a good campus citizen, an unsatisfactory financial record, or violation of any policy of Fontbonne University. For further information, refer to the Griffin Scratch Student Handbook.  ACADEMIC APPEALS PROCESS An undergraduate student, who wishes to petition the academic appeals committee for a hearing for a final grade appeal or for a hearing for an academic matter other than a final grade, must consult with Office of Academic Affairs which will provide the student with a copy of the academic appeal policy, procedures, and timelines.  The academic appeals committee, comprised of five elected faculty members and eight students selected by the office of academic affairs in consultation with department chairs, serves to offer a fair hearing to the student. Three faculty and three undergraduate students are selected from the committee to serve with the committee chair at any hearing.  Appeals ordinarily are not heard in the summer session.  Academic Appeal Regarding Matters Other Than Grades If an undergraduate student wishes to appeal an academic issue other than a recorded final grade, the student must consult with the Office of Academic Affairs as to the appropriate process to follow as it relates to the appeal issue. Within one calendar week following this consultation the student must provide a formal letter of appeal to the Office of Academic Affairs, which will then direct the letter to the appropriate individual/committee for resolution.  Final Grade Appeal If an undergraduate student wishes to challenge a recorded final grade, the student must begin the appeal process no later than three weeks into the next fall or spring semester.  Students should attempt to resolve a grade complaint in conversation with the professor before beginning a formal appeal.  If the matter cannot be resolved, the student should begin the appeals process, as described below.    The appeal process begins as the student must put into writing the reasons he or she believes the grade is incorrect. The student must then provide this rationale to the instructor of the course.  If the instructor changes the grade to the student’s satisfaction, the process ends there.  If the instructor does not agree, then the instructor will put into writing his or her explanation for the grade.  If the student chooses to continue the appeal, he or she will bring the written documentation of the student and instructor to the department chair.  If the department chair changes the grade to the student’s satisfaction, the process ends there.  If the department chair does not agree, then the department chair will also put into writing his or her explanation for the denial.  If the student wishes to continue the appeal, he or she will then bring all the written materials collected thus far to the dean of the college in which the course is offered.  If the dean changes the grade to the student’s satisfaction, the process ends there.  If the dean does not agree with the student, he or she will put into writing his or her reasons for the denial.  If the student chooses to continue the appeal, he or she should then bring all the existing written documentation—from the student, the instructor, the chair, and the dean—to the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs.  The Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs will then convene the Academic Appeals committee.  The Academic Appeals committee will consider the student appeal at its next scheduled meeting.  The Appeals committee normally meets once per semester.  If the Appeals committee finds against the student, the decision is final.  People at each level of responsibility in the appeal are expected to respond in a timely manner—normally within a week.  READMISSION WITH A NEW START  A returning Fontbonne undergraduate degree-seeking student may petition to participate in the New Start program with the following stipulations:  The student has not been enrolled for five consecutive years at Fontbonne University.  The student may petition for the New Start program after returning to Fontbonne and completing 12 consecutive credit hours with a minimum grade of C- in each course and a 2.0 GPA.  Previous credits and grades from a maximum of six courses with grades of D and/or F may be removed from the grade point average, but not from the transcript.  All previous courses and grades will remain on the transcript. Previous grades of C- or better will count in the grade point average and the credits will be carried forward.  The grade point average will be recalculated. Fontbonne University Page 58  2018-2019 Catalog  The transcript will indicate New Start.  The student participating in the New Start program is ineligible for Latin honors at graduation. (See Latin  honors in this section of the catalog.)  To petition to participate in the New Start program, a student must obtain a new start program petition form from the registrar’s office, complete the form, and return it to the registrar’s office.  THE DEAN’S LIST The dean’s list is published at the end of fall and spring semesters. To be considered for the dean’s list a student must:  be a full-time undergraduate student earning a bachelor’s degree.  earn a minimum of 12 undergraduate credit hours in the semester. (The grades for courses that end after the last official day of the semester will not be calculated for consideration for the dean’s list.) Since P, NP, and I grades are not computed in the GPA, any credit hours graded P, NP, or I will not count toward the required minimum of 12 credit hours. However, students who successfully complete required courses that are offered only on a P/NP basis and who have completed at least six graded credits are eligible.  achieve a semester GPA of 3.7 or above.  LATIN HONORS A Fontbonne undergraduate student who is seeking a first baccalaureate degree may earn Latin honors which are conferred at graduation. Latin honors reflect the academic excellence of all of the undergraduate coursework taken in preparation for the undergraduate degree.  To calculate Latin honors, Fontbonne uses the grades for all courses taken at other colleges and universities, as well as all courses taken at Fontbonne.   Latin Honors will be calculated for the May commencement ceremony based on the GPA at the end of the previous semester and will be considered provisional until all grades are received and it is ascertained that all graduation requirements have been met.  The correct Honors category will be noted on the student’s diploma and transcript based on the final GPA calculation.  All transcripts/grades to be considered for the calculation of Latin honors, including any outstanding grades, must be received in the registrar’s office no later than September 30 for the December graduation, January 31 for the May graduation, and May 31 for the August graduation. Latin honors are as follows: Cum laude: 3.7 to 3.79 cumulative grade point average Magna cum laude: 3.8 to 3.89 cumulative grade point  average Summa cum laude: 3.9 or above cumulative grade point average  DEAN’S AWARD FOR ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE The Dean’s Award is presented to graduating seniors who achieve a Fontbonne cumulative grade point average of 3.7 or above on a minimum of 60 credit hours taken at Fontbonne. A Dean’s Award recipient is not eligible for Latin honors due to transfer coursework which results in a combined cumulative grade point average below 3.7.  HONORS CONVOCATION Each spring the university recognizes outstanding students in various categories, such as academic department/program honors and awards, honors program awards, honor society awards, and Latin honors. This recognition is publicly acknowledged at the honors convocation.  APPLICATION FOR DEGREE All students who wish to apply for a degree to be conferred must file their applications in the registrar’s office by August 1 for December conferral of degree, December 1 for May conferral of degree, and May 1 for August conferral of degree.  Commencement ceremonies are held in May.  COMMENCEMENT/CONFERRING OF DEGREES Fontbonne University confers bachelors’ and masters’ degrees at the annual commencement ceremony in May.  Undergraduate students with nine or fewer hours left to complete their degree and who have enrolled in those courses necessary to complete the degree by the August conferral date are allowed to participate in commencement the May preceding their August completion.  All graduate students who will complete their degree in August and who have enrolled in the courses required to do so are eligible for participation in the commencement ceremony the May preceding their August completion.  All other students who wish to participate in commencement before completing all requirements may direct an appeal to walk in the commencement ceremony to the Office of Academic Affairs. Students may only participate in one commencement ceremony.    RECORD OF WORK AND TRANSCRIPTS A student receives a semester grade report online after the close of each semester, and can access unofficial copies of their transcript through the student portal.  A student may Fontbonne University Page 59  2018-2019 Catalog request official copies of the transcript for a fee. Additional information can be found at www.fontbonne.edu/transcripts.    To protect the right to privacy of a student, a student must make a written request for transcripts. A request should be submitted at least one week in advance of the time the transcript is needed. Fontbonne will not issue any transcripts until all indebtedness to the university has been settled in full.  To be considered an official transcript, a transcript must include the institution’s seal and be either received directly from another institution or sent directly to another institution.  Fontbonne will not release official transcripts from other institutions filed for the purpose of admission to Fontbonne. These become the property of Fontbonne University.  ACADEMIC INTEGRITY/HONESTY According to its mission, Fontbonne University is committed to graduating students who are prepared to think critically, to act ethically, and to assume responsibility as citizens and leaders. Fontbonne University expects the highest standards of integrity from its students.  A violation of academic integrity includes, but is not limited to, any act of cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, dissimulation, and any act of aiding and abetting academic dishonesty. In cases where academic integrity is in question, the following definitions and policies will apply.  Cheating is a purposeful deception in the preparation and/or submission of papers and assignments and the taking of exams, tests, or quizzes.  Plagiarism is the representation of the words and ideas of another as one’s own in any academic exercise. Plagiarism includes failing to give a citation for using work from another person or source. Modifications and rephrasing do not reduce the requirement for giving a citation. This also applies to information obtained electronically, such as from the Internet.  Fabrication is the deliberate falsification or invention of any information or citation in any academic exercise, such as making up a source, giving an incorrect citation, misquoting a source.  Dissimulation is the disguising or altering of one’s own actions with the intent to deceive another about the real  nature of one’s actions concerning an academic exercise.  Examples include fabricating excuses for such things as missing classes, postponing tests, handing in late papers, turning in a paper for one class that was originally written for another class (when original work is requested).  Individual instructors will set specific policies regarding academic integrity. In general, students may expect to receive a zero (0) on any assignment, exam, test, or quiz and perhaps fail a course when a violation of academic integrity has occurred.  Broader violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to:   Abuse of resources is the damaging of any resource material or inappropriately limiting access to resource material that is necessary for academic work. Abuse includes hiding library materials; removing non-circulating material from the library; hiding or stealing another person’s textbook, notes, or software; failure to return library materials when requested.  Forgery of academic documents is the unauthorized changing or construction of any academic document, such as changing transcripts, changing grade books, changing grades on papers which have been returned, or forging signatures. Other examples include completion of an application for any academic program that omits or falsifies any requested information. Such violations can result in the revocation of the application even if approval was previously granted on the basis of fabricated information.  Sabotage is the damaging or impeding of the academic work of another student. Sabotage includes ruining another student’s lab work; destroying another student’s term paper.  Aiding and abetting academic dishonesty is knowingly facilitating any act defined above.  Violations of academic integrity have a broad impact on the university and will result in university review and action. Faculty who observe violations of academic integrity are asked to report all violations to the office of academic affairs where records of violations will be maintained for five years. University review and action may include tutorials on the appropriate use of materials, academic probation, or expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. All procedures for disciplinary action are detailed in the Griffin Scratch and Fontbonne policy manuals.    ASSESSMENT To ensure the continuing quality of a Fontbonne degree, the university regularly collects data on academic Fontbonne University Page 60  2018-2019 Catalog programs, advising, student activities, and campus climate. Examples include course evaluations and advising evaluations which all students are expected to complete.  Student participation in periodic assessment, such as surveys and achievement tests, is expected and may be required for graduation. Because of the random sampling methods used to identify participants, not all students will be required to participate in the same assessment activities. Along with formal assessments, student work samples from individual classes may also be collected to provide authentic artifacts for internal and external program review.  The assessment program is designed to assist faculty, staff, and administrators in improving student learning, as well as the delivery of all campus services. Academic programs and student services are reviewed and revised based on a regular analysis of the data obtained from the assessment process. In this way, both the individual student and the institution benefit from assessment. Fontbonne University Page 61  2018-2019 Catalog   College of Arts and Sciences   DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT OF FINE ARTS DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, AND RELIGION DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM   Dr. Adam G.

In each of these programs, students learn essential analytical, critical thinking, problem solving, research, and communication skills.   Psychology currently ranks as the second most popular undergraduate major in the United States. The discipline of psychology embraces all aspects of the human experience – from individual brain functions to the actions of social groups within society. The understanding of behavior, thoughts, and emotions is the scientific enterprise of psychologists.    Students in the psychology program take classes on a variety of topics such as developmental, social, cognitive, and abnormal psychology in order to gain a broad and well-rounded understanding of the field. They also use the scientific method to answer empirical questions, design research projects, and collect data in an effort to better understand and improve the human condition.   Psychology is well-suited for students who are interested in applying scientific methods to enhance understanding of human behavior, emotion, and cognition. While many of our graduates enter careers or graduate programs within the field of psychology, the major also provides a marketable educational foundation for students who plan to pursue careers in education, research, human resources, advertising, marketing, as well as political, medical, or legal professions.   The applied behavioral sciences major is designed to provide introductory knowledge and training in the discipline of psychology along with select courses in related fields.  Foundational courses are supplemented with additional coursework in applied fields related to the behavioral sciences such as communication studies, social work, counseling, sociology, the health sciences, and/ or business.   Elective courses are chosen individually by students, with guidance from their faculty advisors, in areas that will broaden their knowledge and skill sets in the behavioral sciences and better prepare them for the specific careers they plan to pursue upon graduation.   The applied behavioral sciences degree program is well suited for students who have multidisciplinary interests and who plan to pursue careers rather than graduate programs after completing their degree.   FACULTY Laurel C. Newman, associate professor of psychology and chairperson of the department of behavioral sciences Jessica M. Blaxton, assistant professor of psychology Jason R. Finley, assistant professor of psychology     Fontbonne University Page 63  2018-2019 Catalog MAJOR IN PSYCHOLOGY The psychology curriculum provides students with a broad and balanced foundation in each of the core areas of the discipline. Students will study various aspects of the human psychological experience, including lifespan development; learning, memory, and cognition; biological foundations of behavior; abnormal psychology; social psychology; and personality and adjustment. Students supplement these core courses with chosen electives on more specific topics such as child psychology, positive psychology, cross-cultural psychology, sleep, addictions, pre-occupational therapy, and controversial topics in the field. Students will also learn research, analytical, and writing skills through courses in statistics and research methods. During their senior year, students choose from various capstone options that allow them to apply what they have learned in the lab or the field. Additional learning opportunities for students include assisting with faculty research, completing supervised internships, conducting and participating in student research in the psychology laboratory, or exploring the field through independent study projects. Interested students also have the opportunity to present their own research at local and regional conferences.   Students are encouraged to enhance their major course of study by choosing a minor that emphasizes the intersection between psychology and related disciplines. Students work with their advisors to determine the best minor for their educational and career goals.   The psychology curriculum prepares students for employment at the baccalaureate level or advanced study in psychology and related disciplines upon graduation. The psychology program conforms to guidelines established by the American Psychological Association.  The major consists of 42 credit hours of courses. Students must have a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.3 on a 4.0 scale from all colleges/ universities attended as well as a GPA of 2.5 in psychology courses for acceptance into the major, to remain in the program, and for graduation.  Major Approval Major approval is required during the second semester of the sophomore year, or after the completion of 45 credit hours at Fontbonne. For transfer students, major approval is required after completing the equivalent of one full semester (a minimum of 12 credits) at Fontbonne.  Baccalaureate Degree and Residency Requirements All requirements for an undergraduate degree are listed under academic policies and regulations in the introductory section for undergraduate programs in this catalog. These requirements include a graduation requirement of at least one course in religion or theology.  General Education Requirements The 42 credit hours of general education requirements are presented in the academic information section in this catalog. A course that meets a general education requirement may also meet a course requirement in the major or a course requirement in another discipline.  Courses Required in the Major:   Strategies for Self-Directed Learning (1 credit) This independent study course is designed to provide students an opportunity to engage in deeper learning about what it means to be a successful collegiate learner. The course is focused on integrating academic skills, self-reflection, and use of appropriate support resources to help students achieve academic success.  "

In this case two or more departments and/or disciplines may collaborate to offer a program or to support a program designed primarily by the student (the university major) through interdisciplinary coursework.  The interdisciplinary studies program offers the university major.   Minors are available in American culture studies, women’s and gender studies, and university minor.  Specific interdisciplinary (INT) courses are offered on a regular basis, while others occur as a need arises (see each semester course schedule).  UNIVERSITY MAJOR Students with well-defined goals and interests which cut across several disciplines are encouraged to consider a university major. This major allows students to individualize a program of study that provides an exploration of diverse fields of study, the challenge of independent work, and possible off-campus experiences. The major may lead to a bachelor of arts (BA) degree or a bachelor of science (BS) degree.  Baccalaureate Degree and Residency Requirements All requirements for an undergraduate degree are listed under academic policies and regulations in the undergraduate introductory section in this catalog. These requirements include a graduation requirement of at least one course in religion or theology.  General Education Requirements The 42 credit hours of general education requirements (GER) are presented in the undergraduate academic information section in this catalog. A course that meets a general education requirement may also meet a course requirement for the major or a course requirement in another discipline.  Requirements for the  University Major A university major must have a clearly defined unifying principle. This principle must be either a special career goal (e.g., consumer affairs) not provided in an existing major or a special interest that crosses disciplinary lines (e.g., American studies).  The student pursuing a university major must complete no fewer than 60 credit hours and no more than 80 credit hours in the chosen disciplines. A minimum of 50 percent of the credit hours in the university major must be taken at Fontbonne. A minimum of 24 credit hours must be completed at the upper division level and must represent more than one discipline.  At the time of the submission of a proposal for a university major, the student must have a Fontbonne minimum cumulative grade point (GPA) average of 2.5 and must maintain this GPA through degree completion.  Procedures for Applying for a University Major A student interested in pursuing a university major must: 1.

Fontbonne University will not tolerate harassing conduct that:  creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working or academic environment.  affects tangible employment benefits.  interferes unreasonably with an individual’s working or academic environment or   performance.  This policy applies to complaints alleging harassment carried out by 1) University employees, 2) University students, and 3) third parties, in accordance with applicable law governing liability for third parties.  Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment involves any one or more of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other Sexual harassment involves any one or more of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct based on sex when:  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working or learning environment or unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work or academic performance.  Submission to such conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of an individual’s employment or academic activities.  Submission to rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or academic decisions affecting that individual.  Sexual harassment may include: unwanted sexual advances; explicit sexual propositions; displaying sexually suggestive objects; pictures or materials; sexual innuendo; sexually-oriented verbal abuse; sexually suggestive comments; unwanted contact such as touching, patting, stroking, pinching, or brushing against another’s body; sexually oriented kidding, teasing or practical jokes; jokes about gender specific traits; foul or obscene gestures or language; and physical acts of aggression, assault, or violence, regardless of whether these acts are being, or have been, investigated as criminal offenses by a law enforcement agency (such as rape, sexual assault or battery, and sexually motivated stalking) made against a person’s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent due to victim’s age, intellectual disability, or use of drugs or alcohol.    Sexual harassment also involves inappropriate conduct toward an individual which, although not motivated by sexual desire, would not have occurred except for that person’s gender.  Reporting Procedures All employees and students have the responsibility to assure that Fontbonne University’s non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies are effective.  Any University employee or student who experiences, observes, hears, or otherwise witnesses unlawful harassment or discrimination, or who receives a report of unlawful harassment or discrimination of which one or both is carried out by 1) University employees, 2) University students, or 3) third parties, in accordance with applicable law governing liability for third parties, must immediately notify either of the compliance coordinators identified above.  If a report of discrimination or harassment alleges involvement of the Vice President for Finance and Administration or the Director of the Kinkel Center for Academic Resources and Section 504 / ADA Coordinator, then the report of discrimination or harassment may be made to the Vice President for Academic Affairs.    No employee or student is required to confront the alleged harasser or report that person’s concern to the alleged harasser.  The University will thoroughly and promptly investigate all complaints and take corrective or disciplinary action when appropriate.    Likewise, the University will initiate a thorough investigation and take corrective or disciplinary action as appropriate against incidents of discrimination or harassment that come to the University’s attention, regardless of whether a formal complaint is made. Fontbonne University Page 317  2018-2019 Catalog Fontbonne University will investigate every harassment and discrimination complaint thoroughly, promptly and impartially and the parties will be given an opportunity to present witnesses and provide evidence.  Fontbonne University will evaluate all relevant information and documentation relating to a complaint of discrimination or harassment. All investigations shall be conducted in a sensitive manner and, to the extent feasible, confidentiality will be honored.  The investigation and all actions taken will be shared only with those who have a need to know.  The investigation findings will be documented, and the complaining individual and the alleged harasser will be kept advised of the progress of the investigation and of the University’s final determination.  If, after investigation, Fontbonne University determines that an employee or student has engaged in illegal discrimination or harassment, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge or dismissal, will be taken against the offending individual. Fontbonne University will take prompt steps to prevent recurrence of any harassment or discrimination and correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, as appropriate.  In addition, the University will take immediate steps to stop any retaliation and prevent its recurrence against the alleged victim and any person(s) associated with the alleged victim.   In the event that the complaint involves an employee of the University, a complaint of alleged discrimination or harassment may also coincide with a Grievance (see online policy manuals, Volume V, paragraph 5.8). At the discretion of the University Administration, separate investigations may be conducted, or the investigations may be merged. The University will not wait for the conclusion or outcome of a criminal investigation or proceeding to begin an investigation required by this grievance procedure.  Investigation Procedures Fontbonne University will provide a prompt, equitable resolution of complaints of discrimination by students, employees and beneficiaries of the University’s programs and activities.  LEVEL I - INFORMAL PROCEDURE Informal procedures are designed to work out a mutually agreeable solution to a problem and are completely optional and voluntary.  Any informal resolution activities will not delay the prompt, adequate, reliable and impartial investigation of the complaint of discrimination or harassment or interfere with the provision of immediate or interim actions, if necessary.    At the option of the complainant only, it may be possible to resolve a harassment or discrimination complaint through a voluntary conversation between the complainant and the alleged harasser or discriminator, which conversation is facilitated by a University designee appointed by the Vice President for Finance and Administration. If the complainant, the accused, and the University designee feel that a resolution has been achieved through this informal procedure, then no further action need be taken. Fontbonne University recognizes that a voluntary conversation between the complainant and the alleged harasser may not be appropriate for harassment complaints.   The results of any informal resolution shall be reported by the University designee in writing signed by the complainant and the accused, and submitted to the Vice President for Finance and Administration.  LEVEL II - FORMAL PROCEDURE The complainant shall submit a written and signed complaint with the Vice President for Finance and Administration which clearly states the particulars concerning each incident of harassment or discrimination, including:  the name and position of the accused  the nature of discrimination or harassment  the date(s) when the alleged harassment or discrimination occurred  the details of the alleged conduct including any information that would support the   complaint               the redress that is sought  In the absence of a written complaint, the University will investigate any notifications of discrimination or harassment that may come to its attention.  Such investigation will be considered a formal procedure. The Vice President for Finance and Administration shall inform the Vice President(s) in whose area the accused and accuser are employed of the complaint, or, in the case of students, shall inform the Vice President for Student Affairs  The Vice President for Finance and Administration will promptly investigate the complaint or will appoint a University designee to promptly investigate the complaint.  The complainant and the accused will each be interviewed.  The accused will then be furnished with a copy of the written complaint and will have an opportunity to respond in writing within ten (10) working days.  Within twenty (20) working days after the time the accused has to respond in writing to the written complaint, the Vice President for Finance and Administration (or University designee, if applicable), will prepare investigation findings and, if appropriate, determine any corrective or disciplinary action to be taken.  The Vice President for Finance and Administration will inform the appropriate Vice President or Dean of the findings of the investigation.  Both the accused and the complainant will be informed in writing of the findings of the investigation by the Vice President for Finance and Administration within three (3) working days of the preparation of findings and, if appropriate, determination of corrective or disciplinary action. Fontbonne University Page 318  2018-2019 Catalog Appeal Procedures Individuals requesting an appeal of the findings of an investigation of a harassment or discrimination complaint must appeal in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs within ten (10) days of being informed of the findings of the investigation.    If an individual requests an appeal, the appeal must be in writing, and, if applicable, it must cite any alleged procedural or substantive error that occurred during the investigation, if applicable, and provide an account of any new information that has become available since the investigation was conducted.  Within ten (10) days after receipt of the written appeal, the Vice President for Academic Affairs must meet with the complainant and with the alleged harasser or discriminator.  The written decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs shall be issued within five (5) days of the latter of these two meetings and shall be final and binding. If the underlying allegations involve the Vice President for Academic Affairs, then written request for appeal shall be made to another member of the President’s Cabinet.  Retaliation Prohibited Fontbonne University prohibits retaliation against any person who makes a complaint of discrimination or harassment, opposes discrimination or harassment, or testifies, assists or participates in an investigation proceeding or hearing relating to such discrimination or harassment.  Retaliation includes, but is not limited to, any form of intimidation, reprisal, harassment or treatment based upon retaliatory motive that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity.

The department also offers minors in food management, health & wellness, and nutrition.  The mission of the department is to prepare graduates to become leaders and advocates who enhance the quality of life of individuals, families, and communities. Graduates accomplish this through careers in education, health care, business and industry, and social/human service.  Graduates from the programs in the department of family & consumer sciences (FCS) are in great demand in many career sectors dedicated to educating people to improve the status of their health, resources, relationships, family and community.  (Graduates of our dietetics program pass the national registration exam for dietitians at a rate above the standards required by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics [ACEND]).   Undergraduates who complete their degrees are encouraged to pursue an advanced degree. The department offers master of arts (MA) degree in FCS with a concentration in multidisciplinary health communication studies. See the family & consumer sciences program in the graduate section in this catalog for more information.  COMMON STRENGTHS OF PROGRAMS The educational experiences of all programs focus on values, interrelationships of people with their environment, cultural diversity, and the management of resources in preparing students to assist others in meeting the challenges of their physical, social, educational, economic, and community environments.  All students completing a major in the department participate in the following synthesizing courses and experiences:  Career seminars that allow students to survey professional development practices in their respective field, including learning strategies for developing one’s career path.  A service learning course focusing on family dynamics and the interaction between families and their environment as it relates to the resources available to meet needs and achieve goals.  A capstone course that examines the historical and philosophical foundations of family and consumer sciences public policy initiatives, and the role of professional advocacy in promoting the common good.   Field-based experiences (practicum, internship, and service-learning) to provide students with the opportunity to integrate theory with practice and explore a range of possibilities for professional practice. The metropolitan St. Louis area provides a wealth of opportunities for such field-based experiences.  Students are encouraged to become members of the Student Association of Family & Consumer Sciences. They may also become members of associations related to their area of specialization such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Society for Public Health Education. These experiences provide students with leadership development and professional networking opportunities at the local, state, and national levels.  Fontbonne University Page 211  2018-2019 Catalog FACULTY Mary Beth Ohlms, assistant professor of dietetics; chairperson of the department of family & consumer sciences Jamie Daugherty, assistant professor of dietetics Dena French, assistant professor of dietetics; director of the dietetics program; ISPP experiential coordinator Jaimette McCulley, assistant professor of dietetics, director of graduate programs  DUAL UNDERGRADUATE/GRADUATE ENROLLMENT See dual enrollment in both the undergraduate and graduate program information sections in this catalog.

Applications will be reviewed by CDDE faculty who will take into consideration the student GPA and sustainability to the degree as outlined in the Essential Functions for an SLP.   Once admitted, the student must maintain a GPA of 3.75 or higher and receive no grade lower than a “B” in required courses. If the GPA falls below 3.75 the student will be notified in writing that they are at risk for losing the direct admittance into the graduate SLP program. The student will be given on semester to return the GPA back to the minimum GPA of 3.75 or higher. If the student does not meet this requirement, they will be notified in writing that they no longer qualify for the direct admission program, but that they still have Major Approval and can continue in the SLP program to complete the B.S. in Speech-Language Pathology. Students who do not retain their direct admission to the graduate program are eligible to apply for admission to the graduate program through the regular application process.   Leaving Fontbonne University before completion of the bachelor’s degree in SLP negates this direct admission agreement. A student who is accepted into the Direct Admission program is not obligated to attend the graduate program in SLP at Fontbonne University.

All certification programs are accredited by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) and the Council for the Accreditation of Educational Programs, or CAEP. It should be noted that all certificates to teach are issued by DESE, not Fontbonne University.  The university makes recommendations to DESE upon a candidate’s completion of all requirements.    Teacher Certification Programs:  Undergraduate The following table lists the areas of certification that typically accompany the departmental major at the undergraduate level.  With the assistance of an academic advisor, a student may choose to pursue additional certification from those listed.  Choosing multiple areas of certification could result in the lengthening of a student’s program.

This conceptual framework is knowledge-based, clearly articulated, shared throughout campus, and is consistent with the institutional mission and the Missouri standards for preparation of educators as well as the standards of the Council for the Accreditation of Educational Programs, or CAEP. The conceptual framework and programs are evaluated through student outcomes, course evaluations, field experiences, graduate surveys, and employer feedback. Students are expected to adhere to the “Commitments of the Responsible Educator” which are reflective of the conceptual framework.  As indicated in the Conceptual Framework, Fontbonne University is in touch with the social, political, and economic realities which place demands on education.  The university therefore offers teacher certification programs that prepare individuals who will be able to teach students with a variety of learning styles from diverse backgrounds and prepare students for the future by encouraging an attitude of openness and critical evaluation regarding change. Probing current research findings heightens awareness of future perspectives, raises questions, encourages identification of appropriate teaching techniques, and enables students to identify implications for the future and begin to assume responsibility for creating their future. All Fontbonne teacher certification programs prepare students for the challenge of teaching and enable students to give meaningful service to children and adults.  Teacher certification at Fontbonne University provides:   opportunities for innovation and creativity;  opportunities for reflective decision making;   faculty who are well-educated, creative teachers, professionally involved, and have outstanding supervisory skills;  a foundation of sound theoretical knowledge for each area of certification;   a thorough foundation in both typical and exceptional development of children;  an introductory course which provides an overview of educational theory and practice, along with the   development of skills in observation and analysis of classroom interactions;  faculty members who strive for effective student-teacher relationships.  Fontbonne University Page 309  2018-2019 Catalog POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR STUDENTS IN TEACHER CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS Students in teacher certification programs must maintain a minimum cumulative blended grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale for coursework designated as “professional,” and an overall cumulative blended grade point average of 2.75 on a 4.0 scale. These standards take into consideration all coursework taken at all colleges and universities, both undergraduate and graduate. Students earning certification in middle school and secondary programs must achieve a GPA of 3.0 in the relevant content areas with no grade lower than a C.  (See appropriate departmental sections of this catalog.)  Candidates for teacher certification must also fulfill all Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) requirements, to include successful completion of all Missouri Educator Gateway Assessments (MEGA). The DESE MEGA assessment process includes the:  Missouri Educator Profile (MEP)  Missouri General Education Assessment (MoGEA); required for undergraduate candidates only  Missouri Content Assessment  Missouri Pre-Service Teacher Assessment (MoPTA)  These DESE MEGA requirements are subject to change. The most current requirements set by DESE must be met, including required GPAs and completion of MEGA assessments. Fontbonne University will not submit a recommendation for certification to the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for official teacher certification until all of the DESE MEGA requirements have been met.  Students are responsible for reading the Policies and Procedures for Students in Teacher Certification Programs manual upon beginning their program at Fontbonne. This manual is intended to serve as a supplement to the Fontbonne University catalog for students seeking Missouri initial teacher certification, and contains important information about Fontbonne University and the Missouri teacher certification programs, policies, procedures and deadline dates. Candidates for teacher certification must fulfill all Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) requirements, including qualifying scores on entrance and exit tests, grade point average, and acceptable scores on the DESE Missouri Educator Gateway Assessments (MEGA) assessments. The requirements in this policy manual are subject to change and supersede catalog requirements.  It is the student’s responsibility to review both the Fontbonne University catalog and a copy of the Policies and Procedures for Students in Teacher Certification Programs.  BACKGROUND CHECKS As part of an ongoing effort to ensure the safety and welfare of students and staff, school districts require that any individual who teaches, supervises, or has access to students in schools undergo an FBI fingerprint check, a criminal record check, child abuse/neglect screening, TB tests and/or other screenings.  Candidates should also realize that the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education may deny teaching certificates to those who have a record of criminal activity.  Therefore, the Fontbonne University Educator Preparation Program requires every student enrolling in teacher education courses beyond the 100 level to complete an annual sequence of background checks and screenings, to include both the FBI fingerprint check and the Missouri Family Care Safety Registry, along with an annual TB check. Students are also required to complete the one-time Protecting God’s Children training before gaining access into any Catholic schools.  As students are placed in field experiences, schools and/or school districts will be informed that we have received these reports and, if necessary, information will be forwarded to appropriate authorities. Confidentiality will be maintained at all times; however, students should understand that a record of criminal activity may prohibit approval to observe, tutor, supervise, or teach in a school district.   Background checks must be updated annually, along with the annual waiver to view records. It is the responsibility of each student to maintain up-to-date background checks for the purpose of observations, practicum and final clinical experience/student teaching.  Please check with your advisor or Fontbonne’s Certification Officer (East 235) should you have questions regarding background checks and the courses for which they are necessary.  If these background check and procedures are not followed and updated annually, placement in field and clinical experiences cannot occur.  TEACHER CERTIFICATION GATES The teacher certification process is composed of three gates: Major Approval, Admission to the Teacher Certification Program, and Final Clinical Experience/Student Teaching. Each gate and its associated requirements are detailed below. Students who fail to meet the requirements of the teacher certification gates (1) will not receive the permissions granted for the gates, and (2) must change their major and move into the General Studies in Education degree (see the Education/Special Education Department information in this catalog), or another degree that does not include a teacher certification option. Students can re-apply for a major with a teacher certification option once the teacher certification gate requirements are met.   Fontbonne University Page 310  2018-2019 Catalog Gateways for Teacher Certification Programs at Fontbonne University  4 Year/Native Fontbonne Student Gate Time Frame Requirements Permissions Granted Major Approval By end of sophomore year or after completing 45-60 hours   Complete MEP survey in "
