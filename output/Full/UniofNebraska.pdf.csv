Graduates leave here with not only an outstanding education, but also with maturity, character and spirituality. They are positively impacting their communities, churches, and the world!  A catalog is meant to describe the academic offerings and requirements of the College as well as to outline the parameters of community life and interaction on the campus. What a catalog cannot do is adequately describe the depth of the experience you will receive at York College.  You will not understand from these pages the dedication of faculty and staff who are not only academic mentors, but also friends and guides. You will not see the number of staff who invite students into their homes. You will also not be able to determine that many of your classes are small, allowing one on one interaction with exceptionally prepared faculty who care about you as a person and not just as a student. You will not see the quality of coaches dedicated to student character development and who place students above win-loss records.   You will also not see the rich student life that exists through activities and residence life. Nor will you experience the interaction of students and faculty that happens in daily Chapel.  Chapel is more than just the programming of messages, it is the central part of the day when all students gather together and share each other’s lives.  At York College we care about you and how you will impact the world, both as a student and later as a graduate. You will be encouraged to stretch yourself and grow into leadership roles and activities you never could have imagined before.   York College is unique. A catalog can partially show that through course offerings and information. It cannot show you the heart and soul of who we are. We take seriously our mission to “transform lives through Christ-centered education and to equip students for lifelong service to God, family and society.” That mission applies to all of us here: administration, faculty, staff and students. We are all growing and changing. Each year here is different as students help shape and define what York College is as we learn, grow and serve together.  We invite you to join us on our journey of transformation.  Sincerely, Steve Eckman 33   President  MISSION STATEMENT THE  MISSION  OF  YORK  COLLEGE  IS  TO  TRANSFORM  LIVES  THROUGH  CHRIST-CENTERED EDUCATION AND TO EQUIP STUDENTS FOR LIFELONG SERVICE TO GOD, FAMILY AND SOCIETY.  PURPOSES: 1. To provide Biblical teachings and spiritual nurture for each student. York College is committed to the Bible as God’s inspired infallible, complete will for humankind. Believing that there is no substitute for personal study of the Bible, York College offers a wide variety of textual studies in both the Old and New Testaments. Other experiences, which influence the students’ moral and spiritual development, are daily chapel, devotionals, and numerous aesthetic, athletic and social activities in which attitudes and conduct are based on spiritual principles. York College is committed to the relevance of the Bible to the moral and spiritual values of modern humankind. It is with this in mind that York College stresses that God’s standards as revealed in the Bible are necessary to productive, happy lives and relationships. York College recognizes each student as a person of dignity and worth, and values each student as the center of the educational process.  2. To provide a strong liberal arts preparation in every academic discipline. Liberal arts education seeks to develop the inner resources of the individual. It is designed to liberate the mind and spirit of the student. A Christian liberal arts education is as much concerned with being as with doing. A person with a liberal arts education will be active for the common good and will bring this perspective to bear upon all experiences and relationships. The liberal arts offerings at York College are designed to help students become more objective, analytical and critical, to become more articulate and to lay a foundation in the humanities and the social, physical and natural sciences on which to build a continuing education. The liberal arts also promote a sensitivity for the human condition, and a concern for the how and why of human behavior. With this balance, the liberal arts at York College promote a more disciplined and balanced life.  3. To provide an environment where tolerance, dialog, and the pursuit of truth are honored. The pursuit of truth is embodied in the very nature of liberal arts. York College believes truth must be pursued in all aspects of life. The significance of liberal arts offerings at York College lies in their being consciously permeated with a Christian world-view.  Properly developed moral and spiritual values will lead each individual to cultivate social skills, function constructively in community affairs and to prepare for wholesome family living. This environment encourages each student to understand oneself and the world, to relate to others, to serve others in local and global environments, and to think independently. The importance of this purpose in the overall mission of York College may also be seen in its concern for the stability of the family and for integrity in all aspects of life. Higher education in a Christian environment promotes within students a sense of civic, personal, and social integrity.  CORE VALUES:  Spiritual We believe that God, His word, and His will are sovereign, and that Jesus Christ is His Son. 44    Academic We will develop each student's potential through the pursuit of integrity and academic rigor.  Individual We will encourage each student to pursue individual responsibility, personal integrity, and spiritual maturity.  Community We will foster a shared sense of unity in Christ, focused on service to God and others.  Health and Wellness We will provide a living and learning environment that encourages each student's physical and emotional well-being.  "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things”. Philippians 4:8  College History York College was founded on August 26, 1890, by the United Brethren Church in conjunction with local citizens who wanted a church-related college in York. In 1946, a merger with the Evangelical Church resulted in control passing to the newly-formed Evangelical United Brethren (EUB) Church. In 1954, that body decided to transfer its support to another EUB institution, Westmar University in LeMars, Iowa, at the end of the summer term, July 1, 1954. Control of the corporate structure, which has remained continuous since 1890, was transferred to members of the churches of Christ in 1956. The new administration reopened York College in the fall of 1956 as a senior college with 89 students. After two years, the administration recommended that York College focus on the Associate Degree programs, cease offering the baccalaureate program, and work toward accreditation by the prestigious North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA). In 1970, NCA awarded accreditation to York College, the first junior college in Nebraska to receive that distinction.  In 1988, York College began the transition to senior college status with the strong support of both the York community and the church constituencies. The important first step came in 1989 when the North Central Association granted its approval of the College awarding the Bachelor of Arts Degree with majors in Biblical Studies and Religious Studies. Approval of other programs soon followed. Following a comprehensive site visit in March of 1994, the NCA team of consultant/evaluators recommended removing any remaining stipulations from York College's affiliation with the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools as a senior institution. The North Central Association's Commission on Institutions of Higher Education unanimously approved that recommendation in August 1994. The State of Nebraska Department of Education approved the Teacher Education programs in April of 1994, the first such new approval in over half a century. On September 9, 1994, the State Board of Education granted continuing approval to York College's Teacher Education programs for the five year maximum. The College acquired the South Campus, including the Dean Sack Hall of Science, in July of 1995. Wayne Baker became the 19th President in September of 1996, and he served until 2009, when he was appointed Chancellor of the College. Steve Eckman became the 20th President of York College in 2009. After Westmar University closed on November 21, 1997, the records of York College prior to 1955 were returned to the Registrar's Office in Hulitt Hall on March 20, 1998.  Today, York College is a senior liberal arts college enrolling approximately 500 students in numerous programs leading to various Baccalaureate and Associate degrees. York College, now in its second century and affiliated with churches of Christ, continues to grow in service to students from around the corner and around the planet, to the York community, 55   and to churches of Christ throughout North America and the world.

Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct In harmony with its mission, York College strives to provide a Christian environment that is counter cultural and does not tolerate discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct. Discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct is contrary to Biblical teaching and a violation of human dignity.  Students, faculty and staff of York College have the right to work and learn free of sexual misconduct, harassment and discrimination.  The College will take action to prevent and promptly correct instances of discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct.  I. Violation of Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy The safety and well-being of members of our community is of the utmost importance to York College. Anyone who feels they have been the subject of discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct or retaliation directed to them by another member of the community, whether on or off campus, should contact the Title IX Coordinator. The Office of the Title IX Coordinator will take steps to ensure an adequate, prompt, reliable, and impartial investigation.   Emily C. Lutz is the Title IX Coordinator and can be reached in person at McGehee 301, by telephone at (402)363-5633, by mail at 1125 E. 8th St. York, -2019 ACADEMIC CATALOG     ACADEMIC INFORMATION A solid liberal arts program is the core of the curriculum at York College. The liberal arts curriculum provides the broad-based knowledge so vital to advancing in all disciplines and careers. Your basic courses in Bible, English, mathematics, social sciences, history, science, religion, and fine arts not only prepare you for further study in specific areas, but develop critical thinking as well as an enhanced awareness of your own interests and goals. Tomorrow’s most important careers require a diversity of knowledge rather than narrowly focused training. From communication and computer science to the pre-professional programs such as pre-engineering, pre-law and pre-medicine, the Christian higher education you will experience at York College prepares you well for a host of options.  York College offers programs leading to master’s, baccalaureate, and associate degrees. While these programs have specific requirements, they do allow you a great deal of flexibility. With the help of your Academic Advisor, the faculty member specially assigned to assist you in making the best choices possible, you will plan the program that best prepares you to meet your goals. Our faculty advisors are experts at helping you plan your studies to succeed in your ultimate degree objectives and career goals.  Each baccalaureate degree requires an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.00 and at least 120 semester-hours of credit, a minimum of 44 upper-division (junior/senior) semester-hours, and and at least a 2.00 GPA in the major and minor if applicable.  Each associate degree requires a minimum of 60   semester-hours of credit with a GPA of 2.00 or higher. Each program has a general education component (which may be more specific), and may have major, minor, supporting and elective course components. The last 30 hours of any four year degree program, and the last 15 hours of any two-year program must be taken at York College (unless approval is granted by the Department Chair and Provost).

The Teacher Education Program at York College is accredited by the Nebraska Department of Education and the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) www.caep.org.  Philosophy of General Education In a world of increasing specialization, students have a need for a broad foundation of learning. York College is dedicated to preparing students for a life of service to God, family, and society. This foundation is provided through the arts, biblical studies, humanities, and sciences for all academic programs of York College.    The General Education Program (GEP) gives the student a broad understanding that facilitates learning in all areas of life. Our core values - transform, educate, equip, and serve - are the philosophical framework for the GEP learning outcomes. The aggregate of courses within the York College GEP address five overarching emphases of liberal arts education: 1) critical thinking; 2) ethical inquiry; 3) effective communication; 4) social responsibility; 5) spiritual formation. The York College General Education Program allows graduates to be equipped for a successful career in their chosen field, as well as service to God, family, and society.

It also includes property between Mayhew and Delaware north to 12th Street. In 1995, the four-acre maintenance facility on Ninth Street was added to the Cherry Hill property just east of the main campus. South Campus on Blackburn Avenue, South across 6th Street from East Hill Park was also acquired in 1995. Total physical plant exceeds 50 acres of land and over 700,000 square feet of buildings.  Bartholomew Performing Arts Center Built in 2015, it is named for York College alumni, Gary R. and Gwen Bartholomew. Gary served as the 15th President of York College from 1978-1987.  This building provides a multiform theater, choral rehearsal hall, and practice rooms for theater and music, as well as office space.  Colis and Dolores Campbell Activity Center, was completed in 2013. It is named for the first basketball coach at the college following its reopening in 1956. Colis and Dolores served many roles while serving the college from 1959-1975.  This multipurpose facility houses daily chapel, intramurals, and many campus events.  Childress Hall Built in 1958, it is named for the 12th President of York College, and the first under the auspices of the churches of Christ, Harvey A. Childress. Brother Childress, a minister of the Gospel, worked extensively in the upper Midwest, and later served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees. This building now houses the Campus Bookstore and Post Office.  Dean Sack Hall of Science was originally built in 1917 as the East Ward/Willard Elementary School of the York Public Schools. The North wing was added in 1957. The entire site was acquired by the College in 1995 through the gracious financial assistance of the late Dean Sack, LL.D., Founder and Chairman of the Board of York State Bank. The Dean Sack Science Wing is handicapped-accessible and has the Office of the President suite (with the Brock Conference Room), classrooms, Development Office, Financial Aid, and Business Office. It also has the laboratories for Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. The original structure houses the Science and Mathematics faculty offices, and additional classrooms.  2020   The Freeman Physical Education Center, built in 1974 and most recently renovated in 2014, provides 27,000 square feet for courts, classrooms, locker and weight rooms, and offices for the Athletic and Physical Education departments. The upper and lower levels are handicapped-accessible via their own external entrances. The Center is named for Mr. and Mrs. R. A. Freeman, long-time local supporters of York College.  Gurganus Hall, named for Howard Gurganus, former Assistant to the President and longtime supporter of York College, provides a set building workshop and other departmental support space for theater and music.  The Holthus Fieldhouse, built in 2003, is a heated 35,000 sq. foot sports practice facility. The surface is covered with Astroturf and an elevated 200 yard conditioning track circles the interior. It is located three blocks east of the Freeman Center at 12th and Maine and the brick frontage resembles the architecture of the Phyllis J. Mackey Center. It is named after the C.G. “Kelly” Holthus Family, for their longtime support of the college and their gift towards the building’s construction. The facility was renovated in 2010-2011 and a weight room was added.  Hulitt Hall, built in 1903, currently houses classrooms and faculty offices. It is named after John Hulitt (member of the United Brethren Church from Hillsboro, Ohio), who, in 1902, gave the initial $5,000 towards its construction.  Levitt Library, built in 1969, is named for Mr. Elijah A. Levitt, prominent local businessman and philanthropist, to honor his more than 40 years of support of York College. Mrs. Lorraine Levitt, his widow, helped burn the mortgage on October 11th, 1996. It houses the Library proper, audio-visual resources, classrooms, faculty offices, the Computer Laboratory with 18 computers and Sympodium technology for classes on the second floor, and the Carruth Academic Technology Center with 16 computer workstations on the main floor. The Carruth ATC, dedicated Oct. 11, 1996, is named for Feral W. Carruth, a Christian businessman and farmer from Texas. Brother Carruth's foresight and generosity resulted in funding this project through an estate gift.  McCloud Hall, erected in 1964, has accommodations for 132 men on three floors, including a parlor, laundry facilities, and a recreation room. It is named for Flora S. McCloud, wife of C. A. McCloud, a prominent businessman of York, Nebraska, who served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees for 15 years.   McGehee Hall contains general-purpose classrooms, Seminar Room, Campus Ministry Office, and the Tutoring Center. The Spiritual Life Center and Coffee Shop on the main floor affords an informal setting for fellowship, activities, and bi-weekly devotionals. Centrally located on the main campus, the courtyard and front porch area with the stained-glass window in honor of Kirk Miller (Class of 1984) is an extremely popular campus meeting place. Originally built in 1911 as a gymnasium "with the finest indoor track in Nebraska", it was converted to the Alumni Library in the late 1920's. More space and the neo-classical facade were added in 1958, and the building was renamed in honor of Kathleen McGehee, Librarian of York College.  Middlebrook Hall, erected in 1949 "to the glory of God and for the promotion of the cause of Christian higher education", is named for Frank C. Middlebrook, Chairman of the Building Committee and early influential supporter of York College. Middlebrook houses the Education Department, Biblical Studies Department, Criminal Justice Department, Behavioral Science Department, Registrar, Institutional Effectiveness offices, the Student Success Center, the Computer Services department, and several state of the art classrooms in the basement.  Oliver House was formerly the residence of the Oliver family, who were early settlers on the East Hill section of the City of York, contiguous to the original campus. Together with the attached building, which was remodeled in 2004, it provides faculty offices for the Music Department and several music practice areas. The adjacent Piano Studio was 2121   formerly the Oliver's carriage house.  Phyllis J. Mackey Center contains the Mabrey L. & Madge Miller Center, The Clayton Museum of Ancient History, the campus dining complex, the Admissions Office, and the Cornerstone Room, the presidential meeting/dining facility. Erected in 1998 in a style reminiscent of "Old Main" (York College's first building {1891-1951}), the entire facility is handicapped accessible. The clock tower's Winchester chimes can be heard throughout the East Hill area of the city. The building is named for Mrs. Phyllis Jean (Klawonn) Mackey, an alumna who encouraged her children to also attend York College. In addition, she was a long-time employee and development officer of York College from 1968 until 1996. Phyllis was instrumental in developing the Round-Up program and making many friends for the college.  The York College Prayer Chapel is one of the newest buildings on campus, but it is also the oldest. Originally constructed in 1901, the church was located seven miles from town. It was moved to campus in December 1999, fully intact. It has been completely restored and updated, and was dedicated in October 2004. It seats 175 and also has a meeting room in the basement. The main auditorium is named in honor of Donald Krauss, whose estate gift enabled much of the restoration of the facility.  Thomas Hall provides housing to 264 students. It was named for Kenneth C. Thomas of York, Nebraska, "a generous Christian and a dedicated College trustee." All four floors are handicapped-accessible via ramps and an elevator. The central section was built in 1972 and the wings were added in 1984. It contains multiple parlors, and laundry facilities.  Kiplinger Apartments and Gibbs Hall were dedicated in March 2006. These facilities can accommodate 186 students in the 48 apartment units. Each unit houses three or four students, each in an individual bedroom, and has two full bathrooms, a kitchen, and living room. Spacious lobbies grace the main floor of each building. The men’s apartment building, on the East side of campus, is named in honor of Mr. and Mrs. H. Jarrell Gibbs, long-time board members and supporters of York College.  In addition to the facilities mentioned above on campus, several nearby sites not owned by the College are available for specific functions. The handicapped-accessible auditorium of the East Hill Church of Christ, across Delaware Avenue from the Beacon Hill Apartment complex, is used for worship by many students and faculty. The City of York's Levitt Stadium, located between Hulitt Hall and the Dean Sack Hall of Science, is used for baseball. Various venues, belonging to either the City of York or the York Public schools, are often used for college events.

Enrollment Deposit: Individual payment plans will be assigned for each international student and administered by the York College business office. The   first payment must be paid in full (by date assigned by S.E.V.I.S. school official) in order for the I-20 form to be released to the student. This payment will serve as the enrollment deposit and will be used towards the student's account. 2323    During the midwinter and spring vacation periods, students must arrange for their own housing and food in some off-campus location and their own food during Thanksgiving.  TRANSFER ADMISSION Students that enroll in courses from an accredited College or University post high school graduation or GED and accumulate 28 earned hours or more are excused from the ACT/SAT test score. In addition to the admissions requirements above, transfer students are required to take some number of hours in Bible, not including Bible credit they transfer. See Bible and Transfer Credit.   CONDITIONAL ADMISSION When all documents are presented and the above stated requirements are NOT met, the student will be evaluated for “Conditional Acceptance”.  His/her Admissions recruiter will complete the Conditional Acceptance Form (which should be returned to the Administrative Assistant of the Admissions office), and the case will be taken to the Acceptance Committee.  This committee will ONLY meet if the file has been completed with all official documents.  The committee will then determine whether or not to accept the student conditionally (on Academic Probation).  If conditionally accepted, the student will have certain course load and activity restrictions.  (These restrictions will be personalized per student and will be determined by the specifics included on all transcripts [i.e. GPA, course load, degree of difficulty, etc.], and the recommendation stated on the Conditional Acceptance Form.)  Students admitted on a conditional basis must meet the satisfactory academic progress requirements by the end of their first semester at York College. Such successful completion of one semester will remove the probationary status. Failure to comply with any of the stipulations will result in academic suspension.  INCOMPLETE ADMISSIONS In the event that a file is not complete (meaning one [or all] of the documents is unofficial or missing) the following actions will be taken. The student’s file and application will be placed on “HOLD”  The student will receive the following information: That his/her acceptance is incomplete That certain documents are unofficial or missing (each transcript will be listed specifically by name) That the student must meet with the Vice President for Finance & Operations before registering for classes to present proof that the transcripts have been ordered and payment plans arranged—enrolling in classes will NOT be permitted until this meeting takes place.  That if the official documents are not presented before the grace period ends (12 business days after start of classes) the student will be dismissed and charged ALL expenses accordingly.  If the student is a potential athlete, information will be sent to the Athletic Director and Head Coach   SPECIAL ADMISSION Students seeking only part-time attendance (11 or fewer hours per term) are required to complete an admission application to be admitted. Documentation for all previous schools attended must be submitted as well. Standards of conduct are required of all students.  Intermittent students are only required to apply for admission once. If such non-degree, unclassified students later wish to seek a degree (a requirement to receive most financial aid) they must meet the regular admission requirements.  ADMISSION, REGISTRATION, and ENROL7-2699. Requests are normally granted within two weeks of receipt. All examinations of student records will take place in the Office of the Registrar with a representative of the college present. After examining his/her records, the student or former student may request that certain records be removed based on grounds that the records in question are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s rights. Should the request of the student be refused, the student shall have the right to a formal hearing before a committee appointed by the President within 60 days of such a request being submitted in writing. Any student has the right to request a copy of any material contained in his/her record. The cost of each page to be reproduced, other than transcripts of the permanent academic history, shall be $1.  Records Disclosure In general, no personally identifiable information from student educational records will be disclosed without written consent from the student. Three exemptions may, however, be made: 1) disclosures required or allowed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (commonly known as FERPA) including certain Federal and State officials, accrediting organizations in order to carry out their accrediting functions, etc.; 2) directory information (which will be released unless the student requests that it be withheld, as explained in the section below); 3) records may be disclosed to parents of students who depend upon them as defined by Internal Revenue Code 1986, section 152, as revised. York College will consider all students as "dependent" unless they specifically inform the Registrar or his designee within the Add/Drop period for each term that they are independent of their parents as defined above.  York College hereby designates the following student information as public or directory information (Such information may be disclosed by the institution for any purpose, at its discretion.): - name - local and permanent addresses and telephone numbers - date and place of birth - major field of study - classification - high school from which graduated - most recent prior educational institution attended - dates of attendance - degrees, awards and honors received (including Honor Rolls) - photo - full-time / part-time - email address - participation in officially recognized activities and sports (including audio and/or video records of such participation),    and weight and height of members of athletic teams.  Under FERPA, currently enrolled students have the right to request that disclosure of directory information be withheld.  4848   To withhold disclosures, written notification including the student's identification number and signature must be received by the Registrar within the Add/ Drop period for each term that information is to be withheld. York College assumes that failure on the part of the student to specifically request the withholding of directory information indicates individual approval for disclosure. Questions regarding records accessibility and/or disclosure and/or York College's implementation of FERPA should be directed to the Registrar.  Semester Hour  A semester hour of credit requires 750 minutes of scheduled class meeting time. Two or three hours of laboratory work each week are equivalent to one semester hour. Each credit hour typically requires approximately 2-3 hours of work outside of class each week. This means that a 3-hour course requires approximately 6-9 hours each week of outside work focused on that course, such as reading, reviewing, writing, preparing for upcoming quizzes/exams, developing and completing projects, and/or other activities to enhance learning.  Student Load  The normal full-time student load is 12 to 16 credit hours during any 16-week semester. Students who have a GPA of 3.00 or higher may register for more than 18 hours per semester only with the signed permission of the Provost.  Student Classifications Students who are carrying 12 or more hours and have met regular or transfer admission requirements are classified as freshmen. Those students who have completed 28 hours are classified as sophomores. Students who have completed 60 hours of work are classified as juniors, and those having completed 90 hours of work are classified as seniors.  Students who previously have completed a baccalaureate degree are classified as post-baccalaureates. Upper division level students are those students who are classified as juniors, seniors and/or post-baccalaureates. Any student who does not meet one or more of the above criteria for classification will be unclassified.  Summer Session(s) York College offers a limited number of courses each summer. This provides opportunities to earn extra credit or remove deficiencies. All summer classes are online.  Transfer of Credit A student who has previously attended a recognized college should make application for transfer of credit to York College. The student must request both the high school and any college(s) attended to send transcripts which include statements of status at the time of graduation or withdrawal. All transferred grades become part of the CUM GPA at York College (grades of “D” are accepted but they will not fulfill any course requirements in the student’s major field of study). College transfers not meeting the required scholastic level will be placed on academic probation. A student admitted on academic probation must achieve the required GPA by the end of the first semester to be removed from probation. Failure to be removed from probation will result in suspension.  Students who transfer to York College with an Associate of Arts (A.A.) or Associate of Science (A.S.) degree (not A.A.S.) completed from another college will be considered to have met the general education requirements for York College, excluding Bible courses, pre-requisites for required courses, and any courses required by outside licensing agencies (NE Dept. of Education, etc.).  York College will accept a maximum of 90 semester-hours from accredited baccalaureate-degree-granting institutions and a maximum of 60 semester- hours from accredited junior colleges. A transfer student must take the final 30 semester-hours at York College. Transfer students are required to take some number of hours in Bible, not including 4949   Bible credit they transfer.   A transfer student who has a baccalaureate degree may obtain a different baccalaureate degree in another field by fulfilling the following requirements: 1. meet the residence requirement of taking the final thirty hours at York College, 2. complete all general education requirements, and 3. meet the specific requirements of the new degree program. Note that Pell Grants are generally not available after a first bachelor’s degree.  Articulation Agreements York College is a charter signatory institution to the Nebraska Transfer Initiative, which guarantees, within the stipulations of the agreement, a block of general education courses for qualified students transferring between signatory institutions. For specific details, contact the YC Registrar or the appropriate advisor at your community college. Since 1995, York College and Nebraska Christian College have agreed to a continuing articulation process which would allow graduates of NCC with Associate in Arts degrees to complete specific bachelor's degree programs with only two or three years of full-time study at York College. For further details, contact the Education Division at (402) 363-5696 if interested in teacher certification, the YC Registrar for all programs (including education), or the Academic Dean of Nebraska Christian College.  Varsity Athletics York College is a member of the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC).  The KCAC was established in 1890 and is the oldest conference in the United States.  Veteran Affairs Regulations Students who are recipients of benefits through the G.I. Bills are subject to all of the following regulations. Such students attending York College as full-time students must be enrolled for at least 12 semester-hours of courses each term. The Registrar keeps records of regular withdrawals from a course and contacts the instructor to determine the last date of attendance in any courses not completed and not officially dropped. The Registrar will receive early notice of any student not attending classes from instructors and from the attendance check made at Chapel. The Registrar shall keep records of each student’s progress and conduct and will immediately notify the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs if either one falls below the minimum standards of the college. All interruptions, terminations, dismissals, or changes of status will be promptly reported to the DVA. York College utilizes the American Council on Education’s “Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services” for military credit recognition.

LMENT 2424,"   Admission, registration, and enrollment are required before becoming an official student of York College.  Admission involves the completion of all specific requirements for admission and the approval of the Admissions Director or the Acceptance Committee. Registration is the formal selection and approval of a slate of classes with your advisor and the Registrar. Enrollment is completed by making satisfactory financial arrangements with the Business Office and starting classes.  Admission may be denied or enrollment terminated if, in the opinion of the administration, the conduct of the student is not in harmony with the philosophy of York College. Enrollment and registration will be denied to any student who has caused York College to incur a loss and who has not voluntarily repaid that loss. No student with a past-due account balance will be allowed to enroll until satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Business Office.   YORK COLLEGE IS AFFORDABLE  The York College financial aid program exists to help any student who has academic potential and limited financial resources. The direct objective of aid is to provide opportunities for those who would not be able to complete their college education without financial assistance.  York College funded scholarships and grants are based on merit and in some cases, need as determined by the FAFSA. Whenever possible, applicants are first considered for all grants and scholarships to the extent of eligibility. Remaining need may be met with loans and/or campus employment. Self-help aid is available in the form of loans and campus employment to the extent that funds are available.  STEPS TO COMPLETING FINANCIAL AID Complete the admissions process. Complete the FAFSA on the Web at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov (York College's code #002567). Submit all requested documentation required for verification purposes and signed Final Award Letter to the Financial Aid Office.  YORK COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP POLICY York College scholarships are offers made to students who have special qualities and/or talents. Institutional scholarships are awarded to students during recruitment efforts. Recommendations are made to the Financial Aid Director for awarding. For the most part, institutional scholarships are renewable to the recipients for each semester at York College.  Students receiving institutional scholarships and grants are expected to represent York College in a positive and respectful manner. Students experiencing discipline problems may lose scholarships based on disciplinary actions recommended by the Dean of Students.  Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is required to keep all scholarships. For renewable scholarships, a student not maintaining SAP may apply for reinstatement of the scholarship after one year without the scholarship and a GPA of 2.00 for the previous semester. At the end of 4 semesters Academic and ACT scholarships under half tuition require a GPA of 3.00 to be maintained in order to keep the Academic and the ACT scholarships. Academic and ACT scholarships of half tuition, or above, require a GPA of 3.50 to be maintained in order to keep the scholarship. Reduction of any scholarship may be appealed to the Scholarship Committee for review. A written letter of appeal must be submitted to the Financial Aid Director. Satisfactory Academic Progress is defined as the following cumulative grade point averages 2525   (CGPA):  Cumulative credit hours earned CGPA 1 to 27  1.60 28 to 59 1.80 60 and above 2.00  Academic Scholarships National Merit Finalist, Presidential Scholar, National Merit Semi-Finalist, Deans Scholarship, Trustees Scholarship, Larson Scholarship, Founders Scholarship, York Scholarship, Panther Award, Blue & White Award, Valedictorian, Salutatorian.

The recipient must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must not have met the academic requirements of a Bachelor’s Degree. The amount of the grant is determined on the basis of a formula developed annually by the Department of Education and approved by Congress.  No repayment is required. Federal Pell Grant amounts range from a maximum of $5,920 for the 2018-2019 academic year.  Application is made by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).  Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG):  This grant is available to Federal Pell Grant recipients with the lowest Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The grant is renewable upon application to the Financial Aid Office if the student meets satisfactory academic progress requirements and continues to demonstrate exceptional financial need. The grant assistance does not require repayment. Average awards of $500 will be granted for the 2018-2019 academic year.  Nebraska Opportunity Grant  Nebraska residents attending York College, full-time, may be eligible for this grant. These state-funded grants are administered through the Nebraska Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education. The average State Grant award for our students is $500.  Recipients who show exceptional need are eligible for this State Grant.  Federal Work Study This employment allows students with demonstrated need to work as many as 20 hours a week in various departments 2626   on campus. Students will need to apply for work-study jobs. Students are advised of job assignments and number of hours to be worked each week. Students will be released from a job for failure to work satisfactorily. The wage is the current minimum wage applicable to educational institutions. The dollar amount as shown by semester on the Award Letter is the maximum amount the student can earn. All student wages are paid monthly. York College offers students the option of using earnings for personal expenses or applying earnings to any outstanding balance on the student’s account. Work Study employment is not a guarantee for all York College students that apply. The average award for the 2018-2019 academic year will be $1350. Institutional Work-Study: Same as Federal Work- Study, but funded in total by York College.  Federal Perkins Loan This loan is available to students who show exceptional need. Students must make application annually. A student may borrow a maximum of $5,000 per year of undergraduate study. A maximum of $20,000 can be borrowed for all undergraduate work. The 5% interest rate begins to accrue and repayment begins nine months after the student ceases half-time enrollment. Repayment may be made over a ten year period, depending on the outstanding balance. A minimum of $40 monthly payment is required. Repayment may be deferred because of service in the Armed Forces, Peace Corps, VISTA, or continued student status. There are loan cancellation provisions for borrowers who enter certain fields of teaching, who teach in designated schools or who serve as a member of the Armed Forces in an area of hostilities. Repayment responsibilities and deferment and cancellation provisions are explained before the borrower signs the promissory note and again before the borrower leaves York College. The following chart shows estimated monthly payments and total interest charges for three different Perkins loans over a 10 year period.   Total Loan  Amount Number of payments Monthly  Payments Total Interest Charges Total  Repaid $4,500 114 $50.00 $1,151.79 $5,651.79 $9,000 114 $100.00 $2,303.58 $11,303.58 $18,000 114 $200.00 $4,607.16 $22,607.16   Federal Subsidized Stafford Student Loan  This loan is available to students with demonstrated need. This loan is actually approved by the U.S. Department of Education; however, the application must be approved through the Financial Aid Office. Students with demonstrated need may borrow $3,500 for the Freshman year, $4,500 for the Sophomore year, and $5,500 per year for the Junior and Senior years, not to exceed the aggregate of $23,000 (effective for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 1993). The interest is paid by the federal government while the student is enrolled at least half-time. The interest rate is set by the Federal Government. For borrowers after July 1, 1994, the interest rate is variable. Repayment may be made over a ten year period, depending on the outstanding loan balance. Deferment provision explanations are provided by the lending institutions. The dollar amount of this loan is the gross figure on the Financial Aid Award Letter. The chart below shows estimated monthly payments and total interest charges for 8% Stafford loans of varying amounts, with typical repayment periods:   Total Loan Amount Number Of Payments Monthly Payments Total Interest Charges Total Repaid 2727   $2,600 64 $50.00 $ 614.60 $ 3,214.60 $4,000 119 $50.00 $1,972.48 $ 5972.48 $7,500 120 $93.52 $3,722.07 $11,222.07  Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan  Students, regardless of income, will be able to obtain a student loan. The interest rate and loan limits for the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan are 3.76%. A borrower may receive a combination of the subsidized and the unsubsidized loans for the same loan period. The combined total of both programs may not exceed the annual limits for the Federal Stafford Loan Program. Interest begins accruing the day the loan is disbursed. The borrower is responsible for interest that accrues throughout the life of the loan including in- school and deferment periods. Interest payments can be paid monthly or quarterly, or can be capitalized by the lender at the request of the borrower and added to the loan principal. Students may be denied a student loan if they demonstrate unwillingness to repay. Students requesting loan funds beyond direct costs may be asked to submit a budget for default management purposes.  Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (FPLUS) This loan is available to parents through the U.S. Dept. of Education and can be used to meet the dependent undergraduate’s educational expenses.  Federal TEACH Grant The U.S. Dept. of Education’s TEACH Grant Program provides grant funds to postsecondary students who are completing or plan to complete coursework that is needed to begin a career in teaching, and who agree to serve for at least four years as a full- time, highly qualified teacher in a high-need field, in a school serving low-income students. Eligible full-time students may receive $4,000 per year in TEACH Grant Funds, up to a maximum of $16,000 for undergraduates. If you receive a TEACH Grant but do not complete the required four years of teaching service within eight years after completing the coursework for which you received the grant, or if you otherwise do not meet the requirements of the TEACH Grant Program, all TEACH Grant funds that you received will be converted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/ Ford Loan (Direct Unsubsidized Loan) that you must repay in full, with interest, to the Department. Once a TEACH Grant is converted to a loan, it cannot be converted back to a grant.  SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) Federal legislation governing the administration of the Pell Grant, the Federal Perkins Loan, The Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), the Federal Work-Study Program (FWS), the Federal Stafford Loan, the Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students Program (FPLUS) and the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan requires that eligible institutions define and enforce standards of progress for students applying for and/or receiving financial aid. To comply with that legislation, the following standards have been established at York College. All applicants for the above mentioned forms of financial aid as well as all state and institutionally funded programs must meet these standards to be eligible.  Full-time students seeking an Associate degree normally acquire the number of credit hours necessary for graduation in four semesters. A full-time student is one who was enrolled for 12 or more credit hours each semester. The maximum time-frame allowed for completion of an Associate degree program is six semesters. This limit is prorated for longer periods of time for students enrolled as three-quarter or half-time students. The maximum time-frame for program completion for a transfer student to York College is eight terms of enrollment at York College, regardless of hours completed at any previous institution. Those seeking a Baccalaureate degree are allowed a maximum of twelve semesters for degree completion. Students should accumulate an average of 16 credit hours every semester to graduate in eight semesters. Minimum standards require the following cumulative Grade Point Average 2828     Cumulative credit hours earned CGPA 1 to 27  1.60 28 to 59 1.80 60 and above 2.00  Full-time students must earn at least 20 credit hours each academic year. Credit hour requirements are prorated for students enrolled as three- quarter or half-time students. Three-quarter time is defined as 9, 10, or 11 hours of enrollment per semester. Half-time is defined as 6, 7, or 8 hours of enrollment per semester. For example, part-time students enrolled on a three-quarter time basis (9, 10, or 11 semester-hours) must have successfully completed at least 9 credit hours each semester. Part-time students enrolled on a half-time basis (6, 7, or 8 semester credit hours) must have earned at least 6 credit hours each semester. Withdrawals from classes are considered to be “Hours Attempted” but are not “Hours Completed” or “Hours Graded”. Repeat classes are not considered in “Hours Completed” for SAP. At any time a student does not successfully complete the appropriate complement of hours (non-inclusive of repeat coursework), they will be considered not to be making SAP, and all probationary and termination standards apply. Official course withdrawals do not change enrollment status. This has no effect on academic probation.  Students are allowed 150% of the normal completion time of their specific degree to receive Title IV assistance. Once a student reaches 150% in credits OR in time, the student is no longer eligible to receive Title IV assistance. Students are allowed one recalculation due to a change in major during their time at York College. Satisfactory Academic Progress is checked at the end of each spring semester. In addition, SAP for each student is checked at the end of four periods of enrollment. A student must have achieved a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 at the end of four periods of enrollment as a full-time student at York College to be considered as making SAP.  Students who have been denied financial aid because requirements were not met may file a written appeal to the Director of Financial Aid. If the appeal is approved by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee, financial aid will be reinstated for the term in question. Unusual circumstances, such as undue hardship caused by the death of a relative, illness or injury experienced by the student or other special circumstances might justify an appeal. Appeals must be made in writing to the Financial Aid Director indicating the reasons for the appeal, such as a documented personal family emergency or documented medical problem. All appeals will be reviewed by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee and the student will be informed of the action taken. If the appeal is approved the student will be placed on financial aid probation and will be required to follow and meet the requirements of an academic plan. The decision of the committee shall be final. If a student is denied financial aid due to lack of academic progress, courses must be taken at the student’s own expense until the minimum requirements are met. Failure to attain the minimum requirements will cause the student to be ineligible for any further financial aid. All students who are denied financial aid and re-enter York College will do so on probationary status and must have the permission of the Finance Office.  TUITION, ROOM, BOARD, FEES: 2018-2019 The Board of Trustees of York College has placed upon the Business Office the responsibility of enforcing the schedule of institutional charges and refund policies applicable to students. All fees and pricing are subject to change without prior notice. This schedule of charges applies only to the 2018-2019 academic year.   Semester charges are not reduced when a student enrolls late.  There will be no refund because of absences from the campus. Meals are not provided during the holiday periods such as Thanksgiving, Spring break or between sessions.  2929   Example of Charges The following is an example of charges, not including special fees, for a student carrying a full course-load of 12-16 credit hours.

Return of Aid Policies Aid received by outside sources, excluding payments on account, York College, and all Title IV programs will be returned to the sources they came from according to the following policies.  Title IV Programs:  All aid received in the form of Pell grants, SEOG, State Grants, Perkins Loan, Stafford loans, PLUS loans, Robert Byrd scholarships, will be earned per day that student is enrolled at York College until the 60% point in the semester. After this 60% point in time, all aid is considered to have been earned by the student and repayment of funds will not be calculated.  York College Program  All aid received in the form of York College scholarships, YCSL, YC Need Based loan, Endowed scholarships, institutional grants will be earned per day that the student is enrolled at York College until the 60% point in the semester. After this 60% point in time, all aid is considered to have been earned by the student and repayment of funds will not be calculated. The calculation for determining amount of earned funds will be to divide the number of days a student is enrolled in classes into the number of days in the semester. (Thanksgiving break and Spring break are not counted as days attended.) Summer school will be counted individually, as sessions require.  The percentage of days will not be rounded, but used as is calculated. That percentage will be applied to each type of aid received by the student. Once the calculations are finished, the amount of unearned aid is determined per Title IV software. (See calculation worksheets in Student Consumer Information and at www.york.edu.)  Outside Scholarships  Once an outside scholarship is validated and applied to a student's account, there will be no return of the funds. Unearned aid that is determined to be returned to the government through the Title IV programs will be the responsibility of the student. Room Damage deposit, less any costs for room repairs and/or prorated share of general student-caused residence hall damage, will be returned within 30 days after exiting York College by applying the deposit to your account. If the account is paid in full, you may withdraw the credit balance. Checkout procedure is through the Residence Hall Manager. Improper checkout or failure to abide by the room lease agreement may result in the deposit being forfeited.       3232                YORK CO"
BIB 121,", History of the New Testament Hours required 2  as listed under Core Level Courses)  The courses in this section are supportive of the mission of York College in that they "provide a quality liberal arts education leading to an understanding and philosophy of life consistent with Christian ideals." The objectives of these courses are derived from the first of three purpose statements of York College: "To provide students with the biblical teachings which encourage the development of moral and spiritual values and an appreciation of New Testament Christianity." Courses in this area are designed to help students appreciate the role of the Bible and Christianity in everyday life. Students are encouraged to reflect on their own values, current ethical issues, and views of others that are different from their own. Courses: 1.   and 123, and sophomores to take  unless transferring an exact equivalent with a grade of "C" or better. The number of Bible classes required for transfer students is determined at the time the student transfers to York College, and cannot be adjusted by transferring in additional hours of classes once initially enrolled at York College. Students are required to take, at York College, the following number of classes in Bible, not including Bible credit transferred into York College:  4040   Bible classes required for: Transfer Hours Bachelor  Associate less than 14 6 4 14 to 28 hours 5 3 29 to 46 hours 4 2 47 to 63 hours 3 1 ()  64 or more 2 1 ()  Changing Class Schedules  You may not change or drop a class without approval of your advisor. A full-time student is one who is enrolled in 12 or more hours at the end of the drop period for that term. Class changes are not permitted after the Add/Drop period of any semester, except for very unusual circumstances and only with the permission of the Provost. Any class dropped without going through the official withdrawal process will be marked “F.” Any class in which a student has excessive absences will be marked "WF”. A student may not receive a grade of “W” unless the course was dropped during the first ten weeks of the semester. After the tenth week, no withdrawal is allowed except for students who withdraw from all classes. The official date of dropping will be the date on which drop forms are filed in the Office of the Registrar. In case of prolonged illness, a student may request that the instructor, advisor and Provost meet as a committee to consider a withdrawal request. Students in a course cancelled by the Provost within the Add/Drop Period for which no replacement is found, will receive a refund of all tuition and fees for that course. Courses cancelled later in the term will receive prorata credit rounded to the nearest integer for work completed. Tuition will be refunded at the prorata reciprocal of the credit granted.  Commencement A student may participate in the May commencement ceremonies if they lack no more than three semester hours of requirements, have the required grade point average(s) for the degree sought, and can demonstrate tangible evidence of pre-enrollment in the required classes or a documented plan for completing the remaining 3 credits to be completed prior to the start of the next fall semester. The final 3 credits represent part of the 30 credit residency requirement and should be taken at York College unless prior written approval is granted by the Provost.  Credit through Special Circumstances York College grants credit through the Advanced Placement (AP) and College Level Examination Programs (CLEP) of the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB), through the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, by institutional testing, for verified professional/technical training, by examination of transferring graduates from certain schools of preaching, and for verified experiential learning. Application for such credit must be made in writing to the Registrar, stating the basis of eligibility and the willingness to pay the fee required in order to receive the credit. Program Directors or Department Chairs may allow or disallow certain types of special credit towards the specific programs in their area(s). Credit will only be awarded to students enrolled in a degree program at York College and only upon receipt by the Registrar of an official grade report supplied by the appropriate authority. A special credit fee will be charged for each hour of credit awarded. Certain examinations have their own fees as well. Refer to the Business Office section of the catalog or contact the chair of the appropriate faculty division.  Credit by Advanced Placement Credit is given for high school courses successfully completed in the College Board’s AP program by entering freshmen. For scores of 4 or higher, credit will be allowed for the corresponding individual course taught at York College; credit is not awarded for multiple college courses based on AP scores in one subject. A 4 or 5 on one subject exam = credit for one course at York College.  For AP credit to be valid, a College Board/AP transcript must be requested by the student and sent to York College; merely having AP designations appear on a high school transcript does not suffice for college 4141   credit at York College. A credit recording fee is charged.  Credit by International Baccalaureate A student who has completed the prescribed examinations of the International Baccalaureate program will receive credit from York based upon the American Council on Education's recommendations. Official score reports directly from the IB office are required for credit to be evaluated. A credit recording fee is charged.  Credit by CLEP Credit is also given on the basis of The College Board’s College Level Examination Program. CLEP currently offers 33 different exams over a variety of subjects. Credit shall not be given for a course in which a student is enrolled, or has ever been enrolled, regardless of the grade earned in the course. If a student earns CLEP credit in a subject by taking the exam at another college, a CLEP transcript must be requested from the College Board, even if the credit appears on the other college’s transcript.  A list of CLEP subject tests available at York College, along with testing fee information, is available from the Testing Office. If a student is successful in passing the CLEP exam, there is a $60 per credit hour recording fee that must be paid in the Business Office before the credit for the equivalent class will be noted on the student transcript.

HST 283,", World Civilizations since 1450  3. Historical Foundations Requirement: Two Courses History is the record-both written and unwritten-of humankind's past. Studying history is a process of assembling information from the past and giving meaning to it. Historians study sources that tell them about the past and such interpretations are presented to inquisitive students of the subject. History courses taught at York College are designed to provide students with the information they need to allow them to establish a context for events of the past; such a context is intended to provide students with a clearer understanding of their world and its relation to past events. Studying history is, therefore, a mission of discovery. It involves telling a story, and while facts are essential in telling a story, they are not enough. Understanding the circumstances of a time, era, epoch, or period of the past which lead or caused events to unfold in a particular manner is the primary goal of all history courses taught at York College. Courses: 1.  . World Civilizations since 1450. 3 hours credit, even years, spring This survey course will focus on the major world civilizations since 1450.

PHI 223,", Philosophy of Living  6. Scientific Inquiry Requirement: Two courses, (at least one course in mathematics). Scientific Inquiry:  The physical and biological sciences seek to understand the natural world using mathematics as the tool in that understanding. By systematically observing and analyzing phenomena, natural scientists have produced a complex and multifaceted set of theories that continually evolve. Courses in this context will introduce students to the key theories of a science and to its methods of inquiry. In these courses students learn how observations are used to develop hypotheses, how hypotheses may be tested experimentally, and how results of experiments may be quantified and analyzed to assess theories. By emphasizing methodology, these courses improve the ability of students to make informed decisions about scientific issues that affect their world and further develop their critical thinking and problem solving skills. Finally, courses in this context will address a number of broad questions pertaining to science: How do the ideas of science evolve and how does their change affect other aspects of our culture? How does technology affect scientific endeavors? By exploring these questions, students become increasingly aware of the interaction between science and society.  A second emphasis is the study of mathematics. Courses in this context will introduce the students to theorems and principles used in mathematics. The study will help the students to understand the principles of mathematics, and how to express the relationships found in science and other areas. Courses: . Students are required to take two upper division courses, for a minimum of four semester-hours, offered by the Bible Division (and prefixed BIB, DOC, MIN, PHI, or RHS) during the junior and/or senior years. Major departments may specify how that requirement should be met. Any substitutions require the advance permission of the Provost.

MTH 173," College Algebra   ACADEMIC REGULATIONS  3838   Absences and Tardiness York College believes that regular class attendance is essential to learning; however, it provides for necessary absences. Punctuality in all classes is required. Individual teachers set their own attendance standards. However, you cannot be absent from any course for more than the equivalent of three weeks of a semester and receive credit in that course. Absences in excess of this amount constitute failure in the course and may result in withdrawal from the course with a grade of “WF” (withdrawn failing).  Academic Probation  Each student is expected to maintain a scholastic level commensurate with personal academic goals. The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is computed by dividing the total quality points earned by the total quality hours attempted, including “F” grades.  A CGPA of at least 2.000 is required for graduation in any degree program. To be eligible to participate in co-curricular activities and to avoid being placed on academic probation, students must meet the minimum standard for satisfactory academic progress.  This standard requires maintaining at least the minimum cumulative grade point averages (CGPA) shown below:  Hours Earned at end of term Resulting Class Standing Cumulative GPA 1 to 27 Freshman 1.600 28 to 59 Sophomore 1.800 60 or more Junior or higher 2.000  Any student who does not meet these minimum standards will be placed on ACADEMIC PROBATION and will be limited to no more than 15 semester-hours. A student who is on academic probation is not permitted to participate in any co-curricular activity, such as athletics, musical groups, dramatic productions, Song Fest, and student publications or to hold office in any club or student organization. Students on academic probation should reduce employment or other outside activity to no more than twelve hours per week, and are required to participate in regular sessions with the Student Success Center. At the completion of the next semester, every student on academic probation will be reviewed. One of the following three actions will be taken:  1) The Provost will remove the student from academic probation if the student now meets the standards of satisfactory academic progress. 2) Students who have: a) not yet completed 60 hours, and b) have not yet reached the required cumulative GPA, c) but have made at least the required GPA for the current term, will be continued on academic probation. (For example: a full-time student with 45 cumulative semester-hours at the end of the semester would need to have completed the term with a term GPA of at least 1.80.) 3) Any student on academic probation who does not satisfy either condition above, will be placed on ACADEMIC SUSPENSION.  Academic Suspension Academic Suspension means the student may not enroll for the subsequent fall or spring semester, and may lose eligibility for federal financial aid. Any of these conditions will place students on Academic Suspension: a. Failure to achieve a semester GPA of .500 or greater b. Failure to reach the required CGPA as described under Academic Probation 3939   c. A second instance of academic dishonesty  A student may request an exception to an academic suspension by writing a letter to the Provost explaining all extenuating circumstances and requesting an exception to the above stated rules.    A full-time student suspended at the end of the spring semester may elect enroll for at least 6 hours, and achieve the required CGPA at the end of the summer session. The student may then be eligible for full-time enrollment on continued academic probation for the fall semester. If those conditions are not met, the academic suspension would continue until the spring semester, at which time the student may petition the Provost to be re-admitted on academic probation.   A student wishing to appeal an academic suspension must submit a letter to the registrar no later than 4:00 p.m. on the Monday of the week before classes begin for the term during which the student wishes to be readmitted. This letter should explain any extenuating circumstances and accompanying documentation (as needed) that may have contributed to the suspension. The appeal letter will be forwarded to the academic appeals committee, which will review written appeals. These meetings occur during the faculty workshop in August or January and will serve to determine whether any suspensions should be lifted or enforced. Any student reinstated under this process will be re-admitted on academic probation and must limit their academic load to no more than 15 hours. They may also be ineligible for any federal financial aid. The decision of the academic appeals committee is final.  Audit A student may enroll as an auditor in a course with the permission of the student's academic advisor. This status allows the student to listen during class meetings, but not to participate in any grading opportunity. After the end of the Add/Drop period for the term, auditors may not switch to credit status, nor may other students change to auditing. The grade of AU (audit, no credit) will be entered on the student's academic record, unless the auditor withdraws from the course or fails to maintain appropriate attendance, in which case the grade of W will be assigned. In addition to the audit tuition.   In addition to the audit tuition, any applicable institutional or special class fee(s) will be assessed.  Government financial aid cannot be used to pay for audits.  Bible The prime purpose of York College is to place students in direct contact with the Bible and other spiritual stimuli that they may be encouraged in the development of moral and spiritual values and in the appreciation of New Testament Christianity. As a servant of Christian homes, the College is dedicated to the cultivation of full Christian personality in every student.  Each full-time lower division student must remain enrolled in a Bible class each semester.

SPN 113," (3 hours)  4242   Credit by Institutional Testing A student may choose to challenge a lower division course, in which the student is not currently enrolled and for which the student does not have prior credit. To do so, the student requests a comprehensive examination for a course for which no CLEP examination is available. Such requests are to be made to the Registrar and must have the approval of the division chairperson and an instructor of the course. The actual test is constructed by the instructor of the course. Some departments may not participate, so the student must seek approval before taking the test. Passing scores are determined by the department. The examinations are graded on a pass/fail basis. A credit recording fee ($60 per semester hour) is charged in addition to the testing fee.  Credit for Professional/Technical/Experiential Learning  York College recognizes that learning may occur outside the college classroom. Many adult students have gained professional/technical knowledge through employment/career training or have acquired skills and learning from life experiences which are equivalent to that provided in the collegiate classroom. Verified and properly documented professional/technical and/or experiential learning may receive college credit. Application is first made to the Registrar, who will evaluate the submitted materials with the aid of other appropriate faculty. York College will use the recommendations of the National Program on Non-collegiate Sponsored Instruction of the American Council on Education (ACE/PONSI) wherever possible for professional/technical training.  The maximum combined amount of professional/technical and/or experiential learning credit which may be awarded is 30 semester-hours. The special credit fee for evaluation and transcription of such credit must be paid before the credit is placed in the enrolled student’s academic record. Only the grade of “S” will be used for experiential learning. Professional/technical credit will use “S” grades unless the original sponsor of the training issues grades in a system which can be converted to the 4.00 scale.  Although numerous colleges and universities also recognize professional/technical and experiential learning credit, each institution sets its own standards on what and how many credits it will accept in transfer. Students intending to transfer or attend graduate schools should inquire of that institution how experiential credit may be accepted.  “Schools of Preaching”  Schools of Preaching graduates may apply for up to 60 hours of credit in Bible and language courses. Contact the Head of the Bible Department for details.  Entrance Tests Each new student is required to present American College Test (ACT) scores as a part of admission requirements (SAT 1 scores may be substituted). Only scores from national administrations of the test taken may be used to establish athletic eligibility. Test results are made available to the student’s advisor to assist in guiding the student in the selection of courses, the recognition of and removal of weaknesses and the selection of fields of interest compatible with ability and previous preparation. First-time college students may be required to take the Accuplacer Exam in order to aid the advisor in making appropriate course selections and to assist the College in evaluating its own programs.  Grade Point Average A grade point average is a score derived by dividing the total number of quality points received by the total number of semester hours graded. The divisor used in computing the GPA will be the total semester hours attempted minus any course in which a grade of “I,” “NC,” “S,” or “W,” is received.  Grades and Other Academic Record Notations - At York College, the following eight grade indices in descending order 4343   are used: Grade Quality Points A 4.0,  B+ 3.5,  B 3.0,  C+ 2.5,  C 2.0,  D+ 1.5,  D 1.0, F            0.0 (academic failure - no credit), and WF 0.0 (no credit for dropping by failure to attend according to the course or institutional attendance policies).   The following marks are also used on the academic record, but not used in computing the grade point average: AU for audit (non-credit), H appears on the academic record for honors courses, I for incomplete, IS indicates independent study, NC for no credit without reference to quality points, R repeated course, S            for satisfactory completion without quality points (may only be used with the advance approval of the Provost), U for a failing "S" grade, W withdrew during the first 5/8ths of the term, or from all courses (must not have already failed due to absences).  The grade of "I" (Incomplete) is given for passable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control. The following regulations apply to assigning, removing, or changing an I grade: The request for an I grade should be made by the student to the instructor.  Instructors may assign I grades only if the student is unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond the student’s control.  Examples of appropriate circumstances include documented illness, documented death or crisis in the student’s immediate family, and similar circumstances.  In no case is an I grade to be used to avoid the assigning of a D or F grade for marginal or failing work.  To assign an I grade, the student and the instructor must complete an I Grade Form (available in the faculty shared directory or the Office of Academic Affairs).  The instructor will state in writing on the form the steps necessary to complete the remaining course work. The student, the instructor, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs will sign this document.  The I Grade Form will be filed in the office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs no later than the date that the I grade is entered into the computer.    The student is entitled to have the I grade changed on the student’s transcript only if the student completes the remaining course work as specified on the I Grade Form in a manner satisfactory to the instructor.  The work must be completed within 60 days after the “I” grade is assigned and prior to the student’s graduation, or within a shorter period of time if specified by the instructor on the “I” Grade Form. Exceptions to the 60 day requirement may only be granted by the Provost.  If the student fails to complete the coursework, the instructor may change the I grade to any appropriate grade (including D or F).  If the instructor does not change the grade, the Office of Academic Affairs will contact the instructor and then notify the Registrar to change the I grade to the appropriate grade.  The changed grade will be reflected on the transcript in place of the I grade in the semester that the course was originally taken.  4444   The effect of removing the I grade on a student's academic standing (scholastic probation or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is officially recorded on the student's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade replacing the I is included in the grade point average calculation that establishes the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorded after the student begins another semester, the effect of the new grade on academic standing is based upon its inclusion with grades for the semester in which the student is enrolled.  If a student chooses to take a course a second time to improve a poor grade, both grades remain on the academic record, but only the higher grade will be considered in determining cumulative GPA.  Academic Honesty Academic integrity is a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action (Duke University's Kenan Ethics Program).1 Cheating is a serious offense against your peers, your college and yourself. Anytime a student does not abide by the fundamental values of academic integrity, cheating has occurred. Cheating can destroy your personal integrity, and ultimately result in dismissal from York College. Cheating can take many forms, but usually falls into one of the following categories: 1. Fraud - Fraud itself can occur in many different ways; here are some: „ Copying: directly copying another individual's work, either on homework or during a test. „ Misrepresentation: submitting an assignment that someone else completed. This includes turning in downloaded papers and documents (free or for a fee) from the web, papers submitted by previous students, or papers that you've already written for a different class. „ Fictionalized accounts: incorporating fictitious data, statements or sources in your paper or assignment. This could also include listing sources that you did not actually consult or read. „ Unauthorized collaboration: working as a group on assignments designed as work for individuals. Many times it is permissible, and even helpful, for students to work together; however, individuals should present the work from their own perspective, and with their own understanding. "Carbon copies" of assignments are never acceptable.2 2. Plagiarism - Plagiarism is perhaps the ultimate form of theft since it’s not taking something material or physical but taking someone else's words, ideas or visions. Like fraud, it has different forms.3 „ Word-for-word plagiarism: copying exactly or nearly exactly someone else's work. Exact copies of anything anyone else did needs to be clearly indicated as such and also need to have appropriate source citations. „ Lifting-and quilting: taking large or small portions of someone else's work, mixing it around a bit, and throwing-in a few of your own phrases. Entire research papers have been completed with lifting and quilting; it is cheating. „ Quoting without a source: failing to cite the original author of a quote. This can be especially troublesome if you happen to be quoting a quote that is second-hand. If you have any questions about whether something is cheating, always check with your instructor.  Academic integrity relates to the issue of character. York College students need to be persons of academic integrity. ___________________________ 1 http://www.academicintegrity.org/Values.asp 2When working together results in multiple copies of the same assignment being handed-in by members of the group, the group has really degenerated into a cheating session.   The group may discuss strategies or concepts, but individuals still need to accomplish the task themselves. 3These forms are taken from the University of Charleston (http://www.uchaswv.edu/library/plagiarism.html), but there are many web sites that discuss this issue.   Another excellent site is  4545   http://library.ups.edu/research/guides/acadhon.htm.  Academic Dishonesty Cheating, defined as any act of fraud or plagiarism discussed above, will result in severe penalties. The first time a student is caught cheating, a zero will be issued for that assignment or test. If a second offense occurs in the same course, the student will be dropped from the course with a failing grade.  Multiple infractions at the institution may result in academic suspension for one or more semesters.  If the student is dropped from another course with a failing grade for cheating during the same semester, the student will be placed on academic suspension for the following semester.  A student has the right to appeal an incident of alleged cheating. To do so, the student must write a letter to the Provost, or his designee, describing the events surrounding the alleged cheating incident from the student's perspective. The appeal must be made within seven working days of the student being notified of the incident, after that time no appeal will be allowed. The office of the Provost will resolve the appeal within seven working days and notify the student in writing of the results.  Honesty promotes successful college and professional careers and enhances your personal integrity.  Honors Students Students who receive the baccalaureate degree with the following cumulative GPA levels will graduate with the indicated honors: C.GPA Baccalaureate   Associate 3.40 “cum laude”   “with honors” (3.30) 3.60 “magna cum laude”  “with high honors” 3.85 “summa cum laude”  “with very high honors”  Academic Honor Roll published each fall and spring semester. It is composed of those students who carry 12 or more graded hours and achieve a term grade point average of at least 3.75 with no incomplete grade and no grade below “C” for the semester.  Honor Societies Alpha Chi National Honor Scholastic Society exists to promote academic excellence and exemplary character. Membership is extended to those students with a minimum of 60 hours in residence at York College and ranking in the top ten percent of the junior and senior classes.  Alpha Psi Omega National Theatre Honor Society exists to promote excellence and involvement in theatre. Membership is extended to those students who earn 75 points through involvement with the theatre department.  Sigma Tau Delta is the national English honorary society and has an active chapter at York.  Honors Study An academically superior student may be challenged to pursue special study under the guidance of a teacher in an area of specialty. The student must be recommended by a teacher to the Academic Council for approval before enrollment in this program. This study will constitute enrichment for the student but will not substitute for other courses. The student and the professor will meet periodically with an appointed committee to share and evaluate the results of the study.  Independent Study A student who has a special talent or interest in an area of study may request approval for independent study under the guidance of a teacher in that area of study. Prior approval from the head of the department, the department chair and the Provost is required.  4646   Mathematics Placement and /or Credit ACT Math sub scores may be used to satisfy institutional math requirements. Students who opt to satisfy a math requirement through this method must pay the per hour credit recording fee before the credit is recorded on a transcript.

Freshmen are permitted to take some courses numbered in the 200s. Freshmen may not enroll in courses numbered above 299, and sophomores may not enroll in courses numbered above 399 without special permission from the student’s advisor and permission from the instructor. Course numbers listed on a transcript followed by “H” indicate that the student was in an honors section of this course. Courses are offered every year unless otherwise stated. Courses offered on “demand” are not regularly scheduled but will be taught provided 5 or more students need the course to meet graduation requirements. The college reserves the right to withdraw scheduled courses when fewer than 5 students register for such courses.  Records Accessibility All student records which are not specifically exempted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended, (commonly called FERPA) are available on request to all present and former students. Specific exceptions include: 1) Financial records of the student's parents or any information contained therein; 2) Confidential letters and statements of recommendation, which were placed in the educational records prior to 1975, if such statements are not used for purposes other than those for which they were specifically intended; 3) If the student signs a waiver of the right of access to confidential recommendations for each of the following 4747   purposes: for admission, for employment, and/or for honor recognitions, provided that the student, upon request, be notified of the names of all persons making confidential recommendations and that such recommendations be used solely for the purpose for which they were specifically intended; 4) Records of a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, professional counselor, or para-professional, provided the records are created and used only in connection with treatment of the student, and provided that such records are available only to those providing such treatment.

The InTASC standards were developed to serve as a resource for candidate education programs, candidates, and others as we develop policies and programs to prepare, license, support, evaluate today’s candidates.  (http://www.ccsso.org)   The program goals for the candidate education candidates can be described into four main areas:  the learner and learning, content knowledge, instructional practices, and professional responsibility. The program goals are assessed during the candidates freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior year.  They are assessed through a candidate interview, observation of teachings, and portfolios.    Standard #1: Learner Development The candidate understands how learners grow and develop, recognizing that  patterns of learning and development vary individually within and across the cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional, and physical areas, and designs and implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences.   Standard #2: Learning Differences The candidate uses understanding of individual differences and diverse  cultures and communities to ensure inclusive learning environments  that enable each learner to meet high standards.   Standard #3: Learning Environments The candidate works with others to create environments that support  individual and collaborative learning, and that encourage positive social  interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation.   Standard #4: Content Knowledge The candidate understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make these aspects of the discipline accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content.   Standard #5: Application of Content The candidate understands how to connect concepts and use differing  perspectives to engage learners in critical thinking, creativity, and  collaborative problem solving related to authentic local and global issues.   Standard #6: Assessment The candidate understands and uses multiple methods of assessment to  engage learners in their own growth, to monitor learner progress, and  to guide the candidate’s and learner’s decision making.   Standard #7: Planning for Instruction The candidate plans instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous learning goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills, and pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context.   5656   Standard #8: Instructional Strategies The candidate understands and uses a variety of instructional strategies to  encourage learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and their  connections, and to build skills to apply knowledge in meaningful ways.   Standard #9: Professional Learning and Ethical Practice The candidate engages in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to  continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her  choices and actions on others (learners, families, other professionals, and  the community), and adapts practice to meet the needs of each learner.   Standard #10: Leadership and Collaboration The candidate seeks appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility for student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals, and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession.

Through courses in composition, literature, and the English language, the department seeks to provide students with skills and tools, insights and perspectives that will enable them to research and write well in all the courses they take across the curriculum, especially in their major fields of study.  The broader objective of the English Department is to help students write and communicate effectively in a wide variety of occupations. Reading good literature increases students’ appreciation of the history, cultural and social background, and human values found in their literary heritage. Reading diverse literary works exposes students to diverse world views, requires them to develop critical thinking skills, and broadens their cultural background.  The long-term objective of English studies is to grow souls, to produce people who will lead productive and satisfying lives. The great literature of the ages can help give wisdom and insight into the human condition; it constantly raises the great moral and spiritual questions of the ages; it constantly challenges our values and stretches our thinking; it nurtures our understanding, our compassion and all that is highest and best in us; and so in a hundred ways it can help us feed our souls as Christians.  Programs in English Some English students use their major as immediate preparation for a career, usually in K-12 education. For those wishing to pursue a teacher education program, the English Department works with the Department of Education to offer an English Education major that prepares students for teaching at the elementary and secondary levels.  Others approach English as a pre-professional degree that does not translate immediately into a career, but prepares them for more schooling or more professional training. Others have no specific career goal in mind: they simply love to read and want to write well, and they know that doing so will eventually help equip them for their vocations. The York College Department of English provides a strong background in English language and literature for those who wish to pursue graduate studies in English that lead to teaching at advanced levels, and for those who wish to study literature as a pre-professional preparation for such fields as law, medicine, business, communications, etc. Law schools, medical schools, and many businesses have seen the proven value of the intellectual training and the communication skills that the mastery of language and literature provides, so they actively recruit graduates with English degrees. The principles and techniques of rhetoric, grammar, and usage equip students to think and communicate effectively, regardless of the vocational niche they occupy.  The English Curriculum All students must fulfil the freshman composition requirement as part of their general education (Gen Ed) requirements. In addition, to fulfil their Gen Ed artistic expression and critical appreciation requirement all students must take at least 5959   one literature class.
