The mission of ManhattanCollege is to provide a contemporary, person-centered educational experience thatprepares graduates for lives of personal development, professional success, civicengagement, and service to their fellow human beings. The College pursues this missionthrough programs that integrate a broad liberal education with concentration in specificdisciplines in the arts and sciences or with professional preparation in business, educationand engineering.Established in 1853 by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, the Collegecontinues to draw its inspiration from the heritage of John Baptist de La Salle, theinnovator of modern pedagogy and patron saint of teachers. Among the hallmarks of thisLasallian heritage are excellence in teaching, respect for human dignity, reflection onfaith and its relation to reason, an emphasis on ethical conduct, and commitment to socialjustice.Historical NoteIn May 1853, five Christian Brothers moved their small Canal Street school to what wasthen known as Manhattanville, a section of New York City at 131st Street and Broadway.The Brothers brought with them more than their furniture and their students. They werethe bearers of an educational tradition that began in 17th century France with Saint JohnBaptist de La Salle, the founder of their order and today acknowledged by the CatholicChurch as the Patron Saint of Teachers. De La Salle formed a community of religiousBrothers who would devote themselves exclusively to their work as teachers. Theirstudents would be the children of the artisans and the underprivileged; their mission wouldbe the intellectual, spiritual, moral, economic and social flourishing of those students.Responding to the needs of his time, De La Salle created a new type of school systemand elevated the work of teaching school — treating it as a profession and a vocation.The Brothers were urged to go beyond rote memory to “touch the hearts” of the students.Practical subjects were taught that would lead to a useful role in society; religion wastaught to impart a commitment to Christian ethics.Between 1853 and 1863, the school grew significantly, adding college-level courses in1859 and first using the name Manhattan College in 1861. It was chartered by the Boardof Regents of the State of New York on April 2, 1863. Manhattan College was an unusualinstitution compared to its peer institutions at the time. From the beginning, the collegesought to combine broad learning in the traditional liberal arts with rigorous technical andpre-professional training. As the first college catalog put it, the curriculum of ManhattanCollege combined the “advantages of a first-class College and Polytechnic Institute,”offering courses in both “the liberal and useful arts and sciences.”As the school grew, new quarters were needed. The cornerstone of the “New Manhattan”was laid in 1922 on property bordered by the Hudson River and Van Cortlandt Park, in theRiverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, its present location. The addition of new buildingsand student residences has enlarged and enhanced the campus significantly. From this10         Mission and Historyaccessible site, the college is able to offer access to the cultural, educational, businessand entertainment opportunities of New York City, as well as a self-contained residentialcampus environment.Today Manhattan College identifies itself as a Catholic college in the Lasallian tradition.That tradition has continued to characterize the special educational experience offeredby the College over its long history. Its constant focus has been the education of thedisadvantaged. From its beginning, the College has paid particular attention to educatingfirst-generation college students, and was an early proponent of access to disadvantagedand minority students, establishing special scholarship funds as early as 1938. Thatcommitment continues today and is evident in Manhattan’s diverse student body, many ofwhom are the first in their families to attend college, and most of whom are supported bysignificant financial aid.The College continues to realize the objectives stated in its first catalog by maintaininga full range of programs in the liberal arts (http://www.manhattan.edu/academics/arts) and sciences (http://www.manhattan.edu/academics/science), combined withprofessional programs in engineering (http://www.manhattan.edu/academics/engineering),business (http://www.manhattan.edu/academics/business) and education (http://www.manhattan.edu/academics/education). The quality of the undergraduate programsis demonstrated in many ways, for example, in the presence on campus of chapters ofprestigious honor societies (http://www.manhattan.edu/about/national-honor-societies)such as Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi and Tau Beta Pi.Over the years, Manhattan College has seen many changes, and yet it maintains its deepcommitment to its heritage and ideals. What was a predominantly Christian Brothersfaculty has become predominantly lay, and includes a significant percentage of women.The College became coeducational and accepted its first women undergraduate studentsin 1973. Currently, women comprise almost half of the full-time undergraduate studentbody.With the opening of Horan Hall (1990) and its twin, East Hill (2008), the Collegecompleted a major transformation from a majority-commuter to a majority-residentialcollege. Manhattan College now offers a four-year guarantee of resident housing(http://www.manhattan.edu/student_life/residence-halls) and 80 percent of the studentbody chooses to live on or near campus. Currently, the College has a student body ofapproximately 3,500 — 2,900 undergraduates and 600 graduate and continuing educationstudents. The student-faculty ratio is 12:1.The College continues to follow the founding spirit of John Baptist de La Salle by beingresponsive to the needs of its place and time. Innovation grounded in tradition has alwaysbeen a hallmark of Lasallian education, and Manhattan College’s new strategic plan(http://www.manhattan.edu/about/strategic-plan), “Renewing the Promise,” commits theCollege to a course of continuous improvement of its programs and facilities in responseto emerging needs.Manhattan College            11AccreditationRecognition and MembershipManhattan College is chartered and empowered to confer academic degrees by the NewYork State Education Department.It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, 3624 MarketStreet, Philadelphia, 4-2680, 215-662-5606, http://www.msche.org/.

The intent of thelegislation is to protect the rights of students and to ensure the privacy and accuracy of"educational information."  Educational Information refers to any record maintained by aneducational institution, including files, documents, and materials of any type which containinformation directly related to students, and which allows a student to be identified.What is not considered Educational Information?•Sole possession records or private notes held by educational personnel which are notaccessible or released to other personnel•Records that are created by the campus law enforcement unit at least in part for a lawenforcement purpose•Records related to individuals who are employed by the college•Records related to treatment provided by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist orother recognized professional•Records of the college which contain only information about an individual obtainedafter that person is no longer a student at the college (i.e., alumni records)Who is protected under FERPA?Students who are protected under FERPA are those students who are currently enrolledor formerly enrolled, regardless of their age or status in regard to parental dependency. Students who have applied but have not attended the college, and deceased students donot fall under FERPA guidelines.Student's rights under FERPAEligible students have the right to inspect and review their educational records within 45days of the day Manhattan College receives a request for access. The eligible studentshould submit the request to the Registrar and identify the record(s) they wish to inspect.The Registrar will make arrangements for access and will notify the student of the time/place where the records may be inspected.An eligible student may also ask the college to amend a record believed to be inaccurateor misleading.  If the school decides to not amend the record, the parent or studentthen has a right to a formal hearing.  If, after the hearing, the school still chooses to notamend the record, the eligible student has the right to place a statement with the recordcommenting on the contested information.Lastly, a student may formally request that Manhattan College not release DirectoryInformation on their behalf.  This request must be submitted to the Registrar.  When thisrequest is made, a notation will be flagged in the MC Student Information System andevery reasonable effort will be made to safeguard the confidentiality of such information.When is a student's consent not required?20         FERPAThere are several exceptions to releasing information without a student's written approval.  Some examples are:•School officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a personemployed by Manhattan College in an administrative, supervisory, academic, orsupport staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff);a person or company with whom Manhattan College has contracted (such as anattorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees;or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievancecommittee, or assisting another school official in performing their tasks. A schoolofficial has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educationrecord in order to fulfill their professional responsibility.•In connection with Financial Aid•Other schools to which a student is seeking to transfer/enroll•Parents of a dependent student, as defined by the IRS.  The college may releasea student's records upon request, but the parent must submit proof of the student'sdependency (via most recent federal tax form) prior to receiving the requestedinformation•Individuals who have obtained court orders or legally issued subpoenas•Certain government officials in order to carry out lawful functions•State and local authorities within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific Statelaw•Health and safety emergencies•Accrediting organizations or organizations conducting studies for MC•Any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- orstate-supported education programDirectory InformationUnder FERPA guidelines, a student's record may not be disclosed without writtenauthorization unless the requested information falls under the category of "DirectoryInformation."  MC may disclose information on a student without violating FERPA if it hasdesignated that information as Directory Information.

Each student in Liberal Arts selects a major field of study. Itis chosen on the basis of the individual’s interests, educational and career goals, andabilities. Double majors are possible with careful planning, but students are encouraged totake as many elective courses as possible.In Liberal Arts, the areas of specialization from which a student selects a major include thefollowing fields:•Art history•Communication•Economics•English•French•History•Philosophy•Political ScienceManhattan College            31•Psychology•Religious Studies•Sociology•SpanishIn addition, five interdisciplinary majors are available to students in Liberal Arts:•Environmental Studies•International Studies•Labor Studies•Peace and Justice Studies•Urban StudiesThese programs are designed to enhance a student's knowledge of a particular area ofstudy not easily confined to a traditional academic department and to help the studentdevelop an ability to address multiple perspectives.Requirements for the major fields are listed under the department or program.Students may not take more than 42 credits in their major without the permission of theDepartment Chair and the Dean. There is a residency requirement in the major for alltransfer students: no more than 12 credits (9 credits in Communication) may transfertoward the major. Students are encouraged to develop a minor or a cluster.Minor Fields of StudyMinors may be earned in all departments and major programs offered by the Schoolof Liberal Arts and in some interdisciplinary areas such as Catholic Studies, Ethics,Film Studies, Medieval Studies, and Women and Gender Studies. Minimum graderequirements for the minor are the same as those for the major. A minor consists of 15credits. The same course cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of both a major anda minor.Students in Liberal Arts may pursue minors in other schools at Manhattan: in ComputerInformation Systems, Finance, General Business, Management, and Marketing in theSchool of Business; a general Education minor without state certification in the School ofEducation & Health; or a minor in Science or in a specific Science or in Mathematics orComputer Science. Students must earn a grade of C or better in all courses taken for theminor in these schools. Students generally take no more than fifteen credits in Business orEducation.ElectivesMost programs in Liberal Arts include the opportunity for a student to select particularelectives to meet individual needs. Often elective courses are selected on the basis oftheir relationship to the student’s major field of study; they also enable students to developa minor field of study, to structure a second major, or to explore new areas of knowledge.Electives should not be selected without serious consideration. Students are advised toconsult regularly with their advisors concerning their electives.32         Liberal Arts - General InformationStudents generally take no more than fifteen credits in Business, Education, Science, orEngineering. Any courses taken in these programs must be approved by the appropriatechair. Students interested in exercising any of these options must consult with theAcademic Advisor in the School of Liberal Arts.Please note: Credits earned in Aerospace Studies may not be used for any degreeprogram in Liberal Arts. Students may not take more than three credits total in health andphysical education courses.Student Course LoadStudents may not take more than eighteen credits in the Fall or the Spring semesterwithout the written approval of the Dean of Liberal Arts. Students may not take more thanthree credits in the January or May intersession or the summer session without the writtenapproval of the Dean of Liberal Arts.Bachelor of Science in General StudiesThe curriculum for the degree program in General Studies is an alternative to the usualundergraduate curriculum. It features an area of concentration rather than a major,and three areas of lesser concentration. Consequently, there is less specialization, butopportunity for broader and more structured general education. Each program providescore requirements in English, fine arts, history, mathematics and science, philosophy,psychology, religious studies, and sociology as a foundation for self-enrichment,appreciation, and understanding. The basic core requires forty-eight credits, including ninecredits in religious studies.A student is required to take one area of greater concentration (a minimum of eighteencredits beyond the core curriculum) in one of the following areas:•Art history•Biology•Chemistry•Computer science•Economics•Education•English•French•History•International studies•Mathematics•Peace and Justice Studies•Philosophy•Physics•Political Science•PsychologyManhattan College            33•Religious studies•Sociology•Spanish•Urban studiesNo language courses at the 100-level count in the greater concentration and no more thantwo 200-level courses or six credits of AP may count toward the greater concentration.Students must achieve a grade of C or better in all courses in the greater concentration.In addition, a student must follow three areas of lesser concentration (a minimum oftwelve credits each beyond the core curriculum) in fields other than the area of greaterconcentration. Fields of lesser concentration may be selected from the following areas:•Accounting•Applied science•Art history•Business (general)•Biology•Chemistry•Computer science•Computer information systems•Economics•Education•Engineering•English•Fine arts•French•General science•History•International studies•Japanese•Management•Marketing•Mathematics•Peace and Justice Studies•Philosophy•Physics•Political Science•Psychology•Religious studies•Sociology34         Liberal Arts - General Information•Spanish•Urban studiesNo language courses at the 100-level count in the lesser concentration and no more thantwo 200-level courses or six credits of AP may count toward the lesser concentration.Students must achieve a grade of C or better in all courses in the lesser concentrations.The balance of the program will include electives. A student’s program should not includeelectives that exceed twenty-four credits in the field of greater concentration or eighteencredits in the fields of lesser concentration. No more than 18 credits in any combinationmay be taken in courses offered by the Schools of Business, Education, or Engineering,including courses taken in a concentration. No more than 3 credits may be taken inPhysical Education and/or Health Education combined. Credits earned in AerospaceStudies do not count toward graduation in this program. Students in this program musttake at least 75 credits in the liberal arts and sciences.Academic AdvisingAll freshmen and those sophomores who have not yet declared a major are advised bythe Academic Advisor for the School of Liberal Arts. Students who have chosen theirmajor are advised by the Chair of their department or their assigned delegate. Transferstudents plan their first semester with the Academic Advisor.Study Abroad OpportunitiesThe School of Liberal Arts encourages students to broaden their educational horizons byparticipating in foreign study programs. In order to participate in such a program a studentmust have a minimum cumulative index of 2.75.Arts is affiliated with the American Institute for Foreign Study and is also associated withthe Institute for European Study and its campuses world-wide. Foreign study opportunitiesare available in many countries.Further information about these and a wide range of other study abroad opportunities isavailable through the Director for International Programs, Professor Nevart Wanger, orthe Coordinator of Study Abroad, Mrs. Nancy Cave. All foreign study programs must beapproved by the Office of the Dean of Liberal Arts after consultation with the Director forInternational Programs.Credit for Off-Campus CoursesOnce matriculated into a degree-granting program (major) at Manhattan College(College), a student may not take off-campus courses offered by another accreditedinstitution for transfer to the College without prior written approval from the student’sacademic advisor and the student’s dean. A maximum of 12 credits may be taken in off-campus courses after matriculation.  Each school may set limitations on what types ofcourses may or may not be approved for its students that are consistent with the College’soverall requirements.Credit for courses taken at other institutions by matriculated students of ManhattanCollege will be recognized under the following conditions:Manhattan College            351.Required courses in a major or in a minor may not be taken off-campus except inextenuating circumstances and with compelling reasons, and with the approval of thechair of the major or minor program.2.Only courses from accredited two- and four-year colleges and from accrediteduniversities will be considered.3.Written approval to take courses with departmental or school course numbersis obtained in advance.  First, the chair of the department offering the course atManhattan must approve the off-campus course based on the equivalency orsubstitutability of the course.  Second, the Dean of the student’s school must approvethe off-campus course based on the chair’s assessment and other circumstances.On-line courses are acceptable if approved.  Approval to take courses withoutdepartmental or school course numbers may be approved by the dean.4.The required form and transcript are filed with the Registrar and the required fee ispaid to the Bursar.5.The grade received at the other institution must be equivalent to or higher than theManhattan College grade of C.6.Grades earned at other institutions will not be transferred to the student’s record atManhattan College.7.Study-abroad courses do not count toward the 12-credit maximum.8.The required nine (9) credits of Religious Studies courses – oots:Music-1st Year SeminarTo fulfil the Social Science requirement, students in the School of Liberal Arts select 3,and students in the School of Science select 2, of the following courses:"
RELS 110,", a 200-level course in Catholic Studies, and a 300-level course from Global Studies andContemporary Issues – are at the core of the Lasallian heritage of the College. Generally, these courses will be taken on-campus.  These courses are offered in bothin-class and online formats by the College.  A required RELS course may be takenoff-campus if the RELS program does not offer enough openings in the course.  Anyexceptions will only be permitted for one of the three-credit RELS courses and as partof the overall 12 credits allowed.  Any RELS course taken off-campus to meet the ninecredit hour requirement will require review for equivalency or substitutability by thedean of the School of Liberal Arts before approval by the student’s dean.1.Each School may adopt additional guidelines to meet specific accreditation orcurricular requirements for its programs.This policy will come into force starting the 2017-2018 academic year for all studentsenrolled at that time and subsequently.Honor Societies and Research OpportunitiesThe faculty of Liberal Arts, in order to encourage and reward the development of seriousscholarship among its students, have established on campus a number of national honorsocieties. Chief among these are Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi.Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, is dedicated to the ideal of excellence in scholarship inthe liberal arts and sciences and is widely regarded as a mark of the highest distinction.The Manhattan College Chapter, the Upsilon of New York, was chartered in 1971.Students elected to Phi Beta Kappa are chosen from among those students who haveachieved general scholastic excellence.36         Liberal Arts - General InformationSigma Xi is a national honor society founded in 1886 that encourages original research inthe pure and applied sciences. Students are elected to membership on the basis of theiraccomplishments in research and their enthusiasm for continued scientific investigation.In addition, most academic departments sponsor local chapters of national honor societiesin their disciplines. The faculty are dedicated to encouraging student research efforts andare pleased to have students join them in their own research. Indeed, one of the hallmarksof Manhattan College is the frequency with which students and faculty join together inresearch projects.Independent study courses are available in most departments for students seekingthe opportunity to do advanced-level study with a faculty member in an area notordinarily covered by regular coursework. In addition, many departments sponsorsupervised internships and field-study opportunities through the department or through theCooperative Education Program.Of special note are the Branigan Scholars Grants. These grants, established in 1967through the generous contributions of Edward Vincent Branigan ’40 with matching giftsfrom major corporations and support from the National Endowment for the Humanities,provide summer stipends for students pursuing research projects independent of theircourse work.InternshipsOpportunities for off-campus work experiences that carry course credit toward graduationare available to juniors and seniors in the School of Liberal Arts through internshipcourses offered by departments and programs. Internship courses are numbered 375 or475. Frequent meetings with the internship advisor and a paper are required. Internshipsare arranged through the Center for Career Development and must be approved inadvance by their chair or advisor and by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts.Graduate Awards and FellowshipsManhattan College is among a small, select group of American Colleges sending largenumbers of students on to graduate schools. To continue this tradition, the college hasdeveloped programs to assist students seeking information about graduate programs andparticularly about fellowships and scholarships for graduate study. Further information isavailable from the Center for Graduate School and Fellowship Advisement and from thedepartmental chairs.Prelegal Advisory CommitteeStudents interested in entering law school should seek guidance through the PrelegalAdvisory Committee.

A chemicalengineer’s education permits the student to work in design and construction, computersimulation, specialty chemicals, industrial gases, food processing, petroleum fractionation,power generation, polymers, pollution prevention and remediation, safety and accidentmanagement, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, or pulp and paper industries.The Chemical Engineering program includes course work in material and energybalances, thermodynamics, reaction engineering, heat and mass transfer, separationprocesses, transport phenomena, and plant design, plus elective courses such as projectmanagement, engineering economics, accident and emergency management and greenengineering. Lectures are complemented by comprehensive laboratory courses withexperiments in both traditional and emerging technologies, ranging from unit operationssuch as distillation and filtration, to unique applications such as the development ofalternative energies. Computer usage, including software, programming, professionaldesign packages and data acquisition, and engineering ethics are integrated throughoutthe curriculum.Students are prepared for both professional employment and graduate study. Chemicalengineering students who plan to enter the medical profession must complete , one RELS 2XXelective and one RELS 3XX elective.  In addition, chemical engineering students arerequired to take additional General Education Electives.cStudents must take 1 advanced science elective (chemistry, math or physics) insenior year from an approved list provided by the Chemical Engineering departmentchair.  Certain advanced level mathematics courses will also count towards amathematics minor.Courses The Nature and Experience of Religion, a 200 level course in CatholicStudies, an upper level course in Global Studies or Contemporary issues.* A full-year requirementHonor Societies and Research OpportunitiesA number of national honor societies have been established on campus in order toencourage and recognize the achievements of Manhattan College students.Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, is dedicated to the idea of excellence in the liberal artsand sciences. The Manhattan College chapter, the Upsilon of New York was establishedin 1971. Election to Phi Beta Kappa is generally regarded as a mark of the highestdistinction.Sigma Xi is a national honor society founded in 1896 to encourage research in thesciences. Students are elected to membership on the basis of their accomplishments inresearch and their enthusiasm for continued scientific investigation.Departments of the School of Science sponsor local chapters of national honor societiesin their disciplines; Beta Beta Beta (Biology), Gamma Sigma Epsilon (Chemistry), Pi MuEpsilon (Mathematics), Sigma Pi Sigma (Physics).The Science faculty are dedicated to encouraging student research efforts. Manhattan’ssmall classes and close student-faculty interactions generate an atmosphere which hasproduced many important student-faculty research collaborations.Professional and Career DevelopmentPrelegal Advisory CommitteeStudents interested in entering law school may receive information and guidance throughthe Prelegal Advisory Committee. In addition to personal interviews, the Committeeconducts group meetings to advise students on specialized fields of law. The Committeemakes information available on requirements for admission to law schools, the availabilityof scholarships, and special opportunities in the legal professionHealth Professions Advisory CommitteeThe Health Professions Advisory Committee is a body of faculty members who giveguidance to students interested in preparing for careers in medicine, dentistry, andallied fields. Students are advised of the requirements established by the Association ofAmerican Medical Colleges, the American Dental Association, and other professionalassociations in the health field.Manhattan College            369Preparation for Medicine and DentistryStudents preparing for professional school admission may major in any discipline in theCollege. Their preparation must include, at a minimum, the following courses., a 200-level course in Catholic Studies, and a 300-level course from Global Studies andContemporary Issues – are at the core of the Lasallian heritage of the College. Generally, these courses will be taken on-campus.  These courses are offered in bothin-class and on-line formats by the College.  A required RELS course may be takenoff-campus if the RELS program does not offer enough openings in the course.  Anyexceptions will only be permitted for one of the three-credit RELS courses and as partof the overall 12 credits allowed.  Any RELS course taken off-campus to meet the nine488         Academic Policies & Procedurescredit hour requirement will require review for equivalency or substitutability by thedean of the School of Liberal Arts before approval by the student’s dean.8.Each School may adopt additional guidelines to meet specific accreditation orcurricular requirements for its programs.This policy will come into force starting the 2017-2018 academic year for all studentsenrolled at that time and subsequently.Leave of AbsenceStudents currently enrolled in Manhattan College who wish to leave the College in thefollowing semester for personal, medical or psychological reasons, after which they intendto return, should request a leave of absence from the Dean of his or her School.  Withapproval, a student can take a leave of absence not to exceed one year.  Studentsrequesting a leave of absence for medical or psychological reasons must have theirrequests reviewed by the Director of Counseling and Health Services.If the request for a leave of absence is approved, a maintenance-of-matriculationregistration must be completed and will be used to maintain the student’s matriculationstatus active during the leave. In addition, the maintenance-of-matriculation registrationpermits the student, on their return to Manhattan College, to follow the degree programrequirements in effect at the time the leave was granted. In special circumstances, astudent may apply through their Dean’s office for one (and only one) additional semesterof leave by completing a maintenance-of-matriculation registration. If a student is notreturning after the approved maintenance of matriculation is over, they must inform theirAcademic Advisor.A student whose request is approved will be billed a maintenance-of-matriculation fee.Generally, students who have been approved for a leave of absence do not need to applyfor reinstatement to the College. In addition, any academic scholarships awarded by theCollege will remain available to them after a one-semester leave of absence, providedthey continue to meet the eligibility requirements. Students taking a leave of absence whoare recipients of federal Title IV financial aid must consult with Student Financial Servicesto determine the implications of that leave on their financial aid eligibility.A leave of absence for medical or psychological reasons requires prior approval of theDirector of the Counseling Center. When the leave of absence is granted for medical orpsychological reasons, the student can return to Manhattan College only after the Directorof Counseling and Health Services has indicated that the medical or psychologicalcondition has been addressed and the student is capable of resuming their studiesat Manhattan. To this end, the student will be required to submit a written progressassessment from a treating health professional attesting to the student’s readiness toresume studies at Manhattan College. This documentation must address the diagnosis,prognosis and treatment plan for the semester of return. The Director of Counseling andHealth Services may also require a release from the student to discuss current treatmentand follow-up needs with the treating health professional, in order to assess whether thestudent is qualified and ready to return to the College. The director of counseling andhealth services approves the return of all students who have been granted a leave ofabsence for medical or psychological reasons.Manhattan College            489If a student is approved for a leave of absence and later is suspended, dismissed orplaced on probation as a result of academic issues or suspended or expelled as the resultof a judicial decision, these sanctions take precedence over a leave of absence and standas a matter of record.ProceduresGradesFinal grades can be viewed on self-service at the end of each semester and at theconclusion of work in the Summer and January Intersessions. Mid-term grades are issuedto all undergraduate students to indicate their standing in courses up to that time andto assist faculty and advisors in providing students the necessary guidance they mightrequire. These mid-semester grades are not recorded on the permanent academic record.Contested GradesIf a student believes that their final grade in a course is not consistent with the gradingcriteria designated by the course instructor, the student should first discuss the matter withthe course instructor. If the student and the instructor cannot resolve the matter in thisdiscussion, the student may discuss the matter with the department chair. Copies of allgraded tests, quizzes, and other assignments will be needed.In the event that the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the discussions withthe course instructor and the chair, the student may make a written request to the chairfor a formal consideration of the problem. This request must be submitted within threeweeks after the beginning of the semester immediately following the regular Fall or Springsemester. Included in the request will be an outline of the student’s specific complaints.The chair shall make a detailed investigation and shall notify the student and courseinstructor of his or her findings. The student may appeal the findings of the chair to theDean of the school in which the course was offered. The Dean of the school will respondto the student in writing and will preserve the documentation of the process. When thedepartment chair is the course instructor, the student may appeal to the Dean of theschool in which the course was taught who will investigate the matter and notify thestudent and the department chair of their findings.Students should be aware that only the course instructor may change a grade.Grade ChangesAll course grades (except “I” grades) are intended to be final and permanent. It isexpected that course instructors will determine and report final grades as accurately andprecisely as the nature of the evaluation of student achievement and the grading systemwill permit. It is considered the instructor’s direct and personal responsibility to ensure thatgrades are fair and reported correctly.Notwithstanding all precautions, faculty members can make errors. When this occurs,the errors should be corrected so that students are not unfairly penalized. If a courseinstructor decides to request a grade correction, the appropriate forms must be completedand sent to the Dean of the school in which the course was taught. A copy of the changeof grade form will be sent to the Dean of the school where the student is registered.Except in the case of contested grades, all requests for correcting grades must be490         Academic Policies & Proceduressubmitted by last day of the fourth week of the semester of the following Fall or Springsemester.

For the purpose of computing grade point averages, thecorresponding numerical equivalents for letter grades will be used:GradeQuality PointsA4.0A-3.67B+3.33B3.0B-2.67C+2.33C2.0C-1.67D+1.33D1.0P0.0F0.0W  Withdrawal. Indicates withdrawal from a course in which the student is regularlyenrolled. The student is required to have the withdrawal notification form signed by theinstructor of the course and the dean of the student's school. The dead-line for withdrawalfrom a course will be the end of the twelfth week of the semester. In “W” courses, neitherquality hours nor quality points are assigned.P Passing. No quality points assigned.NC No Credit.P/F Pass/Fail. In Pass/Fail courses, neither grade influences the grade point average.Credit is awarded for a P grade; no credit for F.Quality points and quality hours are assigned for every credit attempted at Manhattanexcept those taken on a Pass/Fail basis, and those for which designations of a W or an Ihave been assigned. The scholarship index is determined by dividing the total number ofquality points earned by the total number of quality hours.For all students, the cumulative scholarship index is computed at the end of eachsemester; for those who attend the summer or winter sessions it is also computed at theend of each session.GPA CalculationComputing the Grade Point Index (GPA)The following is the method by which a student’s GPA is calculated:1. Multiply the quality points equal to the grade by the number of credits for which thegrade was earnedManhattan College            503       A=4.00 quality points x 3 credits = 12.00 points2. Add the total quality points earned in a semester3. Divide by the total number of credits for a semesterThe total quality points, divided by the total credits equals the GPA for the semester. Tocompute a cumulative grade point average, include all MC courses taken to date anddivide by the total number of credits for which grades other than W, P, NC, AUD, havebeen earned or given.504         GraduationGraduationGraduation PolicyEach student is expected to be familiar with the academic regulations of the Collegeand the particular requirements of their educational program.

An appointment should be made withthe appropriate Academic Advisor to have an exit interview and to complete the requiredform. This form must be completely filled out or students will not be eligible for tuitionadjustments and may be responsible for paying back any financial aid received from theCollege. Students will be considered withdrawn on the date that they officially notify theCollege. Students who withdraw from the College after the last day for course withdrawalwill receive a grade of “F” for all courses during the session unless a waiver is granted bythe Provost for medical, psychological or emergency reasons. In this case, the student willreceive a grade of “W” for all courses during that session.Administrative WithdrawalA student may be administratively withdrawn from the College:1.If the student fails to register for classes by the end of the add/drop period.2.If the student fails to attend classes by the end of the add/drop period.3.If the student has not returned to the College or fails to qualify to return to the Collegewhen the approved period of leave of absence has expired.4.If the student has not returned after academic or disciplinary suspension at the timespecified and the period of suspension has not been expended.5.If in extraordinary circumstances a student is unable or unwilling to request a voluntaryleave of absence or a voluntary medical leave of absence and there is a clear needto protect the safety of the student and/or others, or to protect the integrity of theCollege’s learning environment.Involuntary Medical LeaveIf the College determines that a student should be placed on a leave due to medical orpsychological reasons related to the health and safety of the student, Manhattan Collegereserves the right to place a student on an involuntary withdrawal from the student’sacademic program of study.  This may occur when the student is not able or willing to takea voluntary leave and the College has made a reasonable determination that the studentposes a direct threat to the health and/or safety of self and others.Where Manhattan College believes that an involuntary withdrawal is to be considered, theDean of Students will identify a team of professionals to make a reasoned determination.Included on that decision-making team will be a medical or mental health professional.The student will be informed of the College’s concerns and the pending decision toconsider an involuntary withdrawal.The College reserves the right to notify parents or legal guardians if deemed appropriateunder the circumstances and applicable law, including making arrangements for familyManhattan College            513members to pick the student up from the College’s facilities, house the student or obtainhealth care assistance.Reinstatement Following WithdrawalA student who withdraws or is withdrawn from the College may apply for reinstatement.In order to return to the College from a withdrawn status, a student must make a requestin writing to their Dean at least eight weeks before the beginning of the semester to whichthe student seeks to return. The College reserves the right to require, review and approvedocumentation that the student is qualified and ready to return to academic work.In the case of a voluntary withdrawal for medical/psychological reasons, or anyadministrative withdrawal under this policy related to a physical or mental health condition,the student must submit a written progress assessment from a treating health professionalas part of the request for reinstatement. The Director of Counseling and Health Servicesmay require a release from the student to discuss current treatment and follow-up needswith the treating health professional, in order to assess whether the student is qualifiedand ready to return to the College and whether the College can provide the follow-upcare needed to maintain the student’s enrollment. The Director of Counseling and HealthServices approves the return of all students who have withdrawn or been withdrawn formedical or psychological reasons.Students who are reinstated following a withdrawal from College will comply with thedegree requirements of the catalog in effect when they are reinstated.Withdrawal from a CourseAfter the Add/Drop period at the beginning of each semester, students are permitted towithdraw from a course without academic penalty until the twelfth week of the semester.The required course withdrawal form is available in the office of their Dean. Withdrawingfrom a course after the Add/Drop period and before the deadline for all withdrawals placesa W on the transcript for that course. After the withdrawal deadline at the end of the twelfthweek, the student will receive a grade of F for that course unless there are extraordinarycircumstances (such as severe illness) that merit an exception. Students are cautioned toavoid a pattern of regularly accumulating W grades on their transcripts.Course RequirementsAt the beginning of each semester or session, each instructor is expected in each courseto state the objectives of the course, indicate the course requirements, and the criteria tobe used in evaluating the performance of students. Each instructor is also expected toannounce whether a final examination for the course will be given, and likewise will outlinethe course requirements and indicate the criteria to be used in evaluating the performanceof students.514         Administrative Officers & StaffAdministrative Officers & StaffThe President's OfficeBrennan O’Donnell, Ph.D., President (2009-)Veronica Boland, M.S., Executive Assistant to the President (2009-)Barbara Herlihy - Administrative Coordinator (2011-)Tamara Britt, J.D., General Counsel of Manhattan College (2017-)Robert Walsh,M.A., Senior Advisor to the President for Strategic Partnerships (2018-)Academic AffairsWilliam C.

An application fee of $75 is required. In some cases a student may befinancially eligible for a fee waiver from the College Board or NACAC, issued by their highschool counselor.Freshman AdmissionsCourse Selection and PerformanceIn reviewing applications for admission, the following items are considered by theCommittee on Admissions.Most emphasis is placed upon student course selection on the secondary level andgrades earned in those subjects.All applicants must have completed a minimum of 16 units in academic subjects whichshould include the followingSubjectRequired UnitsRecommended UnitsEnglish44Modern or ClassicalLanguage23Science (Lab Sciences)24Mathematics*34Social Studies34Electives2At the discretion of the Committee on Admissions, quantitative requirements may bemodified for applicants with strong records who show promise of doing well in collegework.*This includes algebra, geometry, intermediate algebra/trigonometry (sequence I, IIand III).SAT and/or ACT ScoresThe Committee on Admissions requires all U.S. applicants for freshman admission tosubmit SAT or ACT scores. Only a student’s highest scores are considered for admissionand scholarship eligibility.  While these scores are an important part of an application,they are considered in combination with other requirements.  SAT or ACT scores allowthe Committee to see how well applicants do in areas fundamental to predicting collegereadiness, using a third-party tool that is not influenced by local grading practices. In thatregard, they are helpful. However, we are aware that tests have limitations, and placehigher emphasis on high school curriculum and grade point average.The Committee on Admissions will accept both the SAT (pre- spring 2016), theredesigned SAT.  The Committee will use concordances (how scores from one versionManhattan College            523translate into the other one), released by the College Board to ensure that neitherscore is advantaged over the other, even if the numeric scores are slightly different. It isrecommended that students submit the optional essay component of the redesigned SATexam.RecommendationsGrades and examination scores alone do not adequately evaluate a student’s ability tobe successful in college. Therefore, appropriate character references are consideredimportant when reviewing candidates for admission. One letter of recommendation froma teacher or guidance counselor is required. Applicants may submit up to three academicletters. Students are also permitted to submit an additional character reference.Essay or Personal StatementApplicants must submit a brief personal statement or college essay, using either theManhattan College essay topic or one of the Common Application essay topics listedbelow:1. Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful theybelieve their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then pleaseshare your story. 2. The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount anincident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did youlearn from the experience?3. Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act?Would you make the same decision again?4. Describe a problem you've solved or a problem you'd like to solve. It can be anintellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma - anything that is of personalimportance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took orcould be taken to identify a solution.5. Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transitionfrom childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family. This essay should be no longer than 650 words.The General Equivalency Diploma (G.E.D.)Accepted in lieu of a high school diploma for admission to some programs of the College.  Please note that the Committee on Admissions requires students to submit a record ofany high school coursework taken even if a student is submitting G.E.D. scores.Committee on Admissions In rare instances the Committee on Admissions will consider waiving the aboverequirements for admission.

As the nation's focus on the environment continues to grow, there is anever-increasing demand for environmental science jobs. If you're seeking a career in thisfield, you can look forward to a far more robust job market than graduates of many otherdisciplines according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The goal of the Environmental Science program is to provide a foundation forunderstanding issues and solving problems involving our natural environment. It isan interdisciplinary science program that focuses on the state of the environment andserious environmental problems that the world faces. The program provides studentswith a strong science background focused on the environmental issues. Students willbe expected to take a variety of courses in numerous departments. Through a series ofacademic courses and co-curricular activities, you will get hands-on experience and obtainthe critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary in order to solve the complex,interdisciplinary environmental problems facing the local community and society at large. The Environmental Sciences Program offers Bachelor of Science degree and a Bachelorof Arts degree in Environmental Sciences.Our interdisciplinary science program is supported by a team of academic departments.Professors work closely with Environmental Sciences undergraduates as their studybecomes more specialized. Such individual attention leads to fruitful partnerships whenstudents become involved in research and other student-centered learning activities.Through coursework, projects and activities, you will develop scientific research, writing,and presentation skills.Individual Attention and MentoringStudents will receive individual attention during their entire undergraduate career. Eachstudent plans a course of study in close cooperation with a faculty advisor, and thestudent's progress is closely coordinated with developing interests. Undergraduatesare strongly encouraged to pursue independent research as an essential part of theireducational program.Career ChoicesAccording to Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of environmental scientistsis projected to grow 15 percent from 2012 to 2022, faster than the average for alloccupations. You will be prepared to enter government, academic, private or non-profitcareers or to continue your education in a variety of scientific disciplines. Graduates wouldbe trained to work in fields including environmental consulting, laboratory or field research,environmental education, environmental law, pollution engineering, toxicology and wastemanagement.444         Environmental ScienceBachelor of Science in Environmental ScienceFirst YearFallCreditsSpringCreditsalculus I   and Calculus II6Specific schools may require or recommend other courses.

In order to participate in such a program, a student must generally havea minimum cumulative index of 2.75 (some programs require 3.00). Students generallytake a semester or a year abroad in their junior year, and occasionally in first semester ofsenior year. Participation in Study Abroad in second semester of senior year may interferewith graduating on time. Several short-term, faculty lead programs are available alsoduring January intersession and during the summer.The College offers Study Abroad opportunities in many countries, including Manhattan’sown programs at the University of Madrid, at the Istituto Europeo in Florence, and at AIEin Buenos Aires. Exchange programs are available at the Universities of Paris (throughMICEFA), LaSalle University of Mexico City and LaSalle University of Barcelona, Spain.Study Abroad programs are also available through our partnership with the colleges anduniversities of LaSallian International Programs Consortium and the Lower Hudson ValleyCatholic College and University Consortium.All foreign study programs must be approved by the Dean of the School in which thestudent is enrolled and the Dean of Students, in consultation with the Director of StudyAbroad Programs. Further information is available through the Study Abroad Office.Manhattan College            481Academic Policies & ProceduresAll students shall abide by the Manhattan College Community Standards and StudentCode of Conduct which can be found at http://manhattan.edu/community-standards-and-student-code-conduct .For crimes of violence, including, but not limited to sexual violence, or crimes that meetthe reporting requirements pursuant to the federal Clery Act, Manhattan College shallmake a notation on the transcript of students found responsible through a judicial processpursuant to the Student Code of Conduct. It will be noted that they were "suspendedafter a finding of responsibility for a Code of Conduct violation" or "expelled after afinding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation." For the student who withdrawsfrom the College while such conduct charges are pending, and declines to completethe disciplinary process, institutions shall make a notation on the transcript of suchstudents that they "withdrew with conduct charges pending." Appeals seeking removalof a transcript notation for suspension can be directed to the Dean of Students and willbe heard, provided that such notation will not be removed prior to one year after theconclusion of the suspension. Notations for expulsion will not be removed. If a finding ofresponsibility is vacated for any reason, any such transcript notation shall be removed.PoliciesGraduationEach student is expected to be familiar with the academic regulations of the Collegeand the particular requirements for their educational program. The student has soleresponsibility for complying with regulations and meeting degree requirements. Generalacademic standards and regulations are set forth below.Students should also consult the current Student Handbook, which explains Collegeprocedures, disciplinary regulations, residence student life and related matters. Thishandbook is available in the Office of the Dean of Students and the Office of the Directorof Residence Life.To be eligible for graduation a student must have satisfactorily completed all the coursesrequired in the program for which they are registered. In following their program allstudents must successfully complete all prerequisite courses before moving to moreadvanced work. All students must obtain a minimum average of C (i.e., a cumulativescholarship index of 2.00, computed according to the method set forth in the CollegeCatalog). Students are personally responsible for meeting the degree requirementsprescribed in the Catalog at the time they entered Manhattan College.GradingThe grades used to indicate the quality of the student’s performance in every courseare as follows: A means excellent, B means good, C means satisfactory, D means poorbut passing, F means failing. For the purpose of computing grade point averages, thecorresponding numerical equivalents for letter grades will be used:482         Academic Policies & ProceduresGradeQuality PointsA4.0A-3.67B+3.33B3.0B-2.67C+2.33C2.0C-1.67D+1.33D1.0P0.0F0.0W  Withdrawal. Indicates withdrawal from a course in which the student is regularlyenrolled. The student is required to have the withdrawal notification form signed by theinstructor of the course and the dean of the student's school. The deadline for withdrawalfrom a course will be the end of the twelfth week of the semester. In “W” courses, neitherquality hours nor quality points are assigned.P Passing. No quality points assigned.NC No Credit.P/F Pass/Fail. In Pass/Fail courses, neither grade influences the grade point average.Credit is awarded for a P grade; no credit for F.Quality points and quality hours are assigned for every credit attempted at Manhattanexcept those taken on a Pass/Fail basis, and those for which designations of a W or an Ihave been assigned. The scholarship index is determined by dividing the total number ofquality points earned by the total number of quality hours.For all students, the cumulative scholarship index is computed at the end of eachsemester; for those who attend the summer or winter sessions, it is also computed at theend of each session.GPA CalculationComputing the Grade Point Index (GPA)The following is the method by which a student’s GPA is calculated:1. Multiply the quality points equal to the grade by the number of credits for which thegrade was earned       A=4.00 quality points x 3 credits = 12.00 points2. Add the total quality points earned in a semester3. Divide by the total number of credits for a semesterManhattan College            483The total quality points, divided by the total credits equals the GPA for the semester. Tocompute a cumulative grade point average, include all MC courses taken to date anddivide by the total number of credits for which grades other than W, P, NC, AUD, havebeen earned or given.Incomplete GradesAn “I” grade indicates that some requirement of a course has not been satisfied by theend of the term. In all cases, the incomplete work must be completed and submitted to theinstructor no later than 45 days from the last day of the term’s final examination period.The faculty member must submit the final grade no later than 50 days from the last dayof the term’s final examination period. An incomplete will be converted to a grade of F ifthe work is not completed on schedule and if the final grade is not submitted on schedule.Extensions for the completion of the work or the submission of the final grade will begranted by the Dean of the school only in highly unusual circumstances. All incompletegrades must be resolved before the student graduates.  A grade of “I” does not satisfythe grade requirement for any prerequisite course.  The “I” grade must be resolvedwith an acceptable grade before a prerequisite course can be counted as beingsuccessfully completed and before the student is permitted to take any courserequiring the prerequisite. Repeating a CourseIf a student repeats a course, both grades will be shown on the transcript and are includedin both the semester and cumulative GPA, unless, the student applies for the gradereplacement policy.Grade Replacement Policy The Manhattan College grade course replacement policy only applies to any student whohas not met the minimum required grade for his/her program of study.  When the studentrepeats the same course at Manhattan College the higher of the two grades is used incalculating the student’s GPA. The lower grade will remain on the student’s record but willnot be used in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. No additional credits are earned. Allgrades earned will appear on the student’s transcript.  See requirements below:Grade Replacement Conditions•Eligible students wishing to apply the course replacement policy may do so at any timeduring his/her undergraduate enrollment, but petitions will not be honored after thedegree is awarded.•Applies only to the first time a course is repeated.•Applies to 100 or 200-level courses taken at Manhattan College.•A student may petition to apply the same policy for a 300 or 400-level course.  Thedean of the student’s school will approve or deny the student’s petition.•Applies to no more than 15 credits or up to 5 courses of the student’s academicrecord.•The grade of the original course will not be removed from the GPA calculation untilafter the new grade has been completed at the end of the term.484         Academic Policies & Procedures•Only the higher of the two grades is used in calculating the GPA.•The lower grade remains on the student’s transcript and will not be used in thecalculation of the cumulative GPA. No additional credits are earned.•All grades remain on the transcript.•Grade replacement may not be used to replace a grade assigned as a result ofacademic dishonesty.•Does not apply for courses which transfer credits have been awarded.•The grade to be replaced must be a “C-“, “D+”, “D”, “F”.•Grades of “W” or “AUDIT” will not replace previous grades.•G.I. Bill students and others receiving Veterans Administration benefits are advisedthat replacement of any grade other than an unsatisfactory grade must be reportedto the V.A. and may result in the retroactive reduction of benefits for the semester forwhich the replaced grade was originally assigned. An unsatisfactory grade may bereplaced without similar consequences. Notify the Office of Veterans Services whenapplying to use this option.•Federal and/or state regulations may supersede portions of this policy. Forexample, students with financial aid are required to follow federal regulationsregarding repeating courses. Please consult with the Office of Financial Aid tocheck how this policy may impact your eligibility for financial aid.Note: In the future, if you apply for admission to other colleges, universities graduate, andprofessional schools, or if your record is evaluated by a national testing agency such asAMCAS or LSDAS, both MC grades will likely be included in the calculation of your GPA.Academic WarningStudents will be considered to be officially on warning when a statement to that effect hasbeen issued from the Dean’s office noting that there is some indication that the student isexperiencing difficulty in maintaining the academic standards necessary for graduation.Such warning will usually include an offer of academic counseling.Academic ProbationThe regulations of Manhattan College provide that students are subject to be placedon academic probation when their cumulative grade index falls below the norm forsatisfactory academic progress (see above). Students may remove themselves fromacademic probation by achieving the cumulative grade index consistent with the norms forsatisfactory academic progress by the end of the following regular semester. Students onacademic probation may be required to take a reduced course load and be restricted fromparticipating in College activities.Academic SuspensionStudents are subject to suspension from the College when dismissal is indicated anda judgment is made that a student’s studies at Manhattan should be interrupted for adesignated period of time, usually six months or one year, before reinstatement would beconsidered. Suspended students must present evidence of their ability to continue theirstudies successfully when applying for such reinstatement.Manhattan College            485Academic DismissalAcademic dismissal is normally considered a permanent separation from the College(not just a school of the College), ordinarily imposed when there is an indication of poorprobability of academic success. Students may be dismissed from the College if theyfail to meet the satisfactory academic progress standards within one semester of beingplaced on probation or fail to observe the restrictions imposed during probation. Studentsmay also be dismissed from the College when they receive failing grades in all creditsattempted in any one semester. Academic Dismissal is noted on the student transcript.A student may appeal a dismissal decision to the dean of the student’s school within 14days of the notification date.  The decision becomes final after 14 days.  After dismissal,a student may request an exception to the policy and the dismissal by applying forreinstatement to the dean of the school imposing the dismissal.  All reinstatementdecisions made by a dean will be reviewed and approved by the provost.Withdrawal from the CollegeRegular WithdrawalStudents currently enrolled in Manhattan College who wish to withdraw from theCollege, effectively ending their status as matriculated students, must complete therequired Manhattan College Withdrawal Form. An appointment should be made with theappropriate Academic Advisor to have an exit interview and to complete the requiredform. This form must be completely filled out or students will not be eligible for tuitionadjustments and may be responsible for paying back any financial aid received from theCollege. Students will be considered withdrawn on the date that they officially notify theCollege. Students who withdraw from the College after the last day for course withdrawalwill receive a grade of “F” for all courses during the session unless a waiver is granted bythe Provost for medical, psychological or emergency reasons. In this case, the student willreceive a grade of “W” for all courses during that session.Administrative WithdrawalA student may be administratively withdrawn from the College:1.If he or she fails to register for classes by the end of the add/drop period.2.If he or she fails to attend classes by the end of the add/drop period.3.If he or she has not returned to the College or fails to qualify to return to the Collegewhen the approved period of leave of absence has expired.4.If he or she has not returned after academic or disciplinary suspension at the timespecified and the period of suspension has not been extended.5.If in extraordinary circumstances a student is unable or unwilling to request a voluntaryleave of absence or a voluntary medical leave of absence and there is a clear need toprotect the safety of the student and/or others or to protect the integrity of the College’slearning environment.Reinstatement Following WithdrawalA student who withdraws or is withdrawn from the College may apply for reinstatement.In order to return to the College from a withdrawn status, a student must make a requestin writing to his or her Dean at least eight weeks before the beginning of the semester to486         Academic Policies & Procedureswhich the student seeks to return. The College reserves the right to require, review andapprove documentation that the student is qualified and ready to return to academic work.In the case of a voluntary withdrawal for medical/psychological reasons or anyadministrative withdrawal under this policy related to a physical or mental health condition,the student must submit a written progress assessment from a treating health professionalas part of the request for reinstatement. The Director of Counseling and Health Servicesmay require a release from the student to discuss current treatment and follow-up needswith the treating health professional, in order to assess whether the student is qualifiedand ready to return to the College and whether the College can provide the follow-upcare needed to maintain the student’s enrollment. The Director of Counseling and HealthServices approves the return of all students who have withdrawn or been withdrawn formedical or psychological reasons.Students who are reinstated following a withdrawal from College will comply with thedegree requirements of the catalog in effect when they are reinstated.Withdrawal from a CourseAfter the Add/Drop period at the beginning of each semester, students are permitted towithdraw from a course without academic penalty until the twelfth week of the semester.The required course withdrawal form is available in the office of their Dean. Withdrawingfrom a course after the Add/Drop period and before the deadline for all withdrawals placesa W on the transcript for that course. After the withdrawal deadline at the end of the twelfthweek, the student will receive a grade of F for that course unless there are extraordinarycircumstances (such as severe illness) that merit an exception. Students are cautioned toavoid a pattern of regularly accumulating W grades on their transcripts.Course RequirementsAt the beginning of each semester or session, each instructor is expected in each courseto state the objectives of the course, indicate the course requirements, and the criteriato be used in evaluating the performance of students. Each instructor is also expectedto announce whether a final examination for the course will be given, and likewise, willoutline the course requirements and indicate the criteria to be used in evaluating theperformance of students.Attendance PolicyStudents are required to fulfill all course requirements as detailed in the course syllabifor their registered courses. Implicit in these requirements is completion of all courseassignments and attendance in all classes.A student who is absent from class cannot expect the course instructor to providenotes or allow makeup tests, quizzes, or laboratories. The student may incur anappropriate grading penalty for such absences if the penalty was described in thesyllabus. Reasonable accommodations for absences are recommended but are solely atthe discretion of the course instructor.If the instructor believes that a student’s failure to attend class is substantially affecting thestudent’s course grade, then the instructor is strongly encouraged to report the situationto the dean of the school in which the student is matriculated.  It is recommended that theManhattan College            487Dean be contacted by the course instructor after the student incurs four hours of absencesin a course.  The Dean will address the situation with the student.Credit HourDuring the fall and spring semesters, each class shall meet for at least 50 minutes perweek per credit hour. Thus, a three-credit course shall meet for at least 150 minutes eachweek through three 50 minute periods, two 75 minute periods or one 150 minute period.After the last scheduled class of each semester and during the final exam periodscheduled by the Registrar, each class shall have at least 150 minutes of class contacttime. This contact time may be used for a final exam or, as appropriate: final projector papers including reflective papers; presentations or other recitations; annotatedanthologies; poster sessions; annotated portfolios; fact sheets; question banks;memorandum or briefs; or other instructor supervised activities.Credit for Off-Campus CoursesOnce matriculated into a degree-granting program (major) at Manhattan College(College), a student may not take off-campus courses offered by another accreditedinstitution for transfer to the College without prior written approval from the student’sacademic advisor and the student’s dean. A maximum of 12 credits may be taken inoff-campus courses.  Each school may set limitations on what types of courses mayor may not be approved for its students that are consistent with the College’s overallrequirements.Credit for courses taken at other institutions by matriculated students of ManhattanCollege will be recognized under the following conditions:1.Required courses in a major or in a minor may not be taken off-campus except inextenuating circumstances and with compelling reasons, and with the approval of thechair of the major program or the minor program, respectively.2.Only courses from accredited two- and four-year colleges and from accrediteduniversities will be considered.3.Written approval to take such courses is obtained in advance from the Dean of thestudent’s School. On-line courses are acceptable if approved.4.The required form and transcript are filed with the Registrar and the required fee ispaid to the Bursar.5.The grade received at the other institution is equivalent to or higher than theManhattan College grade of C. Grades earned at other institutions will not betransferred to the student’s record at Manhattan College.6.Study-abroad courses do not count toward the 12-credit maximum.7.The required nine (9) credits of Religious Studies courses – "

The minor is grounded in the principle thatcinema itself has always been an interdisciplinary art form, borrowing from the traditionsof theater, music, written narrative, photography, and--more recently--televisual and digitaltechnologies. Students in the minor are encouraged to study the history and applicationof these related arts while also learning about the distinctive elements of cinematicaesthetics. At the same time, film is a form of cultural expression that holds the power toshape our understanding of the societies we live in, engaging such diverse subjects ashistory, politics, religion, and social identities. Several courses, therefore, ask students tomake connections between the films we watch and the world we occupy.The Film Studies Minor brings together, in a valuable and systematic way, multipleexisting courses across at least six departments. The curriculum is organized so thatstudents will gain a broad understanding of the evolution of film as an artistic mediumwhile also having the opportunity to study various genres, modes of production, socialissues, and philosophical approaches in depth.

The Middle Ages saw the formation of the institutional Church and the rise ofthe papacy, the development of the nation and representative bodies, the origin of theuniversity and modern legal systems, the creation of new artistic, literary, and musicalforms, and even the formulation of notions such as romantic love and the individual “self.”Current methods in studying the Middle Ages enable scholars and students to engagewith the Lasallian mission by studying the poor, displaced, and persecuted as well as thelegendary, famous, and powerful.The Medieval Studies Minor draws faculty and courses from at least six differentdepartments in the School of Liberal Arts and encourages students to seek connectionsacross the disciplines. The minor complements all majors in the humanities and providesa firm historical grounding for students in the social sciences and other areas who wish tounderstand a period that was crucial to the development of the modern world.MinorRequirements for a Medieval Studies Minor15 credits to include:"

Studying philosophy sharpens students' ability to understand andanalyze concepts, assumptions, beliefs, logical errors and commonly held opinions.It promotes clarity and precision in speaking, comprehension and writing. Majors inphilosophy typically receive among the highest average scores of any major on the GREsand LSATs. Philosophy students enjoy successful careers in a wide variety of fieldsincluding law, business, medicine and education.In philosophy, students grapple with big questions: What is the nature of the good life?What does it mean to be ethical? What can we know with certainty? What is the natureof reality? Philosophers ask a lot of questions that don’t seem to have simple or concreteanswers. But one of the great strengths of a philosophical education is that it developsstudents’ ability to ask good questions. As Aristotle claimed, the mark of a well-educatedperson is not that he or she has amassed knowledge about many fields but that he or sheknows how to ask good questions. To be able to ask the right questions at the right time ishighly prized by employers and colleagues.Manhattan College’s major and minor in philosophy allow students to engage many of thegreatest minds in history in four types of courses — core, historical period, philosophicaltraditions, and major philosophers, as well as in electives. In our courses, students areexposed to a panorama of influential ideas from different periods and traditions.

Until recently, women’s experiences and work have been undervaluedand often ignored. Recent scholarship by feminist historians, literary scholars, social andnatural scientists, and educators has recovered the richness of women’s contributionsand the complexity of women’s roles in society over time. This field of study explores thediversity of women’s experiences as they have been represented for and by them, and,in so doing, challenges students to examine critically gender relations in both the publicand private spheres. Women and Gender Studies also analyzes gender as it intersectswith other categories that shape social institutions and practices, power relations, and thevery meaning of knowledge. Through courses, invited speakers, and faculty research, theminor seeks to promote women’s issues and gender awareness in order to help studentscreate a more equitable world.MinorMinors must take 15 approved credits from the following list. 4 of these must be at the300-level or higher.

The success of this programprompted the establishment of Business in the spring of 1927. Degrees of Bachelor ofScience in Business were awarded to the first graduates of the program in June 1928.During the next two years the program of professional subjects was again revised andextended to a four year curriculum of business and cultural courses. The first class tocomplete this curriculum conducted totally within Business was graduated in 1932. In1933 the degree designation was changed to Bachelor of Business Administration. In1970, as a result of an extensive curriculum revision which emphasizes a balance ofhumanities, mathematics, science, social sciences, and professional business courses,the degree was changed to the Bachelor of Science (Business Administration). At thesame time, the baccalaureate degree program in the Evening Session was merged intoBusiness.The O'Malley School of Business is accredited by AACSB International, the Associationto Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, the premier accrediting agency for businessprograms globally.Mission StatementThe O'Malley School of Business shares with the rest of Manhattan College a commitmentto the development and growth of each student. Inspired by Lasallian tradition, themission of the School of Business is to prepare students from diverse backgrounds forthe challenges that they will face as business and community leaders. The faculty of theSchool, as teachers, scholars and mentors, foster the development of the whole person byintegrating a values-based education with current business theory, skills and practices.Curriculum and ProgramsIn order to accomplish the mission of Business, the curriculum is structured to achieve abalance of liberal arts courses and professional business courses, thus bringing togetherliberal education and professional business preparation. The program in liberal arts isdivided among the areas of humanities, mathematics, sciences, and social sciences.The professional business program, which includes core courses required of all studentsand the study of a major field, offers the student a balanced approach to the two aspectsof the various business disciplines—theory and application to practical problems. Thispractical/theoretical approach heightens the ability of the student to reason and analyzea situation in the context of a given environment thus developing in him or her a practicaloutlook that reflects business reality. In addition, the School provides its students withan exposure to the world of business. The societal considerations of the firm and thebehavioral aspects of the managerial function are interwoven throughout the businesscurriculum. The focus in the professional area is on executive action in business and non-business organizations.196         Business - General InformationThe program of liberal arts courses, which comprises approximately one-half of thetotal curriculum, blends humanistic knowledge with professional career preparation.The sequence of general business-related courses examines topics of broad businessknowledge and practice.

Withthis, every effort is made in the professional courses to correlate the theory of generaleducation as it applies to the Physical Education Teacher K-12 and Exercise Sciencemajors.The curriculum provides a strong and relevant foundation for continued study in graduateschools in such areas as physical therapy, physical education, health education, exercisephysiology, occupational therapy, special education, adapted physical activity, curriculumand instruction, supervision and administration, health promotion/community health, sportand exercise psychology, athletic training, sports medicine, and other education/health-related professions.The objectives of the Department of Kinesiology are to prepare graduates who willbe able to:1.Demonstrate an understanding of the underlying scientific foundations of kinesiology(exercise science and physical education) and its applications to planning, professionalpractice, and evaluation.2.Demonstrate an understanding of the cultural, historical, and philosophical dimensionsof kinesiology and its applications to planning, professional practice, and evaluation.3.Demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between physical activityparticipation and health, wellness, and quality of life.4.Critically evaluate scholarly work related to kinesiology and demonstrate the ability tomake practical applications based on this research.5.Observe, analyze, and evaluate human movement and apply instructional intervention.6.Plan, implement, and assess a variety of developmentally appropriate learningexperiences aligned with professional standards to address the diverse needs of alllearners.7.Demonstrate pedagogical knowledge in their discipline and the skills to apply thisknowledge to positively impact all learners.8.Demonstrate professional responsibility and the dispositions to grow professionally.9.Demonstrate an appreciation and commitment to physical activity practice.Kinesiology students may choose one of two majors: Physical Education TeacherK-12 or Exercise Science.278         KinesiologyPhysical Education Teacher K-12The Physical Education Teaching K-12 major is designed to prepare teachers andleaders for elementary and secondary schools. The program also provides a solidfoundation for continued graduate school study in physical education, health education,special education, adapted physical activity, curriculum and instruction, supervisionand administration, and other education related fields. The program is approved by theNew York State Education Department (NYSED). Program completion leads to NYSteaching certification in Physical Education K-12. NYSED has certification reciprocityagreements with many other states.

In 1892, civil engineering and electrical engineering wereamong four curricula leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. Although civil engineeringhas continued uninterrupted since, electrical engineering was suspended shortly after itsintroduction. It was re-established as a degree program in 1935. Programs in mechanicalengineering, chemical engineering, environmental engineering and computer engineeringwere introduced in 1957, 1958, 1993, and 1998, respectively. The undergraduate programin environmental engineering was phased out in 2012. However, the master's degreeprograms in environmental engineering continue and undergraduate engineering studentscan minor in environmental engineering.Vision and Mission StatementsThe vision of the School of Engineering gives broad direction to long-term goals, i.e.:The Manhattan College School of Engineering will be the school of choice forengineering education in the New York metropolitan region.This means that the College will be the destination of choice when students apply toengineering schools. In order to realize this vision, every program in the school willdevelop curricula which attract and excite students while supporting the mission of theschool.The School of Engineering has developed the following mission statement with input fromits stakeholders:The mission of the Manhattan College School of Engineering is to prepareeach student for a productive and rewarding career in engineering or a relatedprofession.This mission is congruent with the mission of the College. The curriculum supporting theschool’s mission instills the techniques and skills of engineering design through the studyof basic and advanced engineering science. This foundation of techniques and skills isintegrated with practice-oriented engineering design experience covering technical andnon-technical aspects of engineering practice. Students earning a Manhattan Collegeengineering degree are prepared to enter the world of professional practice and tocontinue their studies through the pursuit of post-baccalaureate education.The strong foundation coupled with thorough preparation in an engineering disciplineensures that the student will have life-long access to rapidly developing new technologiesand prepares each student to be a citizen, an advocate, and a leader in the complex worldof the 21st century.The mission of the School of Engineering is consistent with the Lasallian and Catholicheritage of Manhattan College. Graduates of its engineering programs are expected tomeet high academic standards, reflect on moral and ethical considerations in all aspectsof their lives, and appreciate the need for life-long learning in the fulfillment of professionalManhattan College            309goals. Part of the ethical considerations expected of all students is their observance ofacademic integrity.  Students accept the Manhattan College Community Standards andStudent Code of Conduct under which they will not engage in academic dishonesty –cheating, plagiarism, and/or fabrication – or in academic misconduct, nor tolerate it inothers. As aspiring engineers, students are expected to be aware of engineering codes ofprofessional conduct which also prohibit dishonesty and misuse of intellectual property.Program Educational ObjectivesThe undergraduate programs in the Manhattan College School of Engineering areindividually accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET,http://www.abet.org/. (http://www.abet.org.) ABET states that Program EducationalObjectives must be published and that these objectives are consistent with the institution'smission, needs of program stakeholders and other ABET criteria.  Each program isrequired to develop, publish, and periodically review its objectives.Although each program develops its own objectives, there are some general themes thatare recognized across the programs. These themes can be grouped as:•Leadership, achievement, and involvement in engineering and related professions•Dedication to furthering the engineering profession through continuous self-improvement•Ethical practices and moral character•Commitment to engineering as a service-to-humanity professionGraduates of the School of Engineering will be valued for their ethical practices and moralcharacter, leadership and involvement in engineering and related professions, dedicationto the profession through self-improvement, and recognition that engineering is a serviceto humanity.Student Outcomes for The Engineering ProgramsABET states that programs must have documented Student Outcomes that preparegraduates to attain the Program Educational Objectives.  These outcomes relate to theknowledge, skills, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through theprogram. ABET requires each program to adopt a standard set of outcomes plus anyadditional outcomes that may be articulated by the program. The standard set of eleven(11) outcomes, commonly referred to as (a) through (k), is:    a.  an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering;    b.  an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and         interpret data;    c.  an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs         within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social,                 political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability;    d.  an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams;    e.  an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems;310         Engineering - General Information    f.   an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility;    g.  an ability to communicate effectively;    h.  the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering         solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context;     i.  a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning;     j.  a knowledge of contemporary issues; and     k.  an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools                    necessary for engineering practice.The standard (a) through (k) program outcomes have been adopted by the undergraduateengineering programs in chemical, civil, computer, electrical and mechanical.The educational objectives and outcomes of all the programs in the School of Engineeringare consistent with the school’s mission and the Lasallian and Catholic heritage ofManhattan College. In addition, the outcomes articulated by each program are consistentwith the Manhattan College core competencies of:•Effective Communication•Critical Thinking•Information Literacy•Technology Literacy•Quantitative Literacy•Scientific Literacy•Independent and Collaborative Work•Global Awareness•Religious and Ethical AwarenessEngineering EducationThe foundation of the engineering curriculum includes:1.The study of science representing the current state of human knowledge of thephysical world and its behavior2.The study of mathematics, the language and tool that engineers use to describe thephysical world3.Breadth of study in the humanities and social sciences, the basis for making ethicaland moral engineering decisions4.Development of the ability for independent learning and critical thinking5.Development of skills in written, verbal, and graphical communicationIn an age of revolutionary advances in science and technology, continual re-examinationof trends in engineering becomes imperative.  Accordingly, engineering faculty, inconsultation with the Manhattan College Engineering board of advisors, a distinguishedgroup of engineers and industrial leaders assembled from engineering-relatedorganizations, study and evaluate the concepts of engineering education and the school’sManhattan College            311programs. These studies re-emphasize the importance of humanities, mathematicsand sciences as the foundation of engineering education. The engineering curriculumis, therefore, planned to provide the sound and broad education required in importantbranches of engineering.CurriculaThe engineering curricula have been designed with two premises in mind: one, thatsound undergraduate engineering education must establish fundamental concepts at theexpense of specialization; and two, that first-line engineering research, development ordesign requires post-collegiate specialization and advanced study through graduate workor industrial training, together with continuing self-development.The engineering curricula are four-year programs and lead to the Bachelor of Sciencedegree in one of the traditional branches of engineering: chemical engineering, civilengineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.Each program provides opportunities for minor studies or focus areas within its discipline.Despite the apparent division of engineering study into these curricula, there is a coreengineering curriculum designed to offer the fundamental education required for allengineering students.All students must complete "
CHML 207," Process Calculations,  Process Calculations for the chemicalengineering program.  A list of the gateway courses is published in the annual School ofEngineering Advising Manual.  A student will be allowed a maximum of three (3) attemptsto take and pass, with a grade of C (2.00) or better, each of the gateway courses in thestudent’s program.  After three unsuccessful attempts to pass a gateway course with a C(2.00) or better, the student will be subject to dismissal from the engineering program (butnot Manhattan College), as determined by the department chair and the dean.A letter of academic warning is typically issued to each student earning a grade of D orF in any given term, even if the student is still in good academic standing in engineering.Letters of academic warning in two consecutive terms, while the student is still in goodacademic standing in engineering, will result in a meeting with the Assistant Dean or theDean of Engineering. The letter of academic warning clearly spells out the danger to anacademic program from receiving unacceptable grades.A letter of academic probation is typically issued to each student failing to remain ingood academic standing in engineering. Also, a letter of academic probation is typicallyissued to students receiving multiple unsatisfactory grades (especially grades of F) eventhough the student may be in good academic standing. Freshman failing to remain in goodacademic standing after their first term may be placed on academic probation. Studentson probation are required to take a reduced course load of 12 credits for the following termand may be restricted from participating in Manhattan College activities. Students mayremove themselves from academic probation by achieving a grade point average of 2.0 bythe end of the following regular term. Failing to achieve good academic standing while onprobation can lead to an academic contract or, in extreme cases, dismissal.An academic contract is typically issued to students failing to achieve good academicstanding in engineering while on academic probation. A letter of academic contract isalso typically issued to a student if the most recent term grade point average falls below1.0 even if the student was not on probation the previous term. A student may not beon academic contract for two consecutive terms without authorization of the Dean ofEngineering.  A student who does not successfully complete an academic contract issubject to suspension or dismissal.Students are subject to suspension when they fail to satisfy the conditions of theacademic contract or fail to achieve good academic standing while on probation. Inthese situations, a judgment is made by the dean that the student’s studies shouldbe interrupted for a designated time period, usually six months or one year, beforereinstatement would be considered. Suspended students must present evidence of theirability to continue their studies successfully when applying for such reinstatement intothe school of engineering. Upon return, suspended students are subject to an academiccontract for their first term back.Dismissal is a permanent separation from Manhattan College, not just the School ofEngineering. A letter of dismissal from the college may be issued to each student failingto satisfy the conditions of the academic contract or failing to achieve good academicManhattan College            319standing while on probation. A student may also be dismissed from the college when theyreceive failing grades in all courses attempted in any one term.Generally, a student not in good academic standing may not enroll in more than fourcourses or for more than 14 credits, whichever is less. Exceptions to this provision requirethe written permission of the Assistant Dean or the Dean of Engineering.Engineering students must earn a grade of C (2.0) or higher in:a3.

Completion of the minor mayqualify students for entry to the graduate program of the minor department. Except forenvironmental engineering, students should contact the chair of the minor department forfurther information.Engineering students may obtain an Application for Minor form at the office of the Deanof Engineering. After the form is completed by the program chair offering the minor, theform should be returned to the office of the Dean of Engineering by the student. When allcourses have been completed, the dean will notify the office of the Registrar.  The coursesleading to a minor in engineering are subject to change. Please verify the courseworkrequired with the Assistant Dean of Engineering before starting a minor.Transferring from a Community CollegeStudents who complete a pre-engineering program will generally be permitted to transferup to 50% of the credits required for a Bachelor of Science degree in an engineeringdegree program. Transfer credit will only be permitted for courses in which a grade of C(2.0) or higher has been earned.  All transfer credits are reviewed by the Assistant Deanof EngineeringStudents who graduate with an associate degree in a technology program will generallyonly be permitted to transfer 9 credits towards a Bachelor of Science engineering degree.Engineering maintains transfer agreements with several of the community colleges inthe Tri-State area. Additional information can be obtained from the office of the Dean ofEngineering at (718) 862-7281.Graduate-Level Courses (5XX, 6XX, 7XX)Students in all engineering disciplines who have a cumulative grade point average of atleast 3.00 and the permission of the department chair can elect to take graduate-levelcourses.

A concentrationin a variety of sub-disciplines such as structures, water and wastewater treatment,geotechnology, geoenvironmental studies, and transportation are also available. A strongundergraduate research program that provides a unique and very important area for theenrichment of undergraduate engineering education is available to students.Note:  Students interested in environmental engineering are encouraged to choose theenvironmental engineering option in the civil engineering.Program Educational ObjectivesGraduates of the Civil Engineering program will:•Be recognized for their ethical practices and moral character.•Be recognized for their leadership, achievement and involvement in engineering andengineering-related professions.•Demonstrate dedication to furthering the engineering profession through continuousself-improvement.•Exhibit a commitment to engineering as a service-to-humanity profession throughworking towards engineering a sustainable environment for New York and the world.Student OutcomesThe Civil Engineering program uses the standard set of ABET, Inc. outcomes (a) through(k) as described above under Engineering.Civil Engineering ProgramMission StatementThe mission of the Civil Engineering program is to develop a custom-made educationalplan for each of our students so upon graduation they are prepared to continue theirgraduate studies or enter into the civil engineering profession.The goal is to prepare students to function professionally as responsible members of theglobal engineering community dedicated to life-long learning and collaborative practice,discovery and sharing a breadth of knowledge. The program puts particular emphasis onintroducing the students to the broad range of civil engineering disciplines.Civil engineers use mathematics, together with the basic sciences and engineeringsciences, in the study of the structural, geotechnical, transportation, environmental,332         Civil & Environmental Engineeringand water resources engineering disciplines. These disciplines allow a civil engineer,working to improve the environment, to plan, design and construct the industrial plants ofthe world, the great public works, the housing, the bases for space exploration and thetransportation networks.Structural engineering deals with the analysis, design and construction of buildings,bridges, ships, aircraft and other flight structures. Environmental engineering, with itsemphasis on the quality of water resources allows a civil engineer to analyze and modelthe environment, assess the effects of man’s activities on it, and design control facilitiesto ensure improvement and protection of our nation’s water. Geotechnical engineeringconcentrates on the study of the behavior of various soils and designs adequate supportsfor all structures resting on the earth and other planets. Transportation engineeringemphasizes the planning, design, and construction of efficient transportation systemssuch as highways, airports, railways, ports, and public transport. Students obtain abackground in each of the above disciplines with one or more concentrations.Within the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, civil engineering majorshave the opportunity to pursue an exclusive civil engineering curriculum. If, however, theywish to combine a civil major with an environmental minor, there is sufficient flexibility inthe program to accommodate that choice.Four-Year Program in Civil EngineeringThe curriculum for the first year is common to all branches of engineering. In order toenable a student to test his or her interest in civil engineering, he or she takes designatedcourses from the civil engineering course offerings in the sophomore year. The juniorand senior years allow for concentrated studies in the areas of structural, environmental,geotechnical, water resources, and transportation engineering.

Graduates of the program will beprepared to become successful and socially-responsible professional and communityleaders.Central to the programs are certain principles, including the importance of collaboration,the discovery and sharing of knowledge, the appreciation of ethical, safety, and economicconcerns, and the need for life-long learning and advanced study.Program Educational ObjectivesGraduates of either the Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering programs will bevalued by the engineering community. Graduates will be recognized for their:•Ethical practices and moral character•Leadership, achievement, and involvement in engineering and related professions•Dedication to furthering the engineering profession through continuous self-improvement•Commitment to engineering as a service-to-humanity professionStudent OutcomesThe Electrical and Computer Engineering programs use the standard set of ABET, Inc.outcomes (a) through (k) as described above under Engineering.Computer EngineeringThe application of computer-based technology is growing at a phenomenal rate. In fact,it pervades our lives. As a result, there is ongoing demand for engineers who can buildcomplex systems which integrate computer hardware and software. This has given rise tothe field of computer engineering. By combining the core courses in electrical engineeringand relevant knowledge from computer science, the computer engineering curriculumprepares students to enter this challenging field.Manhattan College            343A liberal choice of technical electives accommodates a broad spectrum of educationalobjectives. Those wishing to prepare for an advanced degree may do so by selectingadvanced theoretical courses in computer engineering, electrical engineering or computerscience. Those wishing to obtain breadth in general engineering practice may do so bychoosing electives in engineering science or other engineering disciplines.Four-Year Program in Computer EngineeringThe curriculum for the first year is common to all engineering disciplines within the college.  Additionally, students intending to major in computer engineering as well as those inelectrical engineering complete a common sophomore year in which basic conceptsof contemporary digital environments, modern computer hardware organizations, andanalysis of systems underscore coursework. This maximizes the flexibility that a studentenjoys in ultimate selections of a major.  Discipline specific courses are undertaken inboth the junior and senior years where software and elements of computer science areintegrated into the design of complex computer-based systems. Computer engineeringmajors can choose from a variety of technical electives to enhance individual educationalobjectives.  A representative four-year program is shown below for those studentsentering in the fall of 2010 or later.Electrical EngineeringWide in scope and variety, electrical engineering ranges from design of solid state devicesand increasingly complex microcircuits to design of communication systems or large scalepower generating equipment and plants to meet society’s accelerating demand for cleanenergy. The fundamental principles of information processing and control inherent in anelectrical engineer’s background find applications in such diverse areas as industry andmedicine.Coursework in both the Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering programsemphasize understanding of electrical circuits and electromagnetic theory as a frameworkfor courses in electronics, energy conversion, computers, automation and engineeringsystems. Embedded laboratory experiences associated with the lecture materials providedesign experience, stress principles, methods, accuracy of measurements and thelimitations of electrical instruments and measuring devices. Senior multidisciplinaryresearch and design projects offer opportunities for creative work with personal guidance.Four-Year Program in Electrical EngineeringBecause of the significant overlap in preparation for career opportunities in both electricaland computer engineering, the four-year curriculum for both programs is essentiallythe same.  This common approach provides maximum flexibility and permits a studentto delay the choice of major.  Differences in the major depend on the selection of"concentration courses" during the senior year as well as choice of electives.  Theseselections are made with the consultation, advisement, and approval of the chairof the department.  The curriculum for the first year is common to all branches ofengineering.  An important element in the electrical engineering experience is providedwithin the Capstone Design course.  Working cooperatively with computer engineeringmajors, modern complex systems can be understood as a true integration of hardwareand software elements and the role that each plays in such applications.  This courseoffers opportunities for creative work with personal guidance by a faculty member. 344         Electrical & Computer EngineeringThe department offers options in bioelectrical engineering and cybersercurity systemsengineering through the technical electives.

Thistradition is reflected in the success of Manhattan’s Science graduates and the position ofManhattan among a select number of colleges which are recognized as important sourcesof the nation’s professional scientists.CurriculumUndergraduate studies in the Sciences are most challenging but provide an almost uniqueopportunity to learn and develop problem-solving and analytical skills while gaining adeeper understanding and appreciation of physical laws and their applications. Thechoice of a Science major is based upon the individual’s interests, educational and careergoals, and abilities. Majors may be chosen from several areas: biology, biochemistry,chemistry, computer science, environmental science, mathematics, and physics. Electivecomponents of the major curricula provide the opportunity to explore other areas ofinterest, enhance knowledge in a specialized area of the major, or to construct minorsequences in other disciplines. Minors may be earned in all of the departments of theSchool of Science. At Manhattan, our Science curricula contain a strong core componentin the Liberal Arts to provide a foundation for our graduates to contend with the humanisticand ethical issues they will face after graduation. Once a student is admitted to ManhattanCollege, all major, minor, and Core courses must be taken at Manhattan College. Certainnon-resident courses, with the approval of the Dean and major department Chair, may beexceptions to this requirement. Under unusual circumstances, and with the approval of theDean after consultation with the Chair of the student’s major department, courses may betaken at another CollegeSchool of Science CurriculumArts Core"

We providestudents the mathematical skills necessary to be successful in their field of study whetherit is mathematics, science, engineering, business, education or the liberal arts.The mathematics curriculum for our majors allows students to prepare for careers inbusiness, industry, and teaching as well as to prepare for the study of mathematics at thegraduate level.  Coursework in Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Analysis, Probability,and Statistics prepare students for further work in pure or applied mathematics.  Electivecourses, such as Operations Research, Machine Learning, and Mathematical Modeling,provide students the tools to analyze data in various areas of science, finance, andengineering.Our classes are small giving students the opportunity to build strong relationships withfaculty.  Students are invited to participate in national mathematics competitions such asthe Putnam Exam.  Many students participate in undergraduate research projects, bothinternal and external; funds are available to support these projects during the summer.  Students are encouraged to present their work at the Spuyten Duyvil UndergraduateMathematics Conference, which was founded by the Mathematics Department atManhattan College, as well as at other national and regional meetings.Any student wishing to participate in the Study Abroad program will find the Departmentmakes every effort to provide the needed support to allow them to finish their requiredcourse work.The Department supports a chapter of the national mathematics honor society, Pi MuEpsilon, which is dedicated to the promotion of mathematics and recognition of studentswho successfully pursue mathematical understanding.  Students are nominated formembership in this honor society.  The Department also nominates students who makepresentations at conferences for membership in Sigma Xi, an international honor societyfor science and engineering.Degree PlansThe Department of Mathematics offers the following programs:•Major in Mathematics •Bachelor of Science Degree•Bachelor of Arts Degree•Second Major in Mathematics•Concentration in Applied Mathematics•Minor in MathematicsManhattan College            405The Department also offers a seamless 5-year BS-MS program with a major inMathematics and an MS in Applied Mathematics-Data Analytics. See the GraduateCatalog for more details.Also, the Department works closely with the School of Education & Health on therequirements for the BS in Adolescence Education Mathematics, which prepares studentsto teach at the secondary level and the Mathematics emphasis in the BS in ChildhoodEducation which prepares students to teach at the elementary level. The requirements forthe BS in Adolescence Education Mathematics are listed below under Second Major inMathematics.General RequirementsCourses should be taken in accordance with the Plans of Study listed below.  These plansincorporate the School of Science Core Curriculum.  The order in which core courses aretaken is flexible but care should be taken in planning your program since some coursesare not offered every semester. A minimum grade of C is required in each of the coursesused for any of the listed programs (major, second major, concentration, or minor).The Department also offers a graduate program in mathematics. With the approval of theChair, well-prepared undergraduate students can take graduate mathematics courses tocount toward their mathematics electives.Major in MathematicsBS in Mathematics     (126 credit hours)"

Students mustcomplete an official “Withdrawal from College” form.Failure to attend class and/or failure to notify the Office of the Dean and Office of theRegistrar does not constitute an official withdrawal. Also, failure to make or completepayment does not constitute official withdrawal. Students who never attend or stopattending classes and fail to file the official paperwork mandated by College policy areresponsible for 100% of tuition and fees.Manhattan College            595Official Date of WithdrawalThe date used for refund/liability purposes will be the date that the paperwork wascompleted, not the last date of attendance. Drops or withdrawals received by mail will beeffective as of the official postmarked date.Obligation to Outside Funding Sources UponWithdrawalIf a student received financial assistance from an outside agency then some portion ofthe refund may have to be returned to the issuing grant/scholarship agency or lender.Students who receive Federal Title IV finds will be subject to the refund policy listed in thatsection.Adds, Drops and Withdrawals from IndividualCoursesAdds/Drops and Withdrawals from individual courses must be officially requested withproper forms and processed by the Office of the Dean and the Office of the Registrar. Noadd/drop of courses will be permitted after the published and posted deadlines.Add/Drops processed during the published dates (usually the first calendar week of theterm) will qualify for a schedule change which may affect tuition and fee charges. After thedeadline, withdrawal from a course is the only option for a student.

Your participation in Tuition Protection Plan is completely voluntary; itrepresents a contract between you and the Allianz Global Assistance. Manhattan Collegedoes not benefit from your participation.Enrollment InstructionsShould you decide to participate in the Tuition Protection Plan, you can learn more andobtain a quote by calling 877-232-0765 or go to www.gradguard.com/manhattan (http://www.gradguard.com/manhattan). Sign-up is required prior to the first day of classes. Forthe 2018-19 year, August 27 is the first day of classes in the fall and January 15 is thefirst day of classes in the spring.What the Plan CoversThe coverage complements our refund policy-providing reimbursement for eligible tuitionpayments, room and board fees and other nonrefundable expenses if you withdraw for acovered illness or injury at any time during the plan period.Adjustment of Institutional AidThe College’s refund policy exists for calculating liability for institutional tuition charges.Therefore, if any charges are prorated as a result of voluntary or involuntary withdrawal,the College must in turn prorate any institutional grants based on the percentage chargedto the student as listed in the above policy.Outside Scholarships and External FundingStudents must notify Student Accounts and Bursar Services of any external funds/resources they will receive regardless of amount. Students can use the ExternalResources form or forward copies of their notice of award. The terms “outside”, “external”or “private” sources applies to any fund, scholarship or benefit awarded and administeredby an organization other than Manhattan College. Resources can include: high schools,civic or religious organizations, state or federally funded sources not listed in this catalog,or tuition benefits from an employer. Federal regulations require that these awards betreated as educational resources for determining the student’s eligibility for financial aid.To ensure proper accounting of the external resource, funds should be sent directly toStudent Accounts and Bursar Services to be applied to the student account.For many students, the receipt of nominal external resources will not necessitate afinancial aid award revision. In some cases, however, a student’s demonstrated financialneed is already being met in full with federal, state and/or institutional resources beforeconsidering an external resource.Manhattan College            597In this situation, the College’s policy is that such resources will be used first to reduceunmet need, then loan eligibility, then work study eligibility (Federal Pell Grant is notaffected by the receipt of external resources). However, the College reserves the right toreconfigure its institutional award offer(s) if the outside funding is such that would result inan overage of the College’s intended funding level of institutional aid. If a student receivesno need-based financial assistance, then the combination of all merit aid and outsideresources may not exceed the allowable cost of attendance.Adjustment of Federal AidReturn of Title IV Federal AidWhen a student withdraws during a term, the amount of federal financial aid earnedby the student is determined on a pro-rata basis up to the end of 60% of the term. Theamount of federal Title IV aid earned is based upon the period of enrollment completed.A percentage is computed by dividing the number of days completed (as of the date thestudent officially withdraws) by the total number of days in the term as determined by theOffice of Student Accounts and Bursar Services. Scheduled breaks of more than fourconsecutive days are excluded. The percentage is then applied to the aid received todetermine earned and unearned aid. If and when any aid is determined to be unearned,it must be returned to the appropriate financial aid program(s). Returns to aid programsmust be made in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, SubsidizedFederal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, and NYState Grant. Once a student has completed more than 60% of the term, the student isconsidered to have earned 100% of aid and no adjustment to aid is made.Refunds of Credit BalancesRefunds are subject to the review of the Office of Student Accounts and Bursar Services.Institutional awards can never be refunded to the student. Credit balances resulting fromprivate scholarships, federal financial aid, and alternative loan programs are subject tospecific guideline review and approval by a financial aid counselor and a student accountrepresentative. Refunds will be routed through the approval process when the creditamount actually exists on the student’s account, after the census date for each term (firstweek of each term, or the add/drop period). In the event of an overpayment of personalfunds paid to the College by check, refunds will be subject to a ten day holding periodwhile original funding is cleared by the bank. Credit balances resulting from excesspayments will be refunded to the student’s name unless otherwise authorized by thestudent.Processing of RefundsChecks will be mailed to the current home address of the student, if the student does notelect to receive an eRefund,  or the Parents name and home address on the PLUS loanon our system.598         Financial AssistanceFinancial AssistanceManhattan College provides the maximum financial aid available to qualified students tomake their attendance at Manhattan financially possible.To this end, the College administers a wide range of scholarship and financial aidprograms designed to enable the student to pursue his/her studies to graduation. Thebasis of selection is ability and/or need. Students are advised that program guidelinesand funding levels, especially State and Federal, are subject to change without enoughadvance notice to be corrected in this publication. Students are advised to refer to thewebsite of the Office of Student Financial Services for current information.Meeting the complete costs of college requires a cooperative effort from several possiblesources of funds: student and family, Manhattan College, state and federal governmentagencies and independent sources of aid. Manhattan College attempts to meet asignificant portion of need but is unable to meet full need due to financial limitations.New StudentsStudents admitted to the College and demonstrating financial need will receive afinancial aid assistance offer in the form of a financial aid award notice from the Office ofAdmissions and Financial Aid. Most financial assistance is based on an assessment ofyour financial need. Need is the difference between your total cost of attendance (tuition,fees, room and board, books, miscellaneous/personal expenses and transportation) andwhat your family can reasonably be expected to pay toward those expenses (determinedby the EFC result of FAFSA). If a student’s need for assistance changes from one year tothe next, his/her financial aid may change.Continuing EligibilityAll financial aid is renewable on a yearly basis provided the student remains eligible; i.e.,files the FAFSA, and renews the FAFSA annually by the published deadline, complieswith any FAFSA verification requests or other requests by financial aid administrators,is enrolled in a matriculated program, is in good academic standing, continues todemonstrate need (for need based aid) and has not defaulted on student loans. Pleasecheck aid eligibility requirements listed under each type of financial aid.Application ProceduresStudents who wish to apply for any type of need based financial assistance throughManhattan College must file a Free Application for Federal Student Assistance (FAFSAcollege code is 002758) as early as possible after October 1st preceding the academicyear for which they wish to be considered for aid. Incoming freshmen should fileby February 15th to ensure timely handling of their admissions application. FAFSAapplications must file on the web at: www.fafsa.ed.gov (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov).Continuing students must file by the April 15th deadline and file using completed federaltaxes. Financial aid will be awarded on a “first come first serve basis” to all studentsthat have pre-registered for the upcoming semester by the published deadline.  Lateregistration or applications received after April 15th will result in possible reduction orcancellation of any need-based institutional aid.Manhattan College            599The Federal Student Aid Program performs a needs analysis service which computes theexpected family contribution (EFC) toward educational costs. Manhattan College thendetermines financial need based on the total cost of attendance at the college. ManhattanCollege deducts the family contribution as determined by the FAFSA from the Total Costof Attendance to calculate financial need. All attempts are made to help meet some of thisneed (also known as the Gap) with a combination of gift (scholarships and grants fromManhattan College, federal and state grant programs and outside scholarships), loans(Federal Stafford and Perkins) and work programs (Federal Work Study and CampusEmployment). Any special circumstances should be submitted in writing to the StudentFinancial Services Office.Notification of AwardsApplicants will be advised of all possible awards via a Financial Aid Award Notice whenall pertinent forms and applications are complete. Award notices are provided to incomingapplicants on a rolling basis. Students already in attendance will begin to receive theirAward Notices between late May and mid June.The financial aid awards on your award notice are “estimated” until full eligibility isdetermined. A financial aid award may be reduced or cancelled. The most commonreasons for an award adjustment include changes in enrollment (change to part-timestatus, residency status, not maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress, or over-awardsdue to receipt of additional aid and/or scholarships from other sources.) An award mayalso be adjusted due to changes or inaccuracies in the information on which your award isbased. If your financial aid has been disbursed, you may be responsible for partial or fullrepayment of funds regardless of the reason for the adjustment.Students are advised to visit the Student Financial Services Office to discuss any changesin family circumstances. A student should never withdraw from a class or a semesterwithout visiting the Student Financial Services to discuss the impact on future financial aid.Verification of Financial Aid Data & ApplicationsFAFSA Verification is a process mandated by the federal government requiring theStudent Financial Services office to verify that information reported on the FAFSAapplication is true and accurate. At minimum, the government will randomly select thirtypercent of a college’s population for this process. Applicants are selected or flaggedby the government at random and through computer edits. The verification flag will benoted as an asterisk next to the EFC number on the Student Aid Report (SAR) that isreceived upon completion of the FAFSA. The student is also notified of selection in Part Iof the SAR. In addition to those flagged by the government, Manhattan College may flagstudents randomly or as a result of our own computer edits.After making the enrollment deposit, prospective students will receive a letter indicatingthey have been selected for verification and requesting that an institutional verificationform be completed and returned with signed copies of student and parent signed federalincome tax returns along with other requested documents. Returning students will receivepaper and/or electronic notification of selection for verification as part of the financial aidaward renewal package process.600         Financial AssistanceItems to be verified may include tax filing status, household composition and status ofindividuals listed in the household, proof of number enrolled in post-secondary studies,adjusted gross income and taxes paid from signed federal tax returns, income and wagestatements, proof of non-filing, proof of earned and unearned income, untaxed incomeand benefits, child support documentation, documented value of investments, and otherdocuments requested by the college. All students must complete and sign an institutional‘FAFSA Verification Worksheet.’Selected students are required to provide documentation as specified within 10 businessdays of receipt of notice. Within two to six weeks of receipt, a financial aid counselor willanalyze the data and take any of the following actions:•complete the process with no changes and inform the student•complete the process after making necessary corrections and issue a revised awardletter if there are changes in financial aid•request additional information needed to complete verificationAlthough tuition bills may show pending aid, no financial aid will be credited to the accountuntil verification has been completed. Institutional aid will not be considered final untilthe process is complete. Students will be responsible for payment penalties.

The guidelinesvary, depending upon the student's grade level and depending upon which form(s) ofaid they are receiving. Good academic standing is measured by reviewing a student'squantitative and qualitative progress. The quantitative measurement ensures that studentsare making progress toward their degree goals, while the qualitative measurementensures that students are succeeding in their coursework.•All undergraduate students are required to have a cumulative average of 2.0 GPA atthe end of each academic year. •All undergraduate students are required to maintain a 2.0 for any institutional aid; thisdoes not include scholarship aid.622         Financial Assistance•All graduate students are required to have a cumulative average of 3.0 or higher whileearning minimum number of credits to demonstrate good academic standing.•Each School at Manhattan College may implement additional guidelines forsatisfactory academic progress in their programs.In additions to Manhattan College academic progress policy for all students, students whoreceive financial aid are subject to academic progress guidelines as outlined below:I. Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA): Students must maintain the requiredcumulative grade point average established by Manhattan College to continue enrollmentand to be eligible for financial aid. Satisfactory progress will be measured for allcoursework attempted and/or completed toward the student’s degree.Attempted Credits + Transfer CreditsCumulative GPA1-262.027-592.060 and above2.0II. Earned Hours (Compared to Attempted Hours): It is recommended that studentsattempt to earn at least two-thirds of the credits required per academic year in orderto complete graduation requirements in four years. To remain eligible for financial aid,students must earn at least 67% of total cumulative hours attempted.For financial aid purposes, the following definitions and conditions apply:•To earn hours at Manhattan College, one must receive a grade of A, B, C, or D*(including “+” and “-”).

Refer to thecatalog section on grading policies.•Classes from which a student withdraws after the drop/add period count as attemptedbut not earned hours. Therefore, withdrawing from classes after the drop/add periodnegatively affects students’ ability to satisfy the hours earned standard.•When a student repeats a course, the total attempted hours will increase with eachrepeat, but the student may only earn hours for a successfully completed course once.Therefore, repeating courses may negatively affect student’s ability to satisfy the hoursearned standard.•Accepted transfer credit counts as both attempted and earned hours.III. Maximum Time Limit: To remain eligible for financial aid, undergraduate studentsmust complete their degree requirements within 150 percent of the published length oftheir academic program. At Manhattan College, for example, this means that studentsin programs requiring 120 hours for graduation are eligible for financial aid duringthe first 180 attempted hours as an undergraduate. All attempted hours are counted,including transfer hours, whether or not financial aid was received, or the course work wassuccessfully completed.SAP Reviews: At the end of the each semester, a review is completed, and students whoare out of compliance with one or more of the SAP standards will be notified by the Deanand the Office of Student Financial Services. The College’s policies on academic warning,Manhattan College            623probation and dismissal are cited under the Academic Standards and Procedures sectionof the catalog.

However, if enrolling elsewhere, thestudent must complete the appropriate forms and have the coursework pre-approvedby Manhattan College prior to enrolling in the other institution. Students must providean academic transcript after transient study coursework has been successfullycompleted.3.Maximum Time Frame: Once the Time Limit has been exceeded, aid eligibility ends,even if the student is in compliance with the other two standards. There is no regainingeligibility for aid as long as the student is an undergraduate.Once students are in compliance with all three standards (are back in compliance withthe first two standards and still in compliance with the third), they must notify the FinancialAid in writing to request a reevaluation of eligibility. This process cannot be done until allgrades and hours are posted to the student’s official record. No financial aid award can becalculated until after the review process is complete.Appeals: Federal regulations allow for certain cases in which the school may waive thestandards.

The student will automatically become ineligible forfinancial aid for the following semester. If a student is considering withdrawing from allcourses, please visit the Student Financial Services Office before you do so.If you are a full-time undergraduate student receiving TAP or any other New York Stategrant or scholarship you must meet the State Education Department’s requirements forboth satisfactory academic progress and program pursuit.Program Pursuit: means making a passing or failing grade in the following percentagesof a full-time program (which is a minimum of 12 credits per semester).1st Year of TAP Payment50% of a full-time program must be completed each semester (6 credits per semester)2nd Year of TAP PaymentManhattan College            62575% of a full-time program must be completed each semester (9 credits per semester)3rd and 4th Year of TAP Payment100% of a full-time program must be completed each semester (12 credits per semester)You must meet these program pursuit requirements every semester in order to be eligibleto receive your State aid the following semester.Satisfactory Academic Progress: (TAP) in addition to Program Pursuit requirementsyou must complete a certain number of credits each semester with a certain cumulativeindex to be eligible for the next semester’s award. The following chart outlines what yourcredits completed and cumulative index must be in order for you to be eligible for yourNew York State aid.Before being certified for this payment the following requirements must be met:SemesterMinimum CreditsMinimum GPA Accrued1st002nd61.503rd151.804th271.805th392.006th512.007th662.008th812.009th*962.0010th*1112.00*Note: Only students in five year programs, approved pursuant to section 145-2.7 of theRegulations, are eligible for more than eight semesters of undergraduate awards.A recipient of New York State aid who fails to meet the program pursuit or satisfactoryacademic progress requirements in a particular semester may wish to make up thenecessary credits or achieve the required cumulative index by taking credits at his/herown expense in a given semester. If the student is then in good academic standing forreceipt of New York State aid, the aid will be reinstated the following semester.Aid for Part-Time Study RecipientsUndergraduate students receiving New York State Aid for Part-Time Study (APTS) mustalso meet BOTH satisfactory academic progress and program pursuit requirements.Program Pursuit: means making a passing or failing grade in the following percentagesof a part-time program (which is a minimum of 6 credits per semester).1st Year or APTS Payment50% of a part-time program must be completed each semester (3 credits per semester)2nd Year of APTS Payment75% of a part-time program must be completed each semester (4 credits per semester)3rd and all subsequent Years of APTS Payment626         Financial Assistance100% of a part-time program must be completed each semester (6 credits per semester)In order to be eligible for State aid the following semester you must meet the programpursuit every semester.Satisfactory Academic Progress: The student must successfully complete a minimumnumber of semester hours of credit with a minimum grade point index according tothe same satisfactory progress chart that is printed in the previous section for full-timeundergraduate TAP recipients. The difference is that part-time APTS recipients arenot reviewed every semester for satisfactory academic progress; rather their academicprogress is reviewed in 12 credit increments. Each accumulation of 12 credits attemptedcounts for one semester on the full-time chart; an APTS recipient must meet the academicprogress requirements.A recipient of New York State Aid for Part Time Study who fails to meet the programpursuit or satisfactory academic progress requirements in a particular semester may wishto make up the necessary credits or achieve the required cumulative index by pursuingcredits at his/her own expense in a given semester. If this is done and the desired resultsachieved, the student will be eligible to receive his/her New York State aid the followingsemester.Waivers for Extenuating Circumstances: A recipient of New York State aid who is ableto document reasonable circumstances underlying the lack of academic progress in aparticular semester can provide the documentation with a written appeal outlining suchreasons to the Registrar’s Office. This request, if granted, will be processed as a one-timewaiver of the New York State satisfactory academic progress requirements and the grantwill be permitted to disburse for that term. During the waiver semester, the student mustmake up the academic progress deficiency for the next term.Transfer Students: Transfer students and students re-admitted after an absence of atleast one year from college are reviewed for satisfactory academic progress for NewYork State assistance on a somewhat different basis.
