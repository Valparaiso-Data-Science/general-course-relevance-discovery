It is open to students in all schools. The adjunct major provides students with an inter dis-ciplinary understanding of the international system as it has developed and as it affects contemporary politics and society. Students are required to take a core set of courses in history, political science, sociopolitical development, and economics that are designed to introduce key elements and concepts related to the historical development of the  Arts and Sciences • International Studies   115global political and economic system. They then choose thematic and regional areas of focus, taking courses from a variety of disciplines such as history, political science, economics, anthropology, literature, art, linguistics, global health, music, and religion. Students complete the major with either an integrating project seminar related to  the thematic focus or an honors thesis that includes a 2-quarter honors seminar. Each student majoring in international studies has a different combination of courses. Because international studies majors must show a minimum of 8 courses not double-counted in any other major(s), students should see an inter national studies adviser when designing their programs.

This approach has been fruitful where a descriptive approach is no longer adequate for studying complex systems involved in the body’s transport, regula-tion, and information processing. Equally important has been the development of devices used inside or outside the body to replace or supplement physiological functions and to enhance the quality of diagnosis and care. The interplay among the physical sciences, engineer-ing, biology, and the medical sciences takes many forms. The traditional study of complex systems—whether for power transmission, communications, or the operation and control of industrial processes—provided engineers with a number of concepts and techniques that proved valuable in analysis and design. These principles expressed in mathe-matical form are applicable to a wide range of phenomena, including those in biological processes. Information theory, statistics, and computer technology have opened new areas for exploration of sensory and central nervous activity as well as patient handling and diagnosis. Theories for feed-back controls, transport processes, materials science, and mechanics have provided new insight into homeostatic physiological processes. Analysis of heat transfer, fluid flow, and chemical-process control in living organisms requires competence in both engineering and the life sciences. Current studies further understanding of many physiologi-cal processes, which in turn leads to improvements in clini-cal practice, diag nosis, and patient care.Northwestern was among the first schools to recognize the value of a biomedical engineering background. Today the Department of Biomedical Engineering offers one of the largest and broadest programs in the country at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Most students interested in the field follow its program, but other engi-neering departments also offer biomedical options.The biomedical engineering program provides bio-medical training that is quantitative, emphasizes prob-lem solving, and treats phenomena from the molecular to the systems levels. The curriculum prepares students for careers in dentistry, medicine, or research or with healthcare corporations. Required courses in mathemat-ics, engineering, and science establish a strong foundation  Engineering and Applied Science • Biomedical Engineering   217on which the student builds a self-selected area of specialization.A minimum of 18 course units in engineering design and engineering science, as well as substantial training in design, are required for a biomedical engineering degree.Those seeking admission to dental or medical school should be familiar with the entrance requirements of schools to which they intend to apply. Many professional schools require courses in physics, organic, and/or physi-cal chemistry and laboratory biology, in addition to courses required by the biomedical engineering program. These requirements may be satisfied by judicious use of electives.Biomedical Engineering ElectivesStudents seeking depth in one particular area of biomedi-cal engineering may choose to focus their electives in one of the following three areas:• Biomechanics and rehabilitation • Biomaterials and regenerative medicine • Imaging and biophotonicsAlternately, students may choose a broader approach to the curriculum, selecting electives from two or all three of these areas. Degree in Biomedical Engineering Requirements (48 units)Core courses (32 units)See general requirements on page 210 for details. • 4 mathematics courses• 4 engineering analysis and computer proficiency courses• 4 units of basic science ◦PH-0 Projects  Must be taken P/N.CHEMICAL ENGINEERINGmccormick.northwestern.edu/chemical-biologicalChemical engineering is concerned primarily with the principles and processes involved in the conversion of raw materials into products vital to modern civilization. The products of the chemical and process industries range from antibiotics to zirconium, from petroleum to pharmaceuti-cals, from agricultural chemicals to plastics and synthetic rubber. The rapid introduction of new products gives chemical engineering its characteristic concern with the management and development of innovation. Chemical engineers have always played a pivotal role in the field  of energy and more recently have become key players in sustainability and biotechnology.While clearly rooted in chemistry, chemical engineer-ing is a distinct discipline that makes significant contri-butions to society. Concerns about efficient utilization of raw materials, cost-effective and safe processing strategies, and environmental impact have shaped the evolution of the field. Chemical engineers are uniquely skilled in understanding molecular transformations; working over a wide range of scales, from molecular to global; analyzing quantitatively; and viewing, synthesizing, and analyzing large, complex systems.Preparation for careers in the field requires a compre-hension of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering principles. The chemical engineering curriculum provides broad fundamental training and prepares graduates for the chemical and process industries or for advanced study. The program aims at developing graduates who can plan, design, and operate new processes, who can contribute to the development of new chemical products, and who have potential for managerial responsibility in highly technical industrial enterprises. Areas of SpecializationThe curriculum permits students to select one of these six areas of specialization or plan an alternate program with an adviser:• Bioengineering• Chemical process engineering• Design• Environmental engineering and sustainability• Nanotechnology and molecular engineering• Polymer science and engineeringLaboratoriesThe Undergraduate Chemical Engineering Laboratory provides facilities for exploring firsthand the quantitative experimental implications of fundamental laws in their appli cation to practical problems of heat transfer, dis-tillation, reaction engineering, and other basic operations. A computing laboratory is used in a variety of courses.Degree in Chemical EngineeringRequirements (48 units)Core courses (32 units)See general requirements on page 210 for details. • 4 mathematics courses• 4 engineering analysis and computer proficiency courses• 4 units of basic science ◦PH-0 Projects  Supervised investigation of a chemical engineering problem with submission of a final report.See the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmentalThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers two degree programs for undergraduate students, one in civil engineering and another in environmental engineering, as well as a minor in environmental engineer-ing and an architectural engineering and design certificate. Civil and environmental engineers play central roles in defining sustainable development approaches to the inter-actions of humans with earth systems. The curricula of these programs place strong emphasis on design, commu-nication, teamwork, and the development of a systems per-spective on the complex problems of today and tomorrow.Civil EngineeringCivil engineering provides solutions to pressing societal challenges for both the natural and built environments. Civil engineers design, construct, and manage visible structures, such as airports, skyscrapers, and bridges, as well as infrastructure systems. They provide safe drinking water, sustainable energy, and efficient mobility; sequester and treat waste; transform wastelands; and protect against natural disasters. Civil engineers combine engineering knowledge with initiative and creativity to satisfy each project’s unique characteristics and objectives, protect society and natural resources, and meet budget constraints. They make use of biotechnology that supports environmental restoration; materials science that develops new building materials; preconstruction computer and analytical models that pre-dict the response of infrastructure systems to stress; and advanced sensors and communication devices that monitor performance of bridges, tunnels, and buildings in real time, over long distances, and under extreme conditions. They also employ the social, economic, political, and managerial sciences and collaborate with other experts and the public.Bridging science and society, civil engineering plays a leading role in supporting economic growth through planning, designing, building, and ensuring a sustainable infrastructure system. The profession recognizes the real-ity of limited natural resources; the desire for such sustain-able practices as life-cycle analysis and sustainable design techniques; and the need for social equity in resource consumption. Northwestern’s civil engineering curriculum has been designed to satisfy diverse interests and professional goals. Students customize study plans and have extensive options for social, economic, and managerial science courses out-side the McCormick School. While civil engineering graduates typically work in consulting firms, construction companies, governmental public works and transportation departments, and concrete and steel product industries, some work in the aerospace industry, on Wall Street, or in politics and policy devel-opment. A majority of Northwestern graduates receive advanced degrees and may work in other technical fields or medicine, law, research and development, or education.Areas of SpecializationSince civil engineering students have a wide range of career options, the Department of Civil and Envi ron-mental Engineering prescribes only a minimum of required courses and subjects, allowing students to select the remainder freely or from specified broad categories. To make judicious choices that fit their needs, students are encouraged to discuss with faculty any proposed pro-gram that meets a well-defined goal. Examples of courses selected in the areas of specialization most often pursued are available on the department website.Degree in Civil EngineeringRequirements (48 units)Core courses (32 units)See general requirements on page 210 for details. • 4 mathematics courses• 4 engineering analysis and computer proficiency courses• 4 units of basic science ◦PH-0 Projects  Special studies to be done under faculty direction.

The bachelor of science in journalism (BSJ) degree program develops well-rounded students who are broadly educated in the liberal arts and sciences, knowledgeable about diverse cultures and social inequalities in the United States and abroad, and ready for careers in both traditional and non tradi tion al media and communications.Medill also offers an Integrated Marketing Commu-nications Certificate Program focusing on effective IMC strategies for an increasingly digital media environment. Students learn how to conduct research and analyze  data on consumer behavior, media usage, and marketing communications effectiveness. They learn about message creation and delivery through a wide variety of media channels. (See page 256 for more information on the  IMC certificate.)Real-world training and immersion experiences reflect Medill’s philosophy. A sophomore-year course sends stu-dents into deep subject-specific reporting and writing with an emphasis on fieldwork. They discover issues important to particular audiences and sharpen reporting and writ-ing skills as they produce relevant, engaging multimedia stories.Through the Medill on the Hill program, students may spend a quarter in Washington, DC, reporting and writ-ing about politics and Capitol Hill. The San Francisco Bay Area Immersion program, offered in partnership with the McCormick School’s Segal Design Institute, offers Medill students the opportunity to study at the intersection of design and media innovation.During their junior or senior year, students get real-world experience and networking opportunities within a media company or marketing firm through Journalism Residency. They work alongside professional mentors in one of more than 100 newspapers, magazines, broadcast stations, documentary houses, and public relations and marketing firms across the United States and selected loca-tions abroad, including South Africa, Latin America, and the Persian Gulf.In 2008 Northwestern opened a campus in Qatar offer-ing programs in journalism and communication. Evanston-based journalism students are eligible to spend a term at Northwestern University in Qatar and other universities in the Qatar Foundation’s Education City in Doha. (For more on Northwestern University in Qatar, see page 9.) Medill students routinely win national awards and go on to become leaders and innovators in journalism, media, and integrated marketing communications. ACADEMIC POLICIESRequirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science in JournalismAll Medill undergraduates pursue the bachelor of science in journalism degree. They must complete a minimum of 45 units to earn the BSJ. In addition to their studies in journalism, they acquire a strong background in the arts and sciences. The following policies apply:• Independent of the requirements set by Medill, all students must satisfy the Undergraduate Registration Requirement. (See page 17.)• Of the 45 units, at least 27 must be earned in courses outside Medill and at least 14 in Medill courses.• Journalism students must acquire significant professional experience to earn the BSJ. The requirement may be satisfied through a 4-unit Journalism Residency.• No course may be counted in more than one require-ment category, with one exception: Medill students com-pleting a double major in Weinberg College may apply courses used to meet Medill’s distribution requirements toward the second major.• Exceptions to any degree requirements must be approved by the Medill director of student life. Peti-tions and rules for filing them are available on the Medill Canvas site.Grade RequirementsStudents must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.0 (C) in all nonjournalism courses taken for a letter grade and a mini-mum GPA of 2.25 (C+) in journalism courses. In addition, all journalism students are subject to the following grade requirements:• The journalism GPA is an average of the grades (includ-ing F’s) in all journalism courses attempted.Medill School of Journalism, Media,  Integrated Marketing Communications medill.northwestern.edu Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications • Academic Options 251• Students who earn a grade of D or worse in a journalism course must retake the course until they have earned a C– or better.• When journalism courses are repeated, both grades are computed in the GPA; one course does not substitute for another.• Before starting Journalism Residency, students must  ◦Earn a grade of C or better in "
SCI 399," in a subsequent quarter. If a student takes BIOL , he or she must speak with the HPME director. Approval for this request is handled on a case-by-case basis at the director’s discretion. • ISP students in Weinberg College are subject to the  following special URR provisions: ◦Students must register for at least 6 quarters and  complete at least 23 units of credit at Northwestern. ◦The remainder of the 38.7 minimum units required of ISP students may be a combination of test and approved transfer (including study abroad) credit.A student may appeal for a URR variance to the Regis-tration Requirement Appeals Committee, which consists  of the associate provost for University enrollment, the associate provost for undergraduate education, the Univer-sity registrar, and two associate or assistant deans from  different undergraduate schools. The deans serve three-year terms on a rotating basis. The student should submit  a written petition to an adviser familiar with his or her situation. The adviser writes a letter of support and sub-mits both documents to the Office of the Registrar for  the committee’s consideration. The appeal must be specific  and document any unusual or mitigating circumstances, such as illness, family hardship, or a death in the family. The Registration Requirement Appeals Committee  convenes on a regular basis to review petitions.For additional information, interpretation, or appli-cation of the URR, contact the Office of the Registrar, 633 Clark Street, Evanston, Illinois 60208-1118, 847-491-5234, or nu-registrar@northwestern.edu.Returning StudentsStudents who withdraw from the University and wish to return must submit a Returning Student Application Form to the Office of the Registrar six weeks before the desired date of reentry. Students who seek credit for course  work taken at another institution must submit an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar, as well as have the transfer credit approved by relevant Northwestern depart-ments and officials in their home schools. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS Registration for All StudentsStudents register for classes using the CAESAR online system. The Office of the Registrar maintains a complete, up-to-date online class schedule, found by selecting the “Search for Classes” link at northwestern.edu/caesar. • A quarterly reference copy of the class schedule may be downloaded from www.registrar.northwestern.edu /registration.• The dates of registration for each quarter are announced in advance. Late registration is permitted only through the fifth full day of classes in any quarter.• Students will not earn credit for courses in which they are not officially registered.• When courses designed to be taken once are repeated, all attempts remain on the student’s record and are used to compute the cumulative grade point average. However, credit is awarded only once, following the attempt that resulted in the highest grade. Similarly, when courses that allow more than one completion are repeated more than the maximum number of allowed times, all attempts remain on the record but credit is not awarded for units taken in excess of the maximum. At the time of registration, students receive a warning mes-sage when enrolling in a class that exceeds the number of allowed completions.• Waiver of prerequisites for admission to a course may be sought from the course instructor.Changes of RegistrationChanges in registration in fall, winter, and spring quarters are subject to the following provisions:• In no case may a course be added after the fifth day of classes. No course may be dropped after the sixth Friday of classes.• In courses designated with “Student Option” grading, undergraduate students may elect to change from grade to the pass/no credit (P/N) option or vice versa through the third Friday of the quarter. Check regulations of the individual schools for specific infor mation on the P/N option.• To add a class, students must log on to CAESAR  and add the course to their record. Consent of the department or instructor may be required. See the  class schedule for specific course information. • To drop a course, students must log on to CAESAR  and drop the course from the record. In most cases  no special consent is required. • A course dropped by the sixth Friday of a quarter does not appear on the permanent academic record, and no grade is recorded. • Failure to drop a course within the time allowed may result in a failure and may be recorded with a grade of F. Undergraduate Education • Academic Regulations  19(See also Withdrawal from the University: Refunds and Change of Registration under Financial Regulations.)Registration in the School of Professional StudiesNorthwestern University School of Professional Studies,  with locations in Evanston, Chicago, and the Chicago Loop, offers courses designed primarily for working adults. Students enrolled in an undergraduate school at North-western may take SPS courses for credit only with the approval of their school’s dean or their faculty adviser. SPS students have priority, so enrollment of non-SPS under-graduate students in SPS courses is capped. Registrations are processed on the first day of the quarter, and priority is given to students who need a course to complete a major.To register for SPS courses, students must• Pick up a Dual Registration Form from the Office of  the Registrar in Evanston.• Secure the required approvals.• Turn in the form at the Office of the Registrar in  Evanston as soon as possible before classes start. Interschool TransfersUndergraduate students who wish to transfer from one school or college of the University to another must have  an interschool transfer approved by the dean’s office of each school. A return to the original school must be approved in the same way. Approval of an interschool transfer is usually contingent on satisfactory performance in the original school. The policy concerning inter school transfer and application deadlines can be found at  www.registrar.northwestern.edu/forms/interschool _transfer.html.Cancellation of RegistrationStudents who register for a quarter and later decide not  to attend must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing before the first day of classes of the quarter to avoid being charged the applicable tuition and fees.Withdrawal from the UniversityStudents who wish to withdraw from the University after registering for classes must file a withdrawal form (avail-able at the Office of the Registrar) and have it approved by appropriate school and/or Student Affairs officials. If withdrawals are filed before the deadline to drop classes, that quarter’s registered courses will be removed from the transcript and a withdrawal notation added. After the drop deadline has passed, a withdrawal petition period begins during which students may request complete withdrawal from the term or from individual courses. Approved peti-tions will result in W grades. Withdrawals may no  longer be requested after the final exam or the final  assessment due date, or after 5 p.m. two Fridays before exams begin, whichever is sooner. Detailed procedures can be found at www.registrar.northwestern.edu. (See also Withdrawal from the University: Refunds under Financial Regulations.)Readmission to the UniversityUndergraduate students who have not registered for one or more quarters of an academic year must file an applica-tion to reenter with their school dean’s office no later than six weeks before the first day of registration of the quarter in which they plan to return.Application to reenter is not required if students have registered during the spring quarter and intend to return in the fall.If a student interrupts a program of study for an extended period of time and if degree requirements are changed during this period, the new requirements nor-mally must be met. Any modification of the requirements is made by the appropriate administrative officers of the school in which the student is registered.Work at Other InstitutionsStudents who wish to transfer credit for work taken else-where during an absence from Northwestern must obtain advance approval of their proposed course of study. A peti-tion for credit for non-Northwestern courses may be filed at www.registrar.northwestern.edu/graduation/non_nu _transfer_credit.html. An official signed and sealed tran-script documenting that work must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar in order for credit to be applied to the student’s record.Students may not register concurrently at Northwest-ern and at another institution and receive transfer credit for work taken at the other institution unless permission is granted in advance by the office of the dean of their schools. This applies to traditional and online or blended-format courses.Petition to GraduateUndergraduate students should submit a graduation peti-tion one calendar year before they expect to graduate. Students in Weinberg College, the School of Commu-nication, the School of Education and Social Policy, the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, and the Bienen School of Music sub-mit petitions to the Office of the Registrar; McCormick School students submit petitions to their school’s academic services office. Failure to petition in a timely fashion may delay graduation or result in omission of the student’s name from the printed Commencement program.For additional information, see www.registrar .northwestern.edu/graduation.Academic AdvisingAcademic advising is an essential component of an under-graduate education. All first-year students are assigned an 20 Undergraduate Education • Academic Regulations academic adviser through their school. Returning students may obtain academic advice through their major depart-ment and from the dean’s office of their school. Specialized advice on academic issues that transcend school boundaries —such as interschool transfer—may be obtained from the University Academic Advising Center.In addition to meeting with an academic adviser on a regular basis, students should routinely check their aca-demic requirements—accessible via CAESAR—to ensure that they are meeting their degree requirements; any con-cerns about progress or discrepancies in the report should be promptly discussed with an adviser. Classification of StudentsStudents are classified as follows:• Senior: has completed at least 33 units• Junior: has completed at least 22 but less than 33 units (engineering co-op students are considered preseniors when they have completed 32 units and seniors when they have completed 40 units)• Sophomore: has completed at least 11 but less than  22 units• First-year student: has completed less than 11 units• Graduate student: has a bachelor’s degree or equivalent and has been admitted to a graduate program• Special student: is not working toward a degree at Northwestern but is working for creditFor loan deferment and enrollment verification  purposes, student status is defined as follows:• Full-time: enrolled in at least 3 units or the equivalent• Half-time: enrolled in at least 2 but fewer than 3 units  or the equivalent• Part-time: enrolled in fewer than 2 quarter-courses or the equivalent (also referred to as less than half-time)Grading PoliciesThe following grading system is used in computing the grade point average:Grade Grade PointsA   4.0A–   3.7B+   3.3B   3.0B–   2.7C+   2.3C   2.0C–   1.7D   1.0F   0X Failed to earn credit: missed final examination 0Y Failed to earn credit: work incomplete 0The following notations are ignored in computing the grade point average:P Pass with creditN No grade, no creditK In progressS Satisfactory: noncredit courseU Unsatisfactory: noncredit courseW Withdrawn by permissionNR No grade reported by instructorClass RankNorthwestern University does not rank its students.Pass/No Credit (P/N) Many undergraduate courses are open to the P (pass) or N (no credit) option, which allows students to explore fields beyond their areas of specialization without concern about grade point average. Students may exercise the P/N option in classes designated with “Student Option” grading in CAESAR. For information about a particular school’s P/N policy, see that school’s chapter in this catalog.Incomplete Coursework At the end of a quarter a grade of X (missed final exam) or Y (work incomplete) will be given only if the instructor believes the student has a reasonable chance of passing the course by taking an examination or turning in the required work, or both. Some undergraduate schools prohibit the posting of X or Y grades without the approval of the dean’s office. Students should contact their school for its regula-tions concerning X and Y grades.For credit to be awarded, the student must complete the course and the grade must be changed no later than the end of the following like term, or the incomplete will be changed to a final grade of F (failure). Students planning to graduate within that time frame must complete courses and receive grades before graduating. Incomplete grades remaining at the time of degree conferral will be changed to final grades of F (failure). No academic record changes, including grade changes, are allowed after a degree has been conferred.Regular ExaminationsRegular course examinations are held during the last week of each quarter at the times indicated in the quarterly class schedule, accessible via CAESAR and at www.registrar .northwestern.edu/registration. Summer Session examina-tions are usually held at the last class meeting. Students are responsible for knowing the time and location of each examination. Early examinations are not permitted. Both the instructor and the dean may permit a student to be absent from the final examination for cause beyond the student’s control; normally such permission must be secured in advance of the date of the examination. For credit to be awarded, the student must complete the course  Undergraduate Education • Academic Regulations  21their coursework must request it from the institutions they attended or through their study abroad programs.Access to Student RecordsUnder the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act,  all students have certain rights with regard to their educa-tional records. Northwestern’s student records policy  is available at www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic _records/FERPA_policy.html.Students’ rights under FERPA include• Inspect and review their educational records at North-western University• Request an amendment of their records to ensure that the records are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of privacy or other rights• Consent to release or to restrict disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in their educational records, except under certain limited circumstances when, by law, consent is not required• File a complaint with the US Department of Edu cation concerning alleged failures by Northwestern University to comply with FERPA requirementsThe University’s Use of EmailEmail is the University’s mechanism for official commun-i   ca tion with students, and Northwestern has the right to ex pect that students will read official email in a timely fashion.All students are assigned a “u.northwestern.edu” address that is maintained in the University email direc-tory. Northwestern provides a convenient mechanism for students who want to forward email from the University address to another email address of their choice, but  students assume the risk of forwarding email. Failure  to receive or read University communication that was  sent to the “u.northwestern.edu” address does not absolve  a student from knowing and complying with the content  of the communication. Faculty may use email for communicating with students registered in their classes so that all students will be able to comply with course requirements.Academic IntegrityAcademic integrity at Northwestern is based on a respect for individual achievement that lies at the heart of aca-demic culture. Every faculty member and student belongs to a community of scholars in which academic integrity is a fundamental commitment.Students enrolled at Northwestern are expected to adhere to the University’s standards of academic integ-rity. Questions about the acceptability of specific behavior should be addressed to the appropriate faculty member or school dean. The following is a nonexhaustive list of types of behavior that violate the standards of academic integrity:and the grade must be changed no later than the end of the following like term, or the incomplete will be changed to a final grade of F (failure). Students planning to graduate within that time frame must complete courses and receive grades before graduating. Incomplete grades remaining at the time of degree conferral will be changed to final grades of F (failure).Class Attendance and AbsenceStudents are expected to attend all sessions of the  courses for which they are registered. Excessive absence  is cause for failure in the course. Some courses require attendance at the first class meeting; students may be dropped for nonattendance. Such courses are designated  in CAESAR as “First Class Mandatory.”Grade ReportsQuarterly grades are not mailed but are delivered online through CAESAR. Students may print a copy of their grades from CAESAR for verification purposes.Northwestern University TranscriptsStudents who have satisfied all financial obligations to  the University may request an official transcript of their academic record from the Office of the Registrar in per-son, by fax, or through CAESAR. Northwestern provides transcripts either on paper or in the form of a certified PDF that may be distributed securely. A fee is charged for all official transcripts (see Fees under Tuition and Fees). Current students may print unofficial copies for their per-sonal use from CAESAR.Except for internal educational uses or as otherwise required by law, Northwestern issues official transcripts only upon written authorization of the student concerned. Requests for transcripts initiated by persons or agencies other than the student or appropriate educational agen-cies will not be filled until written authorization has been secured from the student. When these requests can be anticipated, students can avoid delay by providing such authorization in advance. Because of the confidential nature of a student’s record, telephone or email requests for transcripts will not be accepted.Former students may order an official transcript by  following the instructions at www.registrar.northwestern .edu/academic_records/obtaining_a_transcript.html. The site provides full information on the University’s policies and procedures governing academic records.Transcripts from Other InstitutionsNorthwestern neither releases nor certifies copies of tran-scripts or other academic documents received from other schools or institutions. This includes test score reports and transcripts submitted to Northwestern for admission or evaluation of transfer or study abroad credits. Students who study abroad and subsequently need a transcript of 22 Undergraduate Education • Academic Regulations It is the responsibility of every member of the academic community to be familiar with the specific policies of his or her school. A student who violates these policies may be subject to sanctions, including but not limited to one or more of the following: a letter of warning; a defined period of probation with the attachment of conditions; a period of suspension with or without the attachment of condi-tions; course failure; notation on the official record; exclu-sion from the University, with notation on the transcript; or revocation of an awarded degree. A student may not change his or her registration in a course in which a viola-tion of academic integrity has been alleged, regardless of whether the allegation has been referred to the designated school official. Nor may a student receive a University degree while a finding is pending or while a suspension has been imposed pursuant to a finding. Information on proce-dures that will be followed in cases of alleged violations of academic integrity may be obtained from the dean’s office of each school. This will include information regarding how decisions may be appealed to the appropriate Univer-sity officials, up to and including the University provost.  A complete statement of the University’s principles regarding academic integrity may be obtained from the Office of the Provost at northwestern.edu/provost /students/integrity.Academic StandingThe faculty of the school in which a student is enrolled determines the academic standing of that student. Con-tinuing enrollment should be interpreted as good academic standing.Academic Probation Academic probation constitutes notice of unsatisfac tory academic performance; it is a warning that minimum stan-dards for graduation are not being met. Unless a student demonstrates significant scholastic improvement during the period of probation and thereby indicates ability to fulfill degree requirements within a reasonable period of time, the student may be dismissed from the University.The following are ordinarily placed on academic probation:• Students who have received final grades below C in 2 or more courses in any term• Sophomores, juniors, or seniors who have a cumula-tive academic record below a C average on all work attempted at Northwestern University• Students who have failed to complete at least 3 quarter-courses or the equivalent in each of 2 consecutive quarters• Students who, on account of dropped courses, failure, or uncompleted courses, have failed to earn credit for an average of 3 quarter-courses per quarter after 6 quarters of residence • Cheating: using unauthorized notes, study aids, or infor-ma tion on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for regrad ing; allowing another person to do one’s work  and sub mitting that work under one’s own name;  submitting identical or similar papers for credit in  more than one course without prior permission from  the course instructors• Plagiarism: submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one’s own work without attributing those same portions to their correct source (material discuss-ing the use and acknowledgment of sources is available in the Office of the Provost)• Fabrication: falsifying or inventing any information, data, or citation; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the approp riate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected• Obtaining an unfair advantage: stealing, reproducing, circulating, or otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the time authorized by the instruc-tor; stealing, destroying, defacing, or concealing library materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; unauthorized collaborating on an academic assign-ment; retaining, possessing, using, or circulating previ-ously given examination materials, where those materials clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at the conclusion of the examination; inten-tionally obstructing or interfering with another student’s academic work; otherwise undertaking activity with the purpose of creating or obtaining an unfair academic advantage over other students’ academic work• Aiding and abetting dishonesty: providing material, infor -ma tion, or other assistance to another person with knowledge that such aid could be used in any of the vio-lations stated above; providing false infor mation in con-nection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity; providing or selling class materials to websites that sell such materials to students, including notes, PowerPoint slides, outlines, and graded assignments.• Falsification of records and official documents: altering  documents affecting academic records; forging signa-tures of authorization or falsifying information on  an official academic document, grade report, letter  of permission, petition, ID card, or any other official University document• Unauthorized access to computerized academic or administrative records or systems: viewing or altering computer records; modifying computer programs or systems; releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access; interfering with the use or  availability of computer systems or information Undergraduate Education • Honors and Prizes • Special Academic Opportunities 23• Students who have failed to maintain a C average in  the major or a professional field of studyThe faculty of each school may impose such additional conditions of academic probation as they may deem appropriate.Removal from Academic ProbationStudents on academic probation are ordinarily removed from probation if the deficiencies that resulted in pro-bation have been remedied during the next succeeding quarter in residence. Students are rarely removed from probation on the basis of a program consisting of less than 4 courses graded on a basis other than the pass/no credit option.If students on probation who receive grades of X or Y are not dismissed, probation continues until they have completed all courses or until the end of the next quarter in residence, when the students’ records are again subject to scrutiny.In no case are students removed from probation at the end of a quarter in which they have failed any course.Academic DismissalThe following is a partial list of categories of students who may be dismissed for academic deficiencies (in every case the decision is determined in part by the student’s cumula-tive academic record):• Students on academic probation whose academic records have not improved significantly during the period of probation (which will not normally exceed 2 consecutive quarters)• Students not on academic probation who fail in half the work in any quarter or Summer Session• Students who demonstrate flagrant neglect of academic work at any time• Students who do not make satisfactory progress toward completion of degree requirementsAs a matter of general policy, the probation period for a first-year student may be extended to the third quarter of residence if such extension appears to be in the best inter-ests of the student and the University. Such consideration is not granted to a first-year student whose record clearly discloses lack of aptitude or flagrant neglect of work.Disciplinary SuspensionStudents suspended from Northwestern by the University Hearing and Appeals System may not receive Northwest-ern credit for academic work at any other institution dur-ing the period of suspension.HONORS AND PRIZESGraduation with School HonorsDegrees with honors are determined by grades in all work at Northwestern University and are awarded to the top 25 percent of the students in each school who complete graduation requirements. Spring quarter graduates in the highest 5 percent of the school’s class are awarded degrees summa cum laude; those in the next 8 percent, magna cum laude; and those in the next 12 percent, cum laude. Gradu-ation honors are not announced before June Commence-ment, and the GPA cutoffs for each level of honors based on the stated percentages are not made public. Students who complete degrees in the summer, fall, or winter quar-ter are awarded school honors based on the GPA cutoffs established by the prior spring quarter’s graduating class.Graduation with Departmental HonorsDepartmental honors may be granted to graduating seniors who have done outstanding work in a department in connection with a research project or work of an inte-grative nature. Students are nominated for these honors by their departments. The faculty of the school concerned makes the final awards. See the school chapters of this  catalog for more information on departmental honors.Honorary Organizations and PrizesStudents who qualify by reason of superior scholarship or other outstanding achievement are eligible for member-ship in certain honorary societies. Some of these recognize outstanding performance within one of the undergraduate schools, while others recognize distinction in a specific field of study, certain extracurricular options, or other endeavors.In addition, several prizes established through gifts and endowments are awarded each year to undergraduate students. Some are all-University prizes, and others are available only to students in the school, department, or program that administers the awards. Prizes may recognize past achievements or provide students with funding for research projects or creative activities. See the section on support for undergraduate research endeavors on page 25.SPECIAL ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIESSecond Majors, Minors, and CertificatesSome students complete two majors or supplement their major with a minor and/or certificate. Often these pro-grams are in the same undergraduate school, but com-pleting programs in two or more schools may also be an option. See the Cross-School Options chapter and the relevant school and department sections in this catalog for details.24 Undergraduate Education • Special Academic OpportunitiesMaster’s Programs in the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog for more information. Teaching CertificationThe School of Education and Social Policy offers its  students and students in Weinberg College the option to complete the requirements of the secondary teaching program and qualify for Illinois state certification. See Teacher Cert ific ation at Northwestern in the School of Education and Social Policy chapter of this catalog.Study Abroadnorthwestern.edu/studyabroadNorthwestern encourages qualified students to study abroad. With early planning, most students, regardless of school or major, should be able to study abroad dur-ing the academic year and still graduate within four years. Students may also study abroad during the summer on one of Northwestern’s summer programs or on an approved unaffiliated program.The Study Abroad Office, the Office of International Program Development, and the Global Engagement Stud-ies Institute provide information and advising to all stu-dents interested in study abroad. Students must submit a study abroad application, including signatures from school advisers and, in many cases, department advisers; approval is required before the study abroad experience. All students approved by Northwestern to study abroad remain regis-tered at Northwestern while abroad. Most Northwestern students studying abroad do so on one of more than 150 programs administered by or affili-ated with the University. Students participating in Univer-sity exchange programs and some programs administered by the University continue to pay North western tuition. For all other programs, students pay the program fee plus a Northwestern administrative fee. Students participating in Northwestern-sponsored and affiliated programs may apply for financial aid, including Northwestern grant assis-tance, to help offset the cost of their programs. Students who wish to participate in unaffiliated pro-grams must petition for permission to apply. No financial aid is available from the University for students on  unaffiliated programs, and Northwestern cannot process their outside aid.Since study abroad often requires special language or other preparation, interested students should consult with study abroad advisers early in their Northwestern careers. Other resources include information sessions, an annual study abroad fair, and a resource library with detailed information on programs and study abroad policies.Field Studies and InternshipsMany off-campus field studies, internships, and research opportunities sponsored by schools and departments, including McCormick’s co-op program, are available to Self-Designed MajorA self-designed major permits students, with the permis-sion of the school’s curriculum committee or dean, to con-centrate advanced study in an area other than one of those recognized through a departmental or inter disciplinary major. This option is identified as an ad hoc major in Weinberg College and the Bienen School of Music and as integrated engineering studies in the McCormick School.Dual Bachelor’s Degree ProgramsQualified students may earn bachelor’s degrees from two different undergraduate schools at Northwestern. Five years of full-time study are usually required.For information on applying to the combined pro-grams, see Application to Dual Bachelor’s Degree Pro-grams on page 11. For a full list and descriptions of all the programs, including requirements, see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. Accelerated Degree ProgramsHonors Program in Medical EducationThe Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME) provides an opportunity for highly talented high school seniors to be admitted to an undergraduate program and to the Feinberg School of Medicine and to complete their formal premedical and medical studies in seven or eight years. Each year a small number of students are admitted to the pro gram and to Weinberg College, the School of Commu nication, or the McCormick School. For infor-mation on applying to HPME, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. For a description of the program, including requirements for students in the different under-graduate schools, see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog.Integrated Science ProgramThe Integrated Science Program (ISP) is a highly selec-tive undergraduate program of integrated science stud-ies within Weinberg College. The curriculum provides a thorough and rigorous background in the major scientific disciplines and mathematics and offers special research opportunities. ISP can lead to a bachelor’s degree in three years or, after a fourth year at Northwestern, to a double major or an advanced degree. For information on applying to ISP, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. For a description of the program, see page 112 in the Weinberg College chapter of this catalog and isp.northwestern.edu.Accelerated Master’s ProgramsCombined bachelor’s/master’s degree programs enable exceptional undergraduates in the McCormick School, the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Market-ing Communications, and Weinberg College to receive both degrees in less than the usual time. See Accelerated  Undergraduate Education • Special Academic Opportunities 25Northwestern students. The programs vary greatly. Some carry academic credit and/or a stipend. Some are done in conjunction with coursework, while others require full-time commitment and may involve living away from campus. Field study and internship oppor tunities are avail-able during both the regular academic year and Summer Session. See the individual schools and departments in this catalog for details. Additional information on intern-ship opportunities is available from Northwestern Career Advancement. Fellowshipsnorthwestern.edu/fellowshipsNorthwestern undergraduates win an array of national and international fellowships. Such awards fund study, research, and service opportunities in the United States and around the globe. The Office of Fellowships works with students in group and individual advising sessions to identify fellow-ships that fit their educational, professional, and personal goals. The office offers guidance on the preparation of written applications and conducts practice interviews.Special CoursesStudent-Organized Seminars (SOS)Students who wish to pursue studies not included in the catalog may plan and initiate their own courses under the supervision of sponsoring faculty members. SOS credit courses may be developed in all undergraduate schools except the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications.Residence-Linked SeminarsStudents in residential colleges or residential communities may take residence-linked seminars on a theme of common interest. Associated faculty members direct the seminars, which meet in the residence and are normally limited to 10 students. The course number and title indicate the Wein-berg distribution area in which a seminar counts. Proposals for seminars must be approved by Weinberg College.Independent Study (399)Many departments offer seminars and independent studies for qualified undergraduates. An independent study, typi-cally numbered 399, in any department enables a student to engage in indi vidual special study and research, which may involve work in a laboratory or library, fieldwork out-side the University, or the creation of a work of art. The maximum credit a student may receive for 399 (or equiva-lent independent study) during any quarter is 2 units. Support for Undergraduate Research Endeavorsundergradresearch.northwestern.edu globalresearchopportunities.northwestern.eduThe Office of Undergraduate Research pursues three pri-mary goals: administer its grant programs, which award more than $1,100,000 a year; coordinate University-wide efforts in undergraduate research and communicate these opportunities to students; and help students prepare for these experiences. The office aims to encourage as many students as possible to engage in research and creative projects.The office’s flagship Undergraduate Research Grant program, funding research and creative work in any dis-cipline, offers a $3,500 stipend for eight-week summer projects and up to $1,000 for research expenses during the academic year. To help students get started, the Undergrad-uate Research Assistant Program offers students funding to work as mentored research assistants on faculty projects. Other grants provide support for intensive language study during the summer or for conference travel. An annual $9,000 award—the Circumnavigators Travel-Study Grant, jointly funded by Northwestern University and the Cir-cumnavigators Club  Foundation—enables one undergradu-ate researcher to undertake around-the-world travel during the summer before senior year. The office contributes to the Global and Research Opportunities website, allowing students easy, searchable access to opportunities within and beyond Northwestern. Because many students may be undertaking independent projects and applying for funds for the first time, the office offers one-on-one advising and regularly conducts informa-tion sessions and workshops, working with various partners on campus—from the schools, departments, labs, and other groups—to ensure that students receive guidance relevant to their research interests. Outstanding research projects are showcased each year at the annual Undergraduate Research and Arts Exposition, which features a Creative Arts Festival in addition to poster and panel presentations by undergraduate researchers.Many schools and departments at Northwestern also provide funds to support undergraduate research.Transition ProgramsNumerous opportunities, both academic and nonacademic, exist for new undergraduates to transition to Northwest-ern before the start of the regular academic year. Academic opportunities include two Arch Scholars programs—Bridge and Bio:&ChemEXCEL—plus the Summer Academic Workshop in Weinberg College and the EXCEL (Excel-lence in Engineering Leadership) program in the McCor-mick School. Beyond the first year, Weinberg College offers Bridge II summer preparatory courses for chemistry and economics courses typically taken in the sophomore year.26 Although the course listings in this catalog are as complete and exact as is possible at the time of printing, some changes may occur later, and courses may be dropped or added. The class schedule for each quarter is posted on CAESAR and contains a complete and updated listing of classes for each quarter. The University reserves the right to cancel classes when necessary, including those for which registration is not sufficient.Undergraduate Course Credits and QuartersTraditional undergraduate work in all the schools on the Evanston campus is on the quarter system. In a quarter-long course, students and faculty meet at least three hours per week, and students are awarded 1.0 unit of credit. Exceptions are courses that meet less than three hours per week, which carry less than 1.0 unit, and 15-week courses, which carry 1.5 units.For purposes of transfer to other institutions or for cer-tification stated in credit or semester hours, a quarter-long course bearing 1.0 unit of credit is generally the equivalent of 2²/3 (2.66) semester hours. In quarter hours, 1 quarter-long course is equal to 4 quarter hours of undergraduate credit.Numbering SystemA three-part alphanumeric code denotes all courses. PH-0 Independent Research  Supervised indepen-dent research project. Prerequisite: 398 or previous 399.See the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. BUSINESS INSTITUTIONS bip.northwestern.eduThe minor in business institutions offered by the Harvey Kapnick Center for Business Institutions is designed to provide undergraduates with a rigorous introduction to business and management fundamentals. It allows students to prepare for employment in the business world by build-ing on skills and knowledge they acquire through other Northwestern coursework. The program also connects students’ study of business and management fundamentals to broader areas of academic inquiry, both by linking the study of business management principles to the social sci-ences scholarship on which it is based, and by introducing social sciences and humanities scholarship on the cultural, political, philosophical, literary, and social aspects of busi-ness institutions. Thus, the program is not meant to serve as narrowly conceived preprofessional training; instead it offers a broad multi disciplinary perspective on a significant area of inquiry in 21st-century society. Students without extensive quantitative training are particularly encouraged to apply. The program is designed so students can acquire the necessary quantitative back-ground by completing four basic prerequisite courses in mathematics, statistics, and economics.Minor in Business InstitutionsThe minor in business institutions requires the success-ful completion with a grade of C– or above of 11 courses: 4 prerequisite courses in mathematics, statistics, and eco-nomics; 4 business tools courses; 1 writing and speaking course; and 2 social sciences and humanities electives. Students must complete the 4 prerequisite courses before declaring the minor.  Interested students should consult a program adviser or visit the program office for information.Prerequisites (4 units)• -0 Independent Study  Faculty-directed research. Consent of instructor required.COMPARATIVE LITERARY STUDIES complit.northwestern.edu The Comparative Literary Studies Program is an inter-departmental, interdisciplinary program for the study of literature across national and linguistic lines. Those who work in the field of comparative literature hold that lan-guage is not an indifferent medium of expression but an integral dimension of every expressive act. Drawing on faculty from the various literature departments as well as from disciplines such as art history, film studies, music, and philosophy, the CLS program examines literary texts within the context of diverse literary traditions and other cultural phenomena. CLS encourages students not only to read and interpret works of literature but also to reflect on the assumptions, methods, and goals that shape literary and other humanistic studies.In contrast to studying one culture’s literature over a specific time period, CLS juxtaposes literatures of differ-ent cultures and epochs, studying the themes, conven-tions, and movements shared by distinct literary traditions as well as those features that distinguish them from each other. Building on Northwestern’s traditional strengths in European and North American literatures, CLS now also offers programs of study in the literatures of East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. By engaging in cross-disciplinary scholarship across languages and histori-cal eras, students encounter the literary achievements of people with vastly different histories, frames of cultural reference, and poetic traditions.Their course of study provides CLS students with a range of innovative theoretical approaches to literary texts, movements, and genres, along with a strong commitment to traditional literary interpretation, philological methods, and critical analysis. In considering texts ranging from the classics of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations to con-temporary critical theory, students not only learn to under-stand specific literary works but also raise questions about their relations to other forms of discourse and about the nature of literature itself. To this end, the CLS program emphasizes the study of various types of specifically literary theory (such as structuralist, poststructuralist, psychoana-lytic, sociopolitical, and new historical) and of the theoreti-cal and methodological concerns of other disciplines (such as anthropology, history, philosophy, gender and sexuality studies, and sociology).Finally, comparative literary studies considers literary texts in relation to other forms of creative production. The relationship of literature to other arts, such as music, the fine arts, and new media, is an important focus of inter-est in many courses, and students are encouraged to take classes in other disciplines.Major in Comparative Literary StudiesStudents pursuing a program in comparative literature need to be acquainted with at least two literary tradi-tions. They choose a first literature, normally that written in their native tongue, and a second literature written in another language. They take at least 2 courses in each, as well as at least 1 course in non-Western literature either  in translation or in the original language.Introductory CLS courses provide students with a range of theoretical approaches to literary texts in partic-ular and the study of culture in general. Advanced CLS courses allow students to use their linguistic skills to  further explore literary themes, movements, genres, and periods on a comparative basis. By spring of junior year, majors in CLS choose a concentration with the director of undergraduate stud-ies. Each concentration consists of 3 courses, of which 1 is a CLS “gateway” to the concentration. Examples of  Arts and Sciences • Comparative Literary Studies   77concentrations include the following; others may be cre-ated with the director of undergraduate studies.• Literature and media (202 or 206 plus 2 courses on media from radio/television/film or any literature department)• Literature and philosophy (207/ research courses may be sub-stituted for courses on the science list. Foundations in science and math (Units depend on chemis-try and mathematics sequences taken.) Students should complete the following courses in their first two years:•  or -0 Independent Study  Independent research on special problems under direct supervision of a faculty adviser. Comprehensive report required. Prerequisite: consent of program director. Arts and Sciences • Ethics and Civic Life • French and Italian  93ETHICS AND CIVIC LIFEbradyprogram.northwestern.edu The interdisciplinary Brady Scholars Program in Ethics and Civic Life provides students with the opportunity to examine and practice the ethics of citizenship and leader-ship. The three-year program includes academic, interna-tional, and service components. Brady Scholars are selected in spring of the first year. As sophomores, Brady Scholars enroll each quarter in  a seminar investigating what a good human life is, what a good person is, and what a good society is and asking how we can make our cities, nation, and world better places. Each group of Brady Scholars selects one local community challenge for further study. In junior year, Brady Scholars participate in a study abroad program and, in addition to their regular course-work, learn how the foreign country addresses the  challenge selected by their group. Moral philosophy, global citizenship, and community engagement are integrated for Brady Program seniors when their 16-student class works collectively to provide concrete solutions to a social challenge in Evanston, draw-ing on their three years of rigorous research and academic study of the challenge. Seniors receive 1 unit of academic credit for 373-1,2. Courses Specific topics in the sophomore-year seminars 273-1,2,3 will vary as different professors participate. The senior year community engagement sequence 373-1,2 will relate to the community challenge.-0 Independent Study  Study and research projects carried out under faculty supervision. A written proposal, signed by the professor with whom the student will study, should be submitted to the director of under-graduate studies. Consent of department required.PORTUGUESESee Spanish and Portuguese.PSYCHOLOGYpsychology.northwestern.edu The study of psychology includes a wide range of top-ics in the natural and social sciences. It provides students an opportunity to increase their understanding of them-selves and other people as developing individuals, bio-logical organisms, and participants in society. Because of the strong research orientation of the department, it also provides an understanding of how research is done and an opportunity to participate directly in research.A major in psychology may lead in various directions after graduation. Graduate study may prepare a student for a career as an academic, clinical, industrial, or other kind of psychologist. With course offerings spanning the areas of cognitive science, psychobiology, psychopathology, health psychology, and social psychology, psychology is also a useful major for students planning careers in educa-tion, medicine, law, or management. It provides knowledge about human behavior and about research methods and data analysis that is valuable in business, the helping pro-fessions, and other occupations.At the graduate level, the department recognizes sev-eral specialties with programs leading to the PhD. Though opportunities for study and research are available to under-graduates in all of these areas, there is only one under-graduate psychology major. Its requirements are designed to give every student a mastery of the basic methods and a balanced exposure to different aspects of psychology. Beyond that, students are encouraged to follow their inter-ests in regular courses and in independent study. Extensive laboratory facilities and research experiences are available.Major in PsychologyDepartment courses (11 units)• 3 core courses: 110, 201 (or approved substitute), and 205• 8 additional courses ◦   At least 2 must be personality, clinical, or social psy-chology courses chosen from 204, 215, 303, 306, 315, 326, 357, 371, 375, 376, 377, 385, 386. ◦ At least 2 must be cognitive psychology or neurosci-ence courses chosen from 212; 228; 312-1,2; 316; 321; 324; 333; 334; 335; 336; 346; 358; 361; 362; 363; 365; 368; COG -0 Special Problems in Materials Science  Individual problems, including library and design work; comprehensive report on a specific phase of modern  materials science. Credit to be arranged. MECHANICAL ENGINEERINGmccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanicalThe Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a broad range of programs leading to the bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering.Mechanical engineering has always meant engines and machinery, but the character of modern engines and machinery has changed enormously because of the ever-increasing demands of performance, compactness, reli-ability, and productivity. The early devices were built by ingenious mechanics who possessed the know-how to reduce ideas to practice. In an increasingly competitive world, traditional know-how and creative ability are as necessary as ever but no longer sufficient. It is also neces-sary to know why things occur and thus be able to guide the earliest stages of planning. With finite resources and increasing awareness of the environment, mechanical engi-neers must cope with the undesirable effects of pollution as well as the traditional concerns of efficiency and safety. The tools they need must be more sophisticated. Mechanical engineering plays a dominant role in a wide spectrum of industries, among them transportation (auto-motive, rail, air, and marine), heavy machinery (machines producing other machines), the power industry, the envi-ronmental industry (heating, ventilation, and air-condi-tioning), robotics, light precision-machine enterprises (optical, prosthetic devices, mechanical instruments, and the like), and numerous commercial-product industries. Preparation for a career in mechanical engineer-ing requires a basic understanding of the mathematical, physical, and engineering principles essential to planning, designing, and manufacturing new equipment. The curric-ulum provides a broad fundamental preparation for direct entry into industry as well as for further professional study. The first part of the curriculum is devoted to mathematics, 246 Engineering and Applied Science • Mechanical Engineeringphysics, and chemistry. With this background, fundamental mechanical engineering subjects, such as dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and thermodynamics, are studied, followed by specialized subjects, such as manu-facturing, heat transfer, and automatic control. During the final two years design courses, laboratory courses, and project courses allow students to acquire a taste for the complex task of designing, analyzing, and building a piece of “hardware.” In particular, students become aware of the relationships among conceptual design, subsequent analy-sis (mathematical modeling), manufacturing, systematic experimentation, and final testing. Supporting courses in allied fields of science and engineering broaden technical proficiency, while the elective courses in social sciences, fine arts, history, and philosophy enlarge the background in the problems of humanity. Elective ConcentrationsThe program in mechanical engineering is designed to appeal to students with a wide variety of interests and professional goals. By choosing the 4 required elective courses wisely, students can develop a highly personalized curriculum. Some areas of concentration are computer-aided design and manufacturing, fluid mechanics, robot-ics, systems and control, and tribology. In addition, there are seven concentrations: biomedical engineering, design, energy, intelligent mechanical systems, manufacturing, nanotechnology/MEMS, and solid mechanics.The biomedical engineering concentration is open to students interested in the biological and medical applica-tions of mechanical engineering procedures. Students in this concentration can also satisfy the entrance require-ments of medical schools. The design concentration focuses on product design with related conceptual and manufacturing processes. The energy concentration emphasizes the mechanical aspects of energy conversion and management. The intelligent mechanical systems concentration focuses on the design of devices featuring mechanical hardware interfaces with electronic hardware and software. The manufacturing concentration is directed toward planning and selecting manufacturing methods, design for manufacture, computer-aided flexible automation and robotics, and increased efficiency and productivity of cur-rent and emerging manufacturing technologies. The nanotechnology/microelectromechanical systems concentration focuses on engineering at nanometer- and micrometer-length scales, including properties of materials and design and fabrication of devices.The solid mechanics concentration focuses on the study of stress and strain in solid bodies, along with the applica-tion of computational methods for stress analysis. A listing of courses that satisfy the elective requirements may be found in the department office. FacilitiesA detailed description of facilities in the reconstructed mechanical engineering laboratories is available in the department office.Degree in Mechanical EngineeringRequirements (48 units)Core courses (32 units)See general requirements on page 210 for details. • 4 mathematics courses• 4 engineering analysis and computer proficiency courses• 4 units of basic science ◦PH"

Many Northwest-ern faculty are members of more than one department or program, and many of their academic endeavors cut across traditional fields of study. Similarly, many Northwestern students have interests that span traditional academic boundaries.Each of Northwestern’s six undergraduate schools has its own unique curriculum, but many courses across the University are open to students from all six undergraduate schools. In addition, each school offers majors, minors,  certificates, field studies, or other programs in which stu-dents from other schools may participate. Collaborative efforts involving more than one undergraduate school, an undergraduate school and a graduate program, or a University center or institute provide additional options for students. The University is committed to developing programs that build pedagogical and intellectual bridges between disciplines and across schools to create new  interdisciplinary opportunities for undergraduates.SCHOOL-BASED OPTIONS FOR ALL UNDERGRADUATESIn the Weinberg College of Arts and SciencesAll majors and minors in Weinberg College are open to students from Northwestern’s other undergraduate schools.

Applicants should be able to qualify for advanced place-ment in chemistry and mathematics. Each year a small number of students are admitted to the program and to Weinberg College, the School of Communication, or the McCormick School. Only candidates applying directly from high school are considered. For information on applying, see Special Admission Programs on page 11.The first three or four years of the program are spent in undergraduate study, during which students must complete coursework that meets HPME requirements—including chemistry, physics, and biological sciences courses and labs—as well as courses that meet their school’s HPME require-ments. Special Undergraduate Registration Requirement provisions apply to HPME students; see page 17 in the Undergraduate Education chapter. To remain in the pro-gram, students must maintain designated grade point aver-ages both in required science courses and overall.  In addition to the required science courses, HPME students enrolled in Weinberg College fulfill the college’s general education requirements by taking courses in four areas of inquiry: social and behavioral sciences, historical studies, ethics and values, and literature and fine arts. They complete at least one first-year seminar as well as other Weinberg College requirements. The third year is usually devoted to completing the requirements for a BA in Wein-berg College by doing advanced coursework in the major and/or to studying abroad in a Northwestern-affiliated program. Students may also take an additional undergrad-uate year at Northwestern.Students in the McCormick School spend three or four years pursuing an in-depth education in mathemat-ics, the sciences, and engineering while taking core courses in biomedical engineering. To supplement their technical courses, students also take courses in the humanities and the social sciences.Students in the School of Communication’s Depart-ment of Communication Sciences and Disorders supple-ment their HPME science requirements with courses in the social sciences, humanities, and the arts. At the same time, as majors in human communication sciences, they study the basic science principles underlying human com-munication and cognition, as well as hearing, speech, lan-guage, and learning disorders. Through exposure to both research and clinical activities, they consider the relation-ship between basic science and real-life health issues. After the first three or four years, HPME students who meet the program requirements move to the Chicago campus as members of the first-year Feinberg School of Medicine class. After successfully completing their first year at the Feinberg School, Weinberg College students who have not received a BA degree qualify for a bachelor of science in medicine, and School of Communication students qualify for a bachelor of science in communica-tion. McCormick School students either fully complete BS requirements in biomedical engineering during the under-graduate phase of their studies or qualify for the BS in biomedical engineering after successfully completing the second year at the Feinberg School.At the end of seven or eight years, HPME students qualify for the doctor of medicine degree from the Fein-berg School.Northwestern Undergraduate Premedical Scholars Programfeinberg.northwestern.edu/admissions/nupspThe Northwestern Undergraduate Premedical Scholars Program is an early-acceptance medical school program for high-achieving students with sophomore standing who have a demonstrated commitment to a career in medicine. Each year a few highly select third-year undergraduates gain admission to the program.NUPSP is for students who have committed to the Feinberg School of Medicine as their program of choice and requires a binding decision on the part of both the applicant and the medical school. Students are accepted during their third undergraduate year for matricula-tion into the Feinberg School after their senior or fourth undergraduate year. The program is not designed to be a fast track to medical school. Transfer students may apply if they meet the listed requirements and coursework was completed at a similarly rigorous program. Cross-School Options • Kellogg Certificate Program for Undergraduates • Additional Options 31KELLOGG CERTIFICATE PROGRAM  FOR UNDERGRADUATESkellogg.northwestern.edu/certificateThe Kellogg School of Management administers a  program leading to an undergraduate certificate in either financial economics or managerial analytics.

They make their own arrangements for room and board and participate in campus activities of their choice, including the opportu-nity for University-sponsored overseas study. There are no prescribed academic majors for NROTC students, though scientific and technical studies are encouraged. NROTC students are required to complete the naval science cur-riculum, attend a weekly two-hour laboratory, and partici-pate in four to six weeks of active-duty summer training at sea or ashore. NROTC students are required to abide by the Midshipmen Regulations issued by the unit. Students may enroll in the NROTC program at any time from the beginning of their first year of enrollment until the end of their sophomore year.CoursesIn addition to the required courses listed below, partici-pants in the NROTC program must satisfactorily com plete a number of other courses prescribed by the Department of the Navy, which are offered by other departments of the University. Current information on those course require-ments is available from the NROTC unit.With the exception of 110 and 355, Northwestern course credit is granted for successful completion of naval science courses; applicability to graduation requirements is subject to limitations imposed by the responsible Uni  ver-sity faculty committees and by the undergraduate schools. For more information on credit availability, consult the dean of each school. Naval science courses are open to non-NROTC students with department approval. Courses with an asterisk (*) are not required for Marine Corps option students.NAV -0 The Art of Nonfiction  See Writing Arts.EN"

Weinberg College offers a liberal arts education that combines broad exposure to the insights and methods of multiple academic disciplines with focused study in one or more areas. The 600-member college faculty is dedicated to superior teaching informed by advanced research. Nearly all members of the faculty, including the most senior, regularly teach undergraduates in a curriculum that includes more than 2,200 courses each year, as well as tutorials, supervised laboratory experiences, internships, and other individualized forms of instruction. The 4,200 undergraduates and 1,400 graduate students in arts and sciences enjoy a great deal of choice, with access to departments and programs offering 42 majors, 6 adjunct majors, and more than 50 minors. Among these are sev-eral majors and minors that are interdisciplinary within the College and a growing number that represent curricu-lar collaboration across schools.A liberal arts education in Weinberg College empha-sizes the ability to reason clearly, to extract the essential significance of large bodies of information, to apply  general principles in new contexts, to communicate effec-tively, and to be sensitive to human creativity and diversity. Required coursework provides an overview of the com-plexity of the world and different ways of apprehending and solving problems. Students examine how scholars from many backgrounds confront fundamental issues and how social conditions shape their inquiries. Proficiency in writing and competence in a foreign language build com-munication skills and expand the capability to study and understand another culture, while intensive coursework  in a required major and optional minor develops an under-standing of advanced concepts and lays the groundwork  for original research. Many areas of the curriculum encourage interdisciplinary study that integrates the approaches of different fields and enhances the ability to address questions that cross traditional academic bound-aries. A period of study abroad is encouraged in order to develop firsthand knowledge of other cultures and greater intellectual and personal independence. Students are also encouraged to undertake independent research projects that help them move beyond coursework and synthesize what they learn in their majors.Weinberg College promotes participatory learning that begins in the first year of study in required first-year seminars and continues in laboratory experiences, intern-ships, professional linkage and senior seminars, and other small-group or individualized instruction. Students can experience the excitement of discovery in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences not only through lectures by faculty working at the forefront of their fields but also through special projects developed under faculty guidance or by assisting faculty in their research. Northwestern’s strong undergraduate preprofessional schools and its  graduate and professional schools offer liberal arts students enhanced opportunities to extend their interdisciplinary  studies and to pursue applied work in several areas. In some cases this may lead to a minor, a concentration,  or a certificate. (See Cross-School Options chapter.) The University’s outstanding libraries and its research  centers further support and enrich the educational pursuits of liberal arts undergraduates.ACADEMIC POLICIESRequirements for the Degree of Bachelor of ArtsWeinberg College offers courses of study in the arts and sciences leading to the degree of bachelor of arts. Students have extensive flexibility in structuring their academic pro-grams within a framework of general education and major requirements specified in the following sections. Guidance in planning a coherent curriculum is available from several sources; see Academic Advising on page 41. Students earning the bachelor of arts degree must  complete 45 units of credit and fulfill the course and grade requirements described below. These include completing 2 first-year seminars, demonstrating profi c iency in writing and in a foreign language, satisfying distribution requirements in six major areas of intellectual inquiry, and completing the requirements of a major in one of the departments or programs of Weinberg College. They must also complete a specified amount of their coursework within Weinberg College.First-Year Seminar Requirement First-year students must complete two seminars. Offered by nearly all departments and programs in Weinberg Col-lege, these are small, discussion-oriented courses designed to develop basic intellectual skills: how to read critically, think logically, and communicate effectively, typically through the investigation of a specific theme or issue. First-year seminars are limited to 15 or 16 students to Judd A. and Marjorie WeinbergCollege of Arts and Sciencesweinberg.northwestern.edu Arts and Sciences • Academic Policies  37encourage discussion, and each seminar requires con sid-erable expository writing—usually a minimum of 15–20 typed pages. These seminars ordinarily supple ment rather than replace standard introductory courses and usually do not provide the preparation necessary for advanced work in a field. P/N registration is not allowed in first-year seminars.Except for students in HPME, ISP, and MMSS, who may take their seminars in winter and spring, incoming first-year students are assigned to a fall seminar based on preferences they submit to the Weinberg Office of Under-graduate Studies and Advising during the summer. The first-year seminar instructor also serves as the students’ academic adviser for that quarter. Also during the summer, first-year students are informed of the quarter in which they are to take their second seminar. First-year students also have the opportunity through the Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program to take small seminars linked to larger lecture courses focusing on a common broad theme.Writing Proficiency Requirement Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in writ-ing. This may be achieved in a number of ways. First-year seminar instructors make the initial evaluation of writing in their courses. Students who do not write sufficiently well in their first-year seminars or in other courses may be asked to take EN-0 Immunobiology  Nature of host resistance; characteristics of antigens, antibodies; basis of immune response; hypersensitivity.

GLISH 105," Expository Writing. Courses in expository writing and intermediate composition are available for all students who wish to increase their skill and confidence in writing.Foreign Language Requirement Before graduation students must demonstrate proficiency in a classical or modern foreign language equivalent to the work covered in a second-year college-level course. Lan  -guage proficiency may be shown in any of these ways:• Achieving a designated score on a College Board Advanced Placement Examination• Passing a placement examination given online during the summer and/or at Northwestern during Wildcat Wel-come before fall classes start and periodically during the school year (language departments may limit the number of times a placement examination may be taken)• Providing other evidence of proficiency, such as docu-mentation that secondary schooling was completed in a language other than English• Successfully completing designated Northwestern coursework (these courses may not be taken under the pass/no credit option, and a grade of C– or higher must be earned in the last course in a sequence fulfilling the foreign language requirement)Students who believe they are proficient in a language  not regularly taught at Northwestern may petition to take a placement examination in that language. Petitions are available in the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising and must be submitted prior to or during a stu-dent’s first quarter. Students with professionally diagnosed disabilities related to foreign language acquisition should contact AccessibleNU about possible accommodations.Distribution RequirementsTo ensure breadth of education, Weinberg College stu -dents must take 2 courses in each of the six distribution areas listed below. The lists of courses that satisfy the  distribution requirements are established by a Weinberg College committee. Current lists are available on the  college website, and eligible courses for each quarter are identified on the registrar’s website. • I. Natural sciences Courses introduce methods of inquiry and fundamental concepts in the natural sciences.• II. Formal studies Courses introduce concepts, methods, and use of formal rules of inference in mathematics, statistics, computer science, logic, linguistics, and other areas by showing how objects of thought and experience and their rela-tionships can be analyzed in formal terms.• III. Social and behavioral sciences Courses introduce the theories, methods, and findings of empirical research on human behavior and its relation to social, cultural, economic, and political influences, groups, and institutions.• IV. Historical studies Courses introduce the chronological development of cultural, social, political, and economic affairs and their historical relationships.• V. Ethics and values Courses introduce the analysis of moral, social, and religious values and how they have developed.• VI. Literature and fine arts Courses foster understanding of how the attitudes,  ideas, and values of individuals, groups, societies, or  cultures are represented in their literature, arts, and other creative activities.Courses taken P/N cannot count toward the distribu-tion requirements. Students may satisfy a maximum of 2  of their 12 distribution requirements by achieving suffi-cient scores on College Board Advanced Placement or higher-level International Baccalaureate examinations.  A list of qualifying scores and tests as well as detailed information concerning the distribution requirements are available from the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising and on the college website. Major Study Requirement All students must fulfill the requirements of a major, which should be declared by the end of sophomore year. Majors are declared by meeting with a designated department or program adviser to discuss opportunities and requirements, 38 Arts and Sciences • Academic Policiesdevelop a course plan, and complete a Declaration of Major Form. All courses counted toward a major must be passed with grades of C– or higher. Grades of P (pass) are not acceptable in major and related courses. (See also Grade Requirements.)Students may pursue two or more majors by complet-ing each department’s major requirements. With limited  exceptions, the same course may not be applied to the major requirements of two departments. However, a course used as a department or program course in one major may also fulfill a related course requirement for another major.A student’s total number of majors plus minors may not typically exceed three. Exceptions require permission from the Weinberg College Advising Office and cannot be granted during the first year. Transfer students normally must complete at least four 300-level courses at Northwestern in the major depart-ment or program. A student may elect a major from among the following options:• Departmental major Each Weinberg College department offers one or more majors. Requirements are described in detail in the respective department sections of this catalog.• Area or interdisciplinary major The college offers many interdisciplinary majors that apply the approaches of several departments to certain scientific, cultural, and political areas. Most are open to all students. American studies, integrated science, legal studies, and mathematical methods in the social sciences are limited-admission majors that require a special appli-cation, as does the English department’s creative writing major. African studies, geography, global health studies, inter national studies, mathematical methods in the social sciences, and science in human culture are available only as adjunct majors and must be completed with a second major that is not an adjunct major. Requirements for area and interdisciplinary majors are described in detail in their respective sections of this catalog.• Ad hoc major Occasionally students with well-defined interests are led to programs of study that do not fit neatly into the mold of a traditional major. They may develop an ad hoc major in astrobiology or medical ethics, for example, by bringing together courses from various departments. Ad hoc majors must be approved by the faculty’s Curricular Review Committee. For more information contact the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising.Registration Requirements: Number of Courses  and Quarters All Weinberg College students, except those in the Inte-grated Science Program, the Honors Program in Medical Education, and the dual bachelor’s degree programs (BA/BMus and BA/BS), must successfully complete coursework earning at least 45 units of credit in order to graduate. Students must be degree candidates in Weinberg College during the last three quarters before receiving the BA degree. They may take courses in any other Northwestern school, but a limited amount of such coursework may  count toward the degree. For details see the section  Taking Courses in Other Schools of the University.In addition to and independent of the requirements  set by Weinberg College, all students must satisfy the University’s Under   graduate Registration Requirement  (see Under grad uate Education chapter of this catalog). This requirement addresses the number of quarters for which a student must be registered at Northwestern  and the minimum number of units of credit that must  be completed at the University.Grade RequirementsStudents must achieve an overall grade point average of C (2.0) or higher in courses used to meet degree require-ments. They must earn at least a C– in all major courses and all minor courses, including all related courses for a major. If a major or minor has prerequisites, students must earn at least a C– in these courses as well. To complete the foreign language proficiency requirement through North-western coursework, students must earn at least a C– in the third quarter of the second-year language sequence. Full-time students in Weinberg College are permitted to enroll in a limited number of courses with the under-standing that in place of a regular letter grade they will receive the notation P (pass) or N (no credit), neither of which counts in the grade point average. No more than 1 course a quarter and 6 courses in all may be taken under this P/N option. Courses used to satisfy first-year seminar, distribution, foreign language, major, or minor require-ments may not be taken P/N. No more than one-fifth of the total courses taken at North western and offered for graduation may have grades of P or D.While some other undergraduate schools of the  Uni versity offer a Target Grade–P/N registration option, such registration is not available for courses offered by Weinberg College. Special rules govern registrations by  Weinberg College students in courses of the under grad-uate schools where this plan is available as well as by non–Weinberg College students who transfer into the college. Questions concerning this policy should be addressed to the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising.Taking Courses in Other Schools of the University Weinberg students may take advantage of Northwestern’s other schools to take as many as 11 of their required 45 units; of those 11, up to 3 may be instruction in applied music. Students must obtain the advance approval of the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising to register for courses in the School of Professional Studies. Approved  Arts and Sciences • Academic Options  39SPS courses in Weinberg disciplines do not count toward the 11-unit limit.No more than 4 of the required 45 units of credit may come from the military studies programs. Taking Courses at Other InstitutionsStudents must secure prior approval from the Weinberg College Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising before taking courses at other US institutions that they will submit for Northwestern credit. University, college, and department and program rules govern how many courses taken at other institutions a student may count toward requirements, where they may be taken, in which areas of study they may be, and which requirements they may fulfill. Infor mation about credit from other institu-tions is available from the Office of the Registrar. Courses taken at other institutions but not accepted for credit by Northwestern cannot count toward a Weinberg College degree.Many Weinberg College students spend time studying abroad, most often for a summer or for part or all of junior year. The University’s Study Abroad Office is an essential source of information about programs around the world as well as about the rules and process for going abroad. Advisers in the Study Abroad Office, the college’s Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising, and the departments and programs can help students select programs that fit their academic needs. Awards and HonorsEach year Weinberg College awards several prizes and honors to exceptional students. Recognition is given for outstanding writing in first-year seminars and outstanding academic achievement in certain areas of study. Each quar-ter the college’s Dean’s List honors students with suffi-ciently high grades. Each spring the Northwestern chapter of the liberal arts honorary society Phi Beta Kappa elects juniors and seniors to membership. Seniors whose grade point averages meet certain criteria graduate with college honors. In addition, many departments and programs rec-ognize outstanding achievement by their students. This includes recommending students for graduation with department or program honors (see Honors in the Major below).The college also awards funds to students working on research projects and creative activities; see Research Funding on page 41 for information. ACADEMIC OPTIONSMinorsStudents may choose from more than 50 minors offered at Northwestern; among these are Weinberg College minors, inter school minors, and minors offered by some of North-western’s other under  graduate schools (see Cross-School Options chapter). Minor requirements are listed under  the appropriate headings in this catalog.Completion of a minor is optional, not a degree require   ment. A student’s total number of majors plus minors may not typically exceed three. Exceptions require permission from the Weinberg College Advising Office and cannot be granted during the first year. Students may not count any course toward both a minor and a major unless the catalog description of the minor explicitly permits this or the course fulfills a related course requirement for the major. A course may not count toward more than one minor. All courses counted toward  a minor, including prerequisites for the minor, must be completed with a grade of at least C–.Independent Study and Undergraduate SeminarsRegistering for 399 Independent Study allows students  to earn course credit by working on a research or creative project under the supervision of a faculty member. 399 is generally open to juniors and seniors, and depart ment consent is required; in some cases sophomores may qualify. During the quarter before enrolling in 399, students must submit for departmental approval a detailed description of the work they will undertake and the basis for its evalua-tion. Upon completion of the course, they must submit an abstract of the completed work to the department, where the description and the abstract are filed. By departmental invitation seniors may take 398 (a senior-year seminar) in one or more quarters, up to a maximum of 4 units.Students may not register for more than 2 units of 399 in a quarter or take 399 to make up for credit they lack as a result of failure or uncompleted courses. No more than 9 units of 398 and 399 may be presented as credit for gradu-ation. Certain independent study courses offered by some departments with course numbers different from 398 and 399 are also subject to these restrictions.Honors in the MajorEach major in Weinberg College offers a program that may lead to the award of honors in the major to graduating seniors with outstanding records of achievement. Criteria vary by major, but all share certain features. Students recommended for honors in the major must • Complete with distinction the regular courses required for the major and at least two quarters of 398 or 399 or their equivalent, or 400-level courses, or some combina-tion thereof. (These courses may count toward major requirements in some departments and programs.) Majors set different GPA criteria.• Complete a research project or other type of integrative work under the guidance of a faculty adviser. The project must result in a research report, thesis, or other tangible record; coursework by itself is not sufficient. Simple data collection, computer programming, analysis of data with 40 Arts and Sciences • Academic Optionscanned programs, and summaries of primary or second-ary sources are not by themselves bases for the award of honors in the major.Each major has an undergraduate honors committee responsible for administering its honors program and for preparing the final recommendations for honors submitted in May to the Weinberg College Committee on Under-graduate Academic Excellence. The faculty adviser pro-poses a student for honors and writes a letter describing and evaluating the student’s project. A faculty member  typically unconnected with the project must submit another letter giving independent and substantive judg-ments. The departmental honors committee reviews nominations during spring quarter and takes a separate recorded vote on each candidate. Approved nominations are reviewed by the Committee on Undergraduate  Academic Excellence, which makes the final decision. Information on procedures for students pursuing  separate honors in two departments or programs, or inter-disciplinary honors spanning two majors, is available from the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising and at weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/honors -awards/departmental-honors.html.Professional Linkage SeminarsUndergraduates may take specially designed linkage seminars that approach social and work-related concerns through the eyes of an accomplished nonacademic pro-fessional with an affinity for the liberal arts and a gift for intellectual inquiry. These seminars link liberal education to professional issues, illustrating how theory and practice affect and enrich one another and thus focusing on the transition from the academic to the nonacademic world. Preprofessional Study Weinberg College offers excellent preparation for subse-quent training in professions such as law, medicine, and management. Each year many graduates pursue profes-sional study in these areas. Other students enter the work-force directly.All majors can furnish suitable preparation for profes-sional schools, provided appropriate courses are taken. No major, however, is intended solely as preprofessional train-ing. The college advisers in the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising help students design academic pro-grams that combine the breadth of a liberal arts education with adequate preparation for further professional study. Northwestern Career Advancement is another resource; several career counselors specialize in helping Weinberg students identify career goals and paths toward achieving them.InternshipsMany students seek to enrich their education with prac -tical experiences gained off campus. Chicago Field Studies administers several programs that combine seminars taught on campus with internships typically at Chicago-area organizations. Other Weinberg College departments and programs also offer opportunities for off-campus work. These are described in their sections of this catalog. No more than 6 units of credit earned through internship-linked coursework may count toward a Weinberg degree. See the college website for a list of options counting toward this limit.Study AbroadWeinberg College students are encouraged to study abroad. The philosophy of the college is that the best foreign study experience combines continued work in a student’s chosen course of study with significant oppor-tunities for immersion in the culture of the host country. For example, a political science student might study the European Union in France. The college encourages par-ticipation in full-academic–year programs that include extensive study of languages and culture. The Office of the Provost offers grants for intensive summer foreign language study abroad. As early as the first year, inter-ested students should discuss study abroad plans with their advisers and obtain information from the Study Abroad Office (northwestern.edu/studyabroad).Cross-School OptionsDual Bachelor’s Degree Programs  (BA/BS and BA/BMus)Two programs allow undergraduates to combine a bach-elor’s degree in the liberal arts with a bachelor’s degree in another Northwestern undergraduate school. One results in a BA from Weinberg College and a BS from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the other results in a BA from Weinberg College and a BMus from the Bienen School of Music. Both options typically require five years of study. For more information see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. Honors Program in Medical EducationThe Honors Program in Medical Education is designed for unusually well-prepared high school students who seek a career in medicine or medical science. It provides a plan whereby students entering Northwestern are admit-ted simultaneously to Weinberg College, the McCormick School, or the School of Communication and to the Fein-berg School of Medicine. HPME students then spend the first three or four years in undergraduate study and the last four years in the Feinberg School, potentially reducing the period of formal training by one year. For more informa-tion see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog.Accelerated Master’s Programs Undergraduate students doing outstanding work may be accepted into one of the accelerated master’s programs  Arts and Sciences • Student Resources • First-Year Seminars 41approved by the Graduate School. These students may receive permission to double-count some courses toward both bachelor’s and master’s degrees. The approved BA/MA and BA/MS departmental pro-grams in chemistry, comparative literary studies, econom-ics, French, and linguistics share the goal of selecting and training exceptional students. Students are not self-selected but are recommended by the department to the Graduate School for admission. No particular grade point average in undergraduate courses, however high, automatically entitles a student to participate in an accelerated master’s program. Students are officially admitted only after their credentials have been thoroughly reviewed and approved by the senior associate dean of the Graduate School. See the individual department sections of this catalog for more information on accelerated master’s programs. Further details and policies are available from advisers  in the relevant departments and on the Graduate  School’s website at tgs.northwestern.edu/academics /programs/dual-degrees/bachelors-masters.html.Teaching Certification Students enrolled in a number of departments of Weinberg College may simultaneously pursue secondary teaching certification through the School of Education and Social Policy. Students may earn science certification with a biol-ogy, chemistry, or physics designation; social science cer-tification with an economics, history, political science, or sociology designation; or certification in English, French, German, Latin, mathematics, or Spanish.Majors in the certification areas who wish to be con-sidered for teaching certification must apply, be admitted to, and complete all requirements of the Secondary Teach-ing Program as described in the School of Education and Social Policy chapter of this catalog. Applications should be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs in the School of Education and Social Policy.Other Cross-School Options Weinberg College students participate in many academic opportunities outside of the college, sometimes taking individual courses of interest and sometimes completing a formal program of study. Many possibilities are included in the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. Certi ficates open to Weinberg undergraduates are offered through the School of Education and Social Policy, the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Kellogg School of Management, and the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communica-tions. Minors in several of Northwestern’s undergraduate schools, as well as other options in music, are also open to Weinberg College students. For more infor mation see the relevant school chapter of this catalog. Interested students should also contact the schools through which the options are offered.STUDENT RESOURCESAcademic AdvisingWeinberg College provides an integrated academic advis-ing structure centered in the college’s Office of Under-graduate Studies and Advising, where faculty advisers are available throughout the year to assist students in all aspects of academic and career planning. Each first-year student is assigned an adviser who in nearly all cases is the student’s instructor in a fall-quarter first-year seminar. At the end of fall quarter each student is assigned a Weinberg College adviser, who will continue to be that student’s adviser through graduation. In addition, each Weinberg department and program has a corps of faculty advisers who counsel all undergraduates about course selections, majors and minors, and research and career opportunities.Research Funding Weinberg College is committed to facilitating student research and to helping undergraduates immerse them-selves in challenging, intense explorations through well-focused projects. The college, as well as some of its departments and programs, awards competitive grants to support research and creative projects of students working under faculty guidance. Academic–year awards cover some research expenses, and some summer awards also provide assistance with living expenses. Conference travel grants help fund travel to professional conferences to present research or creative work.The University’s Undergraduate Research Grant Pro-gram is another source of research funding for qualified students. See page 25 for information.Student OrganizationsMany departments and programs within the college spon-sor student organizations. Some are honorary organiza-tions, recognizing students who have achieved distinction within their fields of study. Others provide opportunities for students with common interests to come together for academic, social, career-focused, and service activities that complement classroom experiences.The Weinberg College Student Advisory Board is the primary source of student advice to the dean and the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs. Mem-bers also serve on several college committees. The board includes representatives from every Weinberg College department and program offering a major or a minor.ACADEMIC OFFERINGSFIRST-YEAR SEMINARSFirst-year seminars, offered by nearly all departments  and programs in Weinberg College, are small, discussion- oriented classes designed to develop students’ basic intel-lectual skills: reading critically, thinking logically, and 42 Arts and Sciences • General Liberal Arts • African American Studiescommunicating effectively. Expository writing is an  important activity in each seminar.Most Weinberg College students are required to complete two first-year seminars.

Writing courses are limited to 15 students, allowing instructors to comment exten sively on students’ writing and to meet regularly with students in individual confer-ences. Courses at every level emphasize revision, with the goal of strengthening each student’s ability to think clearly, analyze carefully, argue convincingly, and communicate effectively. The Cook Family Writing Program also operates the Writing Place, a center that provides free composition tutoring and consulting for all Northwestern students. The Writing Place, located in University Library, is open most mornings, afternoons, and evenings during the academic year. Students may make appointments, use the schedule of drop-in hours, or interact with Writing Place tutors through the campus computer network.In addition, the program helps to oversee writing requirements—and thus provides writing advising—for undergraduates in Weinberg College, the McCormick School, and the Bienen School. Members of the program faculty teach specialized courses and workshops, as needed. The program has collaborated extensively with other Uni-versity programs and departments, developing new ways to integrate writing instruction with instruction in other disciplines. For example, faculty from the program and the McCormick School team-teach Design Thinking and Communication (a combination of EN-0 Expository Writing  See English.EN or 205• "

Upon successful completion of the program, registration is replaced with credits trans-ferred from the affiliated institution.AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIESafam.northwestern.eduThe study of black lives, cultures, and experiences has a long and distinguished history in the United States and abroad. Inter disciplinary from its beginnings, the field has developed exciting insights and firm intellectual and empirical foundations to systematically study the social, political, cultural, and economic dimensions of race both domestically and internationally. With these strengths and traditions, the Department of African American Studies provides opportunities to explore the richness and diversity of black life in a meaningful and coherent way.The department offers courses that focus on people of African descent in the United States and other regions of the Americas and the African diaspora—the communi-ties created by the dispersion of peoples from the African continent. By comparing the black experience in various parts of the world, students learn to analyze identity, race, and racism as formations that change over time and space. This broad study of the black experience is one of the key features that distinguish the department from similar departments at other institutions. Major themes in the cur-riculum include the nature of colon ization and its impact on the colonizer and the colonized; racism and its effects on society as well as on scholarship; the importance of oral language, history, and tradition in the black experience; the roots and devel opment of black music, literature, and reli-gious styles; analysis of key social, political, and economic institutions such as families, churches, and labor markets; and the traffic of people, ideas, and artifacts throughout the African diaspora.African American studies provides excellent prepara-tion for graduate work in the social sciences, the humani-ties, and the professions, as well as for jobs and careers in a variety of fields. Education, law, journalism, urban planning, healthcare delivery and administration, business, social work, and politics are only a few of the fields for which African American studies provides an excellent back-ground. In addition, as scholars and political leaders pay increased attention to global economic, political, and social phenomena, African American studies touches on issues of far-reaching national and international significance.Major in African American StudiesDepartment courses (12 units)• 5 core courses chosen from 210; 211; 212-1,2; 213; 214; 215; 236; 245 Arts and Sciences • African American Studies  43• 6 elective courses in the department, including at least 4 at the 300 level• 1 senior course: 390, 396, or 399Related courses (5 units)• At least 3 must be at the 300 level, and the other 2 can be 200- or 300-level courses.• Courses must be approved by the department adviser.• See page 45 for approved related courses or consult the director of undergraduate studies for other courses to satisfy this requirement.Minor in African American Studies The minor in African American studies provides thorough exposure to contemporary scholarship concerning the black experience.

To qualify for honors, a student must complete a substantial senior-year research project. With the director, the student selects a thesis adviser, who need not be a member of the department. Completion of the thesis ordinarily requires at least two quarters of research and writing. During one or both of those quarters students may register for 399, an indepen-dent study with the thesis adviser. This course counts as either 1 of the 6 required “elective courses” in the major or as the senior-course requirement.Students whose theses and grades meet department  criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors.

ANTHROPOLOGY anthropology.northwestern.edu Anthropology is the study of humankind from a broadly comparative and historical perspective that aims to advance understanding of human biological and cultural diversity around the world and across time. In a changing world, anthropology provides for cross-cultural comparative analysis of diversities and inequalities. Understanding cul-tural, biological, and linguistic differences and similarities is central to almost any career, and students gain a critical understanding of ethical issues at play in a diverse, global-ized world. Anthropology draws on the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences to answer compelling questions about humankind, including how the species evolved, how biol-ogy, language, and culture became its defining characteris-tics, and how and why cultures change over time.Anthropology’s breadth makes the major ideal for stu-dents seeking a strong liberal arts and sciences education. Students are prepared for careers not only in anthropol-ogy and archaeology but also in a range of fields including medicine, public health, law, journalism, marketing, inter-national development, and business.The department’s faculty bring together the four sub-fields of anthropology (archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology) to develop a holistic understanding of human diversity. Students are encouraged to participate in a variety of departmental field and laboratory research projects in archaeology, ethnography, and human biology that offer the opportunity to conduct original research, which can be an integral part of a senior thesis project.48 Arts and Sciences • Anthropology Major Concentrations in AnthropologyMajor in AnthropologyStudents complete a 13-course program (12 courses in anthropology and 1 in formal studies) for a major in anthropology. At the 200 level, courses provide back-ground in the four major subfields of anthropology. At the 300 level, students expand both the breadth and depth of their studies, examining the philosophical and historical roots of the discipline. A research class (322, 361, 386, or 389) provides an opportunity to learn research skills and gain valuable analytical, critical thinking, and writing skills. Six additional 300-level courses include concentration courses from a subfield and from across the department.Department courses (12 units)• 4 core courses: 211, 213, 214, 215• 370• 1 research course: 322, 361, 386, or 389• 3 300-level courses selected from a subfield ◦  Archaeology: 318, 319, 321, 324, 325, 327, 328, 343, 381, 382, 383, 384, 390, 391, 396, 398 ◦ Biological anthropology: 306, 308, 309, 310, 312, 313, 314, 316, 317, 362, 390, 398 ◦ Cultural anthropology: 310, 311, 315, 320, 330, 332, 334, 339, 340, 341, 347, 350, 354, 355, 368, 369, 372, 373, 374, 376, 377, 378, 390, 395, 398 ◦Human biology: See Concentration in Human Biology for requirements. ◦ Linguistic anthropology: 360, 365, 378, 390, 398• 3 additional 300-level courses selected from any concen-tration or research course Related course (1 unit)• 1 formal studies course ◦For the biological anthropology and human biology concentrations, the formal studies course must be ful-filled by -0 Independent Study  Reading and confer-ences on special subjects.

ASTRONOMYSee Physics and Astronomy.BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES biosci.northwestern.edu The science of biology constitutes the study of organisms at all levels of complexity and in all their diversity. The Program in Biological Sciences provides a broad, modern curriculum in the life sciences leading to a bachelor of arts degree. To majors it offers focused concentrations and the potential to do laboratory research projects. The goal of a baccalaureate degree program in bio-logical sciences at a research university is to develop  and enhance the intellectual and creative potential of life sciences students. To this end, the program includes the following:• A foundation in mathematics, chemistry, and physics• A core curriculum introducing fundamental areas of  biological science• Concentrations that subsequently focus students’ interests• Opportunities to participate in researchMajors must complete the courses listed as related courses below. First-year students usually complete 100-level chemistry and the calculus and statistics require-ments; in spring quarter they take BIOL -0 Independent Study  Individual tutorials or research projects. Prerequisite: consent of instructor.GEOGRAPHYgeography.northwestern.edu The Program in Geography offers three types of courses to students who seek a knowledge of the physical earth and its various modes of human occupancy. Introductory courses develop global perspectives on environments that are rele vant to many social and physical science fields. Courses in regional geography present a unique way of understanding how nature and culture have interacted over time to give character to specific places or regions. Advanced courses focus on the concepts and techniques of professional geog raphy, especially on the construction of maps and on the uses of maps in solving geographical problems.Programs of study may lead to an adjunct major or a minor in geography. In addition to the following require-ments, students majoring in geography also must complete a major in a related social or natural science field.Adjunct Major in GeographyProgram courses (6 units)• 211 or 235; 240; 341 or 343 • 3 additional geography courses, including 1 unit of research (399) Arts and Sciences • German   101• All adjunct majors require completion of a stand-alone major also.

ITALIANSee French and Italian.JAPANESESee Asian Languages and Cultures.JEWISH STUDIES jewish-studies.northwestern.edu The Jewish Studies Program focuses not only on Judaism in its narrow sense as a religious phenomenon but also in its broader sense as a culture and civilization. A good case can be made that the roots of Western culture lie in two places: Athens and Jerusalem. The traditional education of the humanist scholar recognized this by requiring not only the mastery of Greek and Latin but also of Hebrew. Thus, the study of Judaism in this program considers the many and varied dimensions of the phenomenon of Jewish civilization. A typical program of study includes, in addi-tion to the religious dimension, the historical, sociological, linguistic, philosophic, and artistic dimensions. The Jewish Studies Program offers a major and two minors: Jewish studies and Hebrew studies. Major in Jewish Studies Prerequisite• Complete or place out of H-0 Independent Study  Readings and confer-ences on special subjects for students pursuing a specific area of interest in legal studies.LINGUISTICS linguistics.northwestern.edu Linguistics is the scientific study of language, its structure and function as a means of communication, its acquisition, and the mental and physiological processes involved in its use. Knowledge of the structure, origins, and functions of language can provide deep insight into human nature and behavior. The major in linguistics prepares students for professional studies in law, medicine, technology, educa-tion, and business, as well as for graduate work in linguis-tics, cognitive science, and related disciplines.Three introductory courses examining the sound  structure of human language, the structure of words and sentences, and the structure of linguistic meaning make up the core of the major and provide the foundation for more advanced work. More specialized courses in linguistics introduce students to the activities of working researchers in various subfields. Linguistics majors are encouraged to participate in  faculty research and to develop independent research.  Students often enhance their linguistics major through interdisciplinary studies in cognitive science, communi-ca tion sciences and disorders, psychology, philosophy, international studies, mathematics, or computer science. Students with a strong record in their major courses and an interest in pursuing linguistics at the graduate level are encouraged to enroll in 400-level courses.Major in LinguisticsDepartment courses (12 units)• 3 introductory courses: 250, 260, 270• 9 courses beyond the 200 level ◦Should include 350, 360, and 370.

The courses explore an inter-disciplinary range of literary, cultural, and personal texts in performance. The department has particular strengths in the study of literature through solo performance; the ensemble adaptation and staging of poetic, narrative, and nonfictional texts; intercultural performance; performance art; cultural studies and the ethnography of performance; and performance theory and criticism. Internships and field study for performance studies majors extend and deepen their classroom work with experiential learning. Extracurricular work provides students with a variety of opportunities to perform, adapt, and direct, enabling their creative work to reach an audience outside the classroom.Performance studies majors have been successful in many professions that require intelligence and imagination as well as critical and creative skills. In addition to pursuing careers in professional theatre and arts development, many graduates teach literature, theatre, humanities, and perfor-mance studies. Majors have found performance studies an excellent preparation for law school and complementary to their interests in creative writing, communication, new media, anthropology, dance, literature, or social work. Per-formance studies can be thought of as a major that bridges artistic expression and conceptual analysis, theory and practice. Performance, in its manifold forms, is the subject and the method of study.Honors in Performance StudiesPerformance studies majors may apply in their junior year to participate in the departmental honors program. The program is intended to provide highly qualified students with an opportunity to complete a substantial research investigation; to introduce students to graduate-level, faculty-mentored research; and to provide formal honorary recognition to students who have excelled in coursework and in independent research. More information is available from the department office.Major in Performance StudiesProgram requirements (12 units)• 2 introductory courses: 200; 103 or 203• A minimum of 2 other 200-level courses in the depart-ment, chosen from 210-1,2,3, 216, 220, and 224• Production courses: 2 quarters of 119; or 1 quarter of 119 and 1 quarter of TH-0 Independent Study  Prerequisite: consent of undergraduate dean after submission of petition.RADIO/TELEVISION/FILMcommunication.northwestern.edu/departments/rtfThe Department of Radio/Television/Film offers educa-tion in the history, theory, and production of media. Broad-based and interdisciplinary in orientation, the department offers a range of perspectives on media forms from cinema to broadcast and cable television to alterna tive media to emerging technologies. Courses emphasize that media are social and cultural practices in dialogue with the broader context of the humanities. The department is dedicated to integrating theory and practice, creating intersections with other disciplines, and fostering cutting-edge media produc-tion. Originality, critical analysis, and vision are valued in both scholarly research and creative work. The department’s  goal is to educate students and citizens to critically inter-pret contemporary media, envision alter native structures in theory and practice, and reinvent the media of the future.Production facilities include 16mm film and HD equip-ment, sound stage, and editing; field video and multiple-camera television studio facilities; linear and non linear video editing; advanced audio postproduction; and state-of-the-art computer graphics. Students operate the 7,200-watt FM radio station WNUR, which serves the Chicago  Communication • Radio/Television/Film  185area and also broadcasts on the Internet. The School of Communication funds four active student-run cocurricular production groups and offers juniors and seniors numerous opportunities for internships at tele vision and radio sta-tions and production companies in the Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles areas. Frequent guest lectures are offered by alumni with careers in media and by other well-known professionals.Major in Radio/Television/FilmProgram requirements (12 units)• Introductory course: 190 (190 and second-year standing —not through AP credits—are the prerequisites for all 300-level production courses)• 3 200-level courses: 220, 230, and 1 other 200-level course in the department or COMM -0 Independent Study  (.5–1)Pianomusic.northwestern.edu/academics/areas-of-study /piano.htmlThe major in piano performance focuses on private les-sons, studio classes, piano repertoire, piano pedagogy, and accompanying classes.

It is not a “prelaw” program; instead, it examines how legal insti-tutions, actors, and processes fit within a broader social context. In this conception, the law is a social institution that warrants study in its own right and provides an excel-lent lens through which students may critically examine a variety of themes central to other disciplines (such as race 120 Arts and Sciences • Legal Studiesand ethnicity, class, gender, inequality, social change, gov-ernance, politics, and culture).

EATRE 368," (see the School of Communication chapter of this catalog)AFRICAN STUDIESafricanstudies.northwestern.eduMore than six decades after the distinguished scholar Melville J. Herskovits organized the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the program remains a model of Africanist study and research. Through sponsorship of multidisciplinary courses with African content, lan-guage training, and promotion of Africa-based study, it supports and enlivens the undergraduate study of Africa while serving as the Univer sity’s “headquarters” for for-mal and informal interaction among interested students, faculty, and visitors. The program brings undergraduates studying Africa together with faculty and other experts in many areas of inquiry—across disciplinary boundar-ies and regional specializations—for lectures, seminars, workshops, con  ferences, and research programs. North-western’s Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies, an unparalleled resource for Africanist study, attracts  students and scholars from all over the world. Over the years the program has remained in active contact with its counterparts in Africa and elsewhere, while expanding its role in the University and off-campus communities.The program offers both an adjunct major and a minor. Although there is no formal language requirement for either, students are strongly encouraged to study a non-English language that is spoken in Africa or its diaspora,  such as Swahili, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Por tu -    guese, or Spanish. Competence in a foreign language can facilitate individual research projects, widen under-standing of particular topics, and increase study abroad opportunities. Adjunct Major in African Studies The adjunct major is structured to serve two broad aims.First, students are exposed to the geographical and disciplinary breadth of African studies. To that end, all students take 200-level core courses in African history, anthropology, literature, and/or politics, as well as 7 elec-tive courses chosen from an array of disciplines, including African studies, African American studies, anthropology, history, political science, religious studies, and several  language and literature departments.Second, students engage in in-depth research or immer-sion practicums, the products of which they develop in a capstone senior research seminar. Practicums often involve a central research component, but other proposed 46 Arts and Sciences • African Studiespracticums of acceptable quality, depth of immersion, etc., may be approved. Among the experiences that may sat-isfy this requirement with appropriate content are study abroad in Africa, research connected to the Program of African Studies, internships, and independent study and senior capstone projects. Program courses (11 units)• 3 core courses chosen from 276; A-0 African Theatre and Drama  Major practices in African theatre and drama. Topics may include festi-val practices, traveling and popular theatres, Anglophone drama, nationalist dramas, reappropriation of the Western canon, or theatre for development.

AMERICAN STUDIESamstp.northwestern.eduThe American Studies Program is interdisciplinary, com-parative, and internationally oriented. The competitive- admissions major examines the development and expres-sions of national culture alongside those of borderland and diasporic American cultures and amongst global cultures. It draws on a broad range of faculty from the humanities and social sciences so that students can examine compo-nents of US culture and the diverse experiences of Ameri-cans and others affected by Americans locally, nationally, and globally. Students are allowed a wide-ranging yet  disciplined exploration that crosses the boundaries of  traditional academic fields. All students write a thesis explicitly dealing with the United States in a comparative or global dimension. Because this selective honors program has more appli-cants than available space, admission depends in part on academic distinction and on demonstrated interest in com-parative American cultures. First- and second-year students apply for admission to the major early in spring quarter.Study abroad and upper-level language proficiency are strongly encouraged.

ARABICSee Middle East and North African Studies.ART HISTORYarthistory.northwestern.edu Art history studies the world’s arts and architecture from antiquity to the present. It analyzes visual objects from multiple perspectives, including their aesthetic and his-torical contexts, use of technology, relationship to science, ideological or social function, and visual and spatial char-acteristics. It studies individual artists or makers, cultural institutions, audiences, and intercultural exchanges. Because the field is inherently interdisciplinary, it often engages anthropology, philosophy, political science, history, literature, film, performance, theater, and theories of race, gender, class, and sexuality.The study of art history provides knowledge of geo-graphically and historically diverse artworks and related cultural practices. Departmental course offerings explore these works and practices with varying intensity and spe-cialization. The major is an essential platform for those interested in the classic art history careers. (Curatorial work in museums normally requires at least a master’s degree, and college and university teaching and research require a PhD.) With its liberal arts emphasis on informed and critical reading, writing, speaking, and looking, and with its broad historical, cultural, geographic, and method ological range, the major also offers an excellent foundation for specialization in law, medicine, business, international relations, politics, education, and other areas. All majors are required to confer with their adviser or the director of undergraduate studies at the start of the academic year and are encouraged to do so before each registration period. Those wishing to petition to graduate or to transfer credits must see the director of undergradu-ate studies.

Faculty and stu-dents pursue the visual arts as a theoretical discipline that pushes the boundaries of aesthetic and cultural experience. The department offers a range of courses that apply tra-ditional approaches, adopt newer media, or use alternative strategies. The study of art practice in traditional media, such as painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography, is the core of the undergraduate course structure, enabling students to develop a solid foundation in the field’s tradi-tions and established forms. Studio art classes address both  Arts and Sciences • Asian American Studies   55technique and critical thinking about contemporary art; these are complemented by classes in contemporary art theory. Other courses expressly look forward, exposing stu-dents to experimental approaches and a foretaste of future developments in visual art making. This dynamic curricu-lum incorporates digital technology, video, and conceptual art practice, thus blending new trends with traditional practices.Major in Art Theory and PracticeStudents majoring in art theory and practice plan a program of study with and subject to the approval of a department adviser.

Asian American studies deepens understanding of the multiracial history and character of the United States and also provides an opportunity to place the American experience within a larger global context. Northwestern’s Asian American Studies Program aims to provide students with an understanding of Asian 56 Arts and Sciences • Asian American Studies American experience as fundamental to the ongoing devel-opment of American society and linked to the experiences of other racial minorities in the United States and of Asian migrants across the world. The program thus encourages students to develop informed, far-reaching perspectives that facilitate responsible participation in a rapidly chang-ing world. As an interdisciplinary program, Asian Ameri-can studies develops traditional investigative, analytic, and critical skills while also promoting the intellectual and creative powers students need to meet the challenges of the 21st century.Both the major and the minor in Asian American studies offer an opportunity to pursue a coherent study of Asian American communities and the experiences of Asian Amer-icans in the United States. Students pursuing the major or minor engage in the interdisciplinary study of race, eth-nicity, and migration within the modern global historical development of nationalism, imperialism, and colonialism.Major in Asian American Studies Students majoring in Asian American studies must complete 14 courses and an immersion project.Program courses (12 units)• 2 core courses chosen from 210, 214, 216, and 275• 4 introductory electives.

ASIAN LANGUAGES AND CULTURESalc.northwestern.edu The Department of Asian Languages and Cultures focuses on Asian humanities and languages past and present. Its Asian- and English-language courses provide students with opportunities to attain linguistic and transcultural compe-tence in one or more of four language areas and to better appreciate Asia as a dynamic site of international cultural relations.The department offers a major in Asian languages and cultures with five tracks (Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, Korean, and Asian humanities), as well as two minors. The minor in Asian languages focuses on the mastery of an Asian language, and the minor in Asian humanities includes interdisciplinary study of diverse Asian literatures and cultures. When they graduate, majors and Asian languages minors will have proficiency in the four core skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing in an Asian lan-guage. They should be able to understand spoken language in conversations, public speeches, and media; to read lit-erature, newspapers, and magazines; to speak and write in formal and informal language; and to engage with and discuss cultural values and assumptions. In addition to these core skills, students will gain sophisticated understanding of a culture of Asia. Cultural literacy includes knowledge of classical and modern liter-ary texts, films, and other media; ability to analyze and interpret texts orally and in writing; understanding and experience of cultural practices; and ability to conduct independent research in primary and secondary sources.Study abroad is encouraged. Students should consult with their department adviser and the director of under-graduate studies before studying abroad to discuss how courses taken abroad might count.Major in Asian Languages and CulturesMajors complete courses in language, literature, and cul-ture in their chosen concentration. Most students con-centrate in one linguistic and cultural tradition. Students who want to do comparative work or focus on more than one culture, however, may select a concentration in Asian humanities.Prerequisite• 1 first-year language course chosen from 111-3 or 115-3, or equivalent proficiencyDepartment courses (14 units) • 6 language courses ◦3 second-year language courses (121-1,2,3 or 125-1,2,3)  ◦3 third-year language courses (211-1,2,3, 215-1,2,3, or approved substitute) ◦Students may apply for but are not guaranteed credit toward the language requirement for courses taken abroad.

ASIAN STUDIESasian-studies.northwestern.eduThe Asian Studies Program offers individualized, interdis-ciplinary study of the languages, histories, societies, and cultures of the peoples of Asia, past and present. Through the study of a relevant language (Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, or Korean) and coursework in history, the humanities, and the social sciences, students gain a sophis-ticated critical understanding of a specific Asian region (East, South, or Southeast) or country. They also learn to examine the world and themselves through the lens of another language and culture. The program encourages in-depth study while also promoting more general inquiry into fundamental issues, such as cultural difference and its social and political implications and the significance of the transcultural and trans national flow of people and ideas. Asian studies students hone their aptitude for analyz-ing problems, conducting research, and presenting ideas in writing and in speech and thus succeed in a wide range of careers, including law, medicine, business, media, gov-ernment, education, and nonprofit work. Others go on to graduate study. Some graduates work primarily overseas.The program offers a major and a minor. Study of a relevant language is required for the major and encouraged but not required for the minor. Approved courses are listed on the program website.

Students who intend to submit  a senior thesis should send an e-mail message (including the name of the research adviser) to the director of under-graduate studies by fall of senior year. To be eligible for honors, a student must meet minimum GPA requirements, engage in original research during at least two quarters of 399, and write a senior thesis on this research. The 399 credits are not required for and do not count toward the chemistry major. Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information consult the director of undergraduate studies and see Honors in the Major on page 39.The Teaching of ChemistryWeinberg College students pursuing a major in chemis-try who also wish to be certified for secondary teaching must be admitted to the Secondary Teaching Program in the School of Education and Social Policy and complete all requirements as outlined in the SESP chapter of this catalog. Students are urged to contact the Office of Stu-dent Affairs in SESP as early as possible in their academic careers.General Chemistry, Advanced Placement, and Course CreditEntering students may receive advanced placement in chemistry by means of the College Board’s AP Chemis-try examination or the department’s placement examina-tion taken on entry to Northwestern. Depending on their scores, they will be advised to register in 110, 151, or 171 (with credit for 1X0 listed on their transcript); or 210 or 212 (with 1 credit for each 1X0, 1X1, and 1X2, and with 0.34 credit for each 11X and 12X on their transcript). Stu-dents may not start any general chemistry sequence with 131, 152, or 172 regardless of their AP credit. Questions should be directed to the director of undergraduate studies in chemistry.Students may not retain both AP credit and credit for a course at a lower level than placed by the AP score. For example, students who receive 1 test credit listed as 1X0 may take 151 for credit, but they may not retain credit for both. Similar constraints apply to 1X1 and 171; 1X2 and 172; 11X and 181; and 12X and 182. Students may receive credit for only 1 of 131, 151, or 171; only 1 of 132, 152, or 172; only 1 of 141, 161, or 181; and only 1 of 142, 162, or 182. Students whose AP or chemistry placement exam scores place them into organic chemistry but who choose instead to begin with 171/181 must complete the entire general chemistry sequence before taking organic chem-istry. Students who place into organic chemistry may not take 110 or 151/161.The laboratory components of general and organic chemistry courses require separate registration and bear separate credit. When such a course is listed as a prerequisite for another course, the associated lab is also a prerequisite.

Please see Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences for information.Honors in MathematicsMajors with strong academic records in mathematics and an interest in pursuing honors should speak with the direc-tor of undergraduate studies before the end of junior year. To graduate with department honors, students should complete both 320-1,2,3 (or 321-1,2,3) and 330-1,2,3 (or 331-1,2,3). In exceptional cases, students who have not completed these courses may be considered for honors. Students must also complete with distinction 2 quarters of independent study (399) or 2 quarters of a graduate course, as well as an acceptable project that culminates in an honors thesis. The courses may count toward the major requirements. Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information consult the department website and the director of undergraduate studies and see Honors in the Major on page 39.The Teaching of MathematicsWeinberg students majoring in mathematics who wish to be certified for secondary teaching must be admitted to the Secondary Teaching Program in the School of Education and Social Policy and complete the relevant requirements outlined in the SESP chapter of this catalog. They should contact the Office of Student Affairs in SESP as early as possible in their academic careers.Course Recommendations for Entering StudentsStudents enrolled in the McCormick School, ISP, or MMSS should consult their programs to determine the appropriate beginning mathematics course.Students who have not taken any calculus normally enroll in 220. Those concerned about their preparation for 220 should consult the director of calculus about the pos-sibility of starting in 212. Students intending to major in a behavioral science other than economics and those from Medill may take 202 and 211 rather than 220/224/230, especially if they are concerned about their math skills. Those who wish only to fulfill the Area II  distribution requirement and plan no further study of mathematics may also take 100, 104, or 110.Students who have taken calculus in secondary school should determine their beginning math course as follows:• Those who have studied linear algebra or multivariable calculus should consult the director of undergraduate studies.• Those who have a strong interest in mathematics and have excelled in differential and integral calculus but have not studied linear algebra and multi variable calcu-lus should consult the director of MENU about appro-priate placement.• Those who do not have a strong interest in mathematics but have taken courses in differential and integral calcu-lus with grades of B or better should enroll in 230.• Those who have taken a course in differential calculus with a grade of B or better but have not taken a course in integral calculus should enroll in 224.• Those whose calculus grades were below B should con-sult the director of calculus.Substantial portions of the material from 230, 234, 240, 250 are also covered in the sequences 281-1,2,3; 285-1,2,3; 290-1,2,3; 291-1,2,3; and  for any physics or math course in the ISP curriculum. They do not have to choose a physics course concentration.Honors in Physics and AstronomyMajors with strong records in their physics, astronomy, and mathematic courses and an interest in pursuing hon-ors should notify the director of undergraduate studies in October of senior year. Eligible students must enroll for 2 units of 398 by the time of graduation. They participate in research culminating in a written report.Students whose research reports and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information consult  the director of undergraduate studies and see Honors in the Major on page 39.The Teaching of PhysicsWeinberg College students pursuing a major in physics who also wish to be certified for secondary teaching  must be admitted to the Secondary Teaching Program in the School of Education and Social Policy and complete  all requirements as outlined in the SESP chapter of  this catalog. Students are urged to contact the Office  of Student Affairs in SESP as early as possible in their  academic careers.Advanced PlacementFirst-year students who have taken a calculus-level physics course in high school may waive parts of the introductory physics sequence in the following ways:• A score of 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Physics C-Mechanics and/or C-Electricity and Magne-tism examination will give the student credit for 135-1/ 136-1 and/or 135-2/136-2, respectively.• A score of 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Physics 1 and/or Physics 2 exam will give the student credit for 130-1/136-1 and/or 130-2/136-2, respectively.• A passing score on the departmental placement exami-nations, given during Wildcat Welcome, will allow a student to place out of any or all parts of the 130-1,2,3 or 135-1,2,3 sequences plus relevant labs. (No college credit is given for placing out of the courses.)• Students who took college-level physics on the campus of an accredited college while in high school may apply to have the credit transferred to Northwestern. A tran-script from the college is needed. “College-level” classes taken at a high school are not eligible for transfer credit.The laboratory components of first-year physics sequences require separate registration and bear separate credit. When a course in such a sequence is listed as a prerequisite for another course, the associated lab is also a prerequisite. 140 Arts and Sciences • Physics and Astronomy Physics CoursesPH"

CATHOLIC STUDIES See Religious Studies.CHEMISTRYchemistry.northwestern.edu Chemistry is the study of molecular structure, chemical reactions, and the molecular basis of solids, liquids, and gases. Training in chemistry blends descriptive, conceptual, and mathematical elements in both lectures and laboratory work. While developing chemical knowledge is essential, the progressive honing of analytical abilities and applica-tion of this knowledge to research are just as important. Courses are carefully designed to give a rigorous introduc-tion to chemistry for both science and nonscience students. The broad applicability of phenomena and rigorous methodology of chemistry provide a wide range of career options for majors. By offering a foundation in math-ematics, physics, and related sciences; a core curriculum intro ducing the fundamental areas of organic, inorganic, physical, and analytical chemistry; concentrations in six different areas of chemistry; and opportunities to par-ticipate in research, the department meets the needs of students with diverse career objectives, including profes-sional chemistry, graduate training, medicine, and teaching.

Students may also study the reception of classical antiquity in medieval through contemporary Western cultures by taking classical traditions courses offered by other depart-ments. The wide range of choices includes philosophy, 72 Arts and Sciences • Classicsreligion, political theory, art history, film studies, English, and comparative literature.Classics majors may pursue a concentration in Latin, Greek, or both languages. For a classics minor, students may choose a concentration with readings in Latin or in Greek or a classical studies concentration with sources in English translation only. Additional information about classics programs and courses is available on the depart-ment website or in the department office.Major in ClassicsThe major in classics offers students three paths of study. Although no previous knowledge of Latin or Greek is required, all students are required to achieve competence in one of these ancient languages in order to work with primary sources in the original. Some may choose to com-plete advanced work in both languages. With concentrations in Latin, Greek, or both languages, the major requirements allow some flexibility. Classics majors develop familiarity with the broad sweep of ancient history and literature and key analytical skills necessary to examine the record of Greek and Roman culture. They complete a demanding and distinctive course of study that stresses the development of important intellectual sensibil-ities—close reading, analytical clarity, thorough research, evaluation of evidence, logical analysis, effective writing, appreciation of nuance and subtleties, historical variability, and cultural differences. All majors complete a research project under the direction of a faculty member in a small 1-quarter seminar. Seniors pursuing honors will undertake an additional 2 quarters of research.Each of the three tracks—Greek and Latin, Latin, or Greek—requires a minimum of 12 courses beyond the language prerequisites. All majors are required to undertake a research proj-ect in connection with 395 Research Seminar. Topics vary from year to year. Instruction will be included in the use of traditional as well as digital research tools. Students may petition the director of undergraduate studies to substitute research conducted for a study abroad program.

Each option allows students either to survey aspects of classical culture and traditions or to take a more focused cluster of courses. Unlike the Greek and Latin minors, the classical studies minor does not require study of an ancient language. Instead, it provides a framework  for examining any aspect of Greek and Roman antiquity  or its traditions and reception in medieval through  contemporary Western culture. Students majoring in classics may also earn a minor in classical studies, provided they do not double-count courses toward both the major and the minor, and they do not count toward the minor any courses in the language(s) of their major at or below the prerequisite level.

Students learn the ways in which converging sources of evidence may be integrated to discover the mechanisms underly-ing the complex adaptive properties of human cognition. The major in cognitive science gives a broad foundation in this interdisciplinary field, encompassing cognitive psy-chology, linguistics, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and related disciplines. Required introductory courses survey basic phenomena and approaches; basic methodol-ogy courses impart the methods of cognitive science; core courses provide foundations of disciplines within cognitive science; and elective courses allow students to pursue more advanced study in particular disciplines. A proseminar focuses on ongoing research in the field by Northwestern faculty.

It is designed for students who either do not have the language skills necessary for the major or are particularly interested in non-Western literatures, which currently are taught at Northwestern primarily in translation. Unlike the major in comparative literary studies, the minor in world litera-ture does not have a language requirement. Students are encouraged to read literary texts in the original language but can also take courses where literature is read in English translation. The minor allows students to study literatures from different parts of the world as well as different periods. Students take courses from at least two different cul-tural traditions and are encouraged to examine the rela-tions between them—particularly between traditions of Europe and North America and those of the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America. In so doing stu-dents discover how literary texts cross national boundaries and thus become part of “world literature.” This cross-ing often involves some kind of translation, so the minor, while allowing students to read literary texts in English translation, also makes translation one of its objects of investigation.Minor requirements (7 units)• At least 2 COMP LIT courses, of which 1 is 201 and  the other is a 300-level course. • 5 additional literature courses from at least two different cultural and linguistic traditions.  ◦Courses may be from CLS, English, or any of the for-eign language departments or area-studies programs. ◦At least 2 courses must be at the 300 level. BA/MA in Comparative Literary StudiesStudents with a strong record in their major courses and an interest in graduate study are eligible to apply for the BA/MA program in comparative literary studies once they are within 4 courses of completing their undergraduate degrees. The application requires a statement of purpose, a plan of study, and two letters of recommendation from department faculty.BA/MA students fulfill MA requirements by choos-ing 9 graduate courses in consultation with the director of graduate studies. These may be from CLS, the student’s first and/or second literature, and/or another discipline of interest (such as philosophy or film studies). They must include 410 and, during the final quarter, 590, in which the MA thesis is written. Three of the 9 units may count toward the undergraduate major.Honors in Comparative Literary StudiesMajors with strong academic records may be recom-mended to pursue honors based on the strength of their senior essays.

EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCESearth.northwestern.edu The earth and planetary sciences study the past, present,  and future of the earth and other planets. Earth and plan-etary scientists address fundamental scientific questions important for understanding the earth and society’s con-nection to it. Courses in the degree program focus on physical, chemical, and biological processes spanning vast spatial and temporal scales, from the atomic to the inter-planetary and from the origin of the solar system to the modern day. The program provides preparation for gradu-ate study, as well as a variety of careers in the earth sciences and beyond, including environmental consulting, energy exploration and production, natural resources manage-ment, law, and medicine. Majors are involved in the full spectrum of depart-mental activities beyond coursework, including research, seminars, field trips, and social functions. Many do research projects with faculty and graduate students that lead to honors theses and scientific publications.Major in Earth and Planetary SciencesThe academic program covers traditional geologic topics and the latest advances in earth science. Courses may include theory, descriptive studies, data analysis, computer model-ing, laboratory exercises, and field training. Course concen-trations provide depth in the subdisciplines of geophysics, earth materials, geochemistry, earth history, climate sci-ence, or planetary science. Students may also pursue broad, traditional geoscience training via the general geoscience concentration.  Arts and Sciences • Earth and Planetary Sciences  81Concentrations do not constitute rigid programs of study. Students may design their own programs with approval from the director of undergraduate studies. Stu-dents planning to attend graduate school are strongly encouraged to conduct independent study (399).

PORT 380,", 396 See the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. COMPUTER SCIENCEeecs.northwestern.eduThe Program in Computer Science offers students the opportunity to study computer science within the context of Weinberg College’s focus on liberal arts and sciences, as distinct from the engineering context in the McCormick School’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Com-puter Science. The computer science requirements are identical in the two programs. Faculty and courses for the program are drawn from the McCormick EECS depart-ment, which has extensive computing facilities for student use. Computer science is a highly interdisciplinary field. The department maintains links with other programs at North-western, including cognitive science, psychology, learning sciences, communication studies, radio/television/film, computer engineering, and the Transportation Center. The computer science requirements include the follow-ing five parts. Undergraduates are encouraged to partici-pate in research projects and to take advanced courses. • Background or related courses: fulfill the general requirements of the University and school and provide the necessary background for study in computer science• Core courses: what the faculty expects every CS gradu-ate to know• Breadth requirements: areas of computer science to which every CS graduate should be exposed • Depth requirements: opportunities to explore one or two areas in detail• Project: exposure to significant development and/or research work For more information on the EECS department and its course offerings, see the McCormick School chapter of this catalog. Students are urged to speak regularly with advisers and to consult the EECS website for a detailed curriculum document.This major was formerly known as computing and information systems.

For information on criteria and procedures, contact the program director and see Honors in the Major on page 39.CRITICAL THEORY criticaltheory.northwestern.eduCritical theory involves the attempt to better understand power and conflict and to achieve change in or distance from the unexamined beliefs, forces, conventions, ways of thought, institutions, and routines that determine much of human life. Students will develop their ability to question the world in which they live and to formulate theoretically nuanced responses to the problems that define our histori-cal moment. The minor is an interdisciplinary program of study enabling undergraduates to acquire understanding of criti-cal theory’s many dimensions and fields of application. It fosters dialogue between students with shared interests in such areas as continental philosophy, comparative litera-ture, media and communication, film studies, the social sciences, and political theory, among others. Through the undergraduate-initiated and organized Critical Theory Research Workshop, students pursuing the minor bene-fit from an active undergraduate research culture. The minor is associated with Northwestern’s Critical Theory Cluster, a research network of over 100 faculty and gradu-ates responsible for a vibrant program of interdisciplinary events, workshops, visiting professors, and lectures. The minor is also associated with the undergraduate Paris Pro-gram in Critical Theory, Literature, and Media.Minor in Critical TheoryMinor requirements (6 units)• COMP -0 An Introduction to Computer Science for Everyone  General introduction to historical and current intellectual questions in computer science.

The program is especially suited for students considering a major in mathematics, the natural sciences, or economics, although MENU attracts participants with a variety of interests and majors. The program director is available to advise all MENU students regardless of major. During the first year, MENU participants typically enroll in one of two yearlong sequences: 290-1,2,3 or 291-1,2,3. Each provides a strong background in linear algebra and multivariable calculus. In contrast to standard math-ematics courses, 290 and 291 develop linear algebra before multivariable calculus and use linear algebra as an impor-tant tool in the study of multivariable calculus. In particu-lar, 291 emphasizes theory and proofs and is appropriate for students who are particularly skilled in and passionate about mathematics. Students may transfer between 290 and 291 with permission from the MENU director.After the first year, MENU participants may choose among four upper-level MENU sequences: 311-1,2,3; 321-1,2,3; 331-1,2,3; or 360-1,2; or they may enroll in other advanced courses in the mathematics department.Admission to MENU is by invitation. Students who earn an Advanced Placement score of at least 4 on the Calculus BC examination should automatically receive an invitation to participate. Others who satisfy any of the fol-lowing criteria qualify for MENU (although they do not receive an automatic invitation) and may obtain permission to enroll from the director:• International students who have completed single- variable calculus Arts and Sciences • Mathematics   127• Students who have completed a college-level sequence  in single-variable calculus with high grades• Students earning a score of 7 on the International Baccalaureate Higher-Level Mathematics ExaminationStudents who excel in 220 and 224 may consult the MENU director about continuing their study of math-ematics in MENU. Further information about MENU is available at math.northwestern.edu/undergraduate /menu.Mathematics Second Major for ISP StudentsThe Integrated Science Program is a highly selective BA program in Weinberg College (see Integrated Sci-ence Program).

Project to be decided  by mutual agreement with a faculty member.ENGLISH english.northwestern.edu The Department of English values various kinds of criti-cal inquiry and creativity. While some courses emphasize the formal qualities of literary works, others address such questions as what counts as “literary,” or how to char-acterize the relationships among literature, culture, and politics. Classes might discuss psychoanalysis, race and gender, or the history of the book. While courses have different approaches, methods, and emphases and the texts examined vary, all courses stress close reading and careful analysis of texts, whether written or visual. Reflecting both range and specificity, the curriculum enables students to pursue their areas of interest within a broader understand-ing of literary history and the range of literary study. In its creative writing courses the department offers training in verse, fiction, and creative nonfiction. Virtually all courses also include practice in writing clear, concise, and persua-sive expository prose. Rigorous training in thinking and writing is valuable for any career, including law, IT, communications, marketing, consulting, finance, and business as well as writing, pub-lishing, and the teaching of English at all levels. Courses in English and American literature also help students to hone their skills as critical citizens of global communities. The department takes pride in its diversity of perspec-tives. In addition to teaching classes in the department, English faculty contribute substantially to the course offer-ings in theater, drama, and comparative literature, as well as American, African American, Asian American, Latina and Latino, and gender and sexuality studies. Professors have taught courses in conjunction with the Newberry Library and other Chicago institutions.Majors in EnglishA complete description of undergraduate English major programs may be obtained from the department office and website. Detailed descriptions of courses to be offered each quarter are posted the preceding spring in “English Course Listings” on the department website.  Arts and Sciences • English   87English majors may ask any member of the depart-ment to serve as an academic adviser.

We seek to improve the prac-tice of communication, whether on the stage or screen, at the podium, in the clinic, or in everyday life. The school is committed to building the basic and applied sciences of communication; developing theoretical and critical perspectives on communicative performances; creating new technologies for communication and new modes of artistic expression; and helping students to be more effective in their work, at home, and in civic life by applying principles of communication. Undergraduates work in partnerships with world-class faculty to create new understandings and develop new approaches to human communication. The curriculum provides students with a solid liberal-arts education that broadens and enriches their studies of human expression and interaction.Founded by Robert Cumnock in 1878, the School of Communication is now the third largest of Northwestern’s six undergraduate divisions. It annually enrolls approxi-mately 1,200 undergraduate majors and 400 graduate students.Originally, the curriculum and its related activities were  concerned with public speaking and interpretative reading  as performing arts. As the field grew, the school added instruction in theatre, speech pathology, audiology, radio,  television, film, and other specialties in oral communication.  Throughout its history the school has often been a pioneer in new fields of study, including film and audiology.Today the five departments of instruction represent the diverse spectrum of study in the field of communication: communication sciences and disorders; communication studies; performance studies; radio/television/film; and theatre (including dance). All departments offer graduate courses. The School of Communication sponsors dance, debate, media arts, and theatre arts divisions of North-western’s National High School Institute.This wide range of educational activities takes place in buildings across the Evanston campus. The fifth floor of the Ryan Center for the Musical Arts houses the school’s administrative offices and two departmental offices. The Frances Searle Building houses administrative offices, two departmental offices, and laboratory and research spaces. Other facilities include the school’s original building, Annie May Swift Hall; two former residences on Chicago Avenue; the Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts; and John J. Louis Hall, a state-of-the-art studio production facility.In 2008 Northwestern opened a branch campus in Qatar, where programs in communication and journalism are offered. (See Campuses and Schools in The University chapter of this catalog.)ACADEMIC POLICIESRequirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science in Communication and the Degree of Bachelor of Arts in CommunicationThe School of Communication grants the degree of bach-elor of science in communication upon (1) the satis factory completion of 42 course units; (2) the fulfillment of the distribution requirement of the student’s major depart-ment; and (3) the completion of an approved program of study in communication and related fields suited to the student’s special interests and needs. If students interrupt the program of study for an extended period of time and degree requirements are changed during this period, they are normally held to the new requirements.In addition to, and independent of, the requirements set by the School of Communication, students must satisfy the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (see page 17).The Departments of Communication Studies, Perfor-mance Studies, Radio/Television/Film, and Theatre (includ-ing dance) offer the bachelor of arts in communi cation. The  requirements for this degree are identical to the require-ments for the bachelor of science in com munication with the addition of a foreign language requirement. (Regardless of whether the BA or BS is sought, the required programs of study for majors in the Departments of Communication Studies and Radio/Television/Film include specific foreign language requirements; for details, see the major require-ments for each of those programs.) To earn the bachelor of arts in commu nication, students—in addition to com-pleting the degree requirements for the bachelor of sci-ence—must demonstrate two-year proficiency in a classical or modern foreign language. Proficiency is defined as com-petence in the work covered through the final quarter of a college-level second-year language course sequence (or equivalent as determined by each foreign language depart-ment). Students who enroll for course credit to satisfy the proficiency requirement must earn a grade no lower than C– in the final course of the second-year course sequence. School of Communicationwww.communication.northwestern.edu Communication • Academic Options  171This proficiency is established in precisely the same man-ner as in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; see page 37 in the Weinberg College chapter of this catalog.General RequirementsOf the 42 units of credit required for all major programs in the School of Communication, 35 must be completed with grades of A, B, or C (grades of C– do not satisfy this requirement). A minimum of 18 units of credit must be taken outside the major department (see distribu-tion requirements below). All distribution courses and all courses applied to a major or a minor must be completed with a grade of C– or higher. Courses offered by the major department may not be taken for a P grade regardless of how they are applied to degree requirements. D and P grades may apply only to the elective requirement.A transfer student will be required to complete at least 11 units of credit in the School of Communication at North western. A communication placement interview is required at the time of first registration for all transfer students.Distribution RequirementsAll major programs in communication require 18 units of credit outside the major department in the following areas:• Science, mathematics, and technology• Individual and social behavior• Humanities and fine artsStudents should consult the department concerned  for the range of disciplines within each category and the number of courses required.Major Programs in Communication  and Related RequirementsAll students in the School of Communication must meet the requirements of one of the following major programs: human communication sciences, communication studies, performance studies, radio/tele vision/film, theatre,  or dance.Student Conduct in Communication CoursesAll undergraduate students enrolled in School of Commu-nication courses are held accountable to the University’s standards of academic integrity (see Academic Integrity on page 21 in the Undergraduate Education chapter of this catalog). They also are responsible for compliance with the following standards:• Attendance is required in all courses, and excessive absence is cause for failure.• All assigned work must be completed to receive course credit.• Assignments must be turned in on time, and examina-tions must be taken as scheduled; assignments cannot be made up or grades of incomplete given without prior approval from the instructor.See the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. ACADEMIC OPTIONSMinor ProgramsThe School of Communication offers six minor programs: dance, film and media studies, human communication  sciences, performance studies, sound design, and theatre. Students may not earn both a major and a minor in the same area, except that radio/television/film majors may earn a minor in sound design. Students wishing to pur-sue a minor should contact the appropriate department to be assigned a minor adviser. No course for the minor may be taken utilizing the P/N option, and all classes must be completed at a grade of C– or higher in order to be counted toward the minor. School of Com munication minors are open to all Northwestern undergraduate stu-dents. Please see the appropriate departmental sections for descriptions of the minors in human communication sci-ences, theatre, and dance. The Department of Radio/Tele-vision/Film administers the minor programs in film and media studies and sound design (see page 185).Dual Bachelor’s Degree ProgramsTwo programs allow undergraduates to combine a bach-elor’s degree in communication with a bachelor’s degree in another Northwestern undergraduate school. One results in a BA or BS from the School of Communication and a BS from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the other results in a BA or BS from the School of Communication and a BMus or BAMus from the Bienen School of Music. Both options typically require five years of study. For more information see the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog. Certificate ProgramThe Department of Theatre administers the Music Theatre Certificate Program (see page 189).ModulesModules are extended, structured learning experiences that take a student from an entry point to mastery of a specific learning objective. Modules are built around 4 to 6 courses that provide formal instruction related to the learning goal. Formal coursework is paired with cocurricular experiences that provide appropriate opportunities for application and practice. Modules provide a flexible way to build student-faculty cohorts, promote in-depth learning in areas of spe-cial significance, and guarantee that students can articulate what they have learned and demonstrate it through per-formance. For more information about modules, visit the School of Communication Learning Communities website at society.northwestern.edu.172 Communication • Academic OptionsIndependent StudyIndependent study is available by petition to juniors and seniors who have a minimum 3.0 grade-point average. Sophomores who have a compelling academic rationale to do so are also encouraged to petition to take an indepen-dent study. Petitions are available in the Undergrad uate Resource Center on the fifth floor of the Ryan Center for the Musical Arts, in department offices, and online at  communication.northwestern.edu/advising/forms. Stu-dents must secure a faculty sponsor to guide their inde-pendent study. The undergraduate dean must approve all independent study proposals. No more than one indepen-dent study will be approved per student per quarter. The School of Communication does not limit the number of independent studies that a student may take, but only 2 units of 399 may apply to the major degree requirements. Requests for independent study in the Weinberg Col-lege of Arts and Sciences must go through that school’s approval procedure. Regardless of the number of indepen-dent studies approved in Weinberg, no more than 2 units of 399 may be applied to the distribution requirements. Additional units of 399 are counted as electives. Indepen-dent study may not be taken using the P/N option. Some majors have additional rules regarding independent study; see the major requirements for details. Internshipscommunication.northwestern.edu/EPICS /find_an_internshipInternships (also sometimes referred to as field studies) allow students to gain valuable organizational experience and apply theoretical knowledge to situations outside the classroom. Students may receive up to four academic credits by enrolling in a weekly seminar led by an intern-ship coordinator as well as working at an internship. One credit may be applied to the major requirements, and the remaining credits are electives. Full-time internships are available in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City and may be coordinated in other cities on a case-by-case basis. Internships are coordinated through the Office of Exter-nal Programs, Internships, and Career Services (EPICS). Interested students should visit the website and contact their advisers.Junior TutorialsJunior tutorials are small seminars, open to juniors only, taught by School of Communication professors on unique topics. The tutorials may count as School of Communica-tion courses and as major courses if taught by a profes-sor in the student’s major department. They are listed in CAESAR under CMN-related courses and are listed in Spotlight every quarter. Students may take one junior tuto-rial in the course of their undergraduate career; additional enrollments require approval of the undergraduate dean.Student-Organized SeminarsA student-organized seminar (SOS) consists of a small group of students (under the sponsorship of one or more faculty members) who explore a specific topic not covered in the University curriculum. Typically, nine or fewer  students participate, each preparing a written seminar paper and making an oral presentation at one of the class meetings. Before the School of Communication approves an SOS course, a copy of the seminar’s proposal, signed by the sponsor and the department chair, must be submit-ted to the undergraduate dean for approval. Guidelines for proposing an SOS are available in the Student Resource Center on the fifth floor of the Ryan Center for the Musi-cal Arts and online at communication.northwestern.edu /advising/forms.Research PracticaOpportunities sometimes arise for a student to work on a faculty member’s research or project team. Sometimes fac-ulty will invite students to participate in a practicum, but students may also approach a professor whose research or project particularly interests them. Students are registered for research practica through the Student Resource Office on the fifth floor of the Ryan Center for the Musical Arts or via permission number from the professor or department. Professor approval is required to register.Study Abroadnorthwestern.edu/studyabroadStudents are encouraged to study abroad because it is an important educational experience. Most aspects of study abroad are handled by the Study Abroad Office, 629 Colfax Street. For more information see the Undergraduate Edu-cation chapter of this catalog.Graduate StudyThe School of Communication has been a national center for graduate study and research in the fields of communica tion arts and sciences for many years. Programs for the master of arts, master of fine arts, master of science, and doctor of philosophy degrees with majors in com-munication are administered by the Graduate School of Northwestern University. All candidates for these degrees must satisfy the Graduate School requirements. The School of Communication itself offers the doctor of audi-ology, the master of arts in sound arts and industries, and master of science degrees in communication, health com-munication, leadership for creative enterprises, and speech, language, and learning.Requirements for the departmental and thesis  master’s degrees, the master of fine arts, and the doctor  of philos ophy degrees in any division of the School of  Communication are available from the Graduate School. Requirements for the doctor of audiology degree, the   Communication • Student Resources  173master of arts degree in sound arts and industries, and  the master of science degrees in communication, health communication, leadership for creative enterprises, and speech, language, and learning are available from the School of Communication.STUDENT RESOURCESAcademic Advisingcommunication.northwestern.edu/advisingEach student is assigned an adviser within the School of Communication. This adviser is available for consultation, especially for the purpose of planning for the next regis-tration. First-year students have a separate advising period before the fall registration and then have a total of three required advising meetings, one each quarter. Sophomores are required to have two advising meetings during the academic year. Ultimate responsibility for meeting degree requirements rests with the student.Cocurricular Activities and ProgramsA variety of cocurricular opportunities are available to School of Communication students. Each fall North-western’s Activities Fair offers information on options in addition to those listed here.In order to participate in cocurricular and student group activities, students must be simultaneously enrolled in classes at Northwestern. Students who have graduated or who are taking a quarter off from enrollment may not participate in cocurricular or student group activities. This includes all department-sponsored and student-run theatre and film projects and productions.Arts in the CityArts in the City is a program offered exclusively to stu-dents of the School of Communication. It gives them the opportunity to experience the best arts in Chicago for a nominal fee that includes ticket and transportation. These events particularly showcase the talents of those connected with Northwestern and allow students to socialize with faculty and peers.Block CinemaDedicated to providing the campus, the North Shore, and Chicago with a high-quality venue for repertory cinema, Block Cinema screens classic and contemporary films three nights a week in the Block Museum’s state-of-the-art  projection facility.Dean’s Advisory CouncilThe Dean’s Advisory Council consists of approximately 18 students representing the three divisions of the school: division I (theatre, performance studies, and dance), divi-sion II (communication studies and radio/television/film), and division III (communication sciences and disorders). The council meets once each quarter and holds additional meetings as needed. Debate SocietyThe Northwestern debate program was founded in 1855, making it the oldest in the country. Debaters develop valu-able analytical and communication skills by participating in more than 600 rounds of intercollegiate competition each season, in addition to hosting debate tournaments on cam-pus and debating teams from other countries. Headquar-tered in Hardy House, the debate program has achieved unequaled success in competition, winning the National Debate Tournament a record 15 times. For more infor-mation see debate.northwestern.edu.Inspire MediaInspire Media is a Northwestern student initiative aiming to produce social-issue media that engage with topics affecting our local and international communities. Believ-ing that media have the power to motivate thoughtful discussion and action, Inspire Media produces media and relevant programs that inspire thought, dialogue, critical discussion, and action with regard to various social issues. Inspire’s goal is to create an interdisciplinary approach to  media making, allowing students from across disciplines to collaborate in creating socially responsible and critical work.Lambda Pi EtaLambda Pi Eta is the official communication studies honor society of the National Communication Association. Its purpose is to recognize, foster, and reward outstanding scholastic achievement in communication studies; stimu-late interest in the field of communication; promote and encourage professional development among communica-tion majors; provide an opportunity to discuss and exchange ideas in the field of communication; establish  and maintain closer relationships between faculty and  students; and explore options for graduate education in communication studies.National Student Speech Language Hearing AssociationThe National Student Speech Language Hearing Asso-ciation, founded in 1972, is a preprofessional association for graduate and undergraduate students interested in the study of communication sciences and disorders. NSSLHA has member representation on the policy-making board and selected committees and boards of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. The Northwestern chapter is dedicated to providing opportunities for mem-bers to have access to educational, social, and philanthropic experiences during their tenure at the University.

Environmental issues and conflicts are among the most important concerns of the 21st century. The minor in environmental policy and culture provides opportunities to engage in scholarly inquiry about managing the natural environment. Courses address issues such as global climate change, efforts to maintain and restore biodiversity, and the reconciliation of development with environmental pro-tection. Courses that fulfill the minor requirements include both those offered by EPC (identified as ENVR POL) and courses from different departments and programs. They fall into three categories: the humanities (largely courses in history, philosophy, and religion), policy (largely courses in the social sciences), and the natural sciences. Although all students who minor in environmental policy and cul-ture take at least 1 relevant course in the natural sciences, the emphasis is on courses in the humanities and social sciences. Students are encouraged to participate in environmen-tal research at Northwestern.

The curriculum synthesizes the natural sciences, engi-neering, and the social sciences, all of which are important for understanding the environment, the impact human activities have on it, and ways to mitigate and manage such impacts. In the interdisciplinary curriculum, majors learn integrative and quantitative approaches to local and global environmental issues, such as air and water pollu-tion, biodiversity, climate change, energy, human health, and sustainability. The program provides preparation for employment in environmentally oriented firms, compa-nies, and organizations; training for graduate study in diverse environmental disciplines; and preprofessional 92 Arts and Sciences • Environmental Sciences development for careers in civil service, law, business, and medicine. Major in Environmental SciencesThe major in environmental sciences has two tracks: one in science and one in economic policy. The tracks share foundation courses in science and math and the core cur-riculum. Advanced coursework differs by track.Students should plan their academic paths with an environmental sciences adviser soon after identifying their interests in the major. Foundation courses, many of which are prerequisites for advanced courses, should be com-pleted as soon as possible. Students are encouraged (but not required) to take "
MATH 383," and must take the following additional courses:• 201, 202, 203 • 4 advanced studies courses from the lists above ◦3 from the science list (may substitute 1 quarter of 399 for 1 of these) ◦1 from the environment and society list ◦All must be at the 300 level.Honors in Environmental SciencesStudents with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors should approach a faculty member by the end of junior year to discuss possible projects; these may involve field, experimental, or computational research. Research is completed during 2 quarters of 399, which may count toward major requirements. Students then prepare a written thesis. Those whose theses and grades meet program criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors.

PHIL 273,"-1 The Good Life-2 The Moral Life-3 The Good Society"
PHIL 373,"-1,2 Philosophy and the City  (.5 units) FRENCH AND ITALIAN frenchanditalian.northwestern.edu Studies in French and Italian provide unique insights into the language, thought, and character of cultures different from our own. Such knowledge builds an awareness of our own society’s diversity and the ways it resembles and dif-fers from others. Proficiency in language and knowledge of culture are keys to careers in communication, media, busi-ness, the arts, and academia and are valuable components of any university education.The department’s programs are varied. Language courses, from the elementary through the graduate levels, develop communication skills for functioning at ease with foreign texts or in a foreign environment. Courses in lit-erature and culture not only broaden and deepen insights into the thought and writing of other societies but also train students to think independently, to organize and ana-lyze materials thoughtfully, and to discuss ideas effectively.The department offers a minor in French, a major in French studies, MA and PhD programs in French, and a minor and a major in Italian. These may be supple-mented by study abroad, which allows students to increase their knowledge of a foreign language and society while continuing university work abroad in a variety of fields. It is not necessary to be a major to participate in these programs. FrenchMajor in FrenchThe major in French provides rigorous interdisciplinary training in the French language and the literary, cultural, and intellectual traditions of France and the French-speaking world. Extensive coursework at all levels of language study pre-pares students to engage critically with a rich array of texts, images, and ideas from francophone cultures. Ranging in scope from the medieval period to the present, course con-tent extends across regions and incorporates many genres, media, and historical documents, placing them in their social and political contexts. Majors acquire the tools for literary and cultural analysis, learn about the distinctive contributions of French critical thought, and complete an independent research paper. Students are thus prepared to be linguistically adept, global citizens who are attuned to the complexities of language and culture. Prerequisite• 201 or equivalent proficiencyMajor requirements (14 units)• At most 5 200-level courses taught in French, including  ◦202 ◦210 or 211 ◦At least 1 but at most 2 of 271, 272, 273• At least 9 courses must be at the 300 level, including ◦At least 1 advanced language course chosen from 301, 302, 303, 305, 309, 391, 393 ◦At least 4 literature and culture courses selected from 310 through 390.

The program offers a major and a minor for Northwestern undergraduates, as well as a certificate for graduate students. It includes 11 core faculty members with joint appointments as well as affiliated faculty. Faculty teach courses and pursue research in the history and theory of gender, feminism, women’s studies, and sexuality studies, including gay, lesbian, and queer studies.The many approaches, methods, and topics in gender and sexuality studies at Northwestern are united in focus-ing on gender, sex, and sexuality as key but often under-examined categories in history, scholarly study, and daily life. At the same time, they attend to questions of identity and sexual politics in ways that do not take for granted the particular sex/gender categories of the modern Western world.A full range of courses is offered, from first-year semi-nars to graduate courses. They provide information and  Arts and Sciences • Gender and Sexuality Studies  99analysis of culture, society, history, and politics, often from a transnational and international perspective.

Solving these problems requires not only financial resources but, more important, a deep understanding of the interaction of domestic and global forces and the cultural and political realities that affect the design and implementation of solutions in specific settings. The interdisciplinary Global Health Studies Program is designed to provide skills for dealing with complex inter-national health issues, with a focus on health disparities and inequalities. Students learn about domestic and inter-national approaches to international crisis management as well as about perspectives on specific health issues within the diverse US population. The program is designed for students from a variety of backgrounds, including those interested in medicine and health sciences. It combines coursework and international experiences, drawing on many disciplines including pub-lic health, anthropology, history, economics, engineering, political science, sociology, international relations, and psychology.Adjunct Major in Global Health StudiesAdjunct major requirements (11 units)• 4 core courses ◦301, 302, 320  ◦309 or 322 • 3 additional global health courses (310-1,2; 399; and courses taken abroad may not be counted toward this requirement.)• 4 elective courses from various departments as listed on the department website.

GREEKSee Classics.HEBREWSee Middle East and North African Studies.HINDISee Asian Languages and Cultures.HISTORYhistory.northwestern.edu The Department of History is a place where students can study any region of the world, during almost any historical era, from a wide variety of perspectives. The faculty includes nationally distinguished scholars in United States, European, Latin American, African, and 108 Arts and Sciences • HistoryAsian history. Faculty resources enable the department to offer major fields of study in the history of the Americas, English/European history, African/Middle Eastern history, Asian/Middle Eastern history, and global history. Most history courses are open to any undergradu-ate. Few have specific prerequisites, although first-year students are generally advised to try 100- and 200-level courses before attempting 300-level courses. History majors have priority in registering for classes, but most students enrolled in history courses are majoring in other areas. The history faculty welcomes this diversity of students.Since all courses listed below cannot be given in any one year and the quarters in which they are offered are subject to change, see the online quarterly class schedule from the Office of the Registrar for actual offerings.Major in HistoryThe history major enables students to broaden their intel-lectual horizons as they study the experiences of people outside their time and place. Courses are designed to develop the ability to read insightfully, think critically, and write with precision and polish. Students enroll in a range of historical courses as well as develop an area of concen-tration. Majors are each assigned a faculty adviser with whom they are encouraged to consult frequently. Students majoring in history select one of five concen-trations and may arrange to emphasize special fields within its context: • History of the Americas• English/European history• African/Middle Eastern history• Asian/Middle Eastern history• Global history The program for majors consists of 12 graded courses in history, none of which may be substituted by advanced placement credits. These courses, chosen by the student with the adviser, are distributed as follows.Major requirements (12 units) • 2 undergraduate seminars  ◦393, taken as soon as possible after declaring the history major ◦395 (should be taken in junior or senior year and need not be within the student’s concentration)• 10 additional 200- or 300-level courses ◦For nonglobal history concentrations –6 courses in a geographic concentration (see depart-ment website for eligible courses; only 1 allowed from 101, 102, or 103)  –4 courses outside the geographic concentration ◦For global history concentration –250-1,2 and 2 additional global history courses (see department website for eligible courses)  –6 courses outside global history, either 2 each in three geographic areas or 3 each in 2 geographic areas• At least 2 of the 12 courses must be in fields other than modern European or US history (e.g., courses in Euro-pean history before 1800 or in African, Asian, Middle Eastern, or Latin American history in any period).Minor in HistoryThe minor in history encourages students majoring in other fields to study history and to organize their histori-cal studies in a coherent way. The structure of the minor requires students to gain both depth and breadth in his-tory. Students must select a concentration, which enables them to acquire significant knowledge of one area of the world, and take courses outside the concentration, which encourages an understanding of diverse cultural contexts.Minor requirements (7 units)• At least 3 must be at the 300 level.• Only 1 may be an introductory colloquium (101-6,  102-6, 103-6).• 4 must be in one of the following areas of concentration, and at least 2 of these must be at the 300 level: ◦ Africa ◦Asia ◦Europe, including Britain ◦Latin America ◦ Middle East  ◦United States ◦Economic and labor history  ◦Environmental history ◦Law and crime ◦Science and technology• 3 must be outside the area of concentration.Honors in HistoryJunior majors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors attend informational sessions during winter quarter. They submit a thesis proposal and a letter of recommendation from a Northwestern history professor by an early spring deadline. Those chosen enroll as seniors in a 3-quarter thesis seminar (398-1,2,3) and submit a completed thesis in May. All 3 quarters of 398 may count toward the major; see the department for details. Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information consult the director of undergraduate studies and see Honors in the Major on page 39. The Teaching of HistoryWeinberg College students pursuing a major in history  who also wish to be certified for secondary teaching must be admitted to the Secondary Teaching Program in the School of Education and Social Policy and complete all  Arts and Sciences • History  109require ments as outlined in the SESP chapter of this catalog.

IGION 264,", 265 HUMANITIES humanities.northwestern.edu The humanities are a broad and interdisciplinary collec-tion of fields that differ from the physical, biological, and certain of the social sciences by concentrating on the study of human thought and culture. The humanities include the study of literature, philosophy, history, art, and music, as well as film, dance, theater, and television. Certain scholars in sociology, psychology, anthropology, and political sci-ence also pursue humanities research.The humanities pose big questions about the meaning of life and examine assumptions about how we make sense  Arts and Sciences • Humanities   113of our complex and globalized world. Studying them permits us to examine ourselves and what it means to be human—here and now, as well as elsewhere and in the past. Enabling students to process human experience as well as to develop critical thinking, writing, and speaking skills, the humanities offer a valuable contribution for students pursuing any career plan. Alice Kaplan Institute for the HumanitiesThe Alice Kaplan Institute for the Humanities coordinates humanities courses, the Kaplan Humanities Scholars Pro-gram, and the humanities minor. Kaplan Humanities Scholars ProgramStudents accepted into the competitive Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program take two intensive courses in both fall and winter of the first year. Their two first-year seminars are designed especially for program participants. In the two Humanities in the World courses team-taught by some of the University’s best teachers, students explore humani-ties topics in diverse texts and take field trips throughout Chicago. For more information see  kaplanscholars .northwestern.edu. Minor in HumanitiesThe minor in the humanities exposes undergraduate stu-dents to diverse examples of human thought and culture and to the interdisciplinary methods and theories used in humanities scholarship. Its premise is that studying an assortment of humanities topics from a wide range of per-spectives complements the more closely focused course-work of any major, inside or outside the humanities. Minor requirements (7 units)• Up to 3 200-level HUM classess• Balance from 300-level HUM classes, which may include 399 and/or a humanities internship through the Chicago Field Studies program (see page 71)Courses in the Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program Specific topics in these courses will vary as different  professors participate. -0 American Religious History from 1865 to the Great Depression  Topics include urban religion, Afri-can American churches, Christians and foreign policy, immigrant religion, the spiritual crisis of the 1920s, and Pentecostalism.REL"

HUM 399,"-0 Independent Study  Individual projects with  faculty guidance. Open to junior and senior minors.  Prerequisite: consent of instructor.INTEGRATED SCIENCEisp.northwestern.edu The Integrated Science Program is a highly selective cur-riculum of natural sciences and mathematics presented predominantly in small classes at an accelerated pace. Courses emphasize the common base and relationships between the traditional sciences, including the importance of mathematics and the development of first principles, leading to interdisciplinary topics at the forefront of sci-ence today. The goal is to provide students who are inter-ested in careers in science and mathematics with a broad quantitative background that will give them superior preparation for further work in graduate or professional schools or permanent employment. The curriculum is composed of 25.7 units, up to 3 of which may be indepen-dent research, as well as a regular seminar series. Most stu-dents take advantage of the opportunity to pursue research in world-class laboratories at Northwestern and are able to publish peer-reviewed papers in professional journals. ISP may lead to a three-year bachelor of arts degree if, by the end of the third year, the student has completed 38.7 or more units and satisfied all other college requirements.Students must be accepted to Northwestern to be  eligible for admission to ISP, which requires a separate application to the program director. For more information on admission procedures, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. Also see the ISP website for the required AP and achievement tests.The ISP curriculum consists of specially designed courses taught by faculty members of science and mathe-matics departments. Course descriptions are found in the appropriate departments in this catalog. Though listed in a three-year format, the program is often spread over four years, particularly if a student wishes to combine an ISP major with a second major in a traditional department, such as biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, environ mental sciences, earth and planetary sciences, materials science, mathematics, physics, psychology, or in an engineering field.

LING 399,"-0 Independent Study  MATERIALS SCIENCE mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science Materials science is the study of processing-structure-property relationships in materials of importance to society, such as metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconduc-tors, biomaterials, nanomaterials, and their combinations (composites). Materials scientists pay special attention to “microstructure”—i.e., how materials are constructed on the microscopic, submicroscopic, and even the nanome-ter levels, and how this affects their properties. Given the wide range of uses for materials, their properties of inter-est are similarly broad, from mechanical (e.g., strength) to electrical (e.g., semiconduction) to biological (e.g., biocompatibility). By offering the opportunity to study materials science within the context of the liberal arts and sciences, the Materials Science Program in Weinberg College is distinct from the program in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. The Weinberg program has strong connections with Weinberg’s physical and bio-logical sciences departments in addition to its links with McCormick’s various engineering disciplines. Major in Materials ScienceStudents majoring in materials science in Weinberg  College choose from two tracks: general materials or soft materials. (Students interested in solid-state materi-als should see the materials physics concentration in the Department of Physics and Astronomy; they may double-major in materials science.)Requirements include foundation courses in mathe mat-ics and science and advanced electives. Course descriptions for materials science courses are listed in the McCormick School chapter of this catalog.Program courses (13 units)Laboratory components of general and organic chemistry courses require separate registration and bear separate credit; see the chemistry section for details.• 5 core courses: MAT "

For more information consult the program director and see Honors in the Major on page 39. MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCESmmss.northwestern.edu A central feature of modern social, behavioral, manage-rial, and policy sciences is the use of mathematics, statis-tics, and computers, both as languages and as methods of abstraction and analysis. Most undergraduate programs in the social sciences do not incorporate mathematical approaches in an organized and consistent manner, how-ever. The Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences Program (MMSS) was created to give undergraduate  students an opportunity to combine the study of social  sciences with training in formal analytical methods. MMSS students pursue a double course of study: a common mathematics/quantitative methods sequence and the social science major of their choice. (In some cases, students choose their joint major from outside the social sciences.) The program is for students with high mathe-matical aptitude and strong interest in social problems and issues, including policy and research impli cations. It pro-vides excellent preparation for graduate study in social or mana gerial sciences as well as for careers requiring quanti-tative skills and a solid background in the social sciences.In the first two years of the program, students enroll in a coordinated sequence of 12 1-quarter courses (2 courses a quarter) covering mathematical methods and their appli-cations in the social sciences. These courses are open only to MMSS students and are taught at an appropriately advanced level. In senior year, all MMSS students partici-pate in a senior seminar in which they write a thesis. There are no other required MMSS courses, but students must fulfill the requirements of their joint major. Admission to the MMSS program is very selective and is limited to first-year students and to Northwestern sophomores with superior academic records and a demon-strated strong aptitude in mathematics. Arts and Sciences • Mathematics   125A full-year course in calculus is a prerequisite for admis-sion. High school students fulfilling this prerequisite are encouraged to enter the program as first-year students, applying to both Northwestern and the program. To be considered for admission as sophomores, students lacking calculus should complete at least 2 quarters of calculus ( or 399 under the super-vision of a faculty member, consisting of a research project in the student’s area of concentration and, if possible, introductory graduate courses. Students intending gradu-ate study in a subject other than physics or not planning to go to graduate school may select the flexible concentra-tion, which can be tailored to their interests. All declared and prospective majors should meet with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of sophomore year, if not earlier.Major in PhysicsThe physics major is designed to help students acquire a broad and varied background in physics and related fields; it provides an excellent intellectual foundation for many careers. The three basic steps toward completing the major are fulfilling prerequisites in introductory physics and calculus; taking a core sequence (common to all concen-trations) of classical physics, modern physics, and math-ematics; and completing a course concentration.

MATHEMATICS math.northwestern.eduMathematics, often celebrated as the “Queen of the Sci-ences,” has long been an indispensable tool in the physical sciences, engineering, and commerce. Today it is also used in sophisticated ways in the social sciences and humanities. Students majoring in mathematics have the opportunity to learn about its diverse applications, as well as to acquire an understanding of both the foundations and the frontiers of the discipline.The department offers a major and a minor in mathe-matics. The mathematics major is flexible, accommodat-ing students interested in the foundations of the modern mathematical sciences; those primarily interested in the application of mathematics to the biological, social, and 126 Arts and Sciences • Mathematics behavioral sciences; and those interested in management or engineering. Students with sufficiently strong preparation who are interested in a rigorous approach to the subject are encour-aged to enter the Mathematical Experience for Northwest-ern Undergraduates Program (MENU). The department also encourages appropriately prepared students to enroll in its graduate courses.A course in computer science is often a valuable adjunct to a mathematics major. Students interested in probability and statistics or in becoming actuaries should take 310-1,2,3 or 311-1,2,3 and 1 or more courses in statistics (e.g., "

MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAN STUDIESmena.northwestern.eduStudy of the Middle East and North Africa is vital, given the region’s centrality in history and politics and a liberal education’s focus on the diversity of the human experi-ence. The Middle East and North African Studies Program  Arts and Sciences • Middle East and North African Studies  131incorporates the latest critical approaches to social, cul-tural, political, and economic forces in the region, which stretches roughly from Morocco to Iran and Central Asia, from the Mediterranean into Saharan Africa and the Sudan. The program trains students in languages, histories, literatures, and sociocultural specificities while encour-aging consideration of the region’s global integration. It advances fresh perspectives on Middle East studies by inquiring how the cultural, political, and economic condi-tions of globalization influence the region internally and externally. Drawn from anthropology, art history, history, litera-ture, media studies, political science, religion, and radio/television/film, among other areas, the faculty represent a variety of perspectives, with a focus on the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. It reflects Northwestern’s strengths in diaspora studies, Islam in trans-Saharan Africa, media stud-ies, cultural production, and North African studies. The program embraces comparative approaches, both cross-regional and cross-disciplinary. Course topics include the Middle East and North Africa in international politics, mass media, migration, digital cultures, arts and literature, law, and religious movements. The major and the minor prepare students for careers in a variety of fields, including law, government, human rights, international development, and cultural organizations.Major requirements (15 units)• 6 courses in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish beyond the first year. Native-speaker proficiency, determined by testing, fulfills the language requirement but does not count for course credit. Native speakers may com-plete this 6-course requirement with courses in a second MENA language or approved disciplinary courses.• 200• 2 quarters of 301 • 6 additional courses, each chosen from the approved program list for the quarter or with the director ◦Distributed among three disciplinary categories  –2 in history –2 in social sciences (including anthropology, eco-nomics, linguistics, political science, psychology,  and sociology)  –2 in humanities (including art history, art theory and practice, comparative literary studies, English, humanities, philosophy, and religious studies) ◦At least 5 of the 6 must be primarily focused on the Middle East and/or North Africa.   ◦Additional quarters of 301 count in the disciplinary category of the respective instructor.• At most 2 courses may be double-counted toward another major.• The major also requires a study abroad experience in  the Middle East or North Africa, either during the summer via intensive language study or other study abroad, or during the academic year; consult the pro-gram director for advice and approval. Students may petition for a waiver or modification of this requirement in exceptional cases. Minor requirements (8 units)• Each course must be chosen from the approved MENA studies list for the quarter or with the director and must relate to the Middle East or North Africa. • Foreign language study is not required for the minor, and no more than 2 courses may be Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish language courses.• At least 2 courses should be selected in each of the three disciplinary categories: history, social sciences, and humanities.• Students who satisfactorily complete two years of language study in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish may complete the minor with only 6 disciplinary courses.• Native-speaker proficiency does not count for course credit; native speakers may count 2 non native MENA language courses among the 8 courses. Honors in Middle East and North African StudiesMajors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors should submit an honors application, including a brief research proposal, to the program office by the third week of spring quarter of junior year. Accepted students complete a thesis, normally through 2 quarters of senior-year independent study (399); the two units must be counted toward different disciplinary categories.Students whose theses and grades meet program criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with hon-ors.

With strengths in Anglo-American and continental philosophy, the department provides courses in all system-atic areas of philosophy as well as a strong array of courses in ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. The research interests of members of the department show a similar breadth. This pluralism enables students to see philoso-phy’s application to all areas of life and to appreciate the diversity of approaches possible in philosophy.Major in PhilosophyBecause the study of philosophy involves the critical dis-cussion of the most fundamental questions asked by human beings, it helps develop breadth of understanding and  Arts and Sciences • Philosophy  135clarity of thought. This character of philosophical inquiry makes choosing philosophy as a second major attractive to many students. Moreover, with appropriate supporting courses, a philosophy major can be a sound preparation for many careers, whether or not they involve further study.The core of the program is a firm grounding in the  history of philosophy. Against this background, students may tailor a program that meets their particular interests.Major requirements (13 units) • 2 history of philosophy courses: 210-1,3 (should be  completed as early as possible, since the material is a  prerequisite to more advanced work)• 1 logic course: 150 or 250 (should be completed as early as possible, since the material is a prerequisite to more advanced work)• 1 course in moral or political philosophy: 260 or 261• 9 additional courses ◦None may be first-year seminars, 270, 373, or 398. ◦At least 6 must be at the 300 or 400 level (not includ-ing 398). A student who is admitted to and completes 1 or more 400-level courses may apply such courses toward this requirement. ◦Up to 3 quarters of 273-1,2,3, offered in the Brady Program in Ethics and Civic Life (page 93), may be counted, but then students may not petition to count another course offered outside the department.  ◦1 of the 9 electives may be from outside the depart-ment if it has substantial philosophical content. Course approval must be obtained from the director of under-graduate studies by submitting a petition that includes the course syllabus. ◦At most 2 eligible 399s may count toward the major. See department website for criteria. Approval must be obtained in advance from both the instructor and the director of undergraduate studies.Minor in PhilosophyThe minor in philosophy requires students to be well-grounded in the history of philosophy, especially ancient and early modern, covering the major texts of ethical and political theory as well as the major texts of epistemology and metaphysics. The emphasis on argument and logi-cal structure in philosophy requires familiarity with con-temporary logic, at least up to the level of the first-order predicate calculus. Beyond this foundational requirement, students take 4 courses tailored to their individual interests and, typically, to complement work being done in their major. To provide the greatest latitude, only 3 of the 4 remaining courses need be at the 300 or 400 level.Minor requirements (8 units)• 4 core courses: 150 or 250, 210-1, 210-3, and 260 or 261• 4 additional courses ◦At least 3 must be at the 300 or 400 level. A student who is admitted to and completes 1 or more 400-level courses may apply such courses toward this requirement. ◦None may be first-year seminars, 270, 373, or 398.  ◦1 from 273-1,2,3, offered in the Brady Program in Ethics and Civic Life (page 93), may be counted. ◦No more than 1 eligible 399 may count toward the minor. See department website for criteria. Approval must be obtained in advance from both the instructor and the director of undergraduate studies.Honors in PhilosophyMajors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors should have project proposals approved by a faculty supervisor and the director of undergraduate studies or the philosophy department honors convenor before the end of winter quarter of junior year. They then take 398-1 in spring quarter of junior year and 398-2 in fall quarter of senior year; neither counts toward major requirements. (Students may petition to begin this thesis sequence in fall quarter of senior year.) Near the end of the second quarter of 398, students submit completed senior theses, which are evaluated by the undergraduate commit-tee in terms of level of research and philosophical reflec-tion. In the spring, students present their research results at a conference open to the public.Students whose papers, presentations, and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information see the department website and Honors in the Major on page 39. Courses Primarily for First- and Second-Year StudentsStudents with an informed interest in philosophy, espe-cially those intending to choose philosophy as a major, should begin with 210-1 and 210-3 in their first year. All 200-level courses except 250 are suitable for beginners with no previous knowledge of philosophy."

It entails understanding political ideas, ideologies, institu-tions, public policies, and behavior, as well as groups, classes, government, diplomacy, law, strategy, and war. A background in political science is valuable for citizenship and political action, as well as for future careers in govern-ment, law, business, media, or public service. Northwestern’s Department of Political Science offers classes in the four major subfields of the discipline—American politics, comparative politics, international politics, and political theory—but many courses cut across subfields. Political science faculty are closely associated with other departments in Weinberg College, Pritzker School of Law, and the Kellogg School of Management, as well as several interdisciplinary programs, including the Buffett Institute for Global Studies, the Institute for Policy Research, the Program of African Studies, the Gender and Sexuality Studies Program, the Chicago Field Studies Pro-gram, the Environmental Policy and Culture Program, and the Center for Civic Engagement.Major in Political ScienceThe major in political science provides an opportunity for students to learn about politics in a variety of realms and settings. Students generally begin the major with 200-level courses, which provide a general introduction to subfields of political science as well as background for 300-level courses. Majors should choose 200-level courses from at least two subfields: American politics, comparative politics, international politics, and political theory.While some students choose courses from within one or two subfields, most take a wide variety across different areas. Concentrations are not required; however, majors may consult with department advisers to design programs of study. Students might design concentrations around, for instance, themes such as race, ethnicity, and politics; global transformation; representation and law; social and economic inequalities; terrorism and national security; and citizenship studies. Students planning to major in political science are advised to complete the 200-level gateway courses and at least 1 300-level course in political science by the end of sophomore year. Majors should complete their methodol-ogy requirement by the end of junior year and before tak-ing the 395 research seminar. Students should plan to take 395 in junior year or early in senior year. Those who plan to pursue honors must take 395 in junior year.Major requirements (12 units) • 3 gateway courses chosen from 201, 220, 221, 230, 240, 250. Since the gateway courses expose students to a vari-ety of subfields, students may take no more than 2 from the American politics courses (220, 221, and 230) to  fulfill this requirement.• 1 methodology course in political science chosen from 210, 211, 310, 311, 312, 315• 395• 7 additional 300-level courses in political science; "
CFS 391,", 394, 396, or 397 may substitute for at most 1 of these courses with consent of the director of under-graduate studies• At most 2 political science courses taken abroad may count toward the major but may not replace any of the 200-level gateway courses.Minor in Political ScienceThe minor in political science offers students the oppor-tunity to acquire a foundation in the discipline as well as significant exposure to advanced courses. Students may want to choose courses that complement and deepen their major area of study. For example, an economics major may want to focus on political economy courses. A history major might study contemporary poli-tics in an area on which he or she is focusing. A philosophy major may study political theory. Alternatively, students can choose to broaden their knowledge of political science in areas unrelated to their majors. Students should consult with a member of the departmental undergraduate advis-ing team to develop an individual program of study.Minor requirements (6 units) • At least 2 200-level courses chosen from 201, 220, 221, 230, 240, 250• 4 additional political science courses, including at least  3 at the 300 levelHonors in Political ScienceMajors (including students studying abroad) with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors should submit an application to the honors program by March of junior year. Interested students should com-plete at least 7 of the 11 courses required for the major, including the methodology and research seminar require-ments, before senior year. Accepted students enroll in the 2   -quarter seminar 398-1,2, which provides guidance in writing a senior thesis; these courses do not count toward the major. Students interested in pursuing honors in more than one major are encouraged to pursue inter disciplinary honors.Students whose theses and grades meet department cri-teria are recommended to the college for graduation with  Arts and Sciences • Political Science   143honors. For more information see the honors program link on the departmental website and Honors in the Major on page 39. Certificate of Achievement in a Foreign LanguageMastery of a foreign language has become increasingly important to understanding politics at home and abroad. To encourage students to become proficient in a foreign language, the Department of Political Science offers a  certificate of achievement in a foreign language that  may be earned either through coursework in political  science conducted in a foreign language (2 or more courses, usually completed during study abroad) or through the substantial use of foreign language materials in a thesis or other independent study–type (399)  work. Faculty advisers can discuss options with students.  The certificate must be approved by the director of  undergraduate studies.Certificate of Achievement in Quantitative SkillsThrough this certificate the department recognizes majors who have sought the quantitative skills that are increas-ingly important in many careers and in social science research. The certificate requires a grade of B or better in 312 and in 1 more advanced quantitative training course, usually from another department, as well as completion of a research project such as those required for 395, 398, 399, or another 300-level political science course that employs quantitative methods. The certificate must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. The Teaching of Political ScienceWeinberg College students pursuing a major in political science who also wish to be certified for secondary teach-ing of political science with history must be admitted to the Secondary Teaching Program in the School of Educa-tion and Social Policy and complete all requirements as outlined in the SESP chapter of this catalog. Students are urged to contact the Office of Student Affairs in SESP as early as possible in their academic careers.American Politics CoursesThese courses examine political behavior, power, and poli-tics in American society and in the institutions of US gov-ernment at the national, state, and local levels.POLI "

PSYCH 399,"-0 Independent Study  Consent of instructor required. See the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. RELIGIOUS STUDIES religion.northwestern.edu The Department of Religious Studies offers undergradu-ates from across Northwestern the opportunity to study religions as historical and cultural phenomena. This includes the scholarly exploration of religious traditions, histories, cultures, beliefs, practices, sacred texts, sacred stories, and material productions from around the world in their institutional as well as noninstitutional (“on the ground”) forms. The department’s approach is fundamen-tally multidisciplinary, drawing from a variety of fields and critical perspectives: anthropology, history, philosophy, ethics, sociology, and literary and cultural studies, among others.The wide variety of undergraduate courses range from large introductory classes to advanced seminars, and there are also independent studies and a senior thesis program for qualified students. The courses cover aspects of Bud-dhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, African American and Native American religions, new religious movements, and religion and culture in America. The department offers a major and minor in religious studies and a minor in Catholic studies. In consultation with a department adviser, students majoring in religious studies select one of four concentrations:• Global study of religion in comparative perspective• Religion, health, and medicine • Religion, law, and politics • Religion, sexuality, and gender Arts and Sciences • Religious Studies   151The concentrations are designed to complement academic interests and enhance professional goals.

It provides an excellent background for careers in business, advertising, nonprofits, the arts, public administration, law, medicine and health, journalism and communications, and planning, among others. The department also emphasizes the sociological perspective as a fundamental part of a liberal education and a complex understanding of the world.The department is particularly strong in the areas  of organizations and economic sociology; the sociology of law, health, science, and education; urban studies; inter-national, comparative and historical sociology; the sociol-ogy of art and culture; and criminology. It offers a wide variety of approaches to social inequality and its origins and consequences, including class, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 158 Arts and Sciences • Sociology To benefit from the department’s strengths, sociology majors may concentrate in one of seven areas: • economic sociology and global development• environment and society• law and society• social data research• social inequality: class, gender, and race• sociology of health, medicine, and science• urban sociology Concentrations guide the selection of both sociology and related courses. The department website lists approved courses by concentration. Majors may instead concentrate in general sociology, for which all sociology and related courses fulfill the concentration requirement, or design a concentration area. All concentrations require an adviser’s approval.Unusually good opportunities are available for inde-pendent study, field internships, and the use of quantita-tive and qualitative methods of research. In addition to the courses listed below, the department offers quarterly semi-nars on special topics of interest.Major in SociologyDepartment courses (12 units)• 2 sociology courses at the 100 or 200 level (except 101 and 226) • 3 courses in methods of social research ◦226 (recommended to be taken by sophomore year) ◦303 and 329• 306 (recommended to be taken in junior or senior year)• 6 additional 300-level sociology courses ◦398-1,2 (fall and winter quarters of senior year) may count as 2 of the 6 courses. ◦376 may count repeatedly with different topics and adviser approval.  ◦Although 399 may be taken more than once, only 1 unit may count toward the major.  ◦With adviser approval, students may count either 1 Chicago Field Studies course or 1 Global Engagement Studies Institute course toward their 300-level course requirement.

COMMUNICATION SCIENCES  AND DISORDERScommunication.northwestern.edu/departments/csdThe Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Com-munication Sciences and Disorders offers a major in human communication sciences, providing undergraduate students with a foundation for the study of disorders of hearing, speech, language, and learning. The department’s classroom, clinical, and research facilities are located in the Frances Searle Building on the Evanston campus. The undergraduate program emphasizes the basic sci-ence principles underlying all human communication and cognition and introduces students to clinical issues and research findings that pertain to disorders of communi-cation and learning. The major in human communication sciences is particularly appealing to students who plan to attend graduate or professional school in fields such as medicine, audiology, speech and language pathology, learning disabilities, dentistry, and biomedical engineer-ing. Students who do not pursue medical, clinically based, or research graduate degrees may enter careers in health-related private industry or the public sector. Undergraduate majors in human communication sciences have the option of pursuing a general course of study, typical for most premed students, or of choosing among three areas of concentration: audiology and hear-ing sciences, learning disabilities, and speech and language pathology. Audiology and hearing sciences encompasses the study of hearing, hearing disorders, and the treatment of hearing disorders. Emphasis is on basic communication science, including study of the anatomical, physiological, and physi-cal bases of hearing. Undergraduate courses present infor-mation on normal communication processes and provide an introduction to audiologic assessment and hearing loss management. Learning disabilities is concerned with learning processes and their dysfunctions, including disorders of perception, memory, language, and conceptualization. Such disorders lead to problems in the acquisition and use of oral lan-guage, reading, writing, and math skills that require spe-cialized remediation. Undergraduate coursework stresses theoretical, scientific, clinical, and educational issues as a foundation for advanced training.Speech and language pathology introduces students to the psychological, linguistic, neurological, acoustic, ana-tomical, and physiological bases of normal speech and language behavior. As their knowledge of normal speech, language, learning, and hearing processes increases, stu-dents are intro duced to the communicative disorders that result from the disruption of these processes. Advanced undergraduate courses are concerned with the nature, recognition, and management of common communicative disorders and present issues related to administration and public policy. Accelerated Degree Program in Medical EducationHuman communication sciences is an attractive major for students admitted to the Honors Program in Medical Education, providing opportunities for students to connect their study of basic scientific principles to research and clinical activities as well as real-life issues.  For information on applying to HPME, see Special Admission Programs on page 11. For a description of the program, including requirements, see page 30 in the Cross-School Options chapter of this catalog.Honors in Communication Sciences and DisordersAn honors program is available for students in their senior year who have maintained an outstanding undergraduate record through their junior year. Upon successful comple-tion of an honors project, they will graduate with honors in communication sciences and disorders. Also see Honors and Prizes on page 23 in the Undergraduate Education chapter of this catalog.Research PracticumStudents may register for a research practicum in which they gain research experience by working with a faculty  member on design, execution, and presentation of a research project. Students may develop ideas for an independent study based on their research practicum experience.176 Communication • Communication Sciences and Disorders Independent StudyStudents may register for units of independent study, in which they work closely with a faculty member on a topic of mutual interest.

RTVF 399,"-0 Independent Study  Prerequisite: consent of undergraduate dean after submission of petition.THEATREcommunication.northwestern.edu/departments /theatreOf all the performing arts, none draws on the rich vari-ety of human experience more fully than theatre. The-atre communicates the drama of life—whether the past, present, or future, and whether real or imagined—with 188 Communication • Theatreimmediacy, excitement, and eloquence. The student of theatre, therefore, must be a student of human society and must understand how social forces impinge on human behavior. To paraphrase Boswell, students of the theatre take as their subject the entire system of human life.For this reason students who major in theatre at North-western combine a liberal arts education with intensive training in the theories and arts of the theatre. At the heart of the theatre program lies the idea that the best theatre artist is the one who combines a broad knowledge of the literature and theory of the field with highly developed skills in its practice.Students spend approximately one-third of their pro-gram studying in the Department of Theatre, includ ing courses in history, literature, and criticism; acting, voice, and movement; directing; devising theatre; stage produc-tion; design; play writing; dramaturgy; creative drama and theatre for young audiences; and dance. Students develop the ability to approach problems and issues from a vari-ety of perspectives while developing skills in research and writing, laboratory work, group discussion, oral presenta-tion, performance, and production. Another third of the program comprises distribution requirements outside the department, and a final third is devoted to elective courses selected from a wide spectrum of University offerings.A major in dance is also available within the Depart-ment of Theatre (see page 193).Honors in TheatreThe honors program provides theatre majors who have demonstrated records of academic achievement with the opportunity to explore a sustained project in their senior year. It exposes majors to the rigors of research and cre-ative work comparable with graduate-level programs in theatre studies and offers preparation for future graduate-level study. Projects may be proposed in any area of the theatre department’s pursuits (design, directing, choreog-raphy, performance, history, criticism, or playwriting), pro-vided that supervisory personnel are available and willing to participate, and provided that appropriate facilities are available.  Eligibility for the honors program will be determined by the faculty. Contact the theatre department for more information.Major in TheatreProgram requirements (12 units)• Introductory coursesTH"

Learning communities include not only schools and classrooms but also workplaces, families, neighborhoods, and other societal arrangements where learning takes place. Through broad-based interdisciplin-ary research, teaching, and outreach activities, SESP’s faculty strive to better understand how social, psychologi-cal, and economic factors shape human development and learning and how innovations in pedagogy, technology,  and social policies can benefit lives. They learn to under-stand human development and improve learning in its various social contexts by applying the social and behav-ioral sciences.The school provides undergraduates with an inter-disciplinary curriculum, practical experiences, and research activities that are closely linked to its faculty and graduate programs. Five concentrations lead to the degree of  bachelor of science in education and social policy. The intellectual core of the human development and psycho-logical services and social policy concentrations comes from SESP’s human development and social policy  graduate program. The intellectual core of the learning and organizational change, learning sciences, and second-ary teaching concentrations is grounded in the school’s learning sciences graduate program.The five concentrations offer preparation for a number of career options. Students are encouraged to design  their concentrations with career objectives or graduate  and professional school admission policies in mind. They enroll with a wide variety of academic and career goals.  Some intend to go immediately to graduate and profes-sional schools, while others plan to enter a profession  upon graduation.Students in Northwestern’s other schools may choose to complete the requirements of SESP’s secondary teaching concentration in order to qualify for teacher certification.SESP offers advanced degrees and programs in elemen-tary and secondary teaching, higher education adminis-tration and policy, learning and organizational change, learning sciences, and human development and social policy.ACADEMIC POLICIESRequirements for the Bachelor’s Degree in  Education and Social PolicyA minimum of 42 course units are required for the degree of bachelor of science in education and social policy. The concentrations in human development and psychological services, learning and organizational change, learning sci-ences, and social policy have similar distribution and core requirements, though each has different major courses; the secondary teaching curriculum is markedly different, largely due to Illinois Board of Education requirements.Grade and Registration RequirementsThe following requirements concerning grade point  average (GPA) and registration apply to all students seek-ing the bachelor’s degree:• 42 course units are required for graduation.• Students are required to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 in all work presented for the degree. To qualify for teacher certification, students must earn a minimum grade of C in all professional core courses and main-tain minimum GPAs of 2.5 overall and 3.0 in teaching subject–area courses. Students in the human develop-ment and psychological services, learning and orga-nizational change, learning sciences, and social policy concentrations must earn a minimum grade of C– in all distribution requirements, core courses, and concentra-tion courses.• Full-time students may elect to enroll in some North-western courses with the understanding that they will not receive a regular letter grade but the notation P (pass) or N (no credit). They may elect 1 unit per quarter under the P/N option, which may be used only toward elective requirements.• Not more than six of the grades in courses taken at Northwestern and presented for graduation may be P’s and D’s.• Students may double-count up to 3 course units from their concentration toward a second major and up to 2 units toward an adjunct major or a minor. Required related courses in Weinberg College are not subject to these limits.• Coursework taken at institutions other than Northwest-ern that is to be counted toward SESP requirements must be approved in advance by the stu dent’s adviser; if a course taken for credit is outside SESP’s curriculum,  School of Education and Social Policysesp.northwestern.edu Education and Social Policy • Academic Options  197the relevant academic department at Northwestern must also approve. Students taking community college courses must earn a grade of B or higher for SESP to accept the credit.• A student typically may not have more than a total of three majors plus minors: three majors, two majors and one minor, or one major and two minors. Exceptions require permission from the SESP assistant dean for student affairs and are not granted during the freshman year.• All degree candidates must file an application for the degree with their advisers in advance of their degree completion. The adviser will forward the application, when approved, to the Office of the Registrar.• Students who wish to transfer into SESP from another Northwestern school must ◦Have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 (students in the secondary teaching concentration must maintain minimum GPAs of 2.5 overall and 3.0 in teaching subject–area courses). ◦Attend the appropriate information and orientation sessions and comply with the requirements stated on the interschool transfer application.• Students transferring from another university must  complete their final 23 units at Northwestern.• Additional requirements are stipulated in the SESP Undergraduate Handbook. All students are expected  to be familiar with and observe these policies.  When requirements or policies change, notification  is provided on the SESP website.In addition to and independent of the requirements  set by SESP, all students must satisfy the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (see page 17).ProbationIn addition to the University regulations regarding aca-demic probation, undergraduate students in SESP are ordinarily placed on academic probation when, in any one quarter, they do not receive at least three final grades of  A, B, C, or P, or they have a cumulative GPA below 2.0. Students on probation must work with their advisers to meet the conditions set by the probation and address the deficiencies that resulted in probation. Failure to do so may result in dismissal from the University.Petitions for ExemptionsStudents must petition if they wish to be exempted from or request a change in any of the SESP degree or specific course requirements of SESP. Petition forms are available electronically in the SESP Office of Student Affairs and  on the SESP website. No petition is considered unless it  is approved by the student’s adviser. Petitions requesting that a course substitute for a degree requirement must be submitted before the posted deadline.ACADEMIC OPTIONSSESP concentrations are interdisciplinary and flexible, allowing many undergraduates to enroll in University-wide programs or to pursue up to two additional majors, one additional major and one minor, or as many as two minors along with their concentration. Options include the five-quarter Certificate in Civic Engagement Pro-gram and the Summer Field Studies Programs adminis-tered by SESP; see page 208 for more information. Many students also elect to spend one or more quarters in a University-approved study abroad program.HonorsStudents who maintain records of academic distinction may qualify for the honors program. Any student who  has attained a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or above after  winter quarter of the junior year is eligible for provisional admission to the program beginning in spring quarter of the junior year. Students considering both study abroad and the honors program must plan their study abroad  programs accordingly.Students who successfully complete "

For the advising system to work, stu-dents must take all academic questions to their advisers. Advisers are responsible for helping students plan aca-demic programs that meet the requirements for comple-tion and graduation. Advisers also help students make use of academic, professional, and personal development resources. Students consult with faculty as well about research and professional interests.Students are encouraged to meet with their advisers  at least once per quarter to develop an individualized plan of study. Failure to do so may result in a hold being placed  on a student’s registration.Organizational InvolvementThe SESP Leadership and Programming Board plans events and projects to improve the undergraduate expe-rience, with committees for professional and academic opportunities, student experience and inclusion, and com-munity engagement. More infor mation is available in the SESP Office of Student Affairs.Support for Research, Special Projects,  and ExperiencesThe SESP Undergraduate Opportunities Fund provides support for special academic projects and community endeavors that students or student organizations undertake either on their own or under a faculty member’s direction. Students who pursue research may also seek support from the G. Alfred Hess Jr. Fund to defray the costs of data collection and analysis, travel, equipment, and other expenses directly related to their projects.The Vartan Northwestern Experience Fund helps stu-dents with financial need pay for student organization or activity fees and helps subsidize expenses in cases of emer-gency. The fund is not designed to replace financial aid.The Munger Family Practicum/Student Teaching Assis-tance Fund helps students with financial need afford the additional expenses incurred during their practicum or stu-dent teaching. Examples of expenses include transportation  Education and Social Policy • Nonsecondary Teaching Programs  199costs, background checks, and vaccinations.

Each major cur-riculum provides considerable elective opportunity for individualization, but coherence in the selection of elective courses is still necessary. In accredited programs, guidance is essential to ensure that certain criteria are met. A plan of study listing intended selections must be submitted for approval to the Office of Undergraduate Engineering by the end of the eighth quarter of study (winter quarter of junior year).Most curricula offer suggested areas of specialization or options in using electives. Course plans are available in the department or program offices or the Office of Under-graduate Engineering. Alter nately, self-designed plans worked out in con sul tation with a faculty adviser may be submitted.Students must meet both the school’s and the major program’s curricular requirements; the latter are listed in the major curricula sections in this chapter. Some curricula contain specializations or options to guide elective course choices. Taking courses regarded as duplicates will increase the number of requirements needed to earn a McCormick degree. (Contact the Office of Undergraduate Engineering or see the McCormick website for a list.)For further details about a program’s options or special-izations, consult its department coordinator, check with the Office of Undergraduate Engineering, or see the school’s website at mccormick.northwestern.edu.  Engineering and Applied Science • Academic Options   211Grade RequirementsA grade point average (GPA) of not less than 2.0 is required for all units presented for the degree. Students must have received a grade of C or higher in any course taken elsewhere and used to fulfill a McCormick degree requirement. The GPA in the 16 units in the major  program must also be at least 2.0; no more than 2 of  these units may carry grades of D. Grades for courses  fulfilling a minor must be C– or higher, and none of them may be a P.Every candidate for a degree must file an application  for the degree a year in advance of the date of graduation (see Academic Calendar on pages 4–5). In addition to and independent of the requirements  set by McCormick, all students must satisfy the Under-graduate Registration Requirement (see page 17).Pass/No Credit OptionThe following requirements apply to the pass/no credit (P/N) option:•  No more than 8 units taken P/N may be counted toward the 48 units required for the degree.•  Only 1 unit per quarter may be taken P/N during the first and second years.•  Core courses: Any 300-level course, but no more than 4 100- or 200-level courses, may be taken P/N to satisfy the 7-unit requirement in the social sciences/humanities. No courses may be taken P/N in the required math-ematics, engineering analysis and computer proficiency, basic sciences, design and communications, and basic engineering areas.•  Major program: Consult the responsible department office or the Office of Undergraduate Engineering regarding the regulations for use of P/N in each depart-mental program. •  Credits earned under a P/N grading scheme at another institution may be applied toward McCormick require-ments only if the P/N option is permissible for that requirement. Advanced PlacementAdvanced placement and college credit may be granted on the basis of the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Advanced Placement tests (or other appropri-ate international examinations), special examinations in subject areas, or analysis of high school background. Any placement in approved sequential work (verified by a grade above C– in a subsequent course) will reduce the require-ments for the BS by the number of courses preceding the placement. These stipulations regarding placement, exemp-tion, and degree requirements may differ from those of other schools of the University. Students receiving credit from AP examinations and other such programs must still meet the Undergraduate Registration Requirement. ACADEMIC OPTIONS Cooperative Engineering Education ProgramThe Walter P. Murphy Cooperative Engineering Educa tion Program alternates periods of paid industrial experience with academic studies for full-time students in all departments of engineering and applied science. During 18 months of industrial employment, students apply theory while gaining practical experience and develop an understanding of the responsibilities of their future professional careers.First-year students are invited to participate in work-shops to prepare for the co-op program. Sophomores in good academic standing begin applying for co-op positions as early as the fall quarter. The co-op coordinator makes every effort to secure interviews for the students so that cooperative work assignments are related to their profes-sional objectives.Generally, the first work experience for sophomore co-op students occurs the summer before their junior year. Co-op experience for juniors, transfer students, and others may begin as late as the spring of junior year. If necessary, special schedules may be arranged with the help of the academic advisers to enable students to meet individual academic requirements as well as co-op requirements.Students register for their work quarters, thus remain-ing enrolled at Northwestern. While no academic credit is given for co-op, special BS/MS programs may use co-op experience as the basis for undergraduate projects and master’s theses.Although emphasis is on the experience gained from cooperative work rather than on the income, students in the co-op program can cover a portion of their educational expenses with their earnings.The following table shows the college-industry  schedule for the five years of undergraduate education:College-Industry Schedule Summer Fall Winter SpringFirst year  1 2 3Sophomore vacation 4 5 6Junior work 7 8 workPresenior work 9 work 10Senior work work 11 12Employers of co-op students include government and service institutions as well as industry. Co-op coordina-tors visit participating employers periodically to discuss students’ abilities, attitudes, and progress on the job. At the end of each work period, employers are asked to evaluate student performance and progress. No tuition or fees are charged during co-op periods. Students who complete the co-op plan receive rebates of tuition increases their final academic quarters and continue to pay the same tuition level as others in their entering class.212 Engineering and Applied Science • Academic Options In addition to the academic degree, students who suc-cessfully complete the schedule of school and work—meeting standards set by the program and the co-op employer—receive recognition as co-op students upon graduation from McCormick.In some states, co-op experience may be credited for up to one year of the usual four years of engineering experi-ence required for the Professional Engineer’s License.Permanent employment is not an obligation for either employers or co-op students, but most students receive impressive permanent job offers as a result of the co-op experience. Others are admitted to prestigious graduate and professional schools.Undergraduate Honors ProgramStudents with good scholastic records may apply to the Undergraduate Honors Program any time during their junior or presenior years. (Students within three quarters of graduation are past this admission point.) At the time of admission to the honors program, they must have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or better. Courses used to meet the honors requirements must also be used toward require-ments for the bachelor’s degree.Honors students participating in the program must • Complete at least 3 units of approved advanced study (including courses normally accepted at the  grad uate level) with an average grade of B or better. • Complete an extended independent study project (at least 2 quarters on the same topic) leading to an accept-able report.Successful completion of the honors program will be noted on the student’s transcript. Recognition also will be given in the Commencement program. If his or her perfor-mance is not judged to meet the honors standards, the stu-dent will still receive course grades and credits as earned.Undergraduate ResearchOpportunities for undergraduate research are made avail-able and encouraged. Each field of study offers indepen-dent study courses for research enrollment on an elective basis. Funding of undergraduate research is provided by faculty-directed programs and several McCormick School and University sources.The McCormick Student Advisory Board holds an annual competition for the Harold B. Gotaas Award, which honors a graduating McCormick senior who has demon-strated excellence in undergraduate research.Students normally perform undergraduate research projects under the direction of faculty doing research in their department and in laboratories throughout the Uni-versity, including McCormick research centers. For more on McCormick’s research activities, see mccormick .northwestern.edu/research.Integrated Engineering Studies ProgramThe Integrated Engineering Studies Program provides an alternative for students whose particular interests and goals cannot be satisfied by a regular program in engineer-ing or applied science. To be eligible, students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or above. They may apply as early as the end of their first year but no later than 3½ quarters before completing the degree. Applicants must prepare a compelling argument for qualifying for this customized degree program. Examples of these ad hoc degrees from recent years include public health, engineering physics, biomedical engineering and molecular biology, analytics, and mechanical design. Additional details are available on the McCormick School web pages. Students who complete this program are awarded a bachelor of science in inte-grated engineering studies, and their transcripts specify  the themes of their courses of study. Second Field of SpecializationElective opportunities in McCormick curricula may be used in a departmental program in another school of the University. Satisfactory completion of the requirements for the second program, verified by the appropriate depart-ment, will be noted on the student’s transcript. Carefully planned electives will normally enable students to obtain a second field of specialization within the 48-unit require-ment for the BS degree.Multiple BS DegreesStudents with wide-ranging interests may work toward two or more bachelor of science degrees in McCormick by satisfying the full requirements for each degree. At least 6 additional units of credit, or the equivalent, must be pre-sented for each additional degree, and the work in multiple areas does not need to be completed at the same time. Each department or program must approve the course plan for its degree no later than two academic quarters before work for the second degree is completed but no earlier than junior year. Accelerated Master’s ProgramQualified McCormick undergraduate students may work simultaneously toward the bachelor of science and master of science degrees in engineering. Integrated planning of coursework makes it possible to take graduate-level courses during the third and fourth years. The requirements remain unchanged for the two degrees. The McCormick requirement for the BS is 48 units, and the requirement for the MS is specified by the individual department (9–12 units). No course used for the MS requirement may be counted toward the BS requirement.Application for admission to concurrent BS/MS study must be approved by the appropriate department and the Graduate School. A department may require that students do additional work beforehand. Engineering and Applied Science • Academic Options   213Dual Bachelor’s Degree ProgramsDual Engineering and Liberal Arts DegreesMcCormick encourages breadth of interest and to this end supports dual bachelor’s degree programs in engineer-ing and liberal arts. A common approach to a dual degree program is a parallel arrangement of studies requiring five years and resulting in a BA with a major in Weinberg Col-lege and a BS in a field of engineering. Students must com-plete the stated requirements of both schools and expected majors. For a description of the program, see page 28 in the Cross-School Options chapter. For information on applying to the program, see page 11. Dual Engineering and Music DegreesHighly capable students who have a strong interest in and commitment to both engineering and music may pursue a five-year program leading to bachelor’s degrees in both fields. In engineering any field of study may be chosen, resulting in a bachelor of science in the chosen field. In music the bachelor of music or bachelor of arts in music is awarded. For a description of the program, see page 29 in the Cross-School Options chapter. For information on applying to the program, see page 11. Dual Engineering and Communication Degrees Students are able to earn both a bachelor of science in engineering and either a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts in communication in five years. They may select any of the School of Communication’s majors and any of the available programs in engineering. For a description of the program, see page 29 in the Cross-School Options chapter. For information on apply-ing to the program, see page 11. Minors McCormick students are able to complete the following minors in addition to a bachelor’s degree.

See page 224 for details.Business Enterprise CertificateStudents who aim to have business careers and want to improve their ability to make a contribution soon after graduation may wish to consider this certificate program. It involves a combination of required business courses and work experience. Those completing the Walter P. Murphy Cooperative Engineering Educa tion Program must take 2 units of credit in addition to those needed for their bach-elor’s degrees; other students must take 4 extra units. An acceptable report on the work experience and successful completion of a McCormick BS degree are required.Segal Design CertificateThis certificate program, administered by the Segal Design Institute, develops a set of design skills valuable across the entire spectrum of careers available to McCormick gradu-ates. See page 240 for details. Certificate in Entrepreneurship Administered by the Farley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, this certificate is intended for undergradu-ates planning to pursue entrepreneurship at some point in their careers. Students who plan to join or create startups hone skills to complement their degrees. Those focused on research gain skills relevant when traditional sources of research funding no longer exist and commercialization is the next logical step.

It provides a plan whereby students entering Northwestern are admit-ted simultaneously to McCormick, Weinberg College, or the School of Communication and to the Feinberg School of Medicine. HPME students then parti cipate in a challenging program, with the first three or four years in under graduate study and the last four years in the Fein-berg School. Thus, the period of formal training may be reduced by one year.Students who meet the entrance requirements of McCormick may pursue a program leading to the bachelor of science degree in medical engineering after five years and the doctor of medicine degree after seven years. See page 30 for more information on HPME and page 11 for information on applying to the program.214 Engineering and Applied Science • Student Resources • General EngineeringSee the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. STUDENT RESOURCESTutorial ProgramMcCormick conducts a program of guided study and tutorial help for first- and second-year students in all the required courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and engineering. This program encourages out-of-class work and good study habits and helps provide a full understand-ing of the early courses that are the foundation for much to follow.Faculty AdvisersEntering McCormick students are assigned a first-year adviser. By the beginning of the sophomore year most  students will have selected a program of study and will  be reassigned an adviser in that area.

Is the air dangerous to breathe? Should we eat the fish we catch and the crops we grow? Do our living and work spaces pose threats to our health? Environmental engineers are the technical professionals  who address the potentially harmful interrelationships between human civilization and the environment. They identify and measure physical, chemical, and biological problems in the environment and apply scientific and tech-nological knowledge to eliminate or reduce them. Systems designed and operated by environmental engineers shield the environment from the harmful effects of human activ-ity, protect people from adverse environmental events such as floods and disease, and maintain and improve environ-mental quality. As their role has expanded, environmental engineers are being called on to address challenges associ-ated with alternative energy, sustainability, climate change, ecological restoration, and public health.Northwestern’s interdisciplinary four-year curriculum provides students with opportunities to supplement a sound foundation in environmental engineering principles with the knowledge of social sciences, humanities, and  public policy that is desirable in the profession.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCEmccormick.northwestern.edu/eecsThe Department of Electrical Engineering and Com  puter Science offers three programs for undergraduate students leading to the bachelor of science degree: electrical engi-neering, computer engineering, and computer science. It also offers graduate programs leading to the MS and PhD degrees in those three areas. The department boasts an internationally renowned faculty, state-of-the-art research equipment, and the considerable resources offered by a great university. It combines these advantages with an uncommon commitment to students. The department offers several interdisciplinary options, including premedical/biomedical studies and cognitive sci-ence. It collaborates with Weinberg College to offer  that school’s major in computer science (see page 79). Electrical EngineeringElectrical engineering involves the development and application of electronic and optical technologies for generating, communicating, and processing information. The electrical engineering curriculum includes courses in electronic circuits, solid-state electronics, electromag-netics, optics, lasers, controls, digital signal processing,  Engineering and Applied Science • Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  227commu nications and networks. Students may specialize in any of the following areas. Circuits and ElectronicsThis area of study is concerned with the analysis and design of circuits that employ electronic devices, such as integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, light-emitting diodes, data-storage elements, and image-forming devices. Important applications include AM and FM radio, televi-sion, digital computers, and electronic control instrumen-tation systems. Communications SystemsA communication system involves the generation of an electrical signal representing information to be transmit-ted, its encoding in some form for efficient transmission, its actual transmission, its decoding at the receiving end of the system, and its reconversion into something intelligible to the user. The thorough study of communications sys-tems theory requires knowledge of a broad range of math-ematical methods and of the capabilities and limitations of electronic circuits. This subject also covers the design and analysis of communication networks for the transmission of audio, video, and data among many users. Control SystemsThe study of control systems deals with the analysis and design of automatic regulators, guidance systems, numeri-cal control of machines, robotics, and computer control of industrial processes. Students are concerned with identify-ing these systems and with such topics as system stabil-ity, system performance criteria, and optimization. These concepts find application in other fields of engineering and in the development of better understanding of biological, energy, economic, and social systems. Digital Signal ProcessingStudy in this area focuses on the digital representation and algorithmic manipulation of speech, audio, image, and video signals. Specific topics within this general area include image and video processing, recovery and compression, multimedia signal processing, filter design and rank-order operators, image and video transmission, medical and biomedical signal processing, medical imaging, and algorithms for medical instrumentation. Electromagnetics and PhotonicsStudy in the area of photonic systems and technology focuses on microcavity lasers, nanostructures, quantum and nonlinear optics, integrated optics, fiber-optic and infrared waveguide devices, fiber-optic communications, computational electromagnetics, and imaging through turbulence. Special emphases include applications of novel quantum amplifiers in optical communications, imaging, and cryptography; devices for terabit second WDM and TDM optical networks; and applications of computational techniques in integrated and nonlinear optics. Solid-State EngineeringThis area is concerned with the design, physical principles, and applications of solid-state devices both as discrete units and integrated circuit systems. In addition to the various diode, transistor, and FET devices fabricated from silicon technology, devices developed from compound semicon-ductor materials are reviewed. Both analog and digital circuit applications are stressed. Another important topic is the behavior of conductors in the superconducting state, with a stress on applications.

All students acquire an understanding of statistics, economics, optimization, computing, and simulation techniques. Elective opportu-nities include courses in business management, advanced economics and mathematics, quality control and reliability, communications and information systems, and production and supply-chain management. Realistic (i.e., open-ended and ill-defined) problems are used to help students refine the application of these principles as well as their ability to work in teams and to communicate their results effectively. These are the experiences that employers find most valu-able in our graduates regardless of the field they enter.Students may pursue an optional concentration using technical electives and other courses from one or more of the following areas: management science, healthcare and humanitarian logistics, entrepreneurship, mathematical  sciences/graduate preparation, statistics and data analysis, and production and logistics. Many industrial engineering graduates eventually assume management positions. In preparation for such careers, students take full advantage of the additional academic, business, and leadership programs available at Northwestern: a major or minor in economics, the business enterprise certificate for engineers, the Under-graduate Leadership Program, the Business Institutions Program, study abroad, and the co-op program.

MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERINGmccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-scienceThe discipline of materials science and engineering has expanded rapidly in response to growing demand for materials that make improved use of existing resources or are needed for new technologies. The program at North-western is broad based, offering educational and research opportunities in polymer science, ceramics, metallurgy, surface science, biomaterials, nanomaterials, and elec-tronic materials. Engineers, scientists, and technologists who work on these different materials all basically apply the same scientific principles governing the interrelation of processing, structure, properties, and material perfor-mance. A key theme of the Northwestern program is the integration of these principles in the systematic design of new materials. The department offers an undergraduate program  leading to the BS degree and participates in the co-op and BS/MS programs. The curriculum centers on basic engineering and materials coursework but also provides the flexibility to focus on different areas of concentration as described below. The student’s educational experience is broadened by courses in the humanities, arts, sciences, and other areas of engineering. The undergraduate pro-gram culminates in the senior project, in which the student carries out a research/development project with a faculty member and his or her research group. 242 Engineering and Applied Science • Materials Science and EngineeringStudents who complete the BS program will be well prepared for professional work or graduate study in the application, production, processing, or research and devel-opment of materials. Graduates find opportunities in many areas, since materials expertise is important in vari-ous engineering fields as well as in medicine, physics, and chemistry. Areas of ConcentrationThe undergraduate program at Northwestern offers a close relationship between students and faculty. Every effort is made to tailor specific programs to needs and interests. Several broad areas of concentration are described below. Students are encouraged to create other areas that fit particular interests.BiomaterialsThe growth of biotechnology has stimulated interest in the interface of the life sciences and materials science. The field of biomaterials spans three broad areas: biomedical implant materials to replace natural structures; biomimetic materials applying biological concepts to the design of new engineering materials; and application of materials science principles to the understanding of structure and function in biological systems.Design and ManufacturingThis concentration is especially appropriate for those plan-ning a career in industry, where engineers typically work in teams on projects requiring experience with design and manufacturing. It builds on the design content in the materials science curriculum and provides additional interdisciplinary design experience. The concentration also develops industrially relevant strengths in the areas of materials selection, computational tools, materials process-ing, and failure analysis. Electronic MaterialsAs microelectronics enters the era of ultralarge-scale integration, materials scientists face new challenges in developing materials and processes for integrated circuits with components of nanometer dimensions. New scientific principles, materials fabrication techniques, and improved instrumentation will be needed to exploit electronic-level structure/property relations in devices and their com-ponents. New electronic materials must be developed to meet requirements in a growing range of application areas, such as spintronics, optical computing, and fuel cells. Energy MaterialsMaterials play a key role in a variety of energy-related areas, including the search for new and efficient energy sources as well as energy storage and efficient energy utili-zation. Specific topics covered in this specialization include fuel cell materials, hydrogen generation and storage, solar energy conversion, lithium-ion battery materials, and lightweight energy-efficient structural materials. Metals and CeramicsThe ability to design increasingly higher-strength alloys allows for lighter structures, and higher-temperature materials provide energy efficiency. Heat-treatable and toughened ceramics exploit advanced knowledge of solid-state phase transformations and reactions. Exciting devel-opments are taking place in high-performance composite combinations of these and other materials for structural and electronic applications.NanomaterialsThe area of nanomaterials, focusing on materials with sizes in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers, is an increasingly important research topic as nanotechnology industries develop. Examples of nanomaterials include ultrahigh-strength materials with nanometer-range structural fea-tures and structures designed and self-assembled atom by atom or molecule by molecule. Machines smaller than the tip of a pin can be built using either semiconductor materials processing or biologically inspired processing technology. This specialization is designed to give students the knowledge needed to work at the nanoscale, includ-ing design and synthesis, characterization, and theory/modeling/simulation of nanomaterials.Polymeric MaterialsSynthetic polymers offer the engineering community an ever-expanding array of materials having properties tai-lored by chemical and physical processing. New devel-opments are opening up applications for polymers as high-strength, low-weight materials; optoelectronic com-ponents; and key materials in other revolutionary areas. The basic understanding of engineering properties in terms of multilevel microstructure is essential for the full utilization of polymers.Surface ScienceA solid communicates with the outside world through its surface. Wear, corrosion, and passivation are well-known surface processes. Chemical, electronic, and mechanical properties of materials depend on composition at surfaces and grain boundaries (internal surfaces), surface treat-ments, and the environment. The surface scientist must be able to not only determine the properties of surfaces and interfaces but also to control them.Sustainable MaterialsMany technologies that the materials, manufacturing, energy, and water sectors currently rely on to provide benefits to humanity are not designed to last indefinitely. Redirection toward a more sustainable path is key. This concentration focuses on sustainability as it applies to  Engineering and Applied Science • Materials Science and Engineering  243materials and the manufacturing processes that convert them into a multitude of usable products. Students gain knowledge that bridges the domains of systems design and sustainable materials development and engineering.Laboratories and FacilitiesMaterials science and engineering demands sophisticated experimental techniques for the preparation and character-ization of advanced materials. The undergraduate program makes heavy use of state-of-the-art laboratory facilities in core courses, technical electives, and senior projects.Materials preparation and processing equipment is available for all classes of materials, including an advanced crystal growth facility in a clean-room environment for preparing single crystals of metals, oxides, alkali halides, and semiconductors. Investigation of complex microstruc-tures employs a wide array of microscopy, diffraction, and micro analysis techniques. A unique combination of instruments (cold field–emission transmission electron microscope, atom-probe field-ion microscopes, scanning tunneling microscopes) provides atomic resolution imag-ing and chemical analysis. These are complemented by an extensive surface analytical laboratory. Characterization of material properties employs an advanced mechanical testing facility featuring static and dynamic loading under controlled temperature and environment. Specialized facilities measure electrical, spectroscopic, magnetic, and photonic properties. Computer laboratories and a design studio address thermo dynamic modeling and simulation of microstructural evolution, with application in materials design.Degree in Materials Science and EngineeringRequirements (48 units)Core courses (32 units)See general requirements on page 210 for details. • 4 mathematics courses• 4 engineering analysis and computer proficiency courses• 4 units of basic science  ◦PH"

These students also should check with the Office of the Registrar to make sure they have fulfilled the Undergraduate Registration Requirement. (See page 17.)Medill Integrity Code All Medill students are required to uphold the Medill Integrity Code, which, among others things, requires adherence to prin ciples of honesty, fairness, and integrity in academic efforts and related professional media,  journalism, and marketing communications work, whether students are in school, on an internship or a job, or acting as volunteers in a pro fessional or academic activity. ACADEMIC OPTIONSAccelerated Master’s ProgramStudents who exhibit exceptional ability in undergrad uate  work may apply for early admission to the graduate jour-nalism program. This program allows them to earn both BSJ and MSJ degrees in less than five years. Candidates apply during their junior year and are admitted after Journalism Residency on the basis of academic excellence and promise of success in journalism. Interested students are encouraged to begin planning for this option early in their undergraduate careers. Information and admission materials are available from the Medill Office of Graduate Admissions and Financial Aid.Dual Bachelor’s Degree ProgramNorthwestern offers talented students the oppor tunity to earn in five years both a BSJ from Medill and a BMus or BAMus degree from the Bienen School of Music. This dual bachelor’s degree program prepares exceptional stu-dents for journalism careers emphasizing music and arts reporting. Prospective students typically apply to this joint program when they apply for undergraduate admission to Northwestern (see page 11). For a detailed description of the dual-degree program, see page 29 in the Cross-School Options chapter.252 Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications • Student Resources • JournalismIntegrated Marketing Communications Certificate ProgramThe Integrated Marketing Communications Certificate Program focuses on effective marketing communications strategies, tactics, and tools for an increasingly consumer-controlled environment. It prepares stu dents for entry-level marketing communi cations positions in such fields  as advertising, public relations, corporate communica-tions, and direct, database, e-commerce, and interactive marketing. Those who complete the certificate are eligible to complete the graduate IMC program in four quarters instead of five. See page 256 and the Medill website for more information. Bay Area Immersion ExperienceAt the new Northwestern educational space based in downtown San Francisco and anchored by Medill and McCormick, students learn from and contribute to the Bay Area’s entrepreneurial culture through a custom-ized immersion experience. Students who apply and are accepted into the program take 4 courses that focus on experiential learning in, and critical thinking about, areas such as design innovation, digital communication, and the intersection of technology and culture.Medill on the Hill ProgramA select group of Medill students may study for one  quarter in Medill’s Washington, DC, news bureau. These students take 2 intensive journalism electives and a politi-cal science course approved by Weinberg College.Medill on the Hill is an interdisciplinary program that exposes students to the challenging dynamics of Capitol Hill, public policy, political organizations, think tanks, and federal agencies. It is best suited to students interested in learning more about the political process and covering important national and global issues from the nation’s cap-ital in a rigorous, web-driven reporting environment.Internships, Field Studies, and Special ProgramsInternship employment may be available to Medill stu-dents, particularly during the summer. Many employ-ers look to Medill for talented journalists who can be introduced to their organizations through internships. The school encourages these oppor tunities as a means of enriching students’ education but gives academic credit only for Journalism Residency.Medill students also may seek internship or field study credit through other schools at Northwestern. If these experiences involve work in journalism (newspaper, mag a-zine, radio, television), mass communications, public rela-tions, advertising, and/or direct marketing, students must receive approval from Medill before applying internship or field study credit to the 45 units required for the BSJ degree. ROTC Course CreditsROTC course credits may be used as part of the 45 units required for graduation. They are considered elective courses.STUDENT RESOURCESAdvisingEach entering student is assigned a first-year faculty adviser and a student life adviser. Advisers offer support and guidance and are valuable sources of information regarding courses and career goals. Student life advisers help students make the most of their time at the University. They assist students with a variety of issues, including course planning, degree requirements, registration, study abroad, interschool trans-fers, petitions to graduate, and resources within and out-side Medill.Medill Career Services helps students through career advising and employment services. It works with academic departments and individual faculty members, student services, employers, alumni, and other constituencies to enhance student and alumni career development.ActivitiesThrough student publications, student broadcast media, and professional organizations, Medill students have many journalism-related opportunities outside the classroom.The Medill Undergraduate Advisory Council is com-posed of representatives from each class in Medill and serves as the link between the student body and the faculty and administration. The students serve as representatives for Medill, plan programming, and collaborate with Medill to improve the student experience. Professional organizations that promote high standards among journalists maintain chapters on campus, includ-ing the Society of Professional Journalists, the Native American Journalists Association, the National Association of Black Journalists, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, and the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association. Top scholars in the senior and graduate classes are initiated into Kappa Tau Alpha, the national journalism honor society.ACADEMIC OFFERINGSJOURNALISMmedill.northwestern.edu/bsjMajor in Journalism (45 units) All Medill students pursue a major in journalism. Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications • Journalism 253Arts and sciences requirements (17 units)Distribution requirements (12 units)• 2 units in the social and behavioral sciences• 2 units in historical studies• 1 unit in philosophy or religious studies• 2 units in literature or fine arts• 1 unit in economics or a course chosen from Medill’s approved list of “business understanding” courses• 4 units in the natural sciences, computer science, or  “formal studies” as defined by Weinberg College; at  least 1 must be in formal studies• Students should check with a Medill student life adviser about whether the courses they have chosen also meet the diverse cultures requirement.

The Bienen School of Music is a professional school within the University. Entering first-year undergraduates show highest-level achievement in academics as well as music. The school believes that by carefully developing outstanding musician-ship and keen intelligence, while nurturing a curiosity about the world, we can best encourage the emergence  of each student’s unique creative voice.All students at the Bienen School of Music are expected to grow as artists and as people. They are encouraged to explore in depth other areas of interest, drawing on the vast resources of Northwestern’s other schools, and to develop the critical thinking and communication skills  necessary for a successful career in music. Key to all degree programs is intensive one-on-one training with a celebrated faculty that includes members of the Chicago Symphony and Lyric Opera of Chicago Orchestras, internationally acclaimed soloists, sought-after  conductors, and distinguished scholars and clinicians. Stu-dents work in small classes with these dedicated teachers and artists in a curriculum that comprises music history and theory, aural and piano skills, instru mental and voice lessons, and electives. Special programs include a five-year  dual-degree curriculum—enabling students to earn a degree in music as well as one in communication, educa-tion and social policy, engineering, journalism, or arts and sciences—and the ad hoc (self-designed) degree, an option offered by no other major music school. Additionally, the world-class music making and other cultural resources of downtown Chicago provide exceptional opportunities for learning outside the classroom.Performing and research opportunities abound at Northwestern. Students may participate in 16 ensem-bles and chamber groups and have access to more than 400 performances each year, including three critically acclaimed professional series as well as master classes by inter nationally renowned performers. In addition, the school sponsors the biennial Michael Ludwig Nemmers Prize in Music Composition and the Jean Gimbel Lane Prize in Piano Performance, which regularly bring world-renowned composers and pianists to campus. Northwest-ern’s Music Library is among the nation’s largest music research collections and is distinguished internationally for its particular commitment to 20th-century and contempo-rary music, represented especially in extensive holdings of printed music, manuscripts, and archives.A Bienen School of Music education provides students with skills and values—superb musicianship, a mastery of communication, a sense of discipline, a commitment to excellence—that prepare them for success wherever their interests may lead.The Bienen School of Music is a founding member of the National Association of Schools of Music, which fully accredits all its degree programs.ACADEMIC POLICIESPrograms of StudyThe Bienen School of Music offers programs leading to the professional degrees of bachelor of music, master of music, and doctor of musical arts. The school also offers two nonprofessional degrees, the bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music. The curriculum allows flexibility for students while pro-viding an education that is basic for all musicians. Appli-cants in all areas who are accepted by the Bienen School enter directly into a program of specialization that begins in the first undergraduate year. The core studies, taken by all students, require the acquisition of minimum compe-tencies and provide fundamental and essential experiences that complement the specialized studies in the declared major. Students are also required to com plete studies in a number of allied subjects through out the University.Bachelor of MusicCourses of study leading to the bachelor of music degree include majors in piano, strings, voice, winds and percus-sion, jazz, music cognition, music composition, music education, musicology, and music theory. It is also pos-sible to design an ad hoc major as a second major that cuts across specializations to meet a particular student’s needs and career ambitions. Ad hoc majors are designed in con-sultation with faculty and Chicago-area professionals with expertise in the partic ular area of interest; specializations have included areas such as arts administration, music criti-cism, music theater production, and popular musicol ogy. For degree requirements for the bachelor of music, see below.Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Musicmusic.northwestern.edu Music • Academic Policies 259Liberal Arts Degrees in MusicThe bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music are nonperformance degrees that offer a broad liberal arts education with a major in music. The require-ments of the BAMus are essentially iden tical to those for the BA in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; the requirements for the BSMus are the same as those for the BAMus except that the BSMus has no language require-ment. Within these degrees’ focus on music, there are a wide range of possibilities for study, from cultural musicol-ogy to cognitive studies of music and from music composi-tion to advanced theory; the options also include an ad hoc specialization designed to meet a particular student’s needs and career ambitions. These degrees are an excellent  stepping-stone to further education in music or to any career for which a knowledge of music brings depth and enrichment. The curricula offer considerable latitude in designing a sequence of courses to suit the student’s inter-ests and goals. A key feature for the student is the plan-ning and execution of a senior project. For specific degree requirements, see next column.Dual Bachelor’s Degree ProgramsThe Bienen School of Music offers dual bachelor’s degree programs with the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences (music and liberal arts), the School of Communication (music and communication), the School of Education  and Social Policy (music and education and social policy), the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Sci-ence (music and engineering), and the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communica-tions (music and journalism). For information on program requirements, see the Cross-School Options chapter. For information on applying to these programs, see Applica-tion to Dual Bachelor’s Degree Programs on page 11.Degree RequirementsBachelor of Music (50–54 units)Candidates for the degree of bachelor of music must com-plete 50–54 units, depending on the minimum number of courses required for their major. The degree can usually be completed within four years. All students in the bachelor of music degree program take a core set of music require-ments (19 units of credit for all but jazz studies majors) in addition to the requirements for the individual major.• Music core requirements (19 units; 15.5 for jazz studies) ◦2 years of music theory (3 units) ◦2 years of aural skills (3 units) ◦1 year of keyboard skills (1.5 units) ◦5 courses in music history (5 units) ◦1 music studies course in 20th- or 21st-century music (1 unit) ◦1 course in conducting (1 unit) ◦1 year of ensemble (1.5 units) ◦1 year of 100-level applied study (3 units)• General education (nonmusic) (12 units; 8 units for music education) • Free electives (music or nonmusic) (0–3 units) • Major studies requirement (16–27 units)Bachelor of Arts in Music (45 units)Candidates for the degree of bachelor of arts in music must complete 45 units.• Music core requirements (10 units) ◦2 years of music theory (3 units) ◦1 year of aural skills (1.5 units) ◦4 courses in music history (4 units) ◦1 year of ensemble (1.5 units)• Additional music courses (10 units)• General education (nonmusic) (13 units)• Nonmusic electives (6 units)• Foreign language (6 units)Bachelor of Science in Music (45 units)Candidates for the degree of bachelor of science in music must complete 45 units.• Music core requirements (10 units) ◦2 years of music theory (3 units) ◦1 year of aural skills (1.5 units) ◦4 courses in music history (4 units) ◦1 year of ensemble (1.5 units)• Additional music courses (10 units)• General education (nonmusic) (13 units)• Nonmusic electives (12 units)Overlay Requirement in Business or FinanceAll Bienen School undergraduates are required to com-plete a 1-credit “overlay” requirement in business or finance. The requirement is so termed because it does not add to the existing number of courses required for under-graduate degrees; depending on which course is chosen, the course counts toward the student’s general education or free electives requirement. See the Office of Student Affairs for a list of recommended courses.Other RequirementsMusic majors must earn a grade of C or above in all courses required in the major, including all core require-ments and all specialization courses, in order to count those courses toward graduation requirements. A grade of D or above (including P grades for four-year students) may be used to fulfill distribution requirements and elec-tives. If a student receives a D in a major course, then takes that course a second time and receives a C grade or above, the initial D grade remains on the permanent record and cannot count toward elective requirements. The second (improved) grade does not replace the first, and the same course cannot be counted twice in the degree. A maximum of 6 1-credit courses in nonmusic subjects taken under 260 Music • Academic Optionsthe P/N grade option may be counted toward the degree. Music students may not take music courses under the P/N grade option, except for those courses graded solely with P/N grades.If students interrupt their program of study for an extended period of time and degree requirements are changed during this period, they will normally be held  to the new requirements.Every candidate for a degree must file a graduation petition one year in advance of the date of graduation.Students coming to Northwestern University for a sec-ond undergraduate degree must transfer at least 9 units of credit in music, audition for admission at the 300 level, complete the general education distribution requirement with transfer credit, and comply with the University’s Undergraduate Registration Requirement for transfer students.In addition to and independent of the requirements set by the Bienen School of Music, all students must satisfy the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (see page 17  in the Under grad uate Education chapter of this catalog).Applied Music StudyThe Bienen School of Music offers individual instruc-tion for majors in piano, strings, voice, winds and percus-sion, jazz, and composition. Students should consult their program coordinators for the assignment of an instruc-tor. Consent of the instructor, program coordinator, and department chair as well as concurrent registration in ensemble are required. Attendance PolicyStudents are expected to attend all sessions of courses and ensembles for which they are registered. It is the responsi-bility of students enrolled in the Bienen School of Music to acquaint themselves and comply with the attendance policy of their departments, class instructors, and ensemble con-ductors. In addition, students who are absent from classes for three or more consecutive days because of illness are required to notify the Office of Student Affairs.Outside professional opportunities may arise for music students. If such an opportunity directly interferes in any way with curricular responsibilities, students must first obtain permission from faculty of record for courses potentially affected, including classes, opera, and ensem-bles, along with the signature of the program coordinator and a signature from one of the cochairs of the Depart-ment of Music Performance.Failure to comply with these regulations can be cause for failure in the courses or ensembles for which a student is registered during that quarter.See the Cross-School Options chapter for opportunities open to all Northwestern undergraduates. ACADEMIC OPTIONSDouble MajorStudents may earn a double major in four years by fulfill-ing the requirements of both majors. Typically, the double major within the Bienen School of Music combines a spe-cialization in a performance area with one in an academic area, although double majors in two academic areas are also possible. A double major in two performance areas is generally not permitted. Four-year bachelor of music stu-dents may also complete a second major outside the music school but may earn only one bachelor’s degree. Bienen School of Music students who choose to leave the school for another school at Northwestern may still complete a music major as a second major, although in these cases no degree from the Bienen School will be awarded. Candidates for the bachelor of arts in music and bach-elor of science in music may double major with any major offered in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences but may earn only one bachelor’s degree. Candidates for bach-elor’s degrees in all Northwestern undergraduate schools other than the Bienen School may complete a second major from the Bienen School but must first successfully complete the application and audition process through the Bienen School’s admission office.Minor ProgramsThe Bienen School of Music offers minors in arts admin-istration, commercial music, general music, music cogni-tion, music composition, music criticism, music education, musicology, music technology, and music theory. Minor programs include a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 9 courses, of which a minimum of 5 courses are not double-counted toward the major. Students must receive a grade of C or above in all courses counted toward the minor; no P/N grades are allowed. Students who wish to complete a minor program should fill out a Minor Declaration Form, available in the Office of Student Affairs, and should fill out a minor petition form one year before graduation. Stu-dents may pursue more than one Bienen School of Music minor. Program HonorsEach year faculty are invited to nominate graduating stu-dents for program honors. To be eligible for program honors, students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or above and be outstanding contributors to their respective programs. Additional criteria govern the selection of voice majors; see the coordinator of the voice and opera program for details. Faculty select only a small number of students in each program for program honors in a given year; for more information, contact the Office of Student Affairs in the Bienen School of Music. Music • Student Resources • Interdepartmental Courses for Music Majors  261Graduate StudiesThe Bienen School of Music offers programs of study leading to the master of music and doctor of musical  arts degrees. Information concerning these programs is  available from the Office of Admission and Financial  Aid in the Bienen School of Music. For information about the requirements for the doctor of philosophy degree in music, contact the Graduate School.Music Studies for NonmajorsThe Bienen School of Music offers many opportunities for students registered in other schools of the University to participate in ensembles and to take courses and private lessons. For information on these options, see page 272.STUDENT RESOURCESMusical OrganizationsAs a part of their program of study, music majors are required to participate in music school ensembles. Stu-dents from all other schools of the University are encour-aged to participate in any organizations for which they qualify. Ensembles include Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, and Philharmonia; Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Concert Band, and Wildcat Marching Band; Bienen Contemporary/Early Vocal Ensemble, Uni-versity Chorale, University Singers, Alice Millar Chapel Choir, and Women’s Choir; Jazz Orchestra and jazz small ensembles; Baroque Music Ensemble and Contempo-rary Music Ensemble; Guitar Ensemble and Percussion Ensemble; and chamber music ensembles.FacilitiesThe Bienen School of Music occupies three lakefront buildings.

Students take the profes-sional program required of all music students, a structured sequence of courses in general education, a basic set of courses in music education, and special courses in the chosen music education specialization. The combination results in a program that prepares professionals with a broad understanding of music and education as well as the skills to be effective music teachers.Students in the undergraduate music education pro-gram must take all the core studies in music and all the professional studies in music education plus the general education courses required for teacher certification. They must also choose one of the three specialization tracks—instrumental, choral, or general—and take the required courses for that track. A combined track is also available for students interested in a hybrid version of the music educa-tion major; see the music education program coordinator for advising on this option. All music education majors are required to complete 100 hours of clinical observation.Major in Music EducationFor a major in music education, 25 to 27 course units are required beyond the core degree and general education requirements.• Additional applied lessons (6 units)• Additional keyboard skills (as needed by track)  (1.5–3 units)• 240, 260, and 358• 314 (4 quarters, 0 units)• Three methods courses: 361, 364, and 366• Student teaching: 380–387 (3 units)• 1 colloquium: 390 (0 units)• CO"
