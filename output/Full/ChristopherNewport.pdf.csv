Each year we welcome 1,200 new freshmen and more than 100 transfers with diverse interests and fields of study. Our students thrive on the close relationships they form with their professors. Many work with faculty on pioneering research — from wetland studies at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge to robotics at NASA to particle re-search at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.The number of admission applications has soared by more than 700 percent in the last decade, and the average SAT score for last year’s incoming freshmen (Critical Reading and Math) was 1210.  The average GPA (4.0 scale) was 3.75.  Plus, more students are seeking entry into our distinguished Honors Program and President’s Leadership Program.Christopher Newport also offers many international study opportunities, including our permanent relation-ship with the University of Oxford and dozens of smaller, faculty-led programs.

In psychology, students regularly make presentations at the top East Coast conference, where they are often mistaken for graduate students due to the quality of their work.  CNU has received top recognition from Forbes, Kip-linger’s Personal Finance and The Princeton Review orga-nization.

The University derives its name from Captain Christopher Newport, the English mariner who was among the most important men connected with the permanent settling of Virginia. It was Captain Newport who was put in sole charge and command of the small squadron of three ships that made the historic voy-age, culminating with the landing at Jamestown in 1607. Christopher Newport University became a four-year, baccalaureate-degree-granting institution in 1971 and, in July 1977, became totally independent from The College of William and Mary. The University began offering graduate programs in July 1991. The University first enrolled 171 students in September 1961 at its initial home, a former public school building in downtown Newport News, provided through the generosity of the city of Newport News and its school board. In 1963, the city of Newport News purchased and deeded to the Commonwealth the 75-acre tract where the present campus is now located.The University derives its financial support from the Virginia General Assembly and from the tuition and fees paid by its students. The affairs of the University are directed by the Board of Visitors of Christopher Newport University, appointed by the governor of Virginia. The president of the University, appointed by the Board of Visitors, is the delegated authority over the administration and the courses of instruction. University presidentsH.

Space in each class is reserved for the best-qualified applicants.  Selection for admission is also dependent on a student’s preparation for their intended field of study.  To be considered for transfer admission, priority is focused on those students presenting a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.00 GPA, 15 hours of college level credit, and completion of one class in college level mathematics and a college level English course. Transfer Enrollment staff carefully review all application materials and inform applicants of the admission decision.  In addition to weighing grades and test scores, the Transfer Enrollment staff may consider co-curricular activities, community involvement, letters of recommendation, and the applicant’s educational and career objectives.  (Note: Priority is granted to those applicants presenting a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 from each college attended.)  Transfer applicants must: 1. Maintain good academic and disciplinary standing and be eligible to return to the last college or university attended.2. Submit the Common Application online which includes an online essay.3. Submit the non-refundable application fee (fee-waiver not applicable).4. Submit official college transcript(s) from all colleges and/or universities attended by the stated application/credential deadline to the Office of the Registrar. Transfer Enrollment accepts electronic college transcripts through Parchment. (Partial transcripts or grade reports are encouraged for those applicants who are still in attendance at their current college).5. Submit official high school transcripts regardless of the graduation year. (Home-schooled applicants must submit the Common Application School Report form and a detailed description of curriculum.  See Transfer Enrollment website for details.) 6. Submit one letter of recommendation through the Common Application. (Two or more are welcome and may be faxed, scanned or mailed).7. Submit Transfer College Report (Verification of Enrollment Form) certified by each college attended.Recommended Actions1.   Submit SAT/ACT test results if graduation from  high school was five years ago or less. 2.   Schedule an interview with Transfer Enrollment Staff. Interviews are not mandatory but they are highly rec-ommended. Degree Completion RequirementTo receive a baccalaureate degree, transfer students must complete at least 45 semester hours of credit in residence at CNU.Documents Required for Transfer Applicants   1. Transfer applicants must request that all colleges previously attended submit official transcripts and the Transfer College Report (Verification of Enrollment Form) certified by each college attended to the Office 16admission,transfer, readmitted and non-degree                                    2018-2019 of the Registrar. Transfer applicants who are enrolled elsewhere when they apply may be conditionally admitted upon review of a partial transcript; however, a final offer of admission will not be made without an official final transcript and the final Transfer College Report. If a conditional offer of admission was made based on an unofficial transcript, and the official transcript indicates a lower GPA or grades below C, or the conditional decision was made without the final Transfer College Report and the final Transfer College Report indicates code of conduct concerns the university reserves the right to rescind any offer of conditional admission and cancel registration.  Once an offer of admission is made, please realize that the applicant is expected to maintain full-time enrollment (12 credit hours) each term.2. Concealment of previous attendance at another college or university is cause for cancellation of the student’s admission and registration.  New transfer or readmission applicants who have been suspended or placed on academic probation from Christopher Newport University or any college or university for non-academic, social, or disciplinary reasons may be denied admission to the University.  If offered admission, should CNU learn of conduct that would violate CNU conduct standards, the Transfer Enrollment Admission Committee will reconsider the admission decision and may withdraw the offer.Transfer CreditTransfer Enrollment evaluates credit for applicants transferring from another college or university.  Upon completion of transfer evaluation, a summary of transferable credits is posted to the student’s web-based account called CNU Live, available by logging into ‘CNU Connect’ link on CNU’s homepage.  This is posted after the student is admitted to the University within the following guidelines:1. A maximum of 92 semester hours of transfer credit will be granted for courses which carry a grade of C or higher and which are comparable to courses offered by Christopher Newport University.  Be advised that the minimum grade of C is not appealable.2. Of the allowable total of 92 semester hours of transfer credit, no more than 66 semester hours of transfer credit will be granted for junior or community college courses that carry a grade of C or higher. Be advised that the minimum grade of C is not appealable.3. A maximum of 60 semester hours of credit, referred to as transfer credit, will be granted for work completed through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), the College Entrance Examination Board Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program. (Note: with the exception of the portfolio accompanying certain AP scores, CNU does not typically award credit based on the presentation of a student portfolios.)4. Unless otherwise authorized by Transfer Enrollment, all transfer students, including students who already hold baccalaureate degrees, will have the maximum allowable number of credits transferred and recorded on their CNU academic records.  When the number of transferable credits previously earned exceeds the maximum allowable credit, the choice of credits to be transferred will be determined by the Director of Transfer Enrollment. 5. Grades from other colleges/universities do not transfer into the student’s GPA at CNU.  Only the course and credits are posted from previous colleges to the CNU transcript. Credit for developmental, remedial, and activity courses do not transfer to CNU.6. Transfer credit policies pertaining to prior service in the Armed Services of the United States, the Community College of the Air Force and the ACE Guide are posted at cnu.edu/registrar/transfer/.Readmission to the UniversityStudents must apply for readmission if they do not enroll for two consecutive regular semesters (fall and spring).  All academic records are considered, including work completed during the student’s absence from CNU.  Competitive admission standards in effect at the time of readmission are used.  Readmission applicants must submit the Common Application online with the non-refundable application fee.  The application/credential deadline for the fall semester is March 1 and November 1 for the spring semester.Students who left the University while not in good academic standing are referred to the Suspension and Reinstatement Procedure section of this catalog.  Please note that an academically suspended student who has not reenrolled for two consecutive regular semesters (fall and spring) must be readmitted prior to seeking a Second Chance Contract.Degree seeking students who leave the University for a period of one full academic year or more must be readmitted and will be required to meet all liberal learning curriculum, major, minor and concentration requirements that are in effect (per the Undergraduate Catalog) when they are readmitted to Christopher Newport University.Non-degree AdmissionStudents who do not wish to seek a degree or are taking classes for career enhancement or personal growth,  may earn academic credit as a part-time student in the same way as degree-seeking students.  Please note that all academic and administrative policies also apply to non-degree seeking students.  Financial aid is not available and prerequisites must be met for individual courses. The application/credential deadline for the fall semester is March 1 and November 1 17for the spring semester.Categories of Non-degree students1. Students who, at the time they enroll, do not wish to pursue a degree program.2. Students who wish to take a course for personal enrichment or to explore the possibility of pursuing a degree at a later time.3. Students who want to earn academic credit applicable to a degree at another college or university.4. CNU employees using tuition waiver.Non-Degree Admission RequirementsNon-degree applications for all individuals, including applicants under the Senior Citizen’s Higher Education Act of 1974, will be considered complete and ready for review once we have received all of the following information listed below:1. Applicants in this category must complete the Non-Degree Application, pay the $65 application fee (non-refundable-see undergraduate general fees), and submit official high school transcript, official transcripts  from all colleges and universities attended, and submit the Transfer College Report verification from all colleges and universities attended.

Past academic credentials from high school and college will be reviewed and regular admission standards will apply.4. Applicants must have met all prerequisites for courses in which they wish to enroll.2018-2019                      admission, transfer, readmit and non-degree 18Student Accounts and Cash Services Office Hours:Monday - Friday:  8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.TUITION, FEES AND FINANCIAL INFORMATIONCurrent tuition and fees can be found on the CNU Busi-ness Office website at: cnu.edu/tuition. Tuition, fees, and room and board rates are determined annually and approved by the Board of Visitors in May for the following academic year.  Current rates and information can be found on the CNU Business Office website at  cnu.edu/tuition.Interpretation of matters concerning fees is the respon-sibility of the Executive Vice President. The President of Christopher Newport University has final authority in the interpretation.TuitionUndergraduate students who have registered for 12 to 17 credit hours will be defined as full-time students and will qualify for the full-time rate. Any combination of credit courses and audit courses satisfies the 12-credit-hour minimum for eligibility for the full-time rates.  The full-time rate only applies to fall and spring terms.  The full-time rate does not apply to registration for other terms even though the student may be registered for more than 12 credit hours during those terms. Students who register for more than 17 credit hours will be charged the full-time rate plus the appropriate per-credit-hour rate for each additional hour above 17 credit hours. Tuition payments for students who register for fewer than 12 credit hours are based on a charge for each credit hour of instruction. The tuition and fees for auditing a course are the same as the tuition and fees for taking a course for credit. Room and BoardStudents, who reside in University Housing and have a meal plan, will be billed the current room and board rates as approved by the Board of Visitors.  Cur-rent room and board rates can be found on the Hous-ing website at cnu.edu/life/housing/roomandboard.Tuition SurchargeBeginning in 2006, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted legislation to place a limitation on student’s eligibil-ity for in-state tuition.  Upon completion of 125 percent of the credit hours required to obtain a degree in the student’s program, the student may be assessed a surcharge which is equivalent to the cost of tuition at the out-of-state rate.  Please note that certain courses and credit hours maybe excluded from the 125 percent calculations.Students who have or will have earned 145 or more credit hours should contact the Office of the Registrar for more information.  Impacted students may appeal to the Of-fice of the Registrar for a waiver as provided by the Code of Virginia, Section 23-7.4.General Fees • Current fees can be found on the CNU Business Office website at: cnu.edu/tuition. • Students who wish to be admitted to the University must pay an application fee. This fee is non-refund-able and may not be applied to other fees. If the fee is paid with the initial application for admission but the student does not enroll in the term for which he or she originally applied, it may be carried forward only to the next term. The fee does not apply to continuing education courses. • A non-refundable applied music instruction fee is charged per one credit hour course. • A laboratory fee is assessed on specific courses.• A non-refundable orientation fee is required for all entering freshman and transfer students.• A late fee penalty is charged for additional charges and balances billed and not paid by the applicable payment deadline.• A parking fee is charged per academic year.• A returned check fee is charged for each returned check.• A study abroad fee is required on specified courses.Schedule Changes (Add/Drop) The amount of tuition and fees will not increase if a full-time student (taking at least 12 credit hours) increases his or her academic workload to no more than 17 credit hours unless the course added requires an additional fee. If a full-time student (taking at least 12 credit hours) decreases his or her academic workload to fewer than 12 credit hours, eligibility for the full-time tuition rate is voided; and tuition and fees will be adjusted to the per-credit-hour rates.

A part-time student who increases his or her academic workload to 12 to 17 credit hours will be eligible for the full-time rate, and the student’s account will be adjusted accordingly. Schedule changes that result in additional charges are due by the payment due date.  If this date has passed, then payment is due in full on the date the course is added. Students who are using the semester payment plan and who add/drop a course or courses may increase or reduce their payment schedules. Students should contact Student Accounts directly to take this action. For students who plan to or are receiving financial aid, course-load reductions and additions can affect the amount of financial aid awarded to them. This is particu-larly true if a course reduction results in a full-time student becoming a part-time student. Students will be responsible for any charges remaining after a course-load change, and any amount due as a refund under the University’s policy may be refunded directly to the financial aid grantor, rather than to the student, if the rules of the grantor so require. If a student receives a financial aid award and must decrease his or her academic workload to less than 12 credit hours, he or she should contact the Office of Financial Aid, telephone (757) 594-7170.

Fall bills are posted online in July and payment is due in August.  Spring bills are posted in December and are due in January.  It is the student’s re-sponsibility to contact the Office of Student Accounts if they are having a problem accessing their bill. Failure to receive a bill does not waive the student from any financial penalties. For registrations, schedule adjustments, housing and meal plan assignments taking place after early registration and the initial billing, payment is due by the payment due date.  If this date has passed, payment is due in full on the date of the change.  It is the student’s responsibility to pay all charges by the payment due date each term.  Please visit our website: cnu.edu/tuition for additional information and due dates.   Payments 1. You may view and pay your bill online through your CNU Live account.  2. Payment may also be made at the Cashier’s Office with cash, money order, or check, payable to Christopher Newport University.  The Cashier’s Office is located on the first floor of Christopher Newport Hall.3. Money order or check, payable to Christopher Newport University can be mailed to Christopher Newport Uni-versity, Attn: Cashier’s Office, 1 Avenue of the Arts, Newport News, VA  23606-3072.Students may also pay their tuition bills to the University through a monthly payment program, discussed later in this publication. Please take careful note of the following:1. Students who owe the University any charges accrued from previous terms (i.e., tuition, room-and-board, parking fines, library fines, etc.) are required to pay these charges before being permitted to register or access grades. 2. Students who are receiving any form of tuition assistance must provide the Office of Student Accounts with properly approved tuition assistance forms and pay any balance by the payment due date or a late payment fee will be assessed. 3. Students who are receiving any form of financial aid must have accepted the aid, prior to the payment due date. Deferments will be for only the amount of the award, excluding work-study, and students are required to pay any balance by the payment due date. (Deferments do not apply to private alternative loan programs.)  If a financial aid recipient chooses to withdraw from classes, they must complete the appropriate forms with the University Registrar. See Tuition Refund Policy below for withdrawal deadlines. Students may also be liable to repay any financial aid disbursed if the semester is not successfully completed.  Late financial aid applicants must be prepared to meet the tuition obligation through means other than financial aid by the payment due date.   4. The University may, at its sole discretion, cancel a student’s registration for failure to meet financial obligations at any time.  Questions concerning financial policy and payment of tuition and fees should be directed to the Office of Student Accounts, located on the first floor of Christopher Newport Hall, telephone (757) (757) 594-7195.2018-2019                       tUition and fees20Payment Policy Tuition and fees are considered fully earned and are due at the time of registration or no later than the payment due date established for each term. Tuition payment may be mailed if received in the University Business Office by the payment due date. Postmark date does not apply.  You may also pay online with an eCheck (no fee) or credit card: VISA, American Express, Discover and Mastercard (a convenience fee applies with credit card use).In the fall and spring terms, at 5:00 p.m. on the pay-ment due date, or any date thereafter, the University may cancel the registration for all students who have not made financial arrangements. These students may register again during scheduled registration periods.  The University does not guarantee that students will be able to obtain their original schedules. Classes are available on a first-come, first-served basis.  Monthly Payment Plan Students may select to use the monthly payment plan and must sign up separately for each semester.  This pay-ment option allows payment of tuition and fees in monthly installments. When determining the amount to budget, please consider tuition and fees, applied music fees, lab fees, and room and board (if applicable). This plan may be used by full-time or part-time students. Information concerning this plan may be obtained on our website at cnu.edu/businessoffice/payment, or by calling (757) 594-7582. Students are encouraged to apply for the plan as soon as possible, since late application for the plan requires a larger down payment. Students who have applied for and receive financial aid may participate in the monthly tuition payment plan.  The University assesses a late payment fee for each payment that is made late. This fee is payable directly to the University.Tuition Refund Policy If the University cancels a course for which a student has registered, the student is entitled to a full refund for that cancelled course. Please note that refunds will not be issued for any fee which is listed in the University Catalog  as a non-refundable fee, unless the course is cancelled by the University. Tuition and comprehensive fees will be refunded for Fall and Spring terms in accordance with the following policy: •	100 percent for all courses dropped through the end of the first week of  the academic term or for any course which is cancelled by the University. •	75 percent for all courses withdrawn from during the second week of the academic term.•	50 percent for all courses withdrawn from during the third and fourth week of the academic term, after which time there shall be no refund. Federal financial aid recipients who totally withdraw from the University will have their refund processed in ac-cordance with federal regulations. These laws provide for a prorated refund if a student totally withdraws before the academic term is complete. These funds may be refunded to the financial aid grantor, if the rules of the grantor so require.   Applied music fees are not refundable after the first day of scheduled lessons with the instructor. For students receiving financial aid or tuition assis-tance, funds received from these programs are applied to the student’s account, as received, until the entire financial obligation to the University is satisfied. Refunds are made to the student from the last funds received, if the student’s account is overpaid. Students must drop or withdraw from courses on or before the deadlines listed above in order to be eligible for a refund. Students who are participating in the semester tuition payment budgeting plan and whose payments received by the University exceed the amount owed in accordance with the policy listed above will receive a direct refund from the University. All refunds will be processed in accordance with the above policy. If there are extenuating circumstances (such as mandatory job transfer or active duty military mobiliza-tion from the Hampton Roads area documented by a letter from the employer and/or a copy of military orders or an extended period of inpatient hospitalization documented by a physician’s statement, students should contact the Office of Student Accounts, located on the first floor of Christopher Newport Hall, telephone (757) 594-7195, to obtain a tuition refund appeal form. Notification of the final decision will be made within two weeks of the date the appeal is filed. Please be aware that students are held individually re-sponsible for the information contained in the Christopher Newport University Catalog. Failure to read and comply with University regulations will not exempt students from financial penalties.  Any appeal filed after the term will be denied regardless of the circumstances. Returned Checks A returned check fee will be assessed for all checks returned from the bank to the University for any reason.  An individual has seven (7) calendar days to repay the amount of the check and the returned check fee. If a check for tu-ition and fees is returned to the University from the bank for any reason a late payment fee will be assessed in addition to the returned check fee. If the student does not repay the total amount due within seven (7) calendar days, his or her registration will be cancelled. If the University receives two non-sufficient fund checks or eChecks from a student, the University will no longer accept checks or eChecks from the student or on the student’s behalf. tUition and fees 2018-2019 21Cashing of Student Checks The Business Office will cash checks up to $25.00. Checks should be made payable to Cash. Under regula-tions governing state-supported agencies, the University is not permitted to cash checks made payable to Christopher Newport University.  A returned check fee is charged for each check returned for insufficient funds. If an individual has a check returned a second time, the University will revoke all check-cashing privileges. The University will not cash a check for an individual who owes a debt to the University. Delinquent Financial Obligations Students who have outstanding financial obligations to the University (to include tuition and fees, room and board, parking fees and fines, library fees and fines, checks returned for non-sufficient funds, etc.) will be refused all services to the University until these financial obligations have been paid in full. Students will not be permitted to register for subsequent terms, grades will be held, and the University will not issue official transcripts. This also will apply to students who retain property that belongs to the University. If a student’s financial account becomes delinquent, the University charges a late payment penalty and administrative fee. The University may turn the account over to a third-party collection agency or credit bureau, the Department of Taxation, and the Attorney General’s Office. The University is permitted under Virginia Law to attach Virginia State income tax refunds or lottery winnings in repayment of any debt which is owed to the University. In the event an account becomes delinquent, the student is responsible for all admin-istrative costs, collection fees, based on the percentage stated in the collection agency contract in effect, and attorney’s fees incurred in the collection of funds owed to the University. Incidental Expenses It is impossible to estimate the exact costs of clothing, travel, and other incidental expenses which the student incurs, for these are governed largely by the habits of the individual. The cost of books depends on the courses taken. Money for textbooks cannot be included in checks covering tuition and fees. Senior Citizens The 1989 session of the Virginia General Assembly amended and reenacted the Senior Citizen’s Higher Educa-tion Act of 1974. Senior citizens are permitted to register and enroll in courses as full-time or part-time students for academic credit, without charge, providing taxable income for federal income tax purposes did not exceed $23,850 (ef-fective July 1, 2015) for the year preceding the enrollment year. Senior citizens may also, without charge, enroll in academic credit courses for audit purposes and in non-credit courses offered by the University without regard to income. They will, however, be required to pay applied music fees and laboratory fees for any course for which such a fee is applicable. Senior citizens must meet the applicable Uni-versity admission requirements to participate in this waiver program, and the determination of the University’s ability to offer a selected course is at the discretion of the University. The law passed by the General Assembly in the 1988 session requires the State Council of Higher Education to establish procedures to ensure that tuition-paying students are accommodated in courses before senior citizens participating in this program are enrolled. In the case of eligible senior citizens who have completed 75 percent of the requirements towards a degree, the University is authorized to make indi-vidual exceptions to such procedures as may be established by the Council of Higher Education. Under this program, the categorization of senior citizen applies to those whose 60th birthday falls before the registra-tion term and who have been a legal domiciliary of Virginia for one year. No limit is placed on the number of terms a senior citizen who is not enrolled for academic credit may register for courses, but the individual can take no more than three non-credit courses in any one term. The law places no restriction on the number of courses that may be taken for credit in any term or on the number of terms in which an eligible senior citizen may take courses for credit. The continuing education program welcomes the participation of senior citizens with the understanding that their registration is contingent on a minimum number of paying students to allow the course’s formation. Forms to request the senior citizen tuition waiver are available in the Office of Student Accounts, located on the first floor of Christopher Newport Hall, and must be com-pleted for each academic term. Classification as an In-State Student All students claiming entitlement to in-state educational privileges, including in-state tuition rates, must demonstrate eligibility in accordance with the provisions of Section 23-7.4 of the Code of Virginia. Applicants for admission who believe they qualify for in-state educational privileges must complete the Residency section of the Common Application (online). Freshman applicants should direct questions to the Office of Admission, while transfer and readmit applicant questions are directed to the Office of Transfer Enrollment.  Continuing undergraduate students who believe that changes subsequent to their initial enrollment justify a reclas-sification of domiciliary status may complete the Application for Reclassification for Virginia In-State Rates form and return it to the Office of Transfer Enrollment. Procedure Upon receipt in the Office of Admission, the Application for Virginia In-State Tuition Rates form will be reviewed by a staff member for an initial determination. If the staff member disagrees with the student’s own determination for in-state privileges, the student will be contacted immediately and given an explanation of the determination. 2018-2019                     tUition and fees22Procedure Upon receipt in the Office of Admission, the Application for Virginia In-State Tuition Rates form will be reviewed by a staff member for an initial determination. If the staff member disagrees with the student’s own determination for in-state privileges, the student will be contacted immediately and given an explanation of the determination.

Some even move on to compete in regional and national tournaments. The more recreational clubs exist to allow students the opportunity to learn a sport or continue to develop skills they already possess. For more information about the specific clubs on campus, you can view their Compass pages via cnu.edu.OAR provides adventure trips for students, faculty and staff as well as special events and workshops to enhance the CNU community’s outdoor experiences.  Through fun, physical, and mental challenges, OAR provides leadership and learning opportunities and furthers the interest and passion of outdoor recreation and environmental awareness.  PhilosophyEach of the program areas strives to fulfill the campus recreation needs of current CNU students, faculty and staff.  Through engagement in the various activities and events sponsored by the Office of Recreational Services, it is hoped that participants will learn and begin to practice life-long health habits. In addition, through engagement in these activities, the Office of Recreational Services provides an opportunity for leadership and learning; opportunities to develop social contacts and lasting relationships; and opportunities for individual development through various recreational activities. Participation in Intramural SportsParticipation in intramural sports is open to currently enrolled CNU students as well as faculty, and staff employed by the University (full-time and/or part-time only; volunteers not accepted). CNU alumni and spouses of CNU students, faculty or staff are not allowed to participate in intramural sports.Participation in Sport ClubsSport clubs are open to all activity fee paying students. Faculty and staff may participate in a sport club during practices but not during competition. Previous experience is not a prerequisite for membership. Sport clubs may be competitive in nature or may be administered for their socio-recreational elements.  Clubs must accommodate any interested parties and work to maintain a balance among the more proficient participant and the novice. Unlike varsity sports, sport clubs are run by students for students. 31Student Affairs represents a comprehensive and complementary educational experience led by the Vice President of Student Affairs. Professional staff members  work in Orientation and Student Engagement; the President’s Leadership Program; Diversity Initiatives; the Office of Residence Life; the James C. Windsor Center for Health and Counseling Services; the Office of Student Activities, which includes Greek Life; the Center for Honor Enrichment and Community Standards (CHECS); and University Police. Student Affairs is also a starting point for students with qualified disabilities.  These areas work collaboratively to support the academic mission of the University, facilitate students’ success and engagement, provide enrichment, and foster the opportunity to interact socially in several hundred activities offered annually.Orientation activities help new students successfully transition to college life. The Setting Sail, Changing Tides and Welcome Week programs are required of all new students, providing guidance and insight into life as a CNU Captain. Closely connected to the Orientation program are our efforts at engaging students. Student Engagement provides meaningful and developmental opportunities that supplement what students learn in the classroom, engage them in leadership outside the classroom, and empower them to serve the community. University Fellows work directly with students seeking additional support or opportunities to become active and engaged members of Christopher Newport University.The President’s Leadership Program (PLP) is a four year leadership education experience that empowers students to recognize their leadership potential and develop personal responsibility for the betterment of self and society. PLP uses a developmenal framework to structure out of class experiences through distinct yet interdependent areas of focus. The framework serves as an integrated approach that engages students in the development of personal and social responsibility. Diversity Initiatives are designed to support students from diverse backgrounds by promoting an environment that fosters cultural understanding and an inclusive campus community. This support includes educational, cultural and social opportunities for diverse interactions and cultural education that enhances student awareness, understanding, and appreciation f165or diversity.The Office of Residence Life (ORL) cultivates a campus living environment which supports residents as they transition towards independence.  Our progressive housing model systematically moves students from halls with a focus on interpersonal skills and community development through halls with a focus on personal ownership and community contribution.The James C. Windsor Center for Health and Counseling Services  facilitates students’ personal exploration to assist them in being successful in their endeavors at CNU.  Students can access basic medical support through the Health & Wellness Clinic, where services range from healthy living assessments to prescribing medication. Student focused group and individual short term counseling is available to any student in need of assistance through the Office of Counseling Services.  The Office of Student Activities (OSA) sponsors a variety of social and educational events tailored to the needs and desires of CNU students.  These programs, many of which are jointly operated with one of the over 200 clubs and organizations on campus, have included major concerts, dynamic leadership speakers, popular comedians, and annual festivals and activities.Greek Life works closely with the social fraternities and sororities as well as the historically African-American Greek-letter organizations to provide a meaningful educational, service and social experience for students. Approximately 30 percent of CNU students join one of the eight fraternities, seven sororities or five historically African American Greek-letter organizations.The Center for Honor Enrichment and Community Standards facilitates the integration of honorable living into the campus community and the lives of our community members.  CHECS upholds the community standards of the university by working closely with the students responsible for administering the student-led Honor Council.  The Center accomplishes these tasks through educational programming and the adjudication of violations to the Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct. Of primary importance is the Honors Convocation, which formally welcomes new students to CNU through the signing of the Honor Code.Safety and security are an important element of the Christopher Newport experience. Through a community policing model which includes 20 sworn officers as well as security and communication staff, University Police provides a safe environment  in which students can focus on the rich academic and co-curricular experiences available to them. Students with disabilities may seek support and services through Student Affairs.  Through accommodations received from the university, students with disabilities are provided the opportunity to access educational programs and services in support of their learning efforts.stUdent affairsDr. Kevin M.

Advisors work with students in their transition from high school to college, throughout their college career, and as they plan post-graduate lives.Faculty and students work closely together in the advising process, and share the common goal of fostering  student success within our university environment. Responsibilities of Academic Advisors Academic advising is critical to a liberal arts education at CNU.  The academic advising system must:1. Encourage students to take responsibility for their own education planning.2. Recognize the unique nature and interests of each student.3. Provide timely, accurate advising that serves all constituents.4. Offer resources for students, including what they need to meet major and graduation requirements and advice regarding internships, service learning, study abroad, and research that will enhance their liberal arts education.5. Foster professional relationships among students and faculty beyond the classroom.6. Help students explore and serve within and beyond the University through study abroad, civic engagement, postgraduate education, and career planning. Responsibilities of StudentsStudents at CNU shall recognize the advising process as an essential aspect of their liberal arts education. During the advising process students must:1. Take responsibility for their own educational planning by actively engaging in the advising process.2. Maintain an open line of communication with their advisor.3. Be knowledgeable about Christopher Newport University’s academic policies, procedures, and requirements.4. Arrive at each advising appointment promptly and prepared with questions and thoughts about what is to be discussed during the appointment.5. Recognize that advisors provide guidance and support throughout the advising process, however, the final decisions ultimately belong to the student.6. Engage in the contemplation and clarification of honor, personal values, and goals; this includes reflecting on what they aspire to accomplish with their liberal arts education within and beyond the University.Faculty Core AdvisorFirst-year freshmen at Christopher Newport University work with a Faculty Core Advisor (FCA) who will remain the student’s advisor for the first two years (while the student pursues the University Core Requirements and major prerequisites) even if the student changes his/her area of academic interest.  This means that all students will have a stable faculty advisor to support them during the first two years of study.  FCAs will assist students in their transition from high school to college, facilitate and encourage students’  intellectual exploration, assist students in curricular decisions, and encourage students to become active members of the University community.  Major AdvisorIn the second semester of their sophomore year, students will declare their major at Sophomore Signing Day, and at that time, a major advisor from the department will be assigned to the student.  Major advisors engage students in the selection of courses, long range academic planning, potential graduate study and career opportunities, research experiences, summer institutes and study abroad possibilities. Major advisors assist students in achieving successful completion of their CNU experience and transitioning into their post-graduate endeavors, including graduate school and/or career opportunities.Pre-Law or Pre-Health AdvisingLike most colleges and universities, CNU does not offer a pre-law or pre-med major, but specialized advising is in place that can help students plan their curricular and co-curricular experiences in preparation for a competitive application to law school, medical school or other health professional programs.

New students, especially those who received accommodations in high school or other post-secondary institutions, will want to contact the office well before beginning their first semester  at CNU if services are required. Students who request accommodations by the University must formally declare their disability by completing a form obtained from Student Affairs and providing appropriate supporting documentation. Consultation with the staff is always available and encouraged as an interactive process in determining accommodations and helps to identify the specific needs of individual students. There are core elements to the liberal arts experience that are essential to a Christopher Newport University education.  To graduate from Christopher Newport University, all students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in logical reasoning through abstract thinking, written communication literacy, second language literacy, mathematical literacy, and economical modeling and analysis. As essential elements of the University curriculum these requirements cannot be waived.  However, students whose disabilities present challenges in these areas will be reasonably accommodated in their efforts at meeting these requirements.  Questions about accommodations in these areas, as well as any essential elements required by a faculty member for a particular class,  may be directed to Student Affairs for assistance. In order to determine needs and provide the best services possible, students must submit recent documentation concerning their disability. The documentation must normally be no more than three years old, but this can vary depending on the circumstances of each case. Such documentation must be provided in writing from a qualified professional source. It should include the test (instruments) used with scores, subset scores and suggestions for possible accommodations as they relate to the diagnosed disability to enhance student access to the programs and activities of the University.  Documentation should be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs. Evaluation information concerning a student’s disability is private.  Such information will be provided to instructional faculty or staff members only when they have a legitimate “need to know” or at the request of the student.

It serves as reflectors of our society and social prescriptions for what is “normal” in various contexts. This course will utilize feature film, scholarly readings, discussion, and writing to allow us to better understand how film both reflects and affects how we think about communication in various contexts. Course materials will vary based on the interests and expertise of the instructor, may focus on family dynamics, friendship, science, health, science fiction, and religious rhetoric.

Health communication research seeks to understand ways communication affects (and is affected by) health, how communication can be used to make us healthy, how communication can affect health decision making and how communication in health and medical settings can affect the goals of health care professions. This class will cover a history of health and an overview of the field of health communication, and pay particular attention to the importance of health communication research in today’s society..The biopsychosocial approach to investigating health communication requires rigorous scientific examination of the biological, psychological and social antecedents and consequents of human communication. In order to understand how social behavior correlates with health, we must understand how biology functions to help us produce, contextualize and interpret communication, and how communication can in turn, affect physiology. This 99course explores the basic anatomy and physiology of the human body including: the brain, nervous system, immune system, endocrine system, cardiovascular system and facial musculature. The remainder of the semester applies this information in context by looking at topics such as human attraction and sexual behavior..This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to studying close relationships. The course starts with an overview of what relationships are, and then follows the trajectory of relationship development and deterioration.

Topics include sound (phonetics/phonology), word parts (morphology), word orders (syntax), meaning (semantics/pragmatics), language acquisition (psycholinguistics) and dialects (sociolinguistics)..In this course we will study the history of the English language, using primary texts ranging from some of the earliest records to our own speech. We will consider some of the changes in the orthography, phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon of the language that have occurred in the last thousand or so years. We will also consider the social, cultural, historical and linguistic forces which might have motivated those changes. .This course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to explore the ways in which literary texts interact inside their particular social, cultural, and political contexts. Because literature is not produced in a vacuum but instead records, promotes, interrogates, or critiques the dominant discourses of its culture, students in the course will examine the political, social, and/or cultural contexts of selected works in order to more fully understand the concerns of the text, the author, and the society that produced them both. Specific topics will vary by instructor..An exploration of the theme of coming to age in adolescent literature as expressed in a representative sample of genres for young adults: historical fiction, contemporary realistic fiction, fantasy, and poetry.

Course offerings may range widely across history, regions, cultural and literary traditions, or focus more narrowly on the literary works produced over time in a particular region of the world by distinct cultural and language traditions. .This course examines representations of otherness, difference, dissimilarity and hybridity in literature and film. It explores how humans tend to identify themselves in relation to others (often via principles of inclusion and exclusion, similarity and difference), and interrogates the power structures and negative connotations embedded in and necessitated by the idea of a norm. In literature, ethnic, cultural, social, sexual or physical alterity is often projected onto a sometimes monstrous “other,” who may be feared, familiar, rejected, desired, uncanny, victimized, or sympathetic. Themes and subjects may range from historical depictions of cultural contact, slavery, and marginalization to speculative representations of vampires, werewolves, or mutants.  with a C- or higher.This course presents students with the chance to learn and practice communicating persuasively, intelligently, and compassionately about our contemporary environmental challenges to different audiences with sometimes competing interests and desires.

In this course students will read pre- and post-contact Native American literatures, Spanish epics and travel narratives, as well as the literature of British and African America, Puritans, Southern colonial adventurers and slaves. The course will  explore the ways in which American identity has always been a contested space for three distinct groups of “early Americans”: African, European and Native Americans. The class will focus on literary texts but will also utilize the important work of cultural historians of early America.2018-2019                      english112.Financial booms, busts, and bubbles have transformed the United States from an agrarian land to a consumer society. Between the Civil War and World War II, American authors responded to these financial gyrations, revealing how economic forces shaped our concept of nation, class, gender and race. Reading works by authors, such as Mark Twain, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Edith Wharton, Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Steinbeck, students will analyze financial fictions and the ways in which wealth, poverty, urbanization and consumption affect individuals and bring into existence new social institutions and new aesthetic forms: realism, naturalism and mass media..What do the novels of Kurt Vonnegut, the short stories of Ursula Le Guin, the poetry of John Ashbery, the film Memento, the art of Andy Warhol and the buildings of Michael Graves have in common? All have been called “postmodern.” Using meta-narrative, pop culture, humor, parody, temporal dislocation and pastiche, postmodern artists depict a pluralistic society. This course will explore how American postmodern works continue the experimentation of modernism but also question its assumptions. In papers and presentations, students will have an opportunity to explore these postmodern trends throughout our culture, in literature, film, art and other media..This course is designed to introduce students to key issues, themes, and methods in African-American Studies as well as encourage further study of the discipline. Students will read texts in a range of genres spanning three centuries, attain a foundation in African-American tradition, and gain some sense of how African-American writers addressed issues of race, gender, nation, slavery and citizenship. Students will use the readings as entry points into a discussion of the historical period and cultural moment, which informed their creation.  .This course will examine how African-Americans have been portrayed and/or erased on the American stage. By looking at works from a variety of periods and performance stances, students will explore what constitutes an effective representation and an offensive representation. Students will also consider if representation is a method of empowerment or oppression. Some playwrights read might include Tyler Perry, Samuel Arnold and George Colman, Lorraine Hansberry, August Wilson, Ridgely Torrence or Suzan-Lori Parks. with a C- or higher.

Poetry writing tackles not just the big questions of being human but also the smaller mundane aspects of existence. To write poetry often means to take the familiar and the ordinary, both words and experiences, and make them strange, exciting, engaging. Students will read published poets and student drafts to explore and learn poetic techniques and become stronger poets and writers through workshop critiques and revisions.  with a C- or higher. This course introduces the principles, theories, and practices of writing for various professional situations. Clearly and effectively communicating ideas, in both written and oral forms, is a powerful skill in today’s workplace, and one beneficial for all majors. Communication changes frequently across fields and disciplines, making it necessary for professionals to become adaptable writers and readers of many documents, in all mediums. Thus, this course includes such professional genres as memos, letters, proposals, abstracts, reports, resumes, supporting documentation, tables, graphs, and figures. The course also requires students to adapt written material into an oral presentation.  This course partially satisfies the writing intensive requirement.  with a C- or higher.This course introduces students to critical methods for interpreting film and writing about film.

While the course will focus on the literature of key historical movements, like the Protestant Reformation and English Civil Wars, it will also explore texts relating to Britain’s increased global explorations and expansions. and either .The tension between Romanticism and Realism reflects the dynamic formation of modern society in the nineteenth century, as Romantic writers such as William Wordsworth and Mary Shelley radically reenvision the ideal relationships among humankind, nature, society and the Divine, whereas Realist writers such as George Eliot and Thomas Hardy seek to explore the common condition of the individual within a complex web of social relationships and institutions. Within the broad definitions of Romanticism and Realism, this course examines the diverse ways that 19th century British authors created and reshaped those traditions, producing a variety of Romanticisms and Realisms that continue to influence literary history through the twentieth century and beyond..At the turn of the 20th Century, writers in London began to demand the authors “make it new!” ushering in the Modernist period. This course will trace the literary aspects of a watershed artistic movement that swept literature, fine art, music, and architecture into the turbulent Twentieth Century.  Examining the tensions between literature and politics, chiefly the two world wars and the ensuing decolonization of many Anglophone nations, this course will introduce students to modern and contemporary literature of the British Isles, offering the opportunity to study major writers of poetry, drama, and fiction, such as T. S. Eliot, W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Beckett..This course investigates the myriad ways film and literature may be understood as conversant, symbiotic, and even combative mediums. The relationships between film and literature will be examined in terms of how one is adapted into the other, how both represent the cultural concerns of a particular historical moment, and how each depends upon and enhances certain stylistic strategies of narrative and non-narrative storytelling.

The Office of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity (OURCA) at Christopher Newport University facilitates the integration of student learning through research and creative activity beyond the traditional classroom. The Office provides opportunities for undergraduates to expand research literacy skills and engage in projects that put classroom course work and academic theory into practice. The OURCA at CNU views research as a deep learning experience, which motivates understanding of basic concepts through their applicaton to a question or problem to help students to develop a deeper understanding of more complex issues. The OURCA is open to students across Christopher Newport University, regardless of their major or stage of educational development. We advise and prepare undergraduates on how to find research opportunities, how to work with faculty, and how to collaborate with each other in innovative and interdisciplinary ways. Finally, the OURCA supports the presentation of research and creative activity in local (including CNU’s annual research conference PAIDEIA), regional, and national conferences, juried shows, performances, competitions, other presentation modalities, and journal publication (including CNU’s student research journal, The Cupola).CNU students are eligible for a wide array of funding and support opportunities:• Research Apprentice Program - supporting beginning researchers• Summer Scholars Program - collaborative work with faculty• Research LENS Student Grants - independent work with faculty oversight• Research LENS Travel Fund - travel to present or conduct research and creative workoffiCe of UndergradUate researCh and Creative aCtivityDr. David A.

At the end of four years of study, a student earns a bachelor’s degree, and the student enrolls the next term in graduate courses leading to a master’s degree. Please note that the use of the term ‘five-year’ is not meant to insure the completion of the master’s in precisely five years. While in most cases this should be possible, the number of graduate hours completed while an undergraduate, the number of hours required for the master’s, and the time necessary for thesis research may require a spe-cific student to take longer than five years.Master of Science in Applied Physics and Computer ScienceThe degree is designed to produce graduates ready to make strong contributions to their professions and/or to continue to-ward a Ph.D. degree in applied physics, computer engineering or computer science. Students may select from three concen-trations: computer science, computer systems engineering and instrumentation, or  applied physics. Many opportunities are available to CNU graduate students because of our loca-tion in the heart of high-tech Hampton Roads and our ties with area national labs and newly developing companies. Graduate students will be able to: • participate in funded research at both the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the NASA Langley Re-search Center• conduct research in nuclear physics, astrophysics, robotics, sensor networking, artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems• solve business and industry problems at the Applied Research Center (ARC), a state-of-the-art research consortium for several universities• learn in an interdisciplinary and collegial environment• work in well-equipped laboratories on campus, NASA Lang-ley, Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the ARC• publish their research in papers and conference presentations nationally and internationallyMaster of Science in Environmental ScienceThis degree program is designed to meet the interests and needs of students pursuing careers in environmental assessment, monitoring, and conservation, and students planning to pursue a Ph.D. in these fields. The curriculum is designed to enhance the understanding of ecosystem ecology, the conservation of organisms and their environment, and environmental chemistry. Courses address skills and content mentioned by employers, consultants and educators as those needed for successful em-ployment. Students spend considerable time in the field collect-ing data and gain experience in analyzing and presenting their findings.  Graduates from this program will:• have a solid background in ecological and environmental conservation theory• have the skills required for employment with environmental assessment and monitoring businesses, and state and federal governmental agencies• have research and technical writing skills• be prepared for further graduate work, for example a Ph.D.Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T)CNU’s Master of Arts in Teaching Program (MAT), is nationally-accredited by the Council for Accreditation for Educator Preparation (CAEP), the sole nationally recognized accrediting body for educator preparation. In addition to meet-ing the rigorous, nationally recognized standards developed by CAEP to ensure excellence in educator preparation programs, CNU’s  MAT curriculum is based on recognized needs for teacher education as identified by bodies such as the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards and the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium. The mission of the CNU Teacher Preparation Program is to prepare students to become highly qualified teachers, licensed to teach in the Commonwealth of Virginia and in reciprocal states through-out the United States. Students select one of the following  endorsement areas: art (visual arts), biology, chemistry, el-ementary, English, English as a second language, history and social science, mathematics, music (choral or instrumental), physics, or Spanish. Faculty from 12 academic departments and practicing public school educators provide students with a strong background in their selected teaching areas. Office of Graduate StudiesThe Office of Graduate Studies is located in Trible Li-brary 243 and welcomes undergraduate students interested in the Bachelor’s to Masters Five-Year programs. From their web site: cnu.edu/admission/graduate/fiveyear/, students may view the Graduate Catalog to see a specific curriculum and course descriptions, apply for admission, contact the graduate program coordinator of their choice and learn more about such topics as research for theses or financial aid.

When students visit Christopher Newport for new student orientation, they will receive instructions on how to activate their access to web-based functions such as online registration; viewing mid-term and final grades; major, minor, or concentration; unofficial degree progress evaluations; unofficial academic transcripts; holds; and address and telephone information. Academic Policies and ProceduresMatters of interpretation of these policies are determined by the Provost or the President. These policies and procedures are administered by the Office of the Registrar.Academic Continuance at the UniversityThe University expects students to make reasonable progress toward earning a degree.  The University evaluates academic standing in terms of both academic progress and academic performance.  Students must demonstrate the incentive and ability to meet the minimum progress and performance standards in order for the University to justify their continued enrollment.Academic performance is measured by grade point average (GPA). Undergraduate students are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average of at least 2.00 each semester, both overall and in their major field of study.  Academic performance  is assessed at the end of each regular (fall and spring) semester. Students who do not maintain this minimum grade point average may be subject to enrollment restrictions as governed by the Academic Performance Policies. Note: Students should be reminded that some major fields of study require a higher academic performance standard. Consult the portion of the Undergraduate Catalog for your major for more specific information. offiCe of the registrarJulianna Wait, University RegistrarMary N.

Please visit financialaid.cnu.edu for the latest update.Academic WarningAcademic warnings apply only to periods of enrollment prior to Fall Semester 2003.  Any student whose semester or overall grade point average fell below 2.00 received an academic warning.  The warning will appear on the student’s academic record.  Academic ProbationStudents who do not academically progress according to the minimum standards for continuance may be subject to academic probation. While on academic probation, students may not enroll in more than 14 credit hours.  The notation Academic Probation will appear on the student’s permanent record. Students who are placed on academic probation are strongly urged to consult with their advisor and the Center for  Academic Success to develop strategies for improving performance.  Students whose performance continues to decline may be subject to academic suspension based on the minimum standards for continuance.Academic SuspensionAcademic suspension results from the cumulative grade point average (GPA) dropping below the minimum standard for continuance while the student is on academic probation. After students have been placed on academic probation and continue to perform below minimum standards, they will be placed on academic suspension.

This plan of study will indicate the credit hour limits the student must observe, the conditions of the agreement, and a schedule of courses to be taken each semester.  If the student follows this agreement and earns at least a 2.00 term GPA, the student will not be academically dismissed even if the cumulative GPA is below the minimum standard for continuance.  If the student does not follow the plan of study, does not meet the terms of the agreement, or does not meet the minimum standard for continuance (GPA), the student will be academically dismissed.  Students are required to initiate the Second Chance Contract each semester of continuous academic probation following academic suspension.  Once a student’s cumulative GPA meets the minimum good standing range (2.00 or higher), the contract is considered complete.  Academic DismissalStudents who have already been academically suspended, are on academic probation, and fail to meet minimum standards for continuance will be academically dismissed from the University. The notation Academic Dismissal will be placed on the dismissed student’s permanent academic record.  Students who have been academically dismissed from CNU may not apply for readmission to the University for at least five calendar years.  Such applicants’ academic records at CNU will be considered part of the relevant materials for readmission to the University.Academic progress must be sufficient to support graduation within a maximum of six (6) years after matriculation as a full-time student.  Such students who fail to meet this requirement may be academically dismissed from the University.  In the event of extenuating circumstances, students may appeal to the Academic Status Committee for an extension of the graduation date. Completed written appeals must be received in the Office of the Registrar at least one week prior to the next published committee meeting. Deadlines for receipt of complete appeals are published on the Office of the Registrar website. Forms for appealing academic progress are available in the Office of the Registrar and on the Office of the Registrar website. Classification of Degree-seeking Full- and Part-time Students (student level)1 - 29 credits .........................Freshman30 - 59 credits ..................... Sophomore60 - 89 credits ..............................Junior90+ credits ...................................SeniorFull-time Status/Permission to UnderloadStudents who enroll in 12 or more credit hours in a regular semester (fall or spring) are considered to be enrolled full-time. The average course load for full-time undergraduate students at CNU is approximately 15 credit hours during either fall or spring semester. Students may carry up to 18 credit hours in a regular semester and up to 18 credit hours in the entire summer session (no more than two courses or six credit hours in each summer term or a total of 18 credit hours in any combination of summer terms) without special permission.  Students who register for more than 17 credit hours will be charged the full-time rate plus the appropriate per-credit-hour rate for each additional hour above 17 credits (for more information see the section of the catalog entitled “Tuition and Fees”). Students wishing to exceed these credit hours should see the section entitled Course Overload Schedule. CNU expects students to maintain full-time status.  A student must seek permission for less than full-time enrollment from the University Registrar.  Such requests must be made prior to the first day of the term.  The form for Permission to take an Underload is available on the Registrar website. Students enrolled as less than full-time should consider carefully the non-academic ramifications of less than full-time enrollment.  For example financial aid, health insurance, NCAA athletics, progress toward degree, immigration status and eligibility for University housing may be impacted.  Students whose request for an underload is denied and who do not appeal their less than full-time status and do not subsequently enroll and maintain full-time status will be disenrolled from the University for that semester.Course Overload ScheduleFor undergraduate students, an overload is defined as more than 18 credit hours in a semester (fall or spring) or all summer terms combined. The University Registrar is authorized to approve overload requests under the follow-ing conditions:Students who wish to enroll in up to 21 credit hours in a regular semester (fall or spring) or up to 18 credit hours in the entire summer (with no more than six credit hours in one summer term or a total of 18 credit hours in any combina-tion of summer terms), provided they have earned at least 12 credit hours at CNU and have an overall GPA of at least 3.00; or students who wish to enroll in up to 19 credits in a regular semester (fall or spring) when the one credit hour overload is for a lab and have an overall GPA of at least 2.50.Students with a GPA below 3.00 may request permis-sion to carry up to 21 credit hours in a regular semester or up to 19 credit hours in the entire summer session (or any combination of summer terms) by appealing to the Academic Status Committee. The Academic Status Committee may recommend granting overload permission in compelling cir-cumstances for students who seem academically able to suc-cessfully complete a semester or term with overload hours. The Academic Status Committee considers the student’s written request, grade point average, progress toward the student’s stated educational objective, academic performance 44aCademiC poliCies and proCedUres 2018-2019in previous semesters, and the mix of courses in the overload appeal. Students must complete the Request for Overload form, which is available in the Office of the Registrar or on the Office of the Registrar website. The completed appeal must be received in the Office of the Registrar no later than the deadline published on the Office of the Registrar web-site. Appeals received after the deadline will be held for the following scheduled Academic Status Committee meeting. Limitation on Eligibility for In-State TuitionBeginning in 2006, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted legislation to place a limitation on students’ eligibility Immunization Requirements for New StudentsIn an effort to provide a healthy environment in which to live and learn, CNU has created an immunization policy that incorporates the guideline for immunizations set forth in the Code of Virginia, Section 23-7.5.  Students may have received these immunizations as a child or later in life. All entering full time students (including transfer students) are required to provide a completed Certificate of Immunization, which must be signed or stamped by a licensed health care professional.  Failure to do so will result in the student’s inability to register for and attend the next semester at CNU. In some cases, students may sign a waiver of the recommended immunization and be in compliance with University and state policy.  Copies may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar website (registrar.cnu.edu/forms/) or by contacting the Office of the Registrar.  Questions about this requirement or the waiver should be directed to the Office of the Registrar at (757) 594-7155 or via email at register@cnu.edu.RegistrationThe University’s registration system is a web-based registration process.  Dates and times for registration periods are published on the Office of the Registrar website prior to each semester (fall, spring and summer).  Typically there are at least two weeks of published advising and registration planning for currently enrolled students prior to the registra-tion period.  Students are expected to adhere to the guidance of their academic advisors when registering for classes.  Students’ schedules should focus on academic success and progress toward their intended degree.  Students are also responsible for ensuring that they have met the appropriate course prerequisites and registration restrictions for entrance into a course. Students who have not met the course prerequi-sites and registration restrictions, as detailed in this catalog, will not be allowed to register for the course without special permission from the department. Students who are required to meet with their academic advisors prior to registering will be given a registration (also called alternate) PIN used for web-based registration and schedule adjustment purposes.  Registration PINs are specific to registration periods:  fall, spring and summer.  A new alternate PIN is issued for each registration period. Students who have a ‘hold’ on their account may not register or make any schedule adjustments (including adds, drops or course withdrawals) for courses until the ‘hold’ has been resolved. Prior to advising, registration, and schedule adjustment periods, it is the student’s responsibility to de-termine whether there is a ‘hold’ on his/her record. Students should access the ‘CNU Live’ link within ‘CNU Connect’ via the web. If a ‘hold’ exists on a student’s record, he/she must resolve that hold with the office issuing the hold.Registered students should log in to their CNU Live account to review their charges as paper bills are no longer mailed.  The balance must be paid by the deadline noted on the online billing statement and announced on the CNU Busi-ness Office website. Students are not considered officially registered until tuition and fee payments have been received in the Business Office. The University reserves the right to cancel registrations if bills are not paid. Newly admitted freshmen are expected to attend the mandatory orientation programs before receiving their fall class schedule. During their orientation program, these students will receive information on how to access their web-based registration account. Newly admitted transfer students, readmitted students, and non-degree seeking students will receive information on how and when to access their web-based registration account with their admission materials.Students who have not registered nor attended for two consecutive regular semesters (fall and spring) will become inactive.  Inactive students who wish to register must seek readmission to the University through the Office of Transfer Enrollment.  After a degree has been conferred, students will be changed to non-degree seeking to facilitate possible future registration unless the student has filed an Intent to Graduate form for an additional degree.for in-state tuition. Upon completion of 125 percent of the credit hours required to obtain a degree in the student’s program, the student may be assessed a surcharge which is equivalent to the cost of tuition at the out-of-state rate. Please note that certain courses and credit hours maybe excluded from the 125 percent calculation. Students who have or will have earned 145 or more credit hours should contact the Office of the Registrar for more information. Impacted students may appeal to the Office of the Registrar for a waiver as provided by the Code of Virginia, Section 23-7.4.GeNerAl AcAdemic policies452018-2019                         aCademiC poliCies and proCedUres Schedule Adjustment (add/drop)After registering for classes, students may make changes to their class schedules via the ‘CNU Live’ link within their ‘CNU Connect’ account during published schedule adjustment periods. If a student has a ‘hold’ on his/her account, he/she will not be able to make schedule adjustments until the ‘hold’ has been resolved with the appropriate office. Note that if the ‘hold’ has not been resolved by the end of the schedule adjustment period, the student may not make additional schedule adjustments for that term.  Schedule adjustment periods are published on the Office of the Registrar website. Courses dropped during this period do not become part of the student’s permanent academic record.   Enrollment in Extended Summer Term All Extended Summer courses will be travel courses that occur at an international location, and travel on these study trips requires concurrent enrollment in the associated coursework.  All current students in good financial and social standing at the University are eligible to enroll in these courses.  Registration for these courses must be processed through the Study Abroad Office and the Office of the Registrar. No more than four credits may be taken during the Extended Summer Term without special permission from the Office of the Registrar. No degree conferrals will occur after completion of an Extended Summer Term course. Students participating in a CNU study abroad course in the Extended Summer Term, or any other course-related travel program, either domestic or international, are required to enroll for and complete the associated course. Students should use the Application for Participation in Non-CNU Led Study Abroad form which can be obtained from the Study Abroad Office. Withdrawal from a CourseFive (5) course withdrawals (grades of W) are permitted during a student’s academic career at CNU. The sixth and any subsequent W will be computed as an F in the grade point average. Effective with the 2007-2008 academic year, the following guidelines apply to course withdrawals:• Courses taken on an ‘audit’ basis do not count toward the limit of five W grades;• Co-requisite courses, when all co-requisite courses are dropped, count as one W toward the limit of five; • Co-requisite courses, when only one of the co-requisite courses is dropped, count as one W toward the limit of five.If a student withdraws from a course where the pass/fail option has been elected, the withdrawal will count toward the maximum of five allowed without grade penalty. Note that the limit of five course withdrawals began with Fall Semester 2002 enrollments. During the withdrawal period, students may withdraw from a course by completing a Course Withdrawal form obtained in the Office of the Registrar or available on the Office of the Registrar’s website. Students are encouraged to obtain the signature of the instructor of record on Course Withdrawal forms, even if the course is for zero credit hours or a course taken on an audit basis. If a student is unable to obtain the instructor’s signature on the Course Withdrawal form, he/she should indicate such on the form when it is submitted to the Office of the Registrar. Course withdrawals will be recorded with a grade of W on the student’s academic record; course withdrawals in excess of five will be recorded with a grade of F on the student’s academic record.  If a student has a ‘hold’ on his/her account, he/she will not be able to withdraw from courses until the ‘hold’ has been resolved with the appropriate office.  Note that if the ‘hold’ has not been resolved by the end of the course withdrawal period, the student may not withdraw from that course.  Course withdrawal periods are published on the Office of the Registrar website and in the academic calendar.Students who are considering withdrawing from a course should be reminded that graduate and professional schools, as well as future employers, may discount academic performance if it is apparent that withdrawing from courses was used as a mechanism for avoiding poor grades. Students should make these decisions carefully and only after consulting with the academic advisor and the instructor. A student who stops attending a class and who does not complete a Withdrawal from Course form will be assigned the earned grade in that course. A grade of W cannot be assigned after the end of the published withdrawal period. Medical, Administrative, and Military WithdrawalsStudents who appeal to withdraw from the semester for medical reasons (medical withdrawal) must complete a Withdrawal from Semester form and submit detailed documentation to the Office of the Registrar outlining the justification for the request. Appeals for medical withdrawals must be timely and must be submitted as close as reasonably possible to the accident or incident causing the need for the medical withdrawal. The student must also provide a written statement on official letterhead from his/her physician (MD or DO) certifying that he/she is/was incapacitated and is physically incapable of completing the term due to medical reasons. Appeals for medical withdrawals which are received after the last day of regular classes will be considered late and must have a written statement by the student indicating the compelling reason for the late request. Late requests are discouraged and will be considered on a case by case basis; only those requests involving very exceptional circumstances which could not have been addressed earlier in the semester will be considered.  After the Office of the Registrar receives all required documentation, the University Registrar will begin a thorough review of the student’s request and determine the appropriateness of the medical withdrawal. 46aCademiC poliCies and proCedUres 2018-2019After the review has been completed, the University Registrar will approve or disapprove the request, and the student will be notified in writing of the decision.  If the request is approved and the student wishes to return to the University for a future term, the student will need to provide written documentation from the treating physician that he/she is eligible to return to full-time study. If the student has not enrolled for two consecutive semesters, the student must apply for readmission to the University in addition to providing written documentation from the treating physician of the student’s eligibility to return to full-time study. It is extremely rare that two consecutive medical withdrawals will be approved.  It is also rare that a request for a medical withdrawal received near the end of a term or after a term has ended will be approved or that a medical withdrawal will be approved retroactively for a previous period of enrollment. In such extreme instances of physical incapacitation, additional documentation from the physician (MD or DO) and the student will be required to justify the lateness of the appeal.In other extenuating (non-medical) circumstances requiring the student to withdraw from the semester, the student must complete a Withdrawal from Semester form and a written personal statement outlining the extenuating circumstances justifying the need for an administrative withdrawal.  Requests for an administrative withdrawal must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for approval by an appropriate University official (the student’s academic dean, a vice provost, or the provost).  After the appropriate University executive administrator has reviewed the request and made a decision, the Office of the Registrar will notify the student in writing of the decision. Students may not have two consecutive administrative withdrawals approved. It is extremely rare that more than one administrative withdrawal will be approved during a student’s entire academic career at Christopher Newport or that an administrative withdrawal will be approved near the end of a term, after the term has ended, or retroactively for a previous period of enrollment.If a request for a medical or administrative withdrawal is approved, all grades for the semester in question will be noted as M on the student’s transcript, and the student will earn no credit for that term. The M grades will not be counted toward the maximum course withdrawals permitted and will not be computed in the students’ grade GPA. Students may not exercise the medical or administrative withdrawal option to withdraw from individual courses.  Students with an approved medical or administrative withdrawal will be ineligible for any refund of tuition and/or fees unless the complete request for withdrawal (including required documentation) was received by the Office of the Registrar during the regular published refund period for withdrawals.  Students who submit requests for withdrawals after the refund period will be ineligible for any refund of tuition and/or fees. Students with approved medical or administrative withdrawals may be eligible for prorated housing and/or meal plan rates after consultation with the Office of Housing Administration and submission of any required documents.  Students with an approved medical or administrative withdrawal will be ineligible for any refund of their University parking fee.  Students who are called to active duty (deployed) after the final drop/add period may pursue a military withdrawal from all courses. Students should complete a Withdrawal from Semester form along with a copy of their official military orders calling them to active duty and forward both to the Office of the Registrar for approval and processing. Students who have reached the ninth week of a regular semester should contact the Office of the Provost for assistance in securing grades of I (incomplete) in their courses whenever possible. Except in cases where students have received authorization for grades of I, all grades for the semester in question will be noted as M on the student’s transcript. The M will not be counted toward the maximum number of course withdrawals permitted and will not be computed in the student’s grade point average (GPA). Additional information regarding the required process is available at registrar.cnu.edu.Auditing a CourseStudents auditing courses are subject to attendance regulations specified by the instructor but are not required to take tests or final examinations in the audited courses. By permission of the instructor, students may complete any of the required assignments. Rather than receive the regular letter grade at the completion of an audited course, auditing students’ academic records will indicate AU for such courses.  (See “Fees and Financial Information” and its subsection concerning Senior Citizens for details concerning audit charges.) Changes from audit to credit status or credit to audit status may be made only during published schedule adjustment periods and in compliance with established deadlines. Students who switch from audit status to credit status are expected to make satisfactory academic progress according to the University Minimum Standards for Academic Continuance.Independent Study ProceduresThe purpose of independent study is to enable qualified students to enrich their programs through directed reading or independent research under faculty supervision for University credit. Independent study courses may be offered in a regular semester or during a summer session. The student and the faculty member directing the independent study agree upon goals, prerequisites, stages and grading procedures in writing. The Independent Study Authorization form must be completed and submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the end of the registration period for the semester in which the independent study is to occur. Forms submitted after the registration period will not be processed.472018-2019                         aCademiC poliCies and proCedUresIndependent study is ordinarily limited to the students’ major or minor fields of study, where they have qualified themselves by previous academic training. Students may present a maximum of six credit hours of independent study credit toward the undergraduate degree. (Note: No more than three credit hours of independent study are allowed in one term.)To qualify for Independent Study: 1. The student must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.50; 2. The student and the faculty member directing the independent study must complete an Independent Study Authorization form (available on the Office of the Registrar website); 3. Students must register for the independent study course through the Office of the Registrar (not via the web). Within five days of being signed by both parties, the Independent Study Authorization form must be submitted to the appropriate department chair and academic dean. (If an independent study is to be taken off campus or is to be directed by adjunct faculty, written approval of the department chair is required.) Students must then present the completed and approved Independent Study Authorization form to the Office of the Registrar at the time of registration or schedule adjustment so he/she can be registered in the desired course. Incomplete forms will not be processed.4. The deadline for submission of an approved Independent Study Authorization form is the last date, as stated on the Office of the Registrar website for the term requested, to add or drop a course. If the addition of the independent study course will cause an overload situation (more than 18 credits in a regular semester), the student must submit the form along with an appeal for an overload to the Academic Status Committee.  Deadlines for submission of appeals to the Academic Status Committee are posted at registrar.cnu.edu/committees.  Completed appeals should be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadline.Class AttendanceThe University expects that students will regularly attend all of their scheduled classes.  An educational system based largely upon classroom instruction and analytical discussion depends upon the faithful attendance of all students. The University does not, however, establish specific attendance policies. These are established at the discretion of the individual colleges, departments, and instructors.  Students with excessive absences will receive a grade of F or UI upon the instructor’s recommendation.  If excessive absences are caused by an extreme emergency and the instructor penalizes the student, the student may appeal the decision through the Grade Appeal Policy (see Student Handbook for details). Other regulations include: 1.    Missing a class meeting does not in any way lessen the student’s responsibility for that part of the course that has been missed. 2.   Instructors may differentiate between excused and unexcused absences and authorize makeup tests when appropriate. 3.     Students who miss classes to represent the university must notify the class instructors in advance of those absences. Given prior notice, instructors will allow students to make up class work or to complete work in advance of class absence. In cases of disagreement about whether an activity represents the university, the appropriate academic dean will make the deter-mination.4.    Students who receive federal financial aid and who discontinue class attendance without formally with-drawing from the course may jeopardize current and/or future financial aid awards. Please contact the Of-fice of Financial Aid for more information. Final ExaminationsThe examinations given at the end of each semester take place at times announced on the examination schedule published on the Office of the Registrar website. Exams may not be completed on a University Reading Day. Students are required to take all final examinations at the times scheduled unless excused as noted below (see Absence from Final Examinations). The University does not authorize re-examination nor will changes be permitted unless the student has three or more examinations in a 24-hour period. Students with more than two examinations scheduled on a single day may request to have any additional examination(s) rescheduled. Such requests must be directed to the instructor(s) before the final exam period begins; at their discretion, instructors may resolve such conflicts using the conflict resolution period (but not the university reading/study day) or by other arrangement, such as allowing the student to take the exam in another course section or re-scheduling the latest final on a given day.  Students with other verifiable conflicts that would force a rescheduling in the exam time may request such a change but the request must be approved by the dean after student consultation with the instructor and/or department chair. Absence from Final ExaminationsA student may be excused from taking an examination at the scheduled time by prior approval of the instructor. The student may be excused on the grounds of illness when it is verified by a physician and received by the instructor or department chair. The instructor must be notified as soon as possible if illness or any other emergency causes a student to be absent from an examination. If the instructor cannot be notified because the student is physically unable to do so, the Office of the Registrar must be notified as soon as possible 48aCademiC poliCies and proCedUres 2018-2019and the Office of the Registrar will contact the instructor. Verification is required. Grade-Point AverageThe ‘cumulative GPA’ is the total number of grade points earned (for CNU courses) divided by the total number of credit hours attempted (CNU). Transfer credit is not included in grade points and credit hours attempted, resulting in one GPA; however, transfer credit is included in credit hours earned towards a degree. Grading System A (Excellent) .........4.00 A- ..........................3.70 B+ .........................3.30 B (Above Avg) ......3.00 B- ..........................2.70 C+ .........................2.30 C (Average) ...........2.00 C- ..........................1.70 D+ .........................1.30 D (Below Avg) ......1.00 D- ..........................0.70 F (Failing) .............0.00 UI (Failing) ...........0.00 AU Indicates that a student has audited a course (no degree credit is awarded) and is not computed in the cumula-tive GPA. I Indicates an incomplete grade and is not computed in the cumulative GPA.M Indicates that a student has received a medical/ad-ministrative/military/judicial withdrawal and is not computed in the cumulative GPA .P Indicates a passing grade in a pass/fail course; if the student receives a grade of P, it is not computed in the cumulative GPA while the grade of F is computed in the cumulative GPA.UI     Indicates an ‘unauthorized incomplete’ denoting that a student did not participate academically in a course beyond the 60 percent date in the semester; this is computed in the cumulative GPA as an F.W Indicates that a student withdrew from a course and is not computed in the cumulative GPA.Z Indicates a zero credit course and is not computed in the cumulative GPA. Incomplete GradeThe grade of Incomplete, I, is a temporary grade that the instructor may assign when exceptional, documented circumstances prevent the student from completing required assignments or from taking the final examination. If the grade of Incomplete is assigned, the student must complete the work and the professor must submit the Grade Change Form (or Extension of Incomplete Form, if appropriate) to the Office of the Registrar by the third Friday of the next regular semester. If a Grade Change Form (or Extension of Incomplete Form) is not submitted as indicated, the grade of I will automatically convert to a grade of F on the following business day and will require the following signatures for a change of grade: instructor, department chair, and academic dean. •  Incomplete grades given in the fall: must be removed or extended by the above indicated deadline in the following spring semester.•  Incomplete grades given in the spring: must be removed or extended by the above indicated deadline in the following fall semester. •  Incomplete grades given in the summer: must be removed or extended by the above indicated deadline in the following fall semester.All extensions of an incomplete grade require the signature of the instructor, department chair, and academic dean and must include a specific date (MMDDYY) prior to the last day of the next regular semester. I grades will roll to a grade of F once an extension date has expired. Note: Degrees will not be conferred for students with a missing grade or grade(s) of Incomplete, I, on his/her academic record and the student’s anticipated semester of graduation will be moved to the following term.Grades for Repeated CoursesFor most courses that are repeated, only the grade, credit, and grade points for the most recent course enrollment will be counted toward graduation requirements, credit hours earned, and included in the computation of grade point averages. Courses completed at CNU with a grade of D or F cannot be repeated at another institution.  Students who, after their third attempt (excluding course withdrawals designated by a grade of W), do not complete a course required for a specific degree at CNU may not be allowed to graduate with that degree, as determined by the student’s academic department.  Students, whose academic department removes them from the major because of three attempts (excluding course withdrawals designated by a grade of W) in a required course, may appeal to the Undergraduate Degrees Committee for reinstatement to their former major. Students who fail to successfully complete the mandatory general education or liberal learning curriculum courses after three enrollments may be academically dismissed from CNU. Students who are academically dismissed may appeal to the Academic Status Committee for reinstatement. Students who wish to appeal either committee should consult the Office of the Registrar website for deadlines, forms, and instructions regarding the appeal process. Appeals received after the published deadline will be held for the next scheduled meeting.  Completed appeals should be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadline.Courses retaken after graduation will not replace grades previously earned; therefore grades, grade points, and credits for both course enrollments will be reflected in the cumulative and CNU totals on the student record.492018-2019                         aCademiC poliCies and proCedUresThe Pass/Fail OptionThe Pass/Fail Option is intended to encourage students to enrich their academic programs by exploring challeng-ing courses outside their major without the pressure of the regular grading system. Effective with fall semester 2008, the requirements for the Pass/Fail Option are as follows:• To register for a course under the Pass/Fail Option, an undergraduate must have at least junior standing (see Classification of Students) with a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.00.• To exercise this option, students must complete and submit a Pass/Fail form to the Office of the Registrar by the end of the published period for that term. Once exercised, the Pass/Fail Option can be revoked only by withdrawal from the course or by withdrawal from the University.• Undergraduate students can complete no more than 12 credit hours under this option during their tenure at CNU.• Undergraduate students can register for no more than six credit hours of pass/fail in any one term (counted fall, spring, or summer).• Courses which may not be taken on a pass/fail basis include those satisfying the liberal learning curriculum (liberal learning foundations, areas of inquiry, and writ-ing intensive) or requirements in the major, minor, con-centration, or degree studies and graduate level courses (numbered  500-600 level). University designated pass/fail courses (offered only on a pass/fail basis) are ex-empt from this policy. Courses for which the pass/fail option applies, are restricted to general (non-program) electives. • Credit for a passing grade will count toward graduation but will not be used in determining the GPA. Credit for a failing grade will not be given; however, a grade of F will be computed in the cumulative GPA. • Courses taken on a pass/fail basis count toward full- or part-time standing. • A grade of P is granted for earning a D- or higher in the pass/fail course. Grade Reports: Third-week, Midterm and Final Students may access their third-week, midterm and final grade reports by accessing their web-based, ‘CNU Connect’ account and clicking on the ‘CNU Live’ link.  Final grades are available at the end of each term.Dean’s Academic Honor ListStudents who, in any given fall or spring semester, are enrolled in at least 12 credit hours, have earned no final grade below C, have not received the temporary grade of I in any course during that semester, and whose term grade point average is at least 3.50, are placed on the Dean’s Academic Honor List for that semester.  NOTE:  Minimum requirements for Dean’s Academic Honor List are not appealable.Request to take Courses ElsewherePermission to take courses elsewhere is a privilege that the University grants to degree-seeking students; however, when a student seeks to enroll in credit courses at another institution, the student must obtain approval in advance from the Office of the Registrar.  This rule also applies to courses taken through the Virginia Tidewater Consortium (VTC). Please note that a maximum of 11 credits or three courses with required labs completed through the Virginia Tidewater Consortium may be applied toward graduation.Students must complete a Request to Take Courses Elsewhere form, available on CNU Live with the Office of the Registrar or on the Office of the Registrar website.  The University grants students permission to take courses for credit at other institutions when such action is necessary for students to make progress toward their educational objective and the course is not available at CNU. Transfer credit(s) for courses taken elsewhere will be granted only if the student has prior written approval and earns a grade of C or higher at the transfer institution. Note that grades earned at transfer institutions are not computed into the student’s cumulative GPA. Degree-seeking students who are on academic and/or judicial suspension (to include suspensions due to Title IX violations) are not eligible to take courses elsewhere. Credit hours earned elsewhere while on academic suspension will not be accepted as credit by Christopher Newport University. CNU students who enroll in any non-CNU study abroad course must obtain prior approval  for credit prior to the study term.  Students should use the Application for Participation in Non-CNU Led Study Abroad form, which can be obtained from the Study Abroad Office.  It is the student’s responsi-bility to obtain the necessary signatures for all courses that might be taken during the study abroad, and submit the completed form, including all required signatures, to the Study Abroad Office for approval. Request to take a College-Level Examination Program (CLEP)Permission to take a College-Level Examination Pro-gram (CLEP) exam is a privilege that the University grants to currently enrolled degree-seeking students; however, when a student seeks to take a CLEP exam to earn college credit, the student must obtain approval in advance from the Office of the Registrar. Students must complete a Request to Take a CLEP Exam form, available on the Office of the Registrar website. The University grants students permission to take CLEP examinations when such action is necessary for students to make progress toward their educational ob-jective. Credit for CLEP examinations are granted only if the student has prior written approval from the Office of the Registrar and earns at least the minimum score published in the Policy for CLEP and Procedures for Course Challenge.  Degree-seeking students who are on academic suspension are not eligible to take CLEP examinations for credit at CNU. 50aCademiC poliCies and proCedUres 2018-2019Challenging a CourseStudents who have become exceptionally knowledge-able through life experiences in the subject matter of cer-tain courses offered at the University may challenge these courses.  Students may earn credit for such courses upon demonstration of proficiency through procedures established by each academic department at the University.  Only those courses that do not appear on the student’s CNU permanent academic record or on any other college transcript may be challenged. Students may challenge a given course only once. To challenge a course, the student should pay the required fee to challenge a course and present a completed Permis-sion to Challenge a Course form (available on the Office of the Registrar website) to the Office of the Registrar for approval. After the student has paid the challenge fee and received approval from the Office of the Registrar, he/she should contact the department chair of the course to obtain approval and to arrange to challenge the course. The student must also obtain written approval of the academic dean to challenge a course. After the course has been challenged, the responsible faculty member will record the results on the Challenge form and submit to the Office of the Registrar. The non-traditional credits will be recorded on the student’s permanent academic record, and the student will receive notification from the Office of the Registrar indicating the results of the challenge. Unsuccessful challenges will not ap-pear on the academic record. Details concerning this process, individual department procedures and courses available to challenge are listed in the booklet entitled Policy for CLEP and Procedures for Course Challenge.Academic ForgivenessCNU students who have been readmitted after not taking courses at CNU for a period of five or more years may apply to the University Registrar for academic forgiveness.  The student must be currently enrolled at CNU and have completed at least 12 credit hours with a minimum 2.00 grade point average.  The University Registrar will act on  behalf of the Academic Status Committee to have the past academic record at CNU forgiven.  The forgiveness policy applies to the entire academic record prior to readmission and not to selected courses.  The record of forgiven courses will remain on the student’s permanent record, but it will be noted that these courses have been forgiven.  Such forgiven courses will not fulfill any academic requirements nor will they be computed in the cumulative grade point average.Individuals exercising this option are cautioned that forgiveness pertains only to the previous record at CNU and does not affect transfer credits earned at other institutions in any way.Declaration or Change of MajorDegree-seeking students will typically declare a major field of study no later than the end of the sophomore year or upon completion of 60 credit hours.  To declare a major field of study, students must complete the Declaration or Change of Major/Minor form, available from the Office of the Registrar. Degree requirements are based on the catalog in effect at the time of admission/readmission. Students must submit the completed Declaration or Change of Major/Minor forms to the Office of the Registrar.  Note that the major(s), do not appear on the diploma but does list on the student’s official transcript.A major must consist of a minimum of 30 semester hours and a maximum of 42 semester hours in the discipline.  Introductory (100- and 200- level) courses need not be counted in the 42-hour maximum requirement, at the discretion of the department housing the major.  Students may take more than 42 hours in the major field, and a department may not require more than this number except where the university has approved an exception for the program as in instances where accreditation may require more hours. Double MajorDegree-seeking students may designate a second, concurrent major field of study.  All requirements for both majors, including the general education or liberal learning curriculum, supporting, and concentration requirements must be completed.  Students seeking a double major must complete and submit the appropriate request form, available from the Office of the Registrar. In the case of a double major, two baccalaureate degrees will not be awarded.  However, a notation recognizing the completion of the requirements for the second major will be recorded on the student’s permanent academic record (transcript) at the time of graduation. Students should submit completed forms to the Office of the Registrar.Declaration of MinorDegree-seeking students may declare a minor in a sanctioned secondary field of study by completing the Dec-laration or Change of Major/Minor form, available from the Office of the Registrar.  A minor may not be declared in the discipline of the major.  The minor must include from 15 to 21 credit hours of course work above the 100-level, as deter-mined by the department of the minor field. Students should submit completed forms to the Office of the Registrar.Second Bachelor’s DegreeStudents who hold a bachelor’s degree from Christopher Newport University are required to present 30 additional hours of residence credit, after the first baccalaureate degree has been awarded, toward a second CNU bachelor’s degree. Students who hold a bachelor’s degree from another regionally accredited college or university, and who wish to become candidates for a second degree, must earn a minimum of 45 hours in residence at CNU, after their first baccalaureate degree has been awarded.  Once admitted into degree-seeking status, such degree holders will not be required to complete the general education or liberal learning curriculum for bachelor’s degrees that have not already been met through transfer of credit from their previous degree program(s).  The degree studies requirement (for students admitted or readmitted prior to Fall Semester 2006), major, and 512018-2019                         aCademiC poliCies and proCedUreselective requirements for the CNU degree being sought must be satisfied. Undergraduate Students taking Graduate CoursesUndergraduate students in senior status may, under certain conditions, take graduate level courses. Seniors with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 are allowed, with the signed approval of the course instructor and the Office of Graduate Studies, to enroll in one graduate level course and any associated laboratory per semester. There is a limit of eight (8) graduate level credit hours over all semesters for an undergraduate student. These graduate level credit hours may count toward the 120 credit hours for the undergraduate degree. In order to enroll in a subsequent graduate level course, the undergraduate student must have earned a minimum grade of B- in the first attempted graduate level course. If the graduate level course is to be used as a substitute course in the undergraduate major, the student must have the course substitution approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. If the graduate level course is to be used as a substitute course in the undergraduate liberal learning curriculum, the student must appeal to the Undergraduate Degrees Committee for approval to substitute a graduate level course for an undergraduate liberal learning curriculum requirement. Allowing a student to enroll in the graduate level course does not indicate permission to substitute that course for any required undergraduate course. The required form, Undergraduate Request to take Graduate Level Course, is available from the Office of Graduate Studies and the Office of the Registrar. The completed and signed form must be attached to the Add/Drop form at the time of registration (no later than the final day of the published add/drop period) and submitted to the Office of the Registrar with all required signatures. Incomplete forms will not be processed.Undergraduates accepted to one of the five-year programs may be required to take certain graduate level courses that will be applied toward an undergraduate degree.  For these students, credit for graduate courses beyond the 120 credit hour requirement for the bachelor’s degree may be transferred to the graduate transcript.  Grades do not transfer.Enrollment During Graduation TermStudents should read and be familiar with university graduation requirements and applicable deadlines available in the Undergraduate Catalog and on the Office of the Registrar website. All undergraduate students must be enrolled the semester of graduation, as noted on the Intent to Graduate form, as one of the university’s requirements for graduation. For summer graduates, students must be enrolled in one of the summer terms. At the end of the final drop/add period for their term of graduation, students who have not registered for a course will be required to enroll in the following semester and graduation will be delayed, or in special circumstances, students can submit an appeal to the Office of the Registrar for an exception to this enrollment requirement.Commencement and Graduation ExercisesCommencement exercises are held once each year in May. Students who complete degree requirements in August and December are eligible to participate in the following Spring Commencement ceremony. Diplomas for August graduates will be available on the first business day after the end of the last summer term. Diplomas for December graduates will be available approximately 21 calendar days after the semester ends. After a degree has been conferred, students will be changed to non-degree seeking to facilitate possible future registration unless the student has filed an Intent to Graduate form for an additional degree.All prospective graduates will be contacted before the  Spring Commencement ceremony by the Office of the Registrar and/or University Events concerning rehearsal and attendance. Those students planning to attend Commencement must notify the University by the announced deadline so that seating arrangements can be finalized for all who plan to participate.  Students who plan to attend Commencement must keep the Office of the Registrar informed of any address and/or phone number changes so that they can receive important information concerning graduation.Degrees will not be conferred for students unless all graduation requirements, including courses, degree requirements, GPAs, credits, and financial obligations have been satisfied.  NOTE:  Degrees will not be conferred for students with a missing grade or grade(s) of Incomplete, I, on his/her academic record.  In the case of a missing or incomplete grade, the student’s anticipated semester of graduation will be moved to the following term.  Students must be enrolled the semester or term of graduation.To participate in the Commencement ceremony, undergraduate candidates for graduation must have completed all remaining degree requirements (degree, financial and social) or be enrolled in spring semester courses which will complete all degree requirements no later than the beginning of spring semester finals week.  If after spring semester final grades have been submitted, a spring candidate does not successfully complete one spring semester course of three or less credits, and has earned a minimum GPA of 2.00 (overall and in the major), he/she may be eligible to participate as a candidate pending completion (see Policy on Participation on the Office of the Registrar website). To be eligible to participate, all degree candidates must be on track to complete all degree requirements as of the second week of spring semester and continue to be on track to complete all degree requirements as of the begin-ning of final exams. Students who have remaining degree or University requirements going into spring semester, or students who intend to finish their requirements in the summer or fall semester, are not eligible to participate in the Spring Com-mencement ceremony.  Please note that May term or any 52aCademiC poliCies and proCedUres 2018-20191. A total of 120 academic semester hours with a grade point average of at least 2.00;2. Official classification as degree-seeking prior to beginning the last 30 credit hours in their academic program;3. Minimum of 45 credit hours completed in residence as a degree-seeking student at CNU.  Note:  Credit earned through a CNU approved study abroad/away program is counted as ‘resident’ credit;4. Minimum of 30 of the last 36 credit hours, including the last 12 credit hours within the major field, taken in residence;  5. Of the total credits required for graduation:a) Students matriculating in Fall 2000 and thereafter must complete two (2) 300-400 level courses that are designated as writing intensive (WI).  See major department for details.b) Students may present a maximum of six credit hours of Independent Study credit toward the undergraduate degree. (Note: No more than three credit hours of Independent Study in one term.)c) Students may present a maximum (total) of 12 credits in any combination of Topics courses (195, 295, 395, and 495) in any department.  Should a course taken as a Topics course subsequently convert to a regularly offered course within that department, then that course will not be counted toward the 12-hour maximum under this provision.d) Students may repeat certain courses for credit toward graduation.

R. Carney, A. RoseInstructor: Barclay, Bunch, Cornette, HealyEmeriti: Chambers, D. Gordon, L.Gordon, Lee, Rosenberg, Sprague, WoodMission StatementThe CNU English Department instills in students the habits of mind required to pursue informed and purposeful lives in a diverse and interconnected world. Through intensive programs of reading, writing, and research, the department’s faculty fosters in its students the capacity for independent thought and reflection, as well as an ever-opening awareness of the world and a keener capacity to observe that world. To that end, the department engenders respect for the English language throughout its history and in its various forms, expressions and functions, while situating English within a larger, global context. Throughout the English Department’s curriculum, students work toward finding their own critical voices, as they encounter literatures of the world, writings of various fields and disciplines, and language varieties of the local community. Students receive individual attention from their professors, who are published experts in their fields, as well as from leaders in the local community who mentor students in professional settings.Overview The English Department is at the heart of a liberal arts university. Grounded in the study of literature and literary tradition, the English major fosters critical-thinking, a talent transferable to all areas of life. The major is an especially good choice for students who want to pursue careers demanding a high degree of cultural literacy and attention to language, such as graduate work in primary, secondary and university level teaching and scholarship, law, advertising, journalism, public relations, publishing, communications, diplomacy, and human relations.The central strength of the English Department is the study of literature, but the department also features other scholarly strengths.

Strong algebra skills are required..The Bachelor of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering  Electrical engineers design and fabricate electrical devices and systems that have become an indispensable part of our lives. The program of study is to provide each graduate with a firm foundation in electrical engineering principles while gaining the tools to adapt to the technical changes and career opportunities they will experience in the future. The electrical engineering undergraduate curriculum begins with a solid foundation in mathematics and science. After the freshman year, we adopt a comprehensive approach by covering traditional electrical engineering areas in circuits, electronics, digital systems, control and communication. Adequate elective freedom is available to allow specialization in three emphasis areas: digital systems, control and instrumentation, communication and signal processing. The goal is to prepare our students with one or more most common electrical engineering specialties. Emphasis is placed on understanding principles through theoretical investigation and experimental verification. The program educational objectives of the electrical engineering program are to ensure that within three years after graduation:1.  Our graduates will have established themselves in professional positions in industry, government, or non-profit organizations that utilize the skills and abilities associated with liberally-educated electrical engineers, and/or will be enrolled in programs of graduate or professional study.2.  Our graduates, collectively, will be competent working on both traditional and emerging electrical engineering positions, and thus will have applied their knowledge and skills in a wide variety of engineering related fields. Furthermore, our graduates will have demonstrated their commitment to professional growth and life-long learning. 3.  Our graduates will be leading lives of significance by taking on leadership roles, demonstrating independent work, and serving society in part through their professional contributions.The student outcomes for the electrical engineering program specify that, by the time of graduation, our graduates will have:• an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and electrical engineering• an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data• an ability to design hardware and software systems to meet desired needs within realistic constraints• an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams• an ability to identify, formulate, and solve software and hardware engineering systems problems• an understanding and appreciation of professional and ethical responsibility• an ability to communicate effectively orally and in writing• the liberal education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental and societal context• a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning• a knowledge of contemporary issues• an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for effective electrical engineering practiceThe curriculum in electrical engineering has mixtures of the particular and the general, theoretical, and experimental, along with strong components in design and integration. Compared to a purely theoretical approach, we adopt a curriculum that focuses on analysis and design using current technologies, and the one that emphasizes an applied approach. There is a comprehensive laboratory component to provide a hands-on experience. Most of the EE courses have either a dedicated laboratory companion course or a laboratory component built into it. This approach is inherently more interesting to students, and leads students toward more individual learning. Degree studies requirements are those of the Bachelor of Science degree. In addition to requiring successful completion of the liberal learning curriculum, the electrical engineering major requires successful of the following courses with no more than two grades below C-:1. /122L)• Organic Chemistry or Biochemistry ("

The interdepartmental and interdisciplinary features of the program allow for a broad and varied exposure to North American Black culture, economics, politics, and history from Africa to the Americas. Students will acquire a ba-sic knowledge of the African-American experience by un-derstanding that the racial system of the United States was never simply black and white. Through the prism of black experiences, the courses shed light on general principles of cultural pluralism, racial diversity, and social stratification in the U.S. and other national and transnational contexts relevant to the black diaspora. Race is not something that affects only racial minorities, for everyone in this country is viewed through the prism of ideas about race. The African-American studies minor’s teaching places a special empha-sis on reaching out beyond those who make the field the focus of their study.The course offerings are designed for a broad student constituency interested in learning about Black experiences and honing skills in critical thinking and effective writing.  The African-American studies minor pairs well with all majors. Consequently, everyone who has an interest is not only invited to take on the minor, but strongly encouraged. Program Objectives:1. Underscore the contributions of people of African de-scent to American history and emphasize the impor-tance of diversity in American culture.   2. Cultivate students’ ability to think critically, to express themselves effectively, and to respect cultural and gen-der diversity.

The student may earn either the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Science degree in interdisciplinary studies. An important objective of the Interdisciplinary Individualized Program is to involve the student in formulating a rationale for the design of a coherent individual program of study. This is a difficult task and requires a certain amount of knowledge and direction. The student will have to give considerable thought to his or her long-range learning objectives and to the best way to meet those objectives. For this reason, the following guidelines must be met:1. The student must have completed at least 30 semester hours of course work and have achieved at least a 3.00 GPA at the time the petition is submitted.2. The declaration of interdisciplinary studies major is through the petition process (details listed below) and must be completed before earning 60 hours of credit.3. The total program of study must include at least 42 semester hours of course work beyond those completed at the time of approval; a minimum of 30 semester hours at the 300-400 level; and a senior capstone project designed by the student and her/his faculty committee to analyze and synthesize the topic of study.4. The student’s educational goals must be such that they cannot be achieved by a regular departmental major supported by a minor and/or careful selection of electives.5. The student’s total program of study must conform to and meet all requirements of the curricular structure for baccalaureate degrees, including the liberal learning curriculum and must give evidence of disciplined academic inquiry.To enter this program the student must first complete a proposed plan of study, including a rationale for the plan and identifying those disciplines that will be involved in the student’s plan of study. Guidelines are available from the Director of Interdisciplinary Studies. Proposals must be submitted to the Interdisciplinary Studies Director by November 1 during the fall semester or March 15 during the spring semester. It is advisable for a student to discuss the plan of study with the director before submitting a proposal.The Director of Interdisciplinary Studies reviews and approves the student’s petition and proposed plan of study and serves as the academic advisor for all interdisciplinary studies students.The student is notified if the proposal cannot be approved. If the proposal is viable, the student recruits a faculty committee that represents the primary disciplines involved. The appointed faculty committee then meets with the student to discuss the proposed plan of study and continues to assist the student in the implementation of the details. This includes approving the individual courses that the student must take to meet all requirements for the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree. The committee must approve the student’s program. The Director of Interdisciplinary Studies oversees the total work of the student and confirms, prior to graduation, that all requirements have been completed.the CUrriCUlUm in interdisCiplinary stUdies, 340;6. .

The University is required to inform enrolled students annually of their rights under the terms of FERPA. The act does not apply to students admitted to the University who have not officially enrolled. Note: Students should access cnu.edu/registrar/ferpa/ for the latest changes to CNU directory information and updates regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). The Vice President for Enrollment and Student Success and the University Registrar serve as the University’s FERPA officials and implement policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with this federal requirement.A. Policy Intent 1. The University student (education) record policy is intended to conform with all state and federal statutes dealing with access to information held by an educational institution on present and former students. 2. The CNU student record policy is formulated to protect the privacy of student information that is maintained and yet provide access to student records for those having a legitimate educational interest in viewing such records. Regulations and procedures to ensure adequate protection of the student are provided in this policy. B. Student Rights under FERPA: 1. Enrolled students have the right to inspect their education record within 45 days of the request for inspection and are entitled to an explanation of any information therein. “Record” refers to those files and their contents that are maintained by official units of the University. Generally, students have the right to review any official record that the University maintains on that student. When access is permitted, documents will be examined only under conditions that will prevent unauthorized removal, alteration, or mutilation. Students must submit to the Office of the Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. A University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the record(s) may be inspected. If the University official to whom the request was submitted does not maintain the requested record(s), that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.2. Information to which the student does not have access is limited to the following: a. Confidential letters and recommendations placed in the student’s files before January 1, 1975, and those letters for which student has signed a waiver of his or her right of access. Letters of recommendation are removed from the Admissions files before the files are forwarded to the Office of the Registrar. b. Parents’ confidential financial statements. c. Personal files and records of members of faculty or administrative personnel, which are in sole           possession of the maker thereof.d. Education records, which contain information about more than one student; in such cases, CNU will allow the inquiring student access to the part of the record, which pertains only to the inquiring student.e. Records of the admissions offices concerning students admitted but not yet enrolled at the University. f. Medical/psychological records used in connection with treatment of the student. A physician or psychologist of the student’s choice may view such records.g. University Police Department records, when utilized for internal purposes by this office in its official capacities.3. Documents submitted to the University by or for the student will not be returned to the student. Normally, academic records received from other institutions will not be sent to third parties external to the University, nor will copies of such documents be given to the student. The student should request such records from the originating institution.4. Students have the right to request an amendment of the education record that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. Should a student believe his or her record is incorrect, he/she should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record he/she wants changed, and specify the information he/she feels is inaccurate or misleading. The official will respond within a reasonable period concerning his or her action. Should the student not be satisfied, a hearing may be requested of the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Success.5. Students have the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education record, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent (see C.3. below).  family edUCational rights and privaCy aCt 2018-2019     2756.

Smith, DirectorMcMurran Hall 165(757) 594-8762jonathan.smith@cnu.eduThe Minor Program in Asian Studies (18-21 credits)Asia is far and away the world’s largest land mass both in geographic and demographic terms. Its consideration as a unit, apart from and opposed to Europe and the West, is due to historical and cultural factors. In reality, Asia is home to tremendous cultural, religious, linguistic, political and environmental diversity. The continent’s historical position is also unique: Asia gave rise to some of the earliest civiliza-tions, while China and India remained the world’s economic centers throughout most of the Common Era.Recent decades have seen the reemergence of Asian societies on the global political and economic scene, a trend likely to continue in coming years. CNU’s minor in Asian Studies aims to offer interested students a structured overview of the cultures, economies, histories, philosophies, politics and religions of East, South and Southeast Asia. Students may take individual courses without committing to the entire program.  Program Objectives:1. Provide an Asia-focused area studies minor combining the structured overview of an introductory course with the depth offered in more specialized and advanced courses.2. Complement work done in the student’s major by offer-ing a focus on Asia that is otherwise unavailable.  3. Formally document a student’s concentrated study of Asia. 4. Assist students with interest in Asia by integrating all relevant coursework and providing Asia-focused extra-curricular and study abroad opportunities.Program Requirements:1.   Socialization and Society, 316, 319, 320; GEOG/.

The minor will approach these issues from global and comparative, classical, modern, and postmodern perspectives.  1. . The Vision of Hinduism (3-3-0) Alternate Years. An ancient Hindu visionary proclaimed, “Truth is one, though religious teachers call it by many names” (Rig-Veda).  In other words, truth is universal and not the possession of any one religion. Yet, due to the different contexts within which human beings experience the sacred, there are many different ways of envisioning the universal truths of religion.  Hinduism is rich with such visionary encounters with truth, as expressed, for instance, in the Vedas, the Upanishads, Vedanta, and Yoga. Depending on the focus of the course when it is offered, these topics may be addressed along with others, such as the guru-disciple relationship, worship of the gods, temple architecture and rituals, caste, paths to enlightenment, mythology, devotional poetry, and religious philosophy. "
RSTD 330,"  The Mystic Quest. Christian Prayer and Spirituality (3-3-0)   AIWTPrerequisite: Junior or senior standing or consent of instructor.Alternate years.Christianity, like other religions, has an inward spiritual or mystical dimension that has nurtured a continuous stream of mystics, saints, and spiritual visionaries over the last two millennia. For example, John Tauler, a 14th Century mystic, taught that “prayer is the ascent of the mind to God.” In this course, we will explore the lives, teachings, and spiritual practices of a wide array of Christian spiritual teachers from the beginning of Christian history to the present day. Along the way, we will focus on the stages of the mystical life as it has been charted by the spiritual masters of the Christian mystical life. More broadly, we will study the teachings of the Christian mystics for insights into the nature of religion, the validity of contemplative experience, and the meaning of human existence."

Cole, Gruber, Knies,Quinlan, Wiens Senior Lecturer: BrownLecturer: Harris, Knight, Lasseter, Liskin, ShimaTombolato-TerzićEmeriti: Chang, Hammer, Sacks Mission StatementThe Department of Molecular Biology and Chemis-try (MBCH) will develop a meaningful level of scientific literacy in all students through exploration of fundamental concepts and processes of the natural world.  Majors build upon this foundation and gain the necessary background, understanding, and experience to be successful in the fields of biology, chemistry and biochemistry; this is achieved through coursework complemented by research and inde-pendent study opportunities.  The MBCH faculty members are actively engaged in quality teaching, research, mentoring and service.  These traditions provide the model for our goal to instill motivation, intellectual drive, dedication, integrity, and professionalism in all of our graduates.The aims of the curriculum and faculty in the Depart-ment of Molecular Biology and Chemistry are to acquaint students with the body of knowledge in these disciplines and to teach them to apply this knowledge usefully and re-sponsibly.  Coursework includes discussion of historical and philosophical developments of biology and chemistry.  The biology program is organized to enable majors to survey the entire field of biology and also to focus in one of a number of areas including molecular biology, cellular biology, micro-biology, physiology and genetics.  The chemistry program allows the major student to develop a solid foundation in the core areas of chemistry and provides upper-level coursework in more specialized areas such as biochemistry and environ-mental, atmospheric, and advanced organic chemistry.  Both programs offer excellent preparation for one of the many health professional programs.  The department offers two degrees: the Bachelor of Sci-ence in biology and the Bachelor of Science in chemistry.  Within the Bachelor of Science in biology there are four pos-sible majors and within the Bachelor of Science in chemistry there are two possible majors. Additional information about the department, the degrees offered, and other opportunities can be obtained from the department office or the department website at mbch.cnu.edu.Note that the Department of Organismal and Envi-ronmental Biology offers the Bachelor of Arts in biology.  Additional biology courses and more details on the envi-ronmental biology and organismal biology majors can be found in the Department of Organismal and Environmental Biology section.Health-Related ProfessionsThe CNU Pre-med and Pre-health Program can help students from any academic major prepare for application to medical school and other health profession programs. Many students find that a biology or chemistry major provides excellent preparation for these career choices.  The program offers a variety of resources, such as academic and career advising, mentoring, clinical internship opportunities, workshops and seminars to help any highly motivated student gain admission to the professional school of her or his choice.  Additional information can be obtained at prehealth.cnu.edu or by contacting the Director of Pre-health Programs, Dr. Gwynne D. Brown, at (757) 594-8255 or gwynne.brown@cnu.edu. The Bachelor of Arts Degree in BiologyThe Bachelor of Arts degree in biology, which is over-seen by the Department of Organismal and Environmental Biology, requires a minimum of 35 credits in biology. Stu-dents may present no more than two biology courses with grades lower than C- for the degree.

Pre-Physician’s AssistantThe typical Physician’s Assistant program lasts approximately 28 - 30 months and leads to a Masters in Physician Assistant Studies. Admission to a P.A. program is similar to that for other health careers, in that it is based on overall academic performance, performance in pre-requisite courses, personal statements, and letters of recommendation, including one from practicing P.A. In addition, most programs require a significant number of patient contact hours, therefore many students volunteer as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT-B) or become Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA).Pre-requisites for applying to a typical physician assistant program vary, therefore the list below is a guide only:1. , 313. Pre-Veterinary MedicineBecause there are relatively few Veterinary Medicine Schools in the U.S., criteria for admission is very competitive, despite the looming shortage of practicing veterinarians. A strong GRE score is important in addition to a solid academic performance. Many hours of experience with animals is paramount; admissions committees look for confidence and competence in animal handling skills. Exposure to a variety of animal groups (small, large and exotic) is also important. At least one letter of recommendation from a practicing veterinarian is required.Pre-requisites for applying to a typical veterinary medicine program:1. "

The majors consist of six courses (18 credit hours) beyond the business core curriculum.AccountingWhile accounting has been referred to as the “language of business,” it is really much more.  Accounting information is a critical element in the decision making processes of virtually all economic entities. Governments, nonprofit organizations, and individuals must all rely on accounting information in making economic decisions.Those with an understanding of accounting are in a unique position to provide valuable assistance to businesses and others making economic decisions.  As a result, there are always employment opportunities available for individuals with the skills to create, analyze, and interpret accounting information.Accountants are found at the highest levels of responsibility in a wide variety of organizations.  These include federal, state, and local governments and nonprofit organizations, as well as business and industry of all types.  82bUsiness, lUter sChool of  2018-2019Accounting graduates also frequently use their training to enhance non-accounting careers in management, finance, law and governmental administration. A degree in accounting provides a solid foundation for a variety of successful career paths.FinanceFinance is the lifeblood of business.  Without knowledge of the financial implications of business decisions, managers can make serious mistakes. Proper financial analysis helps business leaders make the choices that add value for the firm’s stakeholders, reflects the preferences of consumers, and facilitates economic growth and prosperity as innovative products and services receive the proper level of support from investors.  From an academic standpoint, finance sits at the intersection of many business disciplines. Using economic analysis of accounting statements, financial researchers and managers discern and enact successful corporate strategies. This includes how to make better decisions about everything from marketing activities to hiring decisions to information technology implementation.ManagementManagement offers the greatest flexibility and broadest application of all the business majors by challenging our students to understand both the social and technical aspects of an organization.  A major in management helps students develop the skills and tools necessary to pull both people and projects together in an effective and efficient manner, competencies that contribute greatly to the success of an organization.  In the Luter School of Business, management education does not just take place in the classroom; students learn by doing here.  Students work in teams to manage virtual companies using online simulation in which they apply business principles to make decisions about a future course of action.  Students learn to use critical thinking and analytical skills to make decisions and take action when facing a novel or complex problem.  Students also learn to express ideas clearly, and to lead, plan and organize a diverse and changing workforce.  An emphasis on ethical standards is an integral part of the management curriculum.  The management major prepares students for the challenges of our ever-changing, global, and information-rich society.MarketingThe field of marketing is hot, and the use of direct and interactive marketing in today’s business world is booming!  Direct and interactive marketing is now at the center of the communications revolution, and is being used with great fervor by businesses, organizations, associations and individuals across the world.  Today’s marketers must know how to leverage new information, communication, and distribution technologies to connect more effectively with customers in this digital age. Social and mobile media developments are dramatically changing how marketers create and communicate customer value. The CNU Luter School of Business is one of the few undergraduate institutions nationwide to offer a degree program specializing in cutting-edge direct and interactive marketing. This program emphasizes the development of integrated marketing communication strategies which support an organization’s mission and strategic business initiatives. Students will learn how to connect and engage with customers via database marketing targeting consumers with messages that are relevant, timely, and highly measurable.  This major offers many experiential learning opportunities enabling students to go beyond theories and strategies to the actual creation and implementation of marketing plans and campaigns for real-world companies.  Students are challenged to examine how digital marketing is evolving and how emerging technology can be used to engage consumers to create profitable customer relationships.  CNU’s marketing program is known and respected nationwide as its students have repeatedly won the highest and most coveted award in the direct and interactive marketing industry, the Collegiate Gold ECHO Award.All majors within the B.S.B.A. require the successful completion of the liberal learning curriculum, the pre-business requirements, and the business core.

Comparative and International Politics       (3-3-0)Fall and Spring.This course will introduce students to the political world beyond our borders. It combines the study of the international state system with the study of politics within states. The course will involve critical thinking about world issues and the organization of society and require students to debate contemporary political issues such as what responsibility rich countries have towards poor countries, legitimacy of tactics for pursuing political gains, when war is just and the challenges that exist to organizing internationally..A comparative study of the governmental processes of selected nations in terms of their ideologies, institutions, political organizations, and policies such as social welfare, crime control, urbanization, economic management, and foreign affairs. This course partially satisfies the writing intensive requirement..For millennia, philosophers, religious thinkers, and political activists have written about peace and war. Conflicts are found in all human communities; but peace is the state of mind everyone desires. This course examines the nature and causes of conflict, conflict resolution, and the foundations of peace. By analyzing different case studies, we discuss the sources, causes and determinants of conflict, present the various perspectives on conflict management, and study different ways of peacemaking. We study academic writings in international relations, politics, and conflict and peace studies to explore a variety of techniques employed in managing, resolving, and preventing conflict..This course provides a formal introduction to international law and international organizations and emphasizes the relationship between law and the political behavior of states, institutions, and other international actors in world politics. International law is more relevant than ever before. From the international wars to environmental challenges, from human rights violations to the question of statehood, globalization, and the law of war, international law has a direct influence on international affairs. This course focuses on the nature, sources, and applications of international law and analyses its effect on issues in contemporary international relations..Human rights and especially human rights violations are some of the most discussed issues on the international agenda. The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Israel/Palestine, Rwanda, and Sudan are only among the best-known examples involving gross violations of human rights. This course examines human rights issues from different academic perspectives including politics, history, and law. The main focus is on the international management of human rights and the protection of individuals and groups on the international level. A number of exemplary case studies are considered to illustrate achievements, efficiency, and outcome of today’s international human rights protection regime. .This course explores the impact of authoritarian rule, recent uprisings, and calls for change to the political, economic, social and cultural environment of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and discusses the juxtaposition of secular modernism and religious revival in the area. Different case studies will shed light on a region that has been the focus of international attention and scrutiny in both public political discourse and in media coverage over the past decades..This course examines the threats posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to aspiring states and terrorist groups and the strategies that the United States and the international community have employed to prevent the spread of these weapons. Key topics that we will examine include the technologies necessary for these weapons, the relevant treaties and international agreements that attempt to prevent WMD proliferation, and the primary countries and terrorist groups that are attempting to acquire these weapons. or consent of instructor.This is a course that introduces students to regime change, democratic institutional design, and social transformations in contemporary Latin America. Students will learn about classical and novel theoretical perspectives that help us understand how differences in electoral systems, executive, and legislative structure affect political outcomes such as democratic regime stability and governability in Latin America. The last section of the course will explore important social phenomena in the region such as drug trafficking, corruption, indigenous people’s mobilization, and the rise of the new left. or consent of instructor.This course introduces students to the politics, society, and culture of East and Central European countries during three historical junctures in the region’s development – the interwar period of state formation, the years of communist rule, and the post-communist era. Students will learn about classical and novel theoretical perspectives that help us understand how differences in electoral systems, executive, and legislative structure affect political outcomes such as democratic regime stability and governability in post-communist East and Central Europe. The course will also explore important social phenomena in the region such as right-wing political extremism, corruption, ethnic conflict, and immigration issues..East Asia is one of the most economically dynamic regions in the world. The term “East Asian Politics,” however, collapses together a disparate array of political, economic, and social structures, institutions, and practices. One objective of this course is to disentangle each of these factors and examine their respective influences on the contemporary politics of these countries. While the course involves gaining an appreciation for East Asia’s historical richness and complexity, we will primarily focus on contemporary issues related to the “East Asian economic development model,” which reflects the unique relationship between political and economic development in this region..This course will examine the modern phenomenon of terrorism. We will define terrorism, consider its motivations, review the new dangers associated with terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction, and debate policy proposals that might be taken by democratic regimes to reduce the likelihood of terrorism or mitigate its consequences.  Although we will examine a number of different types of terrorism and terrorist groups (including left-wing and right-wing terrorism), we will pay particular attention to the events leading up to and following September 11, 2001 – including a close examination of Al Qaeda and the U.S. “war on terrorism.” or consent of instructor. Restricted to junior and senior standing.This course introduces students to the study of international political economy (IPE). It addresses the reciprocal and interactive relationship between politics and economics in the historical and contemporary international system by exploring the effect of political factors on international economic relations as well as the impact of economic factors on domestic and international politics. The course introduces the theoretical frameworks that guide the study of IPE, and applies these frameworks to the relations between principal state and non-state actors in a variety of issues in IPE, including international trade, foreign investment flows, international monetary relations, currency crises, international development, and global governance..This course is designed to provide students with an overview of contemporary environmental politics, primarily looking at the developed world of advanced capitalist societies. Because environmental problems do not stop at international borders, environmental solutions require international cooperation. We will seek to understand why that cooperation is so difficult to achieve. Topics include the dynamics of environmental politics in different states, the processes of environmental policy making, stumbling blocks to reaching international agreement, and the role of different actors: multi-national corporations, policy makers, scientific experts, political parties, the public, the media, and the environmental lobby..Fall, alternate years.A seminar examining the central international relations theories including realism, neo-realism, liberalism, neo-liberalism, within the context of contemporary world issues. This course partially safisties the writing intensive requirement. .Conflicts in the Balkans, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Darfur, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Sri Lanka, and India, among others, have led to tremendous human suffering and massive political mobilization. This course provides an overview of the causes, character, and dynamics of ethnic conflicts and the strategies that can be employed to resolve them. It discusses the relationship between the theory of nationalism and ethnic conflict and puts issues accompanying ethnic conflict in a broader context of international politics.

Courses in communication examine the nature, use, role and interpretation of messages produced by, and for, individuals, communities and cultures.  Students majoring in communication will learn to understand, interpret, produce and critique messages within the contexts of interpersonal, media and public culture.The Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication Studies Since antiquity, scholars and practitioners have explored and grappled with the power of human communication—as a tool for persuasion, as a means of establishing and building relationships, and as a fundamental way to create meaning. Faculty in the Department of Communication focus on how human beings create and employ messages to accomplish these important purposes. Courses in communication focus on how those messages affect people, how they shape the thinking that individuals and communities do, and how they shape and reinforce the cultures and social structures in which we live. Students majoring in communication learn broadly about the nature and function of messages in relational, public, and mediated contexts. They learn how to understand and insightfully critique the function and power of messages. They also learn how to be more skilled and ethical producers of messages—as professionals and as citizens in a democratic society.In addition to requiring successful completion of the liberal learning curriculum, the major in communication studies requires the following courses:1.

All environmental studies majors will be equipped to critically analyze policy statements and public discourse regarding the environment. In addition, research methodologies and environmental theory will form the basis for student investigations. Students graduating with a major in environmental studies will be well placed for employment in the public or private sectors, or, alternatively, possess an integrated foundation which will serve them well in graduate school. Environmental studies majors will leave CNU with an expertise that is becoming more crucial to civic engagement as we progress through the current millennium. Program Objectives:  1. To provide an opportunity for students to understand and access the complexity of environmental challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective and to design and implement solutions to these challenges.2. To provide courses and course-project activities that are oriented toward offering policy options and other potential solutions to decision makers at the university, community, state, federal and international levels.3. To offer a program that will document the student’s sustained commitment to the interdisciplinary study of the environment.Bachelor of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies, Environmental Studies MajorEnvironmental studies majors are required to complete courses across numerous disciplines.

Puaca, SellarsAssistant Professor: Allison, Black, StennerLecturer: C. CartwrightEmeriti: Bostick, Mazzarella, Morris, Saunders,Sishagne Mission StatementThe mission of the Christopher Newport University Department of History is to serve the University and the Commonwealth by acting as a bridge to the humanities, the social sciences and the hard sciences. The Department’s offerings complement these areas of learning by encouraging students to reach out and understand not only the history of human development through the ages but also to seek out the answers to society’s contemporary problems and issues. The academic environment of the Department of History embraces all aspects of national, Western, and global history. By means of comprehensive offerings of courses at the introductory, upper, and graduate levels of study, the Department cultivates in its students an appreciation and zeal for learning that encompasses both theoretical and applied bodies of knowledge. To that end, the Department and its committed faculty impart to students and the community at large lessons from the great chronicle of human experience - intellectual, political, cultural, economic, and spiritual.  Faculty share their own intellectual curiosity and dedication to learning through effective teaching, significant research and scholarship, and active community service.The Department of History offers the Bachelor of Arts degree in history, a minor program, and general and specific courses for all students interested in studying history for personal enrichment or for meeting their professional needs.  Survey courses are offered by which students may fulfill the liberal learning curriculum requirements, major or minor prerequisites, and education certification requirements.  Courses are offered in American, European, Latin American, African, Middle Eastern, and Asian history, as well as themes in ancient and modern eras.The study of history provides an excellent foundation for careers in areas such as teaching, business, law, politics and international development, public administration, journalism, communications, archaeology, public history and museum work, the ministry, the foreign service and the military, and graduate study.  Students are taught valuable skills such as: analysis of texts, documents and artifacts; the tools and methods of research; collection and organization of information; critical evaluation of conflicting interpretations; and the preparation and presentation of oral and written reports or reviews.Beyond these, the student who majors or minors in history is able to bring the breadth and depth of the human experience to illuminate and give perspective to his or her workday and personal world.  In short, because history brings together all the scattered areas of study, there is not a field that cannot be enriched by studying history. Last, but not least, the study of history is endlessly fascinating, enriching, enjoyable, and can remain so for a lifetime.The Bachelor of Arts Degree in HistoryIn addition to requiring successful completion of the liberal learning curriculum, the Bachelor of Arts degree in history requires successful completion of the following (36 credits):1.

Students admitted to the program upon matriculation receive scholarships renewable annually as long as they enroll in Honors courses as required and adhere to the standards for student progress below.The Honors Program lays the groundwork for excellence through a series of highly interactive interdisciplinary seminars. This intensive, integrative approach to the liberal arts allows students—working with Honors advisors in their major disciplines—the opportunity to personalize academic plans that help fulfill personal and professional aspirations.  Honors Inquiries encourage students to incorporate individualized initiatives into their curricula: independent study and research to hone methods of inquiry; volunteer or compensated experience of civic and social significance; and the culturally enriching experience of studying abroad and reflecting on global issues. Honors students may also enroll in some upper-level courses earlier than usual, or fashion interdisciplinary clusters of courses to fulfill a specialized interest.  In short, the Honors Program helps students to become informed, responsible citizens while encouraging them to prepare purposefully for outstanding opportunities, such as prestigious scholarships, and to proceed into graduate studies and/or fulfilling careers.  The director, advised by the Honors faculty, administers the Honors Program as a University program.Why Be an Honors Student?•	Honors faculty design special, interdisciplinary seminars and set expectations to encourage rigorous, creative thought. •	Honors students receive renewable residential scholarships of up to $10,000 (minimum of 3.00 semester and 3.30 cumulative GPA required) for up to four years (eight semesters).•	Honors scholarship winners are entitled to a one time study abroad scholarship of $2000.•	Honors students receive priority registration, thus making schedule planning convenient and purposeful.•	Honors students receive intensive academic advising and mentoring for internships, prestigious scholarships, and graduate studies.•	During their first year, Honors students live together in Learning Communities tied to their "
HONR 100," seminar,  a community of students serious about education and respectful of one another’s aspirations.•	The Honors Program provides stipends to support special academic experiences (see below).•	The Honors Program offers credit-bearing experiences for international study. •	Completion of the Honors Program is acknowledged on all transcripts.Entering the ProgramApplications to the Honors Program will be reviewed for strength of high school curriculum, including core curriculum courses, as well as a high school grade-point-average of at least 3.75 (on a 4.00 scale), and a minimum total score of 1310 (1250 if taken before March 2016) on the SATs or a composite score of 28 on the ACT (at least 25 on the ACT verbal). First-year students may also be admitted by applying no later than Thanksgiving; a minimum grade point average of 3.50 is required for consideration. Students with a minimum grade point average of 3.50 transferring to CNU from an Honors Program at another university or college are guaranteed admission to the Program. Transfer students interested in the Honors Program should contact Dr. Paul after formal admission to CNU and prior to their first term registration.2018-2019                      honorshonors programDr. Jay S.

The Church and the State (3-3-0) AIWTAlternate Years.  There is no more controversial issue these days than the relationship between church and state. Some believe that religion is a private matter and best left out of the political arena because it creates division and conflict.

The discipline explores language in society, the nature of language variation and issues of power, prestige, and prejudice accruing to language use.The interdisciplinary linguistics minor anchors in two foundation courses, Introduction to Linguistics and a course in the Structure of Language (in English, French, German,  Spanish or Latin). Students then explore how a linguistically informed approach to language fuels both theoretical and applied inquiry in diverse disciplines. For example, sociology and anthropology explore cultural and ethnic differences in communicative style and language use around the world; psychology explores child language acquisition, language and the brain, and the psychology of language; computer science might examine the syntactically and semantically well formed expressions in the artificial language of Java; and philosophy explores different theories of the nature and structure of language and the role that language plays in determining what is counted as truth, knowledge, and reality.Students will learn how to uncover assumptions about language, they will learn how to make, test and revise hypotheses, and how to construct logical arguments pertaining to the nature of language. In this way, the linguistics minor supports our liberal arts mission as students further deepen skills of critical thinking and analysis. Program Objectives:1. Combine two focused foundation courses with the depth offered by diverse advanced courses.2. Complement work done in the student’s major by offering a focus on linguistics that is otherwise unavailable. Students of any major may take the minor in linguistics but it may be of particular interest to majors in English; philosophy and religious studies; modern and classical languages and literatures; fine art and art history; psychology; communication; sociology, and anthropology and social work.Program requirements1.

Philosophy of language asks and attempts to answer questions such as: What is language? What is meaning? How do uses of language understand one another? What is the connection between names and the objects to which they refer? Are the truth and falsehood of our statements determined by the world, or by our linguistic conventions? Can we think without language? Do we have an innate linguistic faculty or do we learn to speak by observing the behavior of other speakers? The attempts to answer such questions are the source of various philosophical theories about language."

Gordon, Larson,   J. M. Smith, Varo VaroLecturer: Davis, McInnis, Motta, Seuchie, ValdezInstructor: Obeid Emeriti: Reppen, St. Onge Mission StatementOur degree programs require students actively to engage with world cultures--both ancient and modern—primarily through the rigorous study of language, which empowers our students to contemplate these cultures with unique insight by progressing beyond a reliance on English descriptions and equivalencies. Students of modern languages hone their linguistic skills by speaking, reading, writing, and listening to the target language; in upper-level classes they apply these linguistic skills to analyzing literature and culture. Students of Greek and Latin focus on reading and interpreting ancient literature, supporting this reading with the study of ancient social history and material culture. All students have opportunities to study abroad as part of their coursework. They also conduct research and develop their capacity for critical thinking, public speaking, and polished writing—the essential tools for professional success in any field. Upon completing our curriculum, students have acquired a more global perspective by deepening their understanding of one or more non-U.S. cultures.The ProgramThe Department of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures offers courses and programs that are designed to teach students to understand a foreign language; to develop skills in speaking, reading, and writing as appropriate; and to promote understanding and appreciation of foreign cul-tures and literatures. The department also helps students to prepare for advanced graduate and professional degrees, the teaching professions, the domestic and international business world, government work, social work, careers in science and medicine, and work in and relating to the fine and performing arts. Thus, modern and classical languages and literatures are both an integral part of the liberal arts program and of many different career-oriented programs at the University. The department offers the Bachelor of Arts with majors in classical studies, French, German, and Spanish. Also avail-able are teacher education programs in Spanish and TESOL, and minor programs in Asian studies, classical studies, Greek studies, international culture and business, Latin American studies, middle eastern and north African studies, French, German, Latin and Spanish.Foreign Language Placement RecommendationsGeneral Language Policies1. Students who demonstrate proficiency at one level may not take a lower-level course for credit without the permission of the Department.2. Native speakers of languages other than English may not receive credits for 100-level courses or 300-level conversation courses in the native language.Second Language Literacy RequirementAll CNU students must successfully complete one course (three credits) in a modern or classical language at the 200 level or higher, or the equivalent, in order to graduate.  Satisfying the Second Language Literacy RequirementStudents are strongly encouraged to complete the requirement during the freshman or sophomore year.

Its primary emphasis is on the development of the skills and knowledge necessary to function as a teacher, performer, composer, and scholar. The areas of concentration include pre-certification choral, pre-certification instrumen-tal, composition, and performance.The Bachelor of Arts degree in fine and performing arts provides a strong education in the liberal arts, irrespective of specific career aspirations. The degree provides a funda-mental knowledge of written and aural skills, the history and development of music, and performance. This degree serves individuals who seek a broad program of general education rather than intense specialization in the undergraduate years.The Master of Arts in Teaching degree is offered with concentrations in choral and instrumental music education. Students accepted into the M.A.T. program graduate in four years with the Bachelor of Music degree with a concentration in either pre-certification choral or instrumental and then complete an additional year of study leading to the M.A.T. degree and teacher certification (PK-12). For more information, see the CNU Graduate Catalog. Assessment ProceduresThe rigor of the academic curriculum of the music pro-gram at Christopher Newport University is ensured through a comprehensive curriculum, highly experienced and qualified professors, numerous assessment procedures, and accredita-tion by the National Association of Schools of Music and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.Entrance RequirementsAcceptance is highly competitive, for the department admits each year approximately two majors per voice part or instrument. A student intending to matriculate in the music program at CNU must first satisfy all entrance requirements, including an entrance audition, interview, two professional recommendations by music educators, entrance examina-tions in music theory and ear training, and acceptance into the University.Degree Program Continuance Requirements The major in music requires an enormous commitment of time and energy toward academic study, individual practice, and ensemble rehearsal. Although admission into the major is highly competitive, music majors who continue to experi-ence significant challenges by the end of the first year should consider changing their major. Music majors are reviewed at the completion of their fourth semester for continuation in either the Bachelor of Music or the Bachelor of Arts degree program, referred to as, “Sophomore Check Point.” The re-view committee consists of full-time music faculty members elected each year by the full-time music faculty. In order to be considered for continuation in the degree, the student must have earned a grade of C- or higher in the following courses: improvisation (.

Velkey, DirectorForbes Hall 1053(757) 594-7927avelkey@cnu.eduFacultyProfessor: CartwrightAssociate Professor: Grau, Meighan, Mitrano, Velkey, Webb Assistant Professor: Campolattaro, Lipatova, Rollins, WiensMission StatementThe Neuroscience Program is an interdisciplinary degree program housed within the College of Natural and Behavioral Sciences. Upon successful completion of the curriculum, students are awarded a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies with a Major in Neuroscience. The mission of the Neuroscience Program is to offer students a comprehensive, rigorous, interdisciplinary curriculum in neuroscience and its many ancillary professional applications. Excellence in didactic and laboratory investigation is the objective of this program. Students will gain a systematic introduction to the scientific methodologies, theories, and literature focused on the anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry of the nervous system. In addition, students will develop skills in conducting independent research on aspects of neural functioning reflecting both molar and molecular levels of analysis.  The members of the Neuroscience Program faculty are dedicated to presenting their students with engaging and challenging courses in the current, basic and applied discipline of neuroscience and presenting them the opportunity to engage in a diversity of undergraduate research projects in basic and applied neuroscience.Curricular Relevance to Graduate EducationThe neuroscience curriculum prepares our undergraduates for highly selective and competitive graduate programs. We aim to produce graduates prepared for and qualified to pursue postgraduate study in neuroscience, psychology, biology, pharmaceutical and medical chemistry, and medicine. As well, the interdisciplinary major in neuroscience is integral to a broad liberal arts and science undergraduate education. Our key and central objective lies in training scholars, teachers, and practitioners who will exercise their intelligence, industriousness, and integrity in the pursuit of productive personal and professional lives.Neuroscience and Pre-Medical EducationThe 2009 report of the Association of American Medical Colleges - Howard Hughes Medical Institute on Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians describes eight general competencies that should be explicit in each applicant at the time of medical school matriculation. The neuroscience curriculum is designed to produce graduates who meet all eight competencies and who will compete successfully for admission to elite medical schools (generally meaning those with an explicit research orientation as opposed to those who specialize only in practitioner preparation).The eight competencies from the AAMC-HHMI report  are:1. Apply quantitative reasoning and appropriate mathematics to describe or explain phenomena of the natural world.2. Demonstrate understanding of the process of scientific inquiry, and explain how scientific knowledge is discovered and validated.3. Demonstrate knowledge of basic physical principles and their applications to the understanding of living systems.4. Demonstrate knowledge of basic principles of chemistry and some of their applications to the  understanding of living systems.5. Demonstrate knowledge of how biomolecules contribute to the structure and function of cells.6. Apply understanding of principles of how molecular and cell assemblies, organs, and organisms develop structure and carry out function.7. Explain how organisms sense and control their internal environment and how they respond to external change.8. Demonstrate and understanding of how the organizing principle of evolution by natural selection explains the diversity of life on earth.The Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary StudiesNeuroscience MajorThe neuroscience curriculum includes the neuroscience core and electives as well as additional required coursework in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology and optional coursework in computer science. The Bachelor of Science degree in interdisciplinary studies with a major in neuroscience requires the successful completion of a minimum of 55 credits in the major. In addition to the successful completion of the liberal learning curriculum, the degree requires successful completion of the following courses:1. Core: "

M. Thompson, UnderwoodAssociate Professor: Jelinek, Silverman, TimaniAssistant Professor: Balay, GardnerSenior Lecturer: HutchinsonLecturer: Homan, TweedtEmeriti: Campbell, Beauchamp, Powell, Rose, Teschner Mission StatementThe mission of the Department of Philosophy and Religion is to foster rational investigation toward the great philosophical questions of existence, knowledge, ethics and religious thought and practice. The department focuses on engaging students in ways of knowing and believing in diverse cultures and religions in the ancient, medieval, modern and contemporary world.The faculty seeks to cultivate a learning environment in which students broaden their perspectives, refine their thinking, and learn to reason and communicate in a critical, clear, and consistent manner. Students and faculty work together addressing timeless questions related to the human search for meaning, truth, value and spirituality.   Majoring in Philosophy and Religion at CNU prepares students for graduate study in diverse fields including philosophy, theology, seminary, law, education, and international studies, as well as for living a productive and creative life in any vocation. In addition to preparing people for a profession in these fields and for an enriched life generally, philosophy is also an entry point for a variety of other professions. Philosophy majors enter graduate school for advanced degrees in various humanities disciplines and then go on to college-level teaching. Others enter graduate programs in business administration or law, for which training in logical analysis and value-awareness provides an excellent background. According to the Law School Admission Council data, philosophy and theology students rank first or second highest in performance on the LSAT among a set of 29 disciplines surveyed. Additionally, philosophy majors have among the highest rates of acceptance to law school of any major. The offerings of the department fully prepare students for graduate work in philosophy and religion as well as for the continuation of their education in other academic disciplines. Students who minor in philosophy are enriched in their understanding of their major field of study by gaining broader insight into its intellectual history and theoretical presuppositions. Students who take only a few courses in philosophy benefit by enhancing their persuasive, expressive, and analytic skills. A liberal arts degree in general and a philosophy degree specifically situates students in the deepest reflections of humanity, empowering them to go into a broad range of practical professions that make use of critical reasoning and necessary communication skills in a dramatically changing world.The Department of Philosophy and Religion offers the Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, the Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy with concentrations in Pre-Seminary Studies or Studies in Religion and a minor in philosophy. These concentrations allow students to explore their primary areas of interest while pursing a Philosophy degree.The Pre-seminary concentration provides the student with a broad view of various religions and a focus on the discipline of theology while at the same time applying  religious concepts to issues of value and practice. The concentration seeks to prepare the student for further studies in religion beyond those encountered in their undergraduate education. Students who concentrate in pre-seminary studies are expected to do a practicum in the religion of their choice.  The area provides opportunity to do field work at churches, mosques, synagogues, and Buddhist and Hindu temples.The Studies in Religion concentration enables students to engage in the empathetic and critical analysis of religious traditions in order to understand their historical development and their present character. As an academic discipline, religion does not seek to promote or to censure any particular creed, institution, or way of life. Rather, it involves the exploration and clarification of diverse religious traditions with particular attention towards their similarities and differences. As a part of a liberal education, the studies in religion concentration fosters curiosity about the world’s religious traditions and an awareness of one’s own religious and cultural heritage both through knowledge of the religious traditions influencing one’s own personal life and culture and also through knowledge of other traditions having comparable influence in the lives of other persons and in other cultures. Such awareness should aid in understanding and articulating personal convictions in relation to matters of religious concern. A central focus of the studies in religion concentration is the Vision Course Series. These courses explore the diverse visions of life opened up by religious traditions.  They also provide insight into how cultures shape and are shaped by religions.department of philosophy and religionDr. Kip H.

What information is needed, who needs it, and how to distribute and manage it are key elements in achieving an organization’s strategic goals.The field of information systems has expanded tremendously in its focus during the past decade. With the rise of the internet, it is no longer sufficient to prepare only for traditional business and organizational needs such as payroll. Applications that formerly required trained specialists are now self-service operations, mediated by the internet (e.g., airline reservations). In this climate of accelerated change, ubiquitous computing, and 24/7 access, the information systems major must be well-rounded with a thorough grounding in computer science. In addition, the IS major must be able to interact with people and understand the way organizations behave. Without these technical and organizational skills, it is not possible to analyze and design information systems.  Graduates will be prepared for further study in graduate school or employment as systems analysts, systems designers, or network designers or managers.The core courses provide a background in computer science, mathematics, and physics. The major and support courses develop information systems foundations in both technical and organizational areas. Because of the wide variety of information systems needs, students also select additional courses in multimedia, data structures, programming languages, networking, psychology and business.

Our academic offerings accomplish this by focusing on the core areas of the discipline of Political Science, which include American politics, political theory, and comparative politics and international relations. American government courses teach students about the forces that influence politics in the United States and how governmental institutions in this country operate. Political theory courses raise awareness of the deep and fundamental questions asked for centuries by classical and contemporary philosophers. Comparative politics and international relations courses provide students with an understanding of political systems from around the world and help them to understand the dynamics of international politics and the functioning of global institutions. Students are also taught how critical analysis and the scientific method can be applied to understand the workings of government and politics.The Department of Political Science offers a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. A degree in political science prepares students for a wide range of employment opportunities in both the public and private sectors, and serves as a foundation for law or graduate school. Our students have gone on to successful careers in local, state, and national government, academics, politics, the legal field, law enforcement, engineering, and the military.  Additionally, some of the department’s course offerings may be used to fulfill the university’s liberal learning curriculum requirements. The effects of politics and government seep into all areas of life, and thus our students are well equipped to handle a variety of situations. Students who study political science are able to make more informed decisions in both their professional and personal worlds, thereby helping to make them responsible democratic citizens.  Graduate Studies PreparationThe Bachelor of Arts in political science is excellent preparation for admission to and success in graduate school.  Recent graduates have gone on to study at schools such as University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, University of Michigan, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, The College of William and Mary, George Mason University, American University, Virginia Tech University, University of Illinois, University of Florida, University of Mississippi, University of San Diego, and University of Maryland. Students interested in pursuing graduate studies should consult their academic advisors to plan an appropriate course of study.Law School PreparationThe Bachelor of Arts in political science is excellent preparation for admission to and success in law school. Courses involving rigorous analytical skills are strongly recommended by law school admissions committees. Recent graduates have been admitted to law schools at schools such as University of Richmond, University of Virginia, The College of William and Mary, George Mason University, University of Delaware, University of Nebraska, Pennsylvania State University, University of Pittsburgh, and University of Wisconsin. Students interested in attending law school should contact their academic advisors to plan an appropriate course of study. For additional information on law school preparation, see the Pre-Law Program located in this catalog.Internship OpportunitiesWe encourage our majors to take political and government-related internships at the local, state, federal, and international levels. Internships might be as varied as working with government agencies, international organizations, political campaigns, private firms, or domestic or  foreign-based non-profit organizations.Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political ScienceThe major in political science is a rigorous academic program that provides a general liberal arts background for the study of politics and government. The Department’s faculty presents a diversity of ideological orientations and methodological approaches that offer students a wide variety of viewpoints and perspectives on political issues.The major in political science requires successful completion of 36 credit hours, including the following:  1.

Therefore, like most colleges and universities, CNU does not offer a pre-law major. Rather, our liberal learning curriculum helps students from all majors prepare for application to law school. In addition to offering all the pre-requisite coursework, CNU offers a variety of resources, such as academic and career advising, mentoring, internship opportunities, workshops, and seminars to help any highly-motivated student gain admission to the law school of his or her choice. Many of these resources are offered through the Pre-Law Program, which hosts a variety of events focused on preparing for law school, determining if law school is right for you, and crafting a strong law school application. Students who join the Pre-Law Program are also assigned an advisor who can answer individual questions. All students interested in law school are also encouraged to join Christopher Newport University’s chapter of Phi Alpha Delta. Our chapter of this national, co-educational fraternity offers pre-law education and peer-to-peer support. In addition, students with high levels of academic achievement and the motivation to prepare early should apply to the Pre-Law Scholars program. This program offers intensive mentoring to maximize law school preparation.   How to Get Started1. Consult our web page, prelaw.cnu.edu, for details about upcoming Pre-Law Program events and to learn more about the Pre-Law Scholars Program.2. Contact Dr. Michelle Kundmueller, michelle.kundmueller@cnu.edu, and ask to join the Pre-Law Program. You will be informed of all our events and, depending on your major, be given an advisor with whom you can discuss your plans. If you qualify, apply to the Pre-Law Scholars Program (qualifications and application procedure are explained at prelaw.cnu.edu).3. Join and be an active member of Phi Alpha Delta, the pre-law fraternity. Membership is open to all Christopher Newport University students. Suggested CoursesWhile no specific courses are required for law school admission, courses that require you to write extensively, think critically, and analyze information from multiple disciplines are helpful toward preparing for the rigors of law school. Both the constitutional studies concentration in the American studies major and/or the philosophy of law minor offer courses particularly relevant to such preparation.Students who wish to have coursework that focuses on legal issues should consider taking some of the following courses: "

The sociology major includes concentrations in anthropology and criminology; minors in anthropology and sociology are also available, as well as a program of Teacher Preparation. Sociology majors acquire a strong liberal arts background as well as experience in understanding society from a sociological perspective. The major emphasizes and develops the ability to analyze significant social issues, conduct research, and communicate the results of scholarly investigation. Majors in sociology learn to apply conceptual models and conduct research in the context of a global and broadly comparative perspective on the world today. The major in sociology provides practical skills for the work-world, valuable preparation for graduate study, and a solid foundation for intelligent citizen participation.The Bachelor of Arts degree in social work offers a strong liberal arts base and has the principal educational objective of preparing students for beginning generalist social work practice. The highly integrated curriculum includes sequences of study in social welfare policy and services, human behavior and the social environment, research, and social work practice. Coursework includes the study of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities; it also integrates content on values and ethics of the profession, diversity and special populations, social and economic justice, and a strengths perspective.  The culmination of the major is the educationally directed field instruction which places students in social agencies in the community. Graduates find employment in public and private social service agencies in fields such as family and child welfare, health, mental health, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, schools, corrections, and probation.  Mission StatementThe Department of Sociology, Social Work and Anthropology’s mission is to present the intellectual foundations of sociology, social work, anthropology, criminology and geography. Built on a strong liberal arts base, our programs are mindful of each discipline’s responsibility to mentor students who will be engaged citizens in a multicultural, diverse and global society. Our instructional mission is to provide students with knowledge and skills that are applicable to a broad range of settings, including the public and private sector, and to better prepare students to pursue graduate and professional degrees in sociology, social work, anthropology, criminology and related disciplines. In addition to these, the social work program prepares students for entry level social work practice. We emphasize each discipline’s core concepts, theories, bodies of knowledge, techniques of social research, the ability to think critically, and the clear expression of ideas, both written and oral. This educational mission promotes scientific and intellectual inquiry and fosters qualities of leadership. Finally, our programs advocate service to the community and Commonwealth.The Bachelor of Arts degree in SociologySociology majors are required to take "

Program is to prepare highly qualified teachers who are licensed to teach in the Commonwealth of Virginia and in reciprocal states throughout the United States.Five-Year Teacher Preparation ProgramsCNU has teacher preparation programs leading to a B.A. (Bachelor of Arts), B.S. (Bachelor of Science) or B.M. (Bachelor of Music) and an M.A.T. (Master of Arts in Teaching). These programs qualify students for a license to teach elementary and secondary school in the state of Virginia. Application to these programs is made during the second semester of the junior year. Because course sequencing is critical to success, interested students should talk to an advisor about the Five-Year M.A.T. early in their program. The Five-Year M.A.T. will require that students take two or more graduate level courses in their senior year. Students who wish to pursue teacher preparation should consult the teacher preparation sections in the individual department (listed below) and the CNU Graduate Catalog for a description of the Master of Arts in Teaching Program.Areas of Teaching and Required DegreesElementary, grades PK-6 TrackThe grades PK-6 track requires teaching all subjects in elementary school.

Lloyd, Shuhy Emeriti: Hillow, WoodMission Statement• To OFFER our students the means to become a liberally educated person of the theater;• To PROVIDE an intellectually and artistically stimulating environment in which to study the art of theater within a liberal arts context;• To PRACTICE the art of theater by actively engaging in a search for vital connections between theater’s role in the past and present, and its future purpose in the world;• To PREPARE our students for success at the finest graduate schools and the world of professional theater;• To BROADEN our students’ understanding of society and culture by exploring personal expression through a variety of theatrical disciplines;• To ENRICH our students awareness and appreciation for the art of theater as central to the liberal arts;• To SERVE as a major artistic and cultural resource for Christopher Newport University and the greater Hampton Roads community.For more than twenty-five centuries the art of theater has illuminated human feeling and behavior. A self-rewarding humanist discipline, the study of theater stimulates self-knowledge, intensifies social awareness, encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and holds a vital place in liberal arts education. The Department of Theater and Dance offers a Bachelor of Arts degree in fine and performing arts with a major in theater, a minor in theater as well as a minor in dance.A theater education at CNU combines hands-on experience in all aspects of stagecraft—acting, directing, playwriting, music-theater/dance, design/technical theater, stage management and theater management with a critical appreciation of dramatic literature.  A rigorous yet flexible curriculum balances classroom study with practical production application.  Our production season includes four ambitious mainstage offerings and between five and eight second-stage and experimental productions.The Department of Theater and Dance, which produces under the banner TheaterCNU, practices professionalism. Through small classes, attentive advising and active collaboration, the faculty of professional theater artists, scholars and practitioners mentor the artistic development and academic progress of each student.  The Department of Theater and Dance prepares its graduates for a variety of professional opportunities, graduate study and careers in theater education.The Department of Theater and Dance is housed in CNU’s Ferguson Center for the Arts: a state-of-the-art performance and teaching facility housing two theaters of 440 and 125 seats, along with scenic and costume shops, design labs, dance and rehearsal studios, classrooms and theater library.The Department of Theater and Dance is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre (NAST) and holds students to high artistic standards, collaborative conduct and scholastic achievement. The program requires incentive and commitment—in the classroom, the rehearsal hall, backstage and in performance. The program expects all students to embrace appropriate discipline and professional conduct. These expectations, policies and practices are clearly articulated in the TheaterCNU Handbook. The Handbook is updated each year and is used in conjunction with this catalog when framing a student’s course of study in theater. The Department of Theater and Dance offers various levels of artistic skill-based classes. Students frequently find it valuable and desirable to take some of these upper-level classes a second time in order to enhance skill in a particular area such as design, acting, and dance. The department offers students the opportunity to retake many of these upper-level skill classes for additional credit. The expectations, assessment procedures, and grading of these classes is done on a case-by-case basis and is designed to best accommodate and serve the student repeating a class. The classes currently designated as repeatable for credit are: "

Stage combat is the art of creating the illusion of violence on stage, or, to quote Bruce Lee from Enter the Dragon, “Fighting without fighting”.  As with the study of martial arts, the study of stage combat must begin with empty-hand, or unarmed, combat to master the use of our own bodies before moving on to the use of weapons. This class explores the governing concepts and principles of safety and dramatic effect applicable to all combat styles, armed and unarmed, through instruction in a myriad of unarmed techniques. These theater and danCe 2018-20192692018-2019     theater and danCetechniques include falls, rolls, punches, kicks, grabs, blocks and avoidances. Yet in the end, staged violence must support the greater needs of story and character, thus great emphasis is placed on acting the fight.

Busch, DirectorMcMurran Hall 359E(757) 594-8498nbusch@cnu.eduThe Minor in U.S. National Security Studies (21 Credits)As the United States enters the second decade of the 21st Century, it faces a multitude of new and unprecedented threats to its national security interests. From the proven and suspected weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs in North Korea, Iran, and Syria, to the ongoing War on Terrorism, the collective threats to U.S. national security are serious and enduring.Given this dangerous international environment, there is a pressing need both to improve our understanding of the threats facing the United States and to prepare the next generation of governmental leaders to meet the challenges facing the nation. This interdisciplinary minor brings together the courses across the curriculum that would help prepare the future diplomats, intelligence analysts, and academic scholars in the field of U.S. National Security.The minor will accomplish these goals by exploring the rich, and often controversial, legacy of U.S. diplomatic and national security policies from its founding to the present, beginning with the principles of U.S. foreign policy rooted in the Constitution and tracing the evolution of U.S. national security through the Cold War and Post-Cold War eras. The minor will also examine the specific internal mechanisms by which national security policies are formulated, as well as the theoretical debates in international relations scholarship.  These debates concern the nature of the international system, the role of power, calculations of national interest, and the effect of institutions such as international law in governing state behavior. Finally, the minor will study the political and historical contexts for current regional conflict areas, and the “new dimensions” of U.S. national security including WMD proliferation, ethnic conflict and conflict resolution, the “War on Terrorism,” and human, environmental, and energy security.Program Objectives:1. Investigate the history and evolution of America’s national security interests and policies from the founding to the present, the contemporary international threats and challenges facing the United States, and the diplomatic and military mechanisms necessary for addressing these threats.2. Examine the specific internal mechanisms by which U.S. national security policies are formulated.3. Serve as a minor for those students who wish to extend their work in a major to include the study of U.S. national security.Program Requirements: 1. A minimum of 21 credits, chosen from the courses listed below, is needed to complete the minor.2. Core requirements: "
WGST 201,", equivalent] AIGMThis interdisciplinary course places the study of women and gender at the center of the curriculum. We will interrogate how gender has been socially constructed and maintained through a variety of institutions in both American society and worldwide. By focusing on intersections of gender with race, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and nation, we will also recognize the manifestations of power and privilege in everyday life. Among the topics we will address are: feminist history and theory; work, welfare, and poverty; body image, health care, and reproductive rights; violence; globalization; and the future of feminism. The following course descriptions appear in appropriate sections throughout the catalog.Core"
