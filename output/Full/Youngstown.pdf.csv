(http://www.ysu.edu/ysu-2020)Historical SketchYoungstown State University traces its beginnings to a commercial law courseoffered by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1908. The YMCAhad offered high school level and vocational courses since 1888, but it wantedto meet the college-level needs of area residents in a society undergoing rapidindustrialization and urbanization. The "Y" offered courses on law, business,and engineering, and in 1910, it even instituted a School of Law that grantedno degree but prepared students to take the bar exam. In 1916, the YMCAincorporated all of its educational work under the Youngstown AssociationSchool.By the early 1920s, the Ohio Board of Education granted the School of Lawthe power to confer the Bachelor of Science in Law degree, and in 1924 theSchool of Commerce and Finance the right to confer the bachelor's degree incommercial science. The YMCA also offered courses to prepare teachers forcertification, a program that evolved by 1927 into a separate school namedYoungstown College and recognized by the State Department of Education.That same year, the school also established the College of Liberal Arts.Youngstown State University            9Throughout the 1920s, the schools of law and commercial science were calledthe Youngstown Institute of Technology, which began a move from downtownto the present location with the purchase of several mansions owned by theWicks and other prominent Youngstown families.In 1931, the YMCA constructed its first classroom building, the present-dayJones Hall, and appointed Howard Jones as the educational director. By themid-1930s, the Board of Directors decided to incorporate with the official nameof Youngstown College separate from the other "Y" educational efforts; theyappointed Howard Jones as the first president, a position he held until 1966.In 1944, the trustees of the Young Men's Christian Association transferredcontrol of the institution to the members of the Corporation of YoungstownCollege, and in 1955 the corporation was rechartered as The YoungstownUniversity. The University joined the Ohio system of higher education inSeptember 1967 as Youngstown State University.Dana's Musical Institute, founded in nearby Warren in 1869, became Dana'sMusical Institute of Youngstown College in 1941. In 1946, the EngineeringDepartment, organized several years before, became the William Rayen Schoolof Engineering; two years later, the Business Administration Departmentbecame the School of Business Administration; and in 1981 the schoolname was changed to the Warren P. Williamson, Jr. School of BusinessAdministration. In 1960, the Education Department became the School ofEducation.The Graduate School and College of Applied Science and Technology werecreated in 1968, and, in 1974, the College of Creative Arts and Communicationwas established.In 1972, Youngstown State University, with the University of Akron and KentState University formed a consortium to sponsor the Northeastern UniversitiesCollege of Medicine, which enrolled its first students in 1975.In 1991 the engineering technology departments separated from CASTand joined the new College of Engineering and Technology; the remainingdepartments formed the new College of Health and Human Services.In 2007, the Rayen College of Engineering and Technology incorporated thescience and mathematics departments from the College of Arts and Sciences.This reorganization linked science, technology, engineering, and mathematicsin one academic college, and the humanities and social sciences in anothercollege.Youngstown State University now consists of the College of Graduate Studiesand six undergraduate academic colleges:•Beeghly College of Education•Bitonte College of Health and Human Services•College of Creative Arts and Communication•College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences•College of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics•Willamson College of Business AdministrationDegrees offered range from the associate, bachelor’s, and master’s to aDoctorate in Educational Leadership, a Doctor of Physical Therapy, and aDoctor of Philosophy in Materials Science and Engineering.AccreditationYoungstown State University is accredited by the Higher LearningCommission (HLC) (telephone: (312) 263-0456 or (800) 621-7440).

All significant dates for each term are published in the catalogand on the YSU website.AdvisementThe Office of the Registrar provides instructions for advisement andregistration prior to registration.All students are urged to consult with advisors in their major area. Eachdepartment or college has a procedure for either assigning an advisor to astudent or having the student select an advisor. Advisement is required for thefollowing students:1.Freshmen (with fewer than 30 hours of credit)2.Post-Secondary Enrollment Option/Early Admission Options Programstudents3.Any student not in good standing4.First-semester transfer students5.All former students returning to the University6.AthletesYoungstown State University            33The responsibility for fulfilling all requirements rests ultimately upon thestudent; the advisors provide assistance in that process.Students may use the online Schedule of Classes to determine the specificclasses offered in a particular term. For information about future offeringsor when a particular course will be offered again, consult the appropriatedepartment.Change of RegistrationRegistered students may change their registration by accessing theregistration functions through the MyYSU Portal. (Also see Reduction/Refund(p. 20) of Fees (p. 20) section).Students should consult their advisors prior to changing their schedules. Ingeneral, each student who needs an advisor's approval for registration mustalso have an advisor's approval for add/drop (change of registration). However,advisors' approval is not required for:•withdrawing from a course(s)•changing sections of a course•changing physical activity coursesA registered student may add an additional course through the change-of-registration procedure until the last day to add a class as published in theacademic calendar.Withdrawal from a course must be accomplished through the change-of-registration procedure. If a student withdraws from one or more coursesduring the full-refund period (or the end of the first week of the summer term),no entry will be made on the student's permanent record for the course(s)dropped.Administrative change(s) of registration may occur if a student is improperlyenrolled in any course or has registered for more hours than permitted.Students who wish to completely withdraw from the University should consultthe appropriate section in this catalog.Cancellation of RegistrationA student's registration may be cancelled for any of the following reasons:1.Academic suspension for the previous term2.Disciplinary action against the student3.Insufficient class enrollment4.Failure to meet admission or prerequisite requirements5.Failure to satisfy past-due financial obligations to the University6.Conditional Admission dismissalFor more information check the Office of the Registrar (http://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/registrar/registrar-home) website.Credit Hours/Class Standing/MajorsThe class hour is a weekly 50-minute class period and is the basic unit ofinstruction. The term "semester hour" (s.h.) signifies one class hour a weekcarried for one 15-week semester (or the equivalent in a summer term orflexibly scheduled class). A semester hour of credit is the amount of creditgiven for one semester hour successfully completed. Each semester hour ofcredit represents an average of three hours of study and instruction every weekthrough the term.Maximum/Minimum Credit-Hour ValueRegistration is not permitted for less than the approved credit hour value ofany course as listed in the Undergraduate Catalog. Students may not registerfor more than the approved credit-hour value of a course.Variable Credit HoursCertain courses have variable credit hours. A student wishing to register forsuch a course may do so only after consulting with the department offeringthe course to determine the number of hours for which to register. The last dayto add a class is also the last day to change credit hours.Student LoadThe semester hours of credit a student carries per term depend on the degreesought and on the curriculum being followed. A minimum of 120 semesterhours must be satisfactorily completed to earn a baccalaureate degree; aminimum of 60 semester hours for an associate degree. Students expecting tocomplete a bachelor's degree in four years or an associate degree in two yearsshould average 16 credits per term. Students interested in taking 21 credithours or more per term must seek approval from the dean of their college.Full-time StatusA full-time undergraduate student is one carrying 12 or more hours for creditper term.Academic ClassificationAll students working for any undergraduate degree conferred by this Universityare ranked in classes, by semester hours completed, as follows:Freshman0-29 semester hours of creditSophomore30-59 semester hours of creditJunior60-89 semester hours of creditSenior90 or more semester hours of creditFor purposes of satisfying course prerequisites, the term "senior standing"may be defined by reference to the specified curricula of a given schoolor college, if it provides detailed programs leading to the attainment of adegree. A student who has completed a four-year degree and who continuesundergraduate enrollment is classified as post-baccalaureate.MajorsDeclaring or Changing a MajorA student may enter the University as an undetermined major.A major and minor (if required) must be declared by the time the student hascompleted 63 semester hours.In order to change or declare a major, the student must fill out a form from thedepartment of the desired major. The form will be forwarded to the Office ofRecords.Students who need help selecting a major should contact an academicadvisor, the academic department, or the Office of Career Services forassistance with academic and career planning.Additional Majors and DegreesA student interested in pursuing more than one major at a time should contactthe departments offering majors to be assigned an advisor for each program.Multiple majors or degrees may be awarded concurrently.Multiple Majors/single DegreeA degree – e.g. Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts – may be awarded onlyonce. However, more than one major for the degree may be posted on thetranscript when the appropriate department chairpersons certify completionof the requirements. The student should indicate in each of the appropriatecolleges each major completed when filing for graduation. When the studentcompletes more than one major in a given degree, one diploma is awarded. Aminimum of 30 semester hours or 50% of the credits counted towards a major,34         Courseswhichever is less, must be specific to that major and not shared by any othermajor.Multiple Majors/Multiple DegreesIf a student wishes to complete the requirements for multiple majors that areawarded under different degrees, the student must fulfill all requirements foreach major and each degree. The appropriate chairpersons and deans mustthen certify completion of the requirements for each major and degree. Thestudent must file intent to graduate and graduation application forms for eachmajor and each degree in the appropriate colleges. A minimum of 30 semesterhours or 50% of the credits counted towards a major, whichever is less, mustbe specific to that major and not shared by any other major.Students may not earn the Bachelor of General Studies concurrently withanother bachelor's degree. Students who hold a bachelor's degree are noteligible for a Bachelor of General Studies degree.Any student who has received a degree from another institution and desiresa second degree from YSU must complete a minimum academic residencyof 20 semester hours for an associate degree and 30 semester hours fora baccalaureate degree, meet all requirements for the second degree, andcomplete the requirements for a new major. Students coming from anotheruniversity or from YSU with an already-completed bachelor's degree will nothave to complete any additional general education requirements at YSU butwill have to satisfy the residency requirements described above.Credit from Professional SchoolsStudents at YSU wishing to enter professional schools with the optionof completing their baccalaureate degree in absentia may do so with thecompletion of at least 94 semester hours of coursework, which must includethe following:•All general University requirements•Completion of major•Completion of minor (if required)•54 s.h. of upper-division coursework (3700-4800-Level)The University will accept the completion of not more than 30 semesterhours from any professional school granting any of the degrees listed belowand approved by the accrediting agency of that profession, provided thatthe student has been accepted for further study at the professional school.The student may thus secure the baccalaureate degree after three to three-and-a-half years in the University followed by approximately a year in theprofessional school. The relevant professional degrees are:•Doctor of Dental Surgery or equivalent•Doctor of Medicine•Doctor of Osteopathy•Doctor of Podiatry•Doctor of Veterinary Medicine•Doctor of Jurisprudence or equivalent•Doctor of Ministry or equivalent•Bachelor of Divinity or equivalentThe policy above does not apply to students admitted in the BS/MD IntegratedProgram of Youngstown State University and the Northeast Ohio MedicalUniversity (NEOMED). However, credit of up to 13 s.h. may be granted towardthe completion of the BS degree to those students who have participated inthe 6th year Human Values in Medicine Programs of NEOMED.Undergraduate Preparation for Post-Baccalaureate DegreesMedical schools have specific requirements for pre-medical study, andmany law, theological, technological, and graduate schools have curriculumrequirements for those seeking admission. Anyone wishing to enter aprofessional, technological, or graduate school of any kind should consultadvisors in the appropriate undergraduate college of this University asearly as possible. Such special needs can usually be met within the degreerequirements of Youngstown State University, but the proper selection ofcourses may have to begin in the first year.Course Load Requirements for EnrolledNonimmigrant International StudentsIn accordance with federal regulations, F-1 students may not be employedon campus for more than 20 hours per week while school is in session.Furthermore, F-1 students are required to "pursue a full course of study,"which for undergraduate students is defined as a minimum of 12 credit hourseach semester (9 credits for graduate students). In order to avoid being de-registered from courses and thus violating nonimmigrant status, it is essentialthat international students pay their YSU tuition and other fees, includinghealth insurance (see below), in full at the beginning of each semester.During international student orientation, results of any required placementtests in math or English language are coordinated with testing and academicareas to assist students who may need to further improve proficiencies foracademic success.The Center for International Studies and Programs can provide advice onmaintaining nonimmigrant status, authorization for a reduced course load,and obtaining additional employment authorization for unforeseen economichardship or practical training. For more information, visit the Center forInternational Studies and Programs (https://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/center-international-studies-and-programs/cisp-home) website.International Student Health InsuranceEnrollment in YSU's student health insurance plan is mandatory for allinternational students (F and J status) and for their nonimmigrant dependents.Coverage must be maintained for the entire calendar year.An exception to this requirement is granted only to:•students who have comprehensive group health insurance coveragethrough a parent or spouse's U.S. employer OR•students whose sponsorship by the U.S. government, the student's homegovernment, or a U.S.-recognized international organization includescomprehensive health insuranceTo request a waiver from enrollment in the YSU international studentinsurance plan, students must, by the end of the first week of classes eachsemester:•Submit a completed YSU International Student Health Insurance WaiverRequest Form to the Center for International Studies and Programswith proof of insurance (including confirmation of coverage dates anda description of covered expenses and exclusions) through a qualifyingrelative's employer or qualified sponsor.Athletic EligibilityThe Athletic Eligibility Committee is responsible for the athletic eligibilitycertification for Youngstown State University with respect to academic"standards of progress" for current student athletes and incoming students incompliance with (NCAA) National Collegiate Athletic Association's regulations.CoursesPrerequisitesNo student may receive credit towards graduation for a course that is aprerequisite for a more advanced course which the student has alreadysuccessfully completed, unless an exception to this policy is recommended bythe appropriate chair and approved in writing by the student's academic dean.Youngstown State University            35Repetition of CoursesA student may repeat a course once, unless otherwise stipulated in the coursedescription or unless an additional repetition is authorized by the student'sacademic dean. If the course is a prerequisite to another course, the repetitionmust be successfully completed before the other course is taken. Both theoriginal course and the repeated course must be taken at YSU. Transfer, studyabroad, and/or transient courses are not eligible to be used as a repetition.If the student has received credit for a more advanced course in the samesubject, a repetition is treated merely as another course, along with the first,in calculating the point average, unless the student secures an approvedrepetition form for recalculation of point average from the dean of the collegein which the student is enrolled. (See Recalculation of Point Average.) Acourse repeated, however, may be counted only once as credit toward astudent's total academic hours for graduation.The Repetition form and the Petition for a Late Withdrawal cannot be usedfor the same course. In other words, a Petition for a Late Withdrawal cannotbe processed for any course that was repeated and a recalculation of pointaverage processed and posted on the student's academic record.Credit towards graduation will not be given for a course on the semestersystem if the student has credit for the equivalent course on the quartersystem.Closed ClassesDepartments set limits to the number of students that can be accommodatedin each section. During the registration period or the period for addingcourses, many classes become filled. These classes are called "closed," whichmeans that no more students will be admitted to them. Only the chair ofthe department offering the course can admit a student to a closed class orreopen a closed class.Audited CoursesA student may audit any course. The student pays the full tuition, as well asany other applicable fee, for the course(s) audited. Audited courses are carriedin a student's load only for fee purposes. A student receiving financial aidshould confer with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships before electingto audit a course.A student may not change registration from audit to credit status or fromcredit to audit status after the last day to add a class.Conference CoursesConference work is available only in exceptional cases and if the academicadvisor considers conference work essential. You must obtain the requiredapproval(s) and complete the registration on-line.Conference courses have the following restrictions:1.Permission is limited to seniors with a 3.00 average. Exceptions must beapproved by the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled.2.The course must be given by a full-time faculty member.3.A brief description of the plan of procedure must be given by the full-timefaculty member.4.Must have approval from the department concerned and the dean of theschool in which the course is offered.Graduate Courses for UndergraduatesAn undergraduate student who has senior standing and an unrecalculatedgrade-point average of at least 2.7 may enroll in 5800 or higher level graduatecourses, provided such enrollment does not cause the total schedule for theterm to exceed 15 semester hours. Before registering for courses, the studentmust have the approval of the student's advisor in the program where thecredit will be applied, the course instructor, and the dean of the College ofGraduate Studies. The credit earned may be used for graduate credit at YSUonly after the student is admitted to the College of Graduate Studies and thecredit is accepted by the department in which the student continues graduatework. (Such coursework cannot count toward fulfillment of the requirementsfor a bachelor's degree.) The maximum amount of such credit that will beaccepted at Youngstown State University is nine hours.Transient Student AuthorizationCurrent YSU students desiring to attend another institution as transientstudents must complete and submit the Transient Student Authorization form,available from the dean of the college in which they are enrolled. Instructionsare on the form. To be certain the transient class is applicable to the degree,the TSA form must be completed prior to taking the course. If the form iscompleted after the course is taken, applicability cannot be guaranteed.To receive credit for approved coursework, the student must have receiveda grade of "C" or better and must attend Youngstown State University thesemester following the completion of the transient term. It is the student'sresponsibility to have an official transcript sent from the other institution tothe YSU Office of Admissions.Complete Withdrawal From TheUniversityProcedureThe student who wishes to withdraw from all courses in a particular termmust access the registration system on the MyYSU Portal or come to theOffice of the Registrar. Any student receiving Title IV financial aid should seekadvisement from the Office of Financial Aid prior to processing a completewithdrawal. A complete withdrawal may be executed before classes or afterthe term starts. The student should consult the MyYSU Portal for deadlines.Eligibility for Future Registrations1.A new applicant who withdraws from all courses prior to the first day ofthe term will not receive notice for future registrations unless the personrequests that the Office of Admissions defer the application to a futureterm.2.A former YSU student who withdraws from all courses prior to the firstday of the term will not receive notice for future registrations unless theperson requests that the Office of Records defer the application to a futureterm.3.A current undergraduate student withdrawing on or after the first day ofthe term will receive notice of future registrations for one academic year.Honorable WithdrawalOn occasion, a student voluntarily withdrawing from the University may need aletter stating the conditions of her or his withdrawal.If a statement of honorable withdrawal is needed, the dean of the appropriatecollege or other appropriate offices (i.e., University Discipline Officer) willfurnish one, provided the student is of good character, has a satisfactoryrecord of conduct, has no financial obligations to the University, and iswithdrawing voluntarily for acceptable reasons; and provided that the student,if withdrawing during a term, follows the official procedure for a change ofregistration.Grading SystemFaculty assign grades on the basis of achievement in the subject matter ofthe course and in accordance with accepted professional standards for thatsubject. The grade earned by a student thus represents the quality of work andis not based merely on competition within the class.36         Grading System•The grade of A represents exceptional work in which the student showsthat he or she has firmly grasped and achieved the objectives of thecourse.•The grade of B indicates very good work and considerable grasp of theessentials of the course.•The grade of C indicates good work and a usable grasp of the essentials ofthe course.•The grade of D indicates a definite, but not necessarily coherent,knowledge of the course.•The grade of F indicates that the student has not achieved even aminimum grasp of the essentials of the course. This grade can alsoresult from failure to withdraw officially from a course (see Change ofRegistration (p. 32) and Refund of Fees Upon Withdrawal) (p. 20).An incomplete grade of I may be given to a student who has been doingsatisfactory work in a course but, for reasons beyond the control of thestudent and deemed justifiable by the instructor, had not completed allrequirements for a course when grades were submitted. A letter grade maynot be changed to an I (Incomplete) after the term has ended and gradeshave been recorded. A written explanation of the reason for the I must beforwarded by the instructor to the Office of Records. This explanation will beincluded in the student's permanent record, with copies to the student anddepartment chairperson. For fall term courses, the final date to complete an Iwill be March 1 of the following term; for the spring term courses, September1; for all summer term courses, October 1. With approval by the instructor andthe dean of the college in which the course is taught, the completion date maybe extended. Courses not completed by the appropriate date will be convertedto an F.Students should not register for the same course the subsequent term. Rather,the student should work individually with the instructor to fulfill the courserequirements. The instructor will initiate a grade change upon completion ofthe course requirements. If no formal grade change occurs within the allottedtime frame, the I automatically converts to an F. Any I that is still pending bygraduation will be converted to an F.If a student receives an I as a result of being summoned to active militaryduty, the student will have one academic year from the date when he or sheis released from active duty to complete the course requirements and havethe change of grade recorded. It is the student's responsibility to inform theregistrar or associate director of records regarding the Incomplete grade.Department chairs are granted authority to convert grades of I into final gradesin cases where instructors may have severed connections with the Universityor have been otherwise unable to convert the grades.A progress grade, PR, is given in certain approved courses to indicate thatwork is still in progress on a project that occupies more than one semester.This grade is changed to a final letter grade at the end of the term in which thework is completed.The PR grade may also be given at the end of a term in courses specificallyidentified as competency-based1 to indicate that the student needs more timeto demonstrate a mastery of the subject matter. In such instances, the PRgrade will be converted to a letter grade by the instructor no later than the endof the subsequent term, excluding the summer. A PR grade not changed bythis time is automatically converted to an F grade.W represents a withdrawal properly processed at any time from the end ofthe full-refund period through the last day to withdraw with a W (as publishedin the Academic Calendar for each semester). For courses involving foreigntravel, the last day to drop a course with a W shall be the date at which thestudent first leaves the campus to begin the travel. Withdrawal after thedesignated date (or an improper withdrawal) is recorded as F. Withdrawalthereafter (or improperly done, at any time) is recorded as F. Petitions for latewithdrawal must be submitted within one year from the time a grade in thecourse was earned. If the grade resulted from circumstances over which thestudent had no control, the student may petition the appropriate dean for a latewithdrawal.A Petition for Late Withdrawal and the Repetition Form cannot be used forthe same course. In other words, Petition for a Late Withdrawal cannot beprocessed for any course that was repeated and a recalculation of pointaverage processed and posted on the student's academic record.When withdrawals change a student's status (full- time to part-time), thestudent immediately forfeits any privileges contingent upon full-time status,and all interested parties which legally require it will be notified.The distribution of achievement levels, and therefore of grades, in a largeunselected group of students generally follows the normal frequency curve, inwhich 5% to 10% are A's, 20% to 25% are B's, 40% C's, 20% to 25% D's, and 5%to 10% F's. However, since it is likely that substantial variation from the normalwill occur in individual classes, the instructor does not use the 'curve' as astandard to be imposed, but only as a model against which the instructor maycompare each particular class, using his or her own judgment on the basis ofprofessional standards.Instructors may use plus and minus modifications of the grades, but they arenot recorded or used in calculating the point average.1The definition of competency-based instruction is to be provided by theinstructor responsible for the course. Competency-based courses are sodesignated in the Schedule of Classes.The Point Average and ScholasticStandingThe student's scholastic standing is indicated by the quality point average(also called "grade point average," "grade average," or "point average").For determining this average, every grade has a quality point value for eachsemester hour it represents, as follows:•A, four quality points•B, three points•C, two points•D, one point•F, zero pointsFor example, an A in a three-hour course is worth 12 quality points; a D ina four-hour course, four points; and an F in any course, zero points. To findthe point average, the total number of quality points earned is divided by thetotal GPA hours. Thus, a student who earns 16 hours and 40 quality pointshas a point index of 2.50. Only grades of A, B, C, D, and F are included in thecalculation of the point average.Grading OptionsTraditional Grade (A,B,C)/No CreditTo receive credit for courses offered on a traditional grade/no credit basis, astudent must earn a grade of C or better. If the student fails to do so, an NC isentered on his or her transcript.An NC does not fulfill the requirements for satisfactory completion of thecourse; it does not affect the grade point average.Audit (AU)The AU grade indicates a student has registered for a course on an audit basisand has met the audit attendance requirement established by the instructor.Failure to meet the attendance requirement results in a grade of AU (W).Students must indicate their election of the audit grading option at the time ofregistration or within the time limits established for adding a class. The auditYoungstown State University            37option will not be changed to the standard grading option beyond the last dayto add a class.Credit/No-Credit (CR/NC)Credit/no-credit grades are given in some specific courses as approved by theAcademic Senate. Such courses are identified in the course descriptions.Credit/No-Credit (CR/NC) (Student Option)To encourage students to experiment with courses outside their major field ofconcentration, a credit/no-credit policy exists within the following guidelines.•Youngstown State University students who have completed at least15 semester hours of credit and have a grade point average of 2.00 orbetter, or transfer students admitted unconditionally who have at least 30semester hours of transfer credit, may elect to take a course for credit/no-credit.•The grade recorded for the student is not a letter grade, but either CR(credit) or NC (no-credit). If a student who has opted for CR/NC earns an A,B, or C in the class, the grade officially assigned is CR; otherwise it is NC.In either case, the grade point average is not affected.•This option may be elected for a maximum of twelve (12) semester hoursfor the baccalaureate degree or six (6) semester hours for the associatedegree. Courses offered only under the CR/NC option (by departmentdesignation) do not count as a student-elected credit/no credit class.Students are restricted to taking one CR/NC course per fall and springsemester and one CR/NC course per non-overlapping summer term.•Courses taken under the CR/NC option may not be counted toward astudent's major or minor. Students should confer with their advisors priorto electing the CR/NC option.•Students must indicate their election of the CR/NC option at the time ofregistration or within the time limits established for adding classes. TheCR/NC option will not be changed to the standard grading option beyondthe last day to add a class.Changing of Grading OptionsYou may change your grading option only through the last day to add a class.Excluding Older Grades (Statute of Limitations)An undergraduate student currently enrolled may petition the dean of his orher college to exclude from the calculation of the grade point average gradesearned five or more calendar years before. If the petition is approved, allgrades (not merely grades of D and F) earned during the specified quarter orsemester and all previous grades (not merely grades of D and F) will then beremoved from the calculation. However, all grades remain on the permanentrecord.Excluded course credit will not count toward the total hours requiredfor graduation. However, courses passed may fulfill basic curriculumrequirements and may satisfy prerequisites for higher courses whereapplicable. Courses excluded from the calculation may be taken againand repeated once without infringing upon repeat privileges specified incatalog course descriptions. Courses excluded are not subject to creditby examination. A student whose petition has been approved is ineligible forgraduation honors. Only one petition from each student may be approved.Students may not petition to exclude older grades after a degree has beenconferred.Grade ReportsFinal grades are available through the MyYSU Portal.Grade ChangesA request for a grade change must be made to the course instructor.Applications for grade changes must be signed by the instructor, departmentchair, and dean. All grade changes must be submitted by the dean or theinstructor to the Office of Records; they will not be accepted from the student.After a degree has been conferred, in no case may a grade change be made fora course or courses taken while pursuing that degree.A student's academic record contains a complete history of his or heracademic performance while earning a degree. Therefore, the academic recordof a student who graduates may not be revised using a Grade Change Form,Repetition Form, Petition for a Late Withdrawal, or Statute of Limitations.In the case of a student who has completed an associate degree, the abovepolicy may, on occasion, be waived, but only if the student is currentlypursuing a baccalaureate degree. However, changes cannot be made in astudent's record which would affect the status of the awarded associatedegree. Waivers must be approved by the appropriate dean.Credit by Examination-DepartmentalA currently enrolled student who can demonstrate ability and knowledgein a particular subject area may establish credit in certain courses withoutenrolling in them, by taking a special examination (through the appropriatedepartment). An examination fee is assessed for each examination. The onlygrade possible is "CRX", and there is no effect on the student's grade pointaverage. For the examination fee, see "Fees and Expenses". Information oncourses for which credit by examination is possible may be obtained fromthe student's academic dean or the Office of Testing (http://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/testing-center/testing-center). Registration fordepartmental tests is done through the specific department.Recalculation of Point AverageA current undergraduate student may wish to improve his or her cumulativepoint average by repeating a course in which a grade of 'D' or 'F' was earned.In order to recalculate the cumulative point average, the repetition must beconsistent with the policy on repetition of courses, and the student mustinitiate the recalculation process with the approval of his or her advisor (orthe dean, if it is a second repetition). A recalculation will be made for onlythe immediately preceding grade for the course, regardless of the number ofrepeats, and may be made only once for any course. Although courses arenot deleted from the permanent record, the record is adjusted to reflect theinclusion of only the last grade in the computation of the point average. Thehours credited toward degree hours completed are those earned with the lastgrade.Only undergraduate students currently attending the University may requestthis recalculation privilege, and only courses taken at Youngstown StateUniversity may be used in recalculating the cumulative point average. A post-baccalaureate student is not eligible to petition for a recalculation unless boththe course and the repetition are completed subsequent to the conferring ofthe degree. A student holding the associate degree may petition after receivingthe associate degree only if currently pursuing a baccalaureate degree. AllYSU grades, including those deducted from accumulative totals as a resultof an approved Repetition Form, will be counted in determining honors forgraduation.Proficiency in English and GradingThe student's ability to express himself or herself in English is the concernnot of the Department of English alone, but of every member of the Universityfaculty. Inadequate competence in English is to be regarded as a reason forlowering a student's grade in any course in the University.Absence from Classes and ExaminationsThe problem of excessive class absence concerns instructor and student, andconsequently requires their mutual effort. All students must realize that fortheir own welfare they are expected to attend all class meetings of courses inwhich they are enrolled.The instructor, however, has the prerogative of determining the relationshipbetween class attendance, achievement, and course grades, and the38         Grade Requirementsresponsibility for communicating the relationship to the students at thebeginning of each term.A student must have the instructor's consent in order to take any examinationat a time other than that scheduled.The faculty believes that classroom activities are essential to learning. Thestudent is responsible for knowing and meeting all course requirements,including tests, assignments, and class participation, as indicated by thecourse instructor.The responsibility for work missed during absence rests with the student. Theinstructor has no obligation to give make-up graded coursework or to reviewother class work missed by a student as a result of absence except underthose specific conditions cited below:•Participation in University-sponsored activities. University-sponsoredactivities are those that are scheduled by academic, student affairs, andathletic units. They include, but are not limited to: intercollegiate athleticcompetitions activities approved by academic units, including artisticperformances; R.O.T.C. functions; academic field trips; professionalconferences; and special events connected with coursework.•Government-required activities, such as military assignments, jury duty, orcourt appearances.•Religious observances that prevent the student from attending class.•Death of an immediate family member, including father, mother, sister,brother, spouse, children, step-children, step-parent, parent-in-laws, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, grandparents,foster parents, foster children, legal guardians, any person who stands inthe place of a parent (loco parentis), or a domestic partner.•Documented personal illness.ProcedureThe following guidelines describe procedures for students, sponsors ofappropriate activities, and instructors.Students shall:•Provide all scheduled activity dates to their instructors at the start ofthe semester. For unforeseen absences, notify the instructor as early aspossible in the semester of the upcoming activity.•In the case of a University-sponsored event, provide the sponsor of theactivity with a list of classes that conflict with the proposed activity.•In the event the absence was due to illness or injury, verification froma health center or medical professional should be presented to theinstructor. If the illness was not severe enough to warrant a medical visit,instructors should use their best judgment in determining if it should beexcused.•Be responsible for all material covered in class during their absence.Students are responsible for completing any work resulting from theirabsence. In no case is an excuse from class to be interpreted as a releasefrom class responsibility.•Out of courtesy, remind the instructor of the absence approximately oneweek prior to the absence.Sponsors of University-sponsored activities shall:•Provide each participating student with a signed letter for each of thestudent’s affected classes, to be given to their instructors, includingtime, date, and location of the event. This letter should be provided at thebeginning of the semester, or as early as possible in the semester.•Address any concerns a faculty member might have related to thescheduled activity.Instructors shall:•Inform the student about graded coursework that will be or was missed.•Determine an alternative due date for graded coursework missed.Grade RequirementsFour categories of academic standing are established: Good Standing,Warning, Probation, and Suspension. These categories are intended to signifya student’s progress toward graduation or to provide an opportunity formaking improvements and achieving academic success.“Warning” and “Probation” indicate that grade standards consistent withgraduation requirements are not being met. An advisor’s approval of courseload is required prior to continuing studies at the University.“Suspension” means that a student is separated from the University for aperiod of time.Academic standing is based upon the total earned hours (TEH) completed,including accepted transfer hours. YSU requires all students to have acumulative GPA of 2.00 to be in good standing.A student whose point average falls below the specified average for thenumber of credit hours achieved will be given a warning.Students on academic warning are required to establish an action plan foracademic success and have a letter of support from a supervisor as per theexisting student employment policy.A student who has been on warning and who fails to bring the average up tothe minimum by the end of the following term will be placed on probation forthe next term. A probationary student who has failed to bring the average up tothe minimum by the end of the probationary term will be suspended; however,a student who makes substantial improvement during a probationary term andaverages at least 2.00 for that term will be continued on probation even thoughthe student’s cumulative average does not reach the desirable minimum.A student on warning is permitted to participate in University activities.A second suspension will have a duration of at least one full year beforereinstatement on probation. Students should not expect to be reinstated aftertwo suspensions unless the dean agrees that extraordinary conditions orcircumstances have occurred. Additional suspensions will have durations of atleast two years.Reinstatement after any suspension is determined by the dean (or designee) ofthe college from which the student was suspended, or, if the student wishes tochange colleges, by the dean of the new college. Exceptions to the suspensionpolicy may be granted by the dean.Transfer students admitted in good standing or on probation must meet thosepoint-average requirements indicated for their total hours, including transferhours accepted by Youngstown State University.TranscriptsThe official transcript is a record of all coursework taken at Youngstown StateUniversity.Current and former students, as well as alumni, can request an officialtranscript for academic work completed at Youngstown State University.Please be aware that only the student may request an official transcript. Anofficial transcript will only verify YSU courses completed.Transcripts may be ordered online at the YSU website (http://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/registrar/transcript-request) or in person.Students are advised that most graduate and professional schools and manyemployers accept transcripts only if sent directly by the University. Photoidentification is required when ordering the transcript in person. TranscriptsYoungstown State University            39will be released only for those students who do not currently have a financialobligation to the University.Disciplinary action is not shown on a student's academic record.Academic HonorsThe Dean's ListThe Dean's List (for each term except summer) includes those full-timeundergraduate students who have earned at least a 3.4 average for not lessthan 12 semester hours of credit in the semester just ended.Included in the listing for the spring term are those part-time students whohave earned at least a 3.4 average for the fall and spring terms, and who haveaccumulated a minimum of 12 hours of credit.The President's ListThe President's List (for each term except summer) includes full-timeundergraduate students who have earned a 4.0 average for not less than 12semester hours of credit in the semester just ended.Spring term President's List recipients follow the same rules as Dean's Listrecipients.Class HonorsTo be eligible for undergraduate class honors:•a freshman must have completed at least 12 semester hours at YSU•a sophomore must have completed at least 24 semester hours at YSU•a junior must have completed at least 36 semester hours at YSU•a senior must have completed at least 48 semester hours at YSUHonors are based on the accumulative point average at YSU only; no transferwork is included. Both full-time and part-time students are eligible, providedthey:1.have a minimum cumulative point average of 3.00;2.have earned at least 12 credits in traditionally graded courses taken duringthe three semesters (including summer) preceding the term in whichhonors are awarded; and3.are enrolled during the current term.Non-matriculated, post-secondary enrollment option students, transientstudents, post-graduate transfer students, and YSU students who havereceived a baccalaureate degree prior to spring semester in the academicyear in which the honors convocation is held are not eligible. A student canreceive class honors only once as a member of a particular class (freshman,sophomore, etc.). The number of honor recipients approximates the top onepercent of the total fall enrollment of every class in each undergraduate unit ofthe University, but it may slightly exceed this figure because of ties.Honors ConvocationThe Honors Convocation recognizes those students who have distinguishedthemselves academically. Some of the awards listed under Awards andPrizes (see Student Activities section) are announced and presented on thisoccasion.Graduation HonorsStudents graduating with a baccalaureate degree who rank high scholasticallyare awarded special honors at the commencement exercise, as follows:•Those who attain a quality point average of 3.8 or higher are granted theirdegrees summa cum laude.•Those who attain a quality point average of less than 3.8 but not less than3.6 are granted their degrees magna cum laude.•Those who attain a quality point average of less than 3.6 but not less than3.4 are granted their degrees cum laude.Students graduating with any associate degree who rank high scholasticallyare awarded special honors at the commencement exercise, as follows:•Those who attain a quality point average of 3.7 or higher are granted theirdegrees With High Honors.•Those who attain a quality point average of less than 3.7 but not less than3.4 are granted their degrees With Honors.•A student who has processed an approved Statute of Limitations isineligible for graduation honors. All YSU grades (including those deductedfrom accumulative totals as a result of an approved Repetition Form) willbe counted in determining honors for graduation.•Transfer students who are baccalaureate degree candidates must have atleast 60 semester hours of credit at Youngstown State University, or thosewho are associate degree candidates must have at least 40 semesterhours of credit at Youngstown State University to be eligible for graduationhonors. In addition, no transfer credit is included in the calculation of thepoint average.Academic MisconductAcademic DishonestyWhat is Academic Honesty?Academic honesty is essential to the educational process and serves toprotect the integrity of the University community. Therefore, all members ofthe University community have a responsibility of maintaining high standardsof honesty and ethical practice. Students should consult with a facultymember if they are not sure what may constitute academic dishonesty.Students suspected of academic dishonesty may be charged with a violationof University conduct regulations under Article III. 1. of the Student Code ofConduct.Although instructors are responsible for taking all reasonable precautions toprevent cheating and plagiarizing, students share a joint responsibility andshould report any act of academic dishonesty to the instructor.After the faculty member has gathered evidence of a possible violation,the faculty member will notify the student within 48 hours in writing, viauniversity email, of the allegations and invite the student to participate in anacademic integrity conference. The faculty member and student may hold theconference without written notification. This academic integrity conferenceshall occur within five university working days of the written notification to thestudent.If a faculty member concludes the student was responsible, the facultymember may impose a sanction which my include, but is not limited to, one ofthe following:•warn the student•lower the grade on the exam, paper, or assignment related to the incident•lower the student's final grade for the course•request additional action from the Student Academic GrievanceSubcommittee, such as removal from a course, University suspension, orexpulsionA complete description of the process is detailed in the Student Code ofConduct (Article V. Academic Dishonesty). However, it should be noted that astudent can:•agree to the charge of academic dishonesty and sign the AcademicIntegrity Form, acknowledging the incident and accepting the sanction40         Academic Grievances•agree to the charge of academic dishonesty but disagree with the sanctionand request further review, thereby initiating further review by the StudentAcademic Grievance Subcommittee•disagree with the charge of academic dishonesty and refuse to sign theAcademic Integrity Form, thereby initiating further review by the StudentAcademic Grievance SubcommitteeRegardless of whether the Academic Integrity Form is signed, in situationswhere suspension or expulsion from the University is recommended by thefaculty member, the case will immediately be sent to the Student ConductOffice and forwarded to the Judicial Chair of the Student Academic GrievanceSubcommittee to initiate a panel hearing. A representative from the StudentConduct Office must be present at all University suspension and expulsionhearings to serve in an advisory capacity.In instances in which the student already has one prior academic dishonestyoffense, any additional offenses will constitute a violation of the Student Codeof Conduct and will require the student to undergo a Student Code of ConductHearing through the Office of Student Conduct.The Student Code of Conduct (https://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/student-conduct/student-code-conduct) is available online. A printed copy canbe obtained in the Office of Student Conduct.Academic GrievancesAcademic GrievancesThe Student Academic Grievance Procedure provides students with a formalchannel through which complaints concerning academic matters may beheard. A student must attempt to resolve the complaint by first discussing theissue with the faculty member. If the complaint is not resolved at that level, thestudent should direct his or her complaint to the department chair and, if thecomplaint is still not resolved, then to the dean of the college.Complaints not resolved following a discussion with the dean will beconsidered by an associate provost or designee, who will serve as JudicialChair. Upon his or her review, the Judicial Chair determines whether thecomplaint is grievable. If the complaint is grievable, it is presented to theStudent Academic Grievance Subcommittee. Per the YSU-OEA Agreement,Article 20, academic matters that may be grieved are the following:•Material deviation from the grading scale or weight distribution indicatedon the course syllabus by the faculty member, to the detriment of theindividual student or the entire class.•Material deviation of faculty contractual obligations as specified in thearticle on Teaching Rights and Responsibilities in the Faculty CollectiveBargaining Agreement, to the detriment of the individual student or theentire class.Other areas of contention between a student and a faculty member may not begrieved under this section. The student should contact the department chairof the faculty member's department or the dean of the college housing thefaculty member's department for further advisement in these situations.Students wishing to file a grievance should contact the administrativeassistant in the Office of the Provost for an appropriate referral. Furtherinformation may be found in the Academic Grievance Guide, which is availableonline at the Student Success (http://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/student-success/division-student-success) homepage. A paper copy may beobtained in the Division of Student Success.An electronic copy of the Student Academic Grievance Form (https://www.dropbox.com/s/bbg1w32fdqui29g/Academic%20Grievance%20Form.pdf?dl=0) is available. An electronic copy of the Student AcademicGrievance Procedure (https://www.dropbox.com/s/5zeuyqxckgy281w/Grievance%20Panel%20Procedure%20072917.pdf?dl=0) is also available.Student ComplaintsYoungstown State University is committed to the continuous improvementof the services it provides to its students. Students who have complaintsregarding the fairness or quality of service they have received from theuniversity are encouraged to share their concerns pursuant to this policy sothat the university may address these concerns in a timely and professionalmanner.This policy applies to all university divisions, colleges, departments, and units.This policy does not apply to student complaints regarding academic (grading)grievances, disability accommodations, harassment or discrimination,university admission decisions, or complaints or disciplinary action pursuantto the YSU Student Code of Conduct.A student complaint is defined as a written and/or clearly documentedverbal statement alleging improper, unfair, or arbitrary action relating to theuniversity's delivery of academic, administrative, and support services. Astudent complaint must be based upon a claimed violation of university policy,regulation, or established practice.There are two kinds of student complaints:•Academically Related Complaints: A student complaint related tothe services and responsibilities provided by the departments withinacademic affairs, including but not limited to academic colleges, academicdepartments, student success, distance education, library, mathematicsassistance center, reading and study skills, and writing center.•Non-Academically Related Complaints: A student complaint related to theservices and responsibilities provided by the departments and divisionsof budget and finance, enrollment management and planning, equalopportunity and diversity, facilities, human resources, multicultural affairs,and student experience.Informal ResolutionStudents are encouraged, but are not required, to resolve complaints onan informal basis. In seeking informal resolution, a student should speakdirectly with the staff, faculty, or administrator with whom the student hasan issue. This process allows the YSU official to have an opportunity to hearthe student's concerns and work with the student to resolve the issue in amutually constructive manner. If the student's concern is not resolved to thestudent's satisfaction, the student may utilize the formal complaint process.Formal ResolutionA student complaint page and submission form is available on the universitywebsite for students to submit their complaints in writing to the university. Theuniversity will respond to the student within ten business days of the allegedissue.For more information, consult YSU's Student Complaint Process Policy.Student RecordsStudent Name ChangesStudents who need to have their official name changed can complete theStudent Change of Information form (http://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/student-one-stop/frequently-requested-forms). Legal documentation(marriage license, passport, divorce document, court order, naturalizationpapers) must accompany the form. This documentation may also bepresented to the Office of the Registrar.Notification of Rights under FERPAThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords studentscertain rights with respect to their education records. They are:Youngstown State University            411.The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 daysof the day the University receives a request for access.A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academicdepartment, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifiesthe record(s) he/she wishes to inspect. The University official will makearrangements for access and notify the student of the time when andthe place where the records may be inspected. If the records are notmaintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted,such official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom therequest should be addressed.2.The right to request the amendment of the student's education records thatthe student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of thestudent's privacy rights.A student should write the University official responsible for the record inquestion, clearly identifying the part of the record he/she wants changed,and specifying why it is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation ofhis/her privacy rights.If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by thestudent, the University will notify the student of the decision in writing andadvise the student of his/her right to a hearing regarding the request foramendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures willbe provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.3.The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable informationcontained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPAauthorizes disclosure without consent.Personally identifiable information is information that, if disclosed, wouldmake a student's identity easily traceable, e.g., name, address or socialsecurity number. An exception which permits disclosure without consentis disclosure to University officials with legitimate educational interests.A University official is a person employed by Youngstown State Universityin an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staffposition (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); aperson or company with whom the University has contracted (such as anattorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board ofTrustees; or a student or volunteer serving on an official committee, orassisting a University official in performing his/her tasks.A University official has a legitimate educational interest if the officialneeds to review an education record in order to fulfill his or herprofessional responsibility for Youngstown State University.Also, the requirement for consent does not apply to the following:•Requests by officials of another institution where the student seeksto enroll or is already enrolled for purposes related to enrollment ortransfer.•Requests in compliance with a lawful subpoena or judicial order.•Requests in connection with a student's application for or receipt offinancial aid.•Requests by state authorities and agencies specifically exemptedfrom the prior consent requirements by the Act, conducting studieson behalf of the University, if such studies do not permit the personalidentification of students to any persons other than to representativesof such organizations and if the personal identification data isdestroyed when no longer needed.•Information submitted to accrediting organizations.•Requests by parents of a dependent student, when claimed by aparent on one's Federal Income Tax Return.•In the case of a health or safety emergency, the University mayrelease information from education records to appropriate persons inconnection with an emergency, if the knowledge of such informationis necessary to protect the health or safety of a student or otherpersons.•To authorized federal officials who have need to audit and evaluatefederally-supported programs.•The results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the Universityagainst an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forciblesex offense to the alleged victim of that crime.•Disclosure to a parent of an underage student in violation of Universitypolicy governing the use or possession of alcohol or drugs.4.The right to prevent the University from disclosing any or all of the informationabout the student the University has designated as directory information.FERPA permits the disclosure of directory information without the consentof the student. Directory information is information contained in a studenteducation record which would not generally be considered harmful oran invasion of privacy if disclosed. Youngstown State University hasdesignated the following types of information as directory information:•name;•address (local, home, and email);•telephone listing (campus and home);•enrollment status (e.g., full-time, part-time, withdrawn);•field of study (including college of enrollment, major and campus);•participation in officially recognized activities and sports;•weight and height of members of athletic teams;•dates of attendance and graduation;•degrees, honors, and awards received;•previous educational institutions or agencies attended; and•photographic, video or electronic images of student.Any student wishing to exercise this right must inform the Registrarin writing of the information not to be designated as directoryinformation with respect to that student. If no such written notificationis submitted, the University will assume that a student does not objectto the release of the directory information. A student's request forsuch non-disclosure will remain in effect until the student notifies, inwriting, the Registrar otherwise.5.The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerningalleged failures by Youngstown State University to comply with therequirements of FERPA.The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is:Family Policy Compliance OfficeU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C. 20202-5920Any questions about this notification should be directed to the Registrar(http://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/registrar/registrar-home).Graduation RequirementsCatalog of EntryThe Undergraduate Catalog in effect when a student first enrolls at theuniversity or any one subsequent catalog will be the guide to graduationrequirements, provided the student is in continuous attendance and does notchange majors.When a student changes majors, the guide to graduation requirements willbe the catalog in effect at the time of change or any one subsequent catalog.Exceptions to this rule include the requirements for the minor and generaleducation requirements. Unless the minor is specified by the new major, astudent who has been in continuous enrollment and changes majors can fulfillthe requirements for a minor by using the criteria in effect in either the catalogof entry or the catalog in effect at the time of the change in major. See thesection on General Education Requirements for the relevant policy on generaleducation.Readmitted students will use the catalog in effect at their last readmissionor any one subsequent catalog as the guide to graduation requirements. Anyexceptions to requirements must be approved by the student's departmentchair and/or college dean. The University reserves the right to change courseofferings and academic requirements.42         First-Year ExperienceCandidacy for a DegreeTo be eligible for candidacy for any degree, students must fulfill the followingthree requirements:ApplicationYou must file a Request for Graduation Evaluation form with the dean of yourcollege after the completion of 40 semester hours for the associate and 100semester hours for the baccalaureate degree.An Application for Graduation form must be filed by the deadline indicated inthe University Academic Calendar. The application is available on the student'sYSU Portal.If the student does not graduate for the term which the application has beenfiled, the student must reapply. The student must fulfill the University-wide,college, and departmental requirements as well as the minimum credit hours.ResidencyThe last 20 semester hours leading to an associate degree and the last 30semester hours leading to a baccalaureate degree must be completed atYoungstown State University. (In the pre-forestry, pre-law, and pre-medicalcurricula, however, which allow the student to earn final credit hours inabsentia, the last 30 semester hours prior to the period of absence must bespent at Youngstown State University.) A minimum of 16 semester hours inthe concentration area for the associate degree, and a minimum of 16 hours ofcredits in the major in the baccalaureate degree, must be earned in residence.A minimum of 21 semester hours of upper-division credit for the baccalaureatedegree must be earned in residence. Exceptions must be approved by theOffice of the Provost. Additional requirements may be specified by individualcolleges.GradesThe cumulative point average must be at least 2.00 (see The Point Averageand Scholastic Standing) at the time candidacy is approved and at the time thedegree is granted.Additional requirements for the associate or baccalaureate degree appearbelow.Baccalaureate DegreeA minimum of 120 semester hours must be successfully completed to earn abachelor's degree. In addition to requirements stated under Candidacy for aDegree, the following requirements must also be fulfilled for a baccalaureatedegree:Course LevelsAt least 60 semester hours must be completed in courses numbered 2600 orhigher; at least 48 of these 60 hours must be in courses numbered 3700 orhigher.MajorsEach student must complete a major. A department major consists of atleast 30 semester hours of an approved set of courses. A combined major, inwhich courses are given by more than one department, consists of at least 48semester hours. All grades in the major must be "C" or better.Each department determines the course requirements for its own major ormajors. Responsibility for certifying that a student has completed a majorrests with the chairperson of the major department. The student may berequired to do more than the minimum stated in the preceding paragraph.As soon as a student has decided on a major, he or she should consult withthe department chair of the major department. A major must be declared bythe time a student has achieved junior standing. Early consultation with thedepartment chair is strongly recommended, since in some departments thestudent must begin coursework related to the major during the freshman yearor risk a delay in graduation.MinorsA minor is an intellectual venture that broadens and deepens the student'sintellectual growth. An intellectual framework and coherence are evident inthe scope and sequence of the minor course of study. A minor is intendedto contrast with or deepen the major or General Education and is to be takenin a discipline other than that of the major. In approved interdisciplinaryminors, courses from the student's major discipline can be counted in theminor provided that the same courses are not counted toward the major. Eachstudent must complete a minor, unless the student has a combined major oris enrolled in a professional or technical curriculum that does not require adelineated minor. Check with an academic advisor for specific information.A minor consists of at least 18 hours of an approved set of courses. All gradesin the minor must be "C" or better. Courses taken under the Credit/No Creditoption may not be counted toward the minor. Upper-division courses mustcomprise at least 1/3 of the credit hours in the minor. An individualizedminor may be developed and approved through the Individualized CurriculumProcess (ICP). Transfer students may also use the ICP process for approvalof a minor course of study. An official minor is designated on the student'stranscript at the time the degree is awarded.Each department develops the specific pattern or sequence of courses forany minor(s) it offers. However, the department in which the student receivesthe major is responsible for certifying that a student has completed a minor.Certification will be guided by the description of minors published in theUndergraduate Bulletin. For a list of minors and their requirements see MinorsList.CertificatesA certificate identifies a concentration of study in an academic area. Thereare a limited number of academic areas where certificates are available, andstudents should consult the program descriptions for this information. Allgrades for the certificate must be "C" or better.Associate DegreeA minimum of 60 semester hours must be successfully completed in order toearn an associate degree. Students in associate degree programs must takea minimum of six general education courses, including Writing I and Writing II,and four additional courses selected from at least three of the following areas:mathematics, speech, natural science, arts and humanities, social science,or social and personal awareness. No more than one course counted towardthe requirement may be in mathematics. Students should check with theirdepartments to see if certain general education courses are mandated by theirprogram.CommencementGraduation ceremonies take place twice a year. Fall commencement is held inDecember and spring commencement is held in May. Students who graduatesummer are invited to participate in either spring or fall commencementactivities.First-Year ExperienceThe Office of First-Year ExperienceThe First-Year Experience program at Youngstown State University is designedto assist incoming students during their transition from high school to college,as well as students who may be transferring from a different university.By discussing topics such as Sexual Violence / Alcohol Awareness, CareerPlanning, Financial Literacy, and the Common Intellectual Experience as wellYoungstown State University            43as participating in at least four campus activities, first-year students will beginto feel comfortable on campus and connect with the university.Director of First-Year ExperienceDr. Karen Becker kabecker@ysu.edu 330-941-3544 3046 Jones HallYoungstown State UniversityLearning Goals and Outcomes:Goal #1:Students will participate in a culture of community.Outcomes:1.

The programalso offers information on Air Force career opportunities and the role of themilitary in the American society. Scholarships are available to help studentscomplete their bachelor's and/or master's degrees.OverviewThere are two primary AFROTC programs under which officer candidates mayearn their commissions.•The first is a four-year AFROTC program. It includes membership in(and completion of) the General Military Course (GMC), a four-week fieldtraining course, and the Professional Officer Course (POC).•The second is a two-year program designed for students who have twoyears of academic work remaining. In the two-year program, students areselected to participate in the POC program and attend a five-week fieldtraining course, which includes coursework covered during the freshmanand sophomore years.Both programs result in a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the UnitedStates Air Force. A minor in aerospace studies is available in consultation withthe academic major advisor and the Aerospace Studies Department.RegisteringCourses are normally taken for YSU academic credit as part of the students'electives. Entering freshmen and sophomores may register for aerospacestudies courses at the same time, and in the same manner, as they enroll intheir other YSU courses. Juniors and seniors wishing to enroll in AFROTCshould call the AFROTC Unit Admissions Officer prior to enrollment to discussthe particular requirements. Students enrolled in the program must travel toKent State University once a week to attend the courses. Arrangements can bemade for carpools or pick-up if the students do not have transportation.The General Military CourseThe General Military Course (GMC) is offered in four-sequenced lower-divisionaerospace studies courses. Each course consists of one hour of academicinstruction per week and 15 leadership laboratory contact hours per semester.Non-scholarship membership in the GMC does not confer any military statusor commitment upon the students, but affords them the opportunity to learnabout the Air Force and its role in the American society. Students who do notwant commissions may take the aerospace studies courses for academiccredit only. There is no military obligation incurred by enrolling in the GMC.The Professional Officer CourseThe Professional Officer Course (POC) is a four-part upper division aerospacestudies course. Each course consists of three hours of academic instructionper week and 15 leadership laboratory contact hours per semester. Entranceinto POC is limited to qualified students desiring to compete for Air Forcecommissions. Enrollment in this program is based upon a cumulative gradepoint average, physical qualifications, and leadership.VeteransVeterans with previous honorable, active U.S. military service who wishto enroll in the POC may be eligible for a waiver of either the GMC or itsequivalent as an entrance requirement.Uniforms and TextbooksAFROTC uniforms and textbooks are provided at no charge. Textbooks arereturned upon completion of each academic year or upon withdrawal from thecourse. Uniforms are returned upon completion of the program or withdrawalfrom the course.Financial AssistanceStudents who demonstrate academic and leadership potential may beselected by the professor of aerospace studies to compete for scholarships.The scholarship award includes tuition, textbook allowance, some course fees,and a monthly tax-free stipend.Scholarship Statement of UnderstandingAir Force ROTC scholarship recipients must meet and maintain certainacademic and military retention standards and serve in the active-duty AirForce after graduation.Contact InformationFor further information, contact:Department of Aerospace StudiesAFROTC uantitative Reasoning3"

(CT)2 helpsmore high school and adult career-technical students to go to college andenter with college credit; technical credit saves students money and time;and Ohio business and industry will benefit from more employees with highereducation and advanced skills.The language in section 3333.162 (http://regents.ohio.gov/careertechtransfer/archives/documents/HB66Language.pdf) of the Ohio Revised Code requiresthe Ohio Department of Higher Education and the Ohio Department ofEducation to develop policies and procedures ensuring that students at anadult career-technical education institution or secondary career-technicaleducation institution can transfer agreed upon technical courses completedthere (that adhere to recognized industry standards) to any public institutionof higher education "without unnecessary duplication or institutional barriers."To access credit, students will need to request a Verification Form be sentby the career-institution from which they attended/graduated, to the collegeor university that the student wishes to attend. For more information on howto access (CT)² credit visit the Ohio Department of Higher Education Career-Technical Credit Transfer (CT) (https://www.ohiohighered.org/transfer/ct2/how-to-access-ct2-credit)2 Verification of Course/Program Completion Formwebpage.Transfer ApplicantsAn applicant who has graduated from high school and was enrolled in anothercollege or university for at least one course during the fall semester followinghigh school graduation is classified as a transfer applicant. This classificationincludes post-graduate applicants from other institutions seeking additionalundergraduate coursework.The Ohio Department of Higher Education in 1990, following a directiveof the 119th Ohio General Assembly, developed the Ohio Articulation andTransfer Policy to facilitate students' ability to transfer credits from one Ohiopublic college or university to another in order to avoid duplication of courserequirements. A subsequent policy review and recommendations producedby the Articulation and Transfer Advisory Council in 2004, together withmandates from the 125th Ohio General Assembly in the form of AmendedSubstitute House Bill 95, have prompted improvements of the original policy.While all state-assisted colleges and universities are required to follow theOhio Articulation and Transfer Policy, independent colleges and universitiesin Ohio may or may not participate in the transfer policy. Therefore, studentsinterested in transferring to independent institutions are encouraged to checkwith the college or university of their choice regarding transfer agreements. Insupport of improved articulation and transfer processes, the Ohio Departmentof Higher Education (ODHE) has established a transfer clearinghouse toreceive, annotate, and convey transcripts among state-assisted colleges anduniversities. This system is designed to provide standardized information andhelp colleges and universities reduce undesirable variability in the transfercredit evaluation process.ODHE Transfer ModuleThe Ohio Department of Higher Education's Transfer and Articulation Policyestablished the transfer module, which is a subset or entire set of a college oruniversity's general education curriculum in AA, AS, and baccalaureate degreeprograms. Students in applied associate degree programs may completesome individual transfer module courses within their degree program orcontinue beyond the degree program to complete the entire transfer module.The transfer module contains 54-60 quarter hours or 36-40 semester hours ofcourse credit in:•English composition (minimum 5 quarter hours or 3 semester hours)•Mathematics, statistics, and formal/symbolic logic (minimum of 3 quarterhours or 3 semester hours)•Arts/humanities (minimum 9 quarter hours or 6 semester hours)•Social and behavioral sciences (minimum of 9 quarter hours or 6 semesterhours)•Natural Science (minimum 9 quarter hours or 6 semester hours)•Oral communication and interdisciplinary areas may be included asadditional options to satisfy OTM requirements•Additional elective hours from among these areas make up the total hoursfor a completed transfer moduleCourses for the transfer module should be 100- and 200-level generaleducation courses commonly completed in the first two years of a student'scourse of study. Each state-assisted university, technical, and communitycollege is required to establish and maintain an approved transfer module.Transfer module course(s) or the full module completed at one college oruniversity will automatically meet the requirements of individual transfermodule course(s) or the full transfer module at another college or universityonce the student is admitted. Students may be required, however, to meetadditional general education requirements at the institution to which theytransfer. For example, a student who completes the transfer module atInstitution S (sending institution) and then transfers to Institution R (receivinginstitution) is said to have completed the transfer module portion of InstitutionR's general education program. Institution R, however, may have generaleducation courses that go beyond its transfer module. State policy initiallyrequired that all courses in the Transfer Module be completed to receive itsbenefit in transfer. However, subsequent policy revisions have extended thisbenefit to the completion of individual transfer module courses on a course-by-course basis.ODHE Conditions for Transfer Admission1.Ohio residents with associate degrees from state-assisted institutionsand a completed, approved transfer module shall be admitted to any stateinstitution of higher education in Ohio, provided their cumulative gradepoint average is at least 2.0 for all previous college-level courses. Further,these students shall have admission priority over out-of-state associatedegree graduates and transfer students.2.When students have earned associate degrees but have not completeda transfer module, they will be eligible for preferential consideration foradmission as transfer students if they have grade point averages of atleast a 2.0 for all previous college-level courses.3.In order to encourage completion of the baccalaureate degree, studentswho are not enrolled in an AA or AS degree program but have earned 60semester or 90 quarter hours or more of credit toward a baccalaureatedegree with a grade point average of at least a 2.0 for all previous college-level courses will be eligible for preferential consideration for admission astransfer students.4.Students who have not earned an AA or AS degree or who have not earned60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours of credit with a grade point averageof at least a 2.0 for all previous college-level courses are eligible foradmission as transfer students on a competitive basis.5.Incoming transfer students admitted to a college or university shallcompete for admission to selective programs, majors, and units on anequal basis with students native to the receiving institution.Admission to a given institution, however, does not guarantee that a transferstudent will be automatically admitted to all majors, minors, or fields ofconcentration at the institution. Once admitted, transfer students shallbe subject to the same regulations governing applicability of catalogrequirements as native students. Furthermore, transfer students shall beaccorded the same class standing and other privileges as native students onthe basis of the number of credits earned. All residency requirements must becompleted at the receiving institution.Acceptance of Transfer CreditTo recognize courses appropriately and provide equity in the treatment ofincoming transfer students and students native to the receiving institution,transfer credit will be accepted for all successfully completed college-level18         Transfer Applicantscourses completed from regionally accredited colleges and universities.Students who successfully complete AA or AS degrees with a 2.0 orbetter overall grade point average would also receive credit for all college-level courses they have passed. (See Ohio Articulation and TransferPolicy, Definition of Passing Grade, Appendix D on the ODHE (https://www.ohiohighered.org/transfer/policy) website.) While this reflects thebaseline policy requirement, individual institutions may set equitableinstitutional policies that are more accepting. Pass/fail courses, credit byexamination courses, experiential learning courses, and other nontraditionalcredit courses that meet these conditions will also be accepted and posted tothe student record.See information for Transfer Students (http://www.ysu.edu/admissions/apply-to-ysu/transfer-students) for related documents.Transfer Assurance GuidesTransfer Assurance Guides (TAGs) comprise transfer module courses andadditional courses required for an academic major. A TAG is an advisingtool to assist Ohio university and community and technical college studentsplanning specific majors to make course selections that will ensurecomparable, compatible, and equivalent learning experiences across thestate's higher-education system. A number of area-specific TAG pathwaysin the arts, humanities, business, communication, education, health,mathematics, science, engineering, engineering technologies, and the socialsciences have been developed by faculty teams. TAGs empower students tomake informed course selection decisions and plans for their future transfer.Advisors at the institution to which a student wishes to transfer should alsobe consulted during the transfer process. Students may elect to complete thefull TAG or any subset of courses from the TAG. Because of specific majorrequirements, early identification of a student's intended major is encouraged.TAG courses count toward the major without adding to the overall total ofcredits in the particular major.Students should also check with their department about which courseshave received approval from ODHE as part of the Transfer Assurance Guidesprogram. Only those courses that have received such approval can beguaranteed transfer credit as part of the major. Students may also check withthe ODHE TAG (https://www.ohiohighered.org/transfer/tag) website.Transferring to YSUTransfer CreditTransfer credit is given for all coursework taken at a regionally accreditedinstitution, provided that the student has a cumulative grade point averageequivalent to at least a 2.0 (on a 4.0 system) at that institution and the workis creditable towards a degree at that institution. Earned credits transferringinto YSU will apply to one of three areas including general education, majorcoursework or elective credit. YSU accepts a "D" grade on the same basis asthe rules governing native students. For example, a "D" grade might not satisfya prerequisite for which a higher grade is needed. Courses from nonregionally-accredited institutions may be accepted on a case-by-case basis with theapproval of the chair of the department and the dean of the college in whichthe course would be housed at YSU.Conditions for transfer admission to the University are in line with ODHE rulesand regulations (see above). Per ODHE policy, the University recognizes theassociate degree as preliminary to the baccalaureate and admits advanced-standing students possessing the associate degree from a regionallyaccredited institution. Transfer credit is granted for all work successfullycompleted from the associate degree. Admission to the University does notguarantee that a transfer student will be automatically admitted to all majors,minors, or fields of concentration. Some programs within the University haveseparate admission standards that must be met before a student may enroll inthat particular program. Please consult the appropriate college or departmentfor information on restricted program admissions. Once admitted, transferstudents shall be subject to the same regulations governing applicability ofcatalog requirements, class standing, and other privileges as all other nativestudents.Transfer applicants who are in good standing at the last institution attendedand who have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher (on a 4.0system) for all previous college-level courses are admitted in good standing.Transfer applicants with a cumulative grade point average of less than 2.0 orwho are on probation may be considered on a case by case basis. Applicantssuspended or dismissed from their most recent institutions are not eligiblefor admission until at least one semester (excluding summer) has passedfollowing the term in which the suspension occurred. Transfer students withmultiple suspensions or a dismissal may not be eligible for admission. Seethe reinstatement policy for YSU students (http://www.ysu.edu/academic-advising/policies-procedures) in the Undergraduate Catalog. Consistent withundergraduate academic policy, failure to maintain a grade point average of2.0 or higher (on a 4.0 system) during the probationary semester will result inacademic suspension.The university is continuing the process of examining all courses fromsurrounding collegiate institutions. The Office of Degree Audit along with thedepartment chairs and the coordinator of General Education work with theOffice of Admissions to identify courses that equate or courses that couldcount toward a major or general education credit. The appropriate schoolor college and/or department and/or coordinator of general education inaccordance with policies governing the fulfillment of degree requirements willdetermine distribution of any accepted course work.Credentials for Transfer StudentsOfficial transcripts may be sent directly from the issuing institution to theYSU Office of Admissions or can be delivered in person in a sealed andstamped envelope. The Ohio Department of Higher Education has establisheda transfer clearinghouse to receive, annotate, and convey transcripts amongstate- assisted colleges and universities. Official transcripts may also besent electronically through a secured provider (e.g. Parchment, eScrip-Safe,National Student Clearinghouse, etc.)Pre-baccalaureateAll undergraduate transfer applicants will need to provide the YoungstownState University Office of Admissions with an official copy of their high schooltranscript and must provide an official copy of all undergraduate transcripts.BaccalaureatePostgraduate applicants are required to submit all undergraduate transcriptsfrom regionally accredited colleges and universities attended. High schooltranscripts are not required unless specifically requested by YSU.Prior Learning Assessment CreditPrior Learning Assessment (PLA) is an option that enables students todemonstrate what they have learned outside the classroom and translatethat learning into college credit. Prior Learning Assessment validates learningacquired through corporate training programs, extensive volunteer activity,military service, workplace experience, civic engagement, individual readingsand studies, training sponsored by professional organizations, and trainingsponsored by governmental agencies. Credit is awarded for college-levellearning (knowledge, skills, and competencies) that students have obtained asa result of their prior learning experiences.Students must demonstrate their mastery of the knowledge in a subject areain order to earn college credit. Prior learning can be verified by:•Performance on standardized tests or department challenge exams•Creation and evaluation of a portfolio•Demonstration of military service learningFor more information regarding PLA credit and guidelines, please see the PriorLearning Assessment (http://cms.ysu.edu/prior-learning-assessment/prior-learning-assessment) website.Youngstown State University            19General Education and the Transfer Module1.Per the articulation and transfer module guidelines developed by the OhioDepartment of Higher Education, any student transferring to YSU with acompleted transfer module from another Ohio public institution of higherlearning will receive credit for all hours (36-40 semester hours; 54-60quarter hours) contained within the module. Furthermore, the transfermodule portion of YSU's General Education Requirements will be judged tobe completed.2.Students transferring into YSU with the OTM completed at anotherinstitution will have all general education courses completed with theexception of 2 courses under Social and Personal Awareness (6 semesterhours) and the capstone course (3 semester hours). Students may finda list of approved capstone courses on the General Education website(p. 43).3.For those students who have not completed the transfer module atanother school, ODHE has guaranteed that any approved transfer modulecourse taken at one institution must receive general education credit atthe receiving institution. YSU has also determined that courses beyond theOTM list may satisfy general education requirements. The Office of DegreeAudit will process equates between YSU courses and the transferredcourses. The General Education Office will determine which courses beingtransferred fit within the YSU general education model. The student willthen be advised as to how many courses in each domain must be taken tosatisfy the general education requirements at this university. Each studentmust complete a capstone course at Youngstown State University.Transfer from a Regionally Accredited Institution-Articulation AgreementsYSU also has a number of articulation agreements with colleges in Ohio andwestern Pennsylvania. Through these agreements a maximum number ofcredits from the associate-degree-granting institution will be applied towarda bachelor's degree program at YSU. Associate-degree holders meeting thatcriterion will, in most cases, be admitted with junior standing at YoungstownState and entitled to all the rights and privileges of native junior students,including eligibility for financial aid and priority in registration. Please refer tothe Degree Audit (http://cms.ysu.edu/administrative-offices/degree-audit/degree-audit) website for more information and for a current list of articulationagreements.The University also has articulation agreements with many career andtechnical centers to award college credit for various courses. For a completelist of these agreements, refer to the Degree Audit website under Agreementswith Other Schools.Articulation agreements are pending with several other institutions in theregion. Applicants who have not completed an associate program areconsidered on the same basis as other transfer applicants.Transferring From YSUIn order to facilitate transfer with maximum applicability of transfer credit,prospective transfer students should plan a course of study that will meetthe requirements of a degree program at the receiving institution. Studentsshould use the Transfer Module (see below), Transfer Assurance Guides(https://www.ohiohighered.org/transfer/tag), and the Transferology (https://www.transferology.com) system for guidance in planning the transfer process.Specifically, students should identify early in their collegiate studies aninstitution and major to which they desire to transfer. Furthermore, studentsshould determine if there are language requirements or any special courserequirements that can be met during the freshman or sophomore year. Thiswill enable students to plan and pursue a course of study that will articulatewith the receiving institution's major. Students are encouraged to seek furtherinformation regarding transfer from both their advisor and the college oruniversity to which they plan to transfer.YSU Transfer ModuleBased on ODHE guidelines, students wishing to transfer to another statecollege or university can complete the general education transfer module bytaking the following:•English 1550 Writing I, English 1551 Writing II (6 semester hours)•Mathematics, statistics, and logic (3 semester hours)•Oral Communications (3 semester hours)•Natural Science (must include one laboratory science, minimum of 7semester hours)•Arts and Humanities (minimum of 6 semester hours)•Social Science (minimum of 6 semester hours)It is recommended that students take a minimum of six of the hours fromNatural Science, Arts and Humanities, or Social Science from courses that arecross-listed as Social and Personal Awareness. In doing so, a student can stillcomplete YSU's General Education Requirements in a timely manner shouldthat student choose not to transfer.No course may count unless it is on the 1500 or 2600 level. The student musttake the minimum credits in each category and at least 36 credits overall tocomplete the transfer module. However, each course approved as part of auniversity's Transfer Module is guaranteed credit at another state institutionas a general education course.Students planning to transfer from YSU should refer to the UndergraduateCatalog (General Education Courses by Knowledge Domain) for a list ofgeneral education courses approved as part of the transfer module. Only thosecourses with an asterisk will receive general education credit. This informationwill also be available on the General Education (p. 43) website, which islinked to the YSU homepage.Advanced Placement (AP)The state of Ohio, working through the University System of Ohio, has initiatedpolicies to facilitate the ease of transition from high school to college as wellas between and among Ohio's public colleges and universities.Beginning in the fall term 2009:1.Students obtaining an Advanced Placement (AP) exam score of 3 or abovewill be awarded the aligned course(s) and credits for the AP exam area(s)successfully completed.2.General education courses and credits received will be applied towardsgraduation and will satisfy a general education requirement if thecourse(s) to which the AP area is equivalent fulfill a requirement.3.If an equivalent course is not available for the AP exam area completed,elective or area credit will be awarded in the appropriate academicdiscipline and will be applied towards graduation where such electivecredit options exist within the academic major.4.Additional courses or credits may be available when a score of 4 or 5 isobtained. Award of credit for higher score values varies depending on theinstitution and academic discipline.5.In academic disciplines containing highly dependent sequences(mathematics, sciences, etc.), students are strongly advised to confer withthe college/ university advising staff to ensure they have the appropriatefoundation to be successful in advanced coursework within the sequence.AppealsA student who disagrees with the award of transfer credit by the receivinginstitution has the right to appeal the decision and should contact the Officeof Degree Audit to begin the process. The institution will make the studentaware of the entire appeal process at the time of contact. You can also visitthe Appeal (http://www.ysu.edu/admissions/apply-to-ysu/transfer-students)website for an explanation of the process.20         Tuition, Fees, and ChargesTuition, Fees, and ChargesSee Student Fees and Charges below for current figures.Payment of Tuition and FeesStudent accounts are billed each semester.

Additional requirements include minimum half-time enrollment andgood credit history as a credit check is required for approval. Repaymentwill begin within sixty days of the loan reaching full disbursement.Current interest rates on the Federal Direct PLUS Loan for Graduate andProfessional Students can be found on the Federal Student Loan (http://www.ysu.edu/content/office-financial-aid-and-scholarships/student-loans) page of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships website.•Federal Perkins Loan: This federally funded loan has an interest rate of5% which is subsidized by the federal government while the student isenrolled at least half-time in school. Students must meet the Perkins Loaneligibility criteria, have exceptional financial need, and be enrolled in aneligible program. Repayment of the Perkins Loan begins nine months aftergraduation, separation, or enrollment of less than half-time status. Awardsare subject to availability of funds and issued on a first-come, first-servebasis.Part-time StudentsAid is available for part-time students, though the amount of part-time aidand the types of aid available vary. Be sure to file the FAFSA by December1 for new students and February 15 for continuing students for maximumconsideration. It is also recommended to check directly with the Office ofFinancial Aid and Scholarships to discuss how part-time attendance canultimately affect a student’s overall financial aid eligibility.Federal VerificationStudents selected for verification are required to submit certaindocumentation to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. Studentsshould submit this requested documentation as soon as possible so thatthe processing of financial aid is not delayed. Even if the student initiallyapplies on time, any delay in processing due to verification could result in thatstudent not receiving financial aid that they may have otherwise been eligibleto obtain. Processing typically takes up to 3 weeks, but can take longer duringpeak processing periods.Keep copies of all tax forms, tax return transcript(s), and W-2 forms each year,as well as any documents or forms submitted to the Office of Financial Aidand Scholarships.Submitting Tax InformationThere are two ways to provide your tax information for the verification process:1.Use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool provided on the FAFSA (recommended)2.Provide a copy of your IRS Tax Return TranscriptTax return transcripts can be ordered by calling 1-800-908-9946, or online(https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript.html).Special CircumstancesIf a student and/or their family have unusual circumstances that haveoccurred during the academic year, such as excessive medical expenses or aloss in income, contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships to discussthe situation with a counselor.Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)PolicyFederal regulations require that Youngstown State University review theacademic progress of students annually, whether they are a previous aidrecipient or not. The purpose of this review process is to measure whethera student is making satisfactory progress towards his or her educationalgoals. The following federal programs are affected when a student is not incompliance with the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy:Federal Pell GrantFederal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)Federal Work-Study ProgramFederal Perkins LoanFederal Stafford Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized)Parent PLUS Loans for Undergraduate StudentsPLUS Loans for Graduate StudentsState grant programs such as the Ohio College Opportunity Grant (OCOG)and the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Award (PHEAA) are notgoverned by the federal Standards of Academic Progress, but rather, by therespective state.YSU’s Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements for undergraduate andgraduate students include the following three components:1. Grade Point Average (GPA)All students at YSU are required to maintain a minimum cumulative gradepoint average. To be considered in good academic standing, a student musthave a 2.0 GPA. Graduate students are required to maintain a 3.00 GPA. Thefollowing grades are included in the GPA calculation: A, B, C, D, and F. The GPAcalculation excludes the following grades: CR-Credit, NC-No Credit, AU-Audit,I-Incomplete, and W-Withdrawal. For Incompletes (I), the credit hours apply tothe term the student was enrolled, not the term the student was making up theIncomplete.*Students academically suspended cannot receive federal aid during theperiod of suspension.2. Max Time FrameWhen a student’s attempted hours reach 150% of the maximum hours neededto complete an associate (109 hours) or bachelor’s (217 hours) degree, federalfinancial aid eligibility will be suspended unless the time frame is extendedwith an appeal accompanied by an Academic Advisor Evaluation. Graduatedegrees must be completed by the length of time standards established andmonitored by the College of Graduate Studies.3. Percentage Completion1.Freshmen undergraduate students (0-29 credit hours earned) mustcomplete a minimum of 55% of the total hours attempted each year;2.Sophomore undergraduate students (30-59 hours earned) must completea minimum of 60% of the total hours attempted each year;3.Junior undergraduate students (60-89 hours earned) must complete aminimum of 65% of the total hours attempted each year;4.Senior undergraduate students (90+ hours earned) must complete aminimum of 70% of the total hours attempted each year;5.Graduate students (13+ grad hours attempted) must complete a minimumof 50% of the total hours attempted each yearPercentage completion will be calculated by dividing completed hours byattempted hours. For federal financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progresspurposes, attempted hours exclude audited hours and withdrawals made bythe last date to receive a 100% refund. The following grades negatively impactthe percentage completion calculation: F-Failed, NC-No Credit, AU-Audit, I-Incomplete, and W-Withdrawal. For Incompletes (I), note that the credit hoursapply to the term in which the student was enrolled in the course, not the termthe student was making up the Incomplete.Transfer StudentsTransfer students will be eligible for federal aid through the spring semesterof the academic year they begin at YSU. During the spring semester, thesestudents will be evaluated under the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy.30         Academic Policies and ProceduresTransfer hours will be included in the number of hours earned and attempted,but only YSU grades enter into the GPA calculation.Non-Degree Students (undergraduates, post-undergraduate, and graduate)A student must be enrolled in a degree program to receive federal financial aid.SAP Appeal ProcessIf a student is non-compliant, he/she must appeal the denial of financial aidby submitting an appeal form that explains the circumstances. Supportingdocumentation may be required. Appeals will be evaluated by the SatisfactoryAcademic Progress Appeal Committee which will respond in writing with thedecision within 30 days.The decision made by the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Committeeis final. The Satisfactory Academic Progress Committee may also cite anddeny students who exhibit a pattern of federal student aid abuse. Federalregulations require students who successfully appeal to be placed on asemester-based Financial Aid Probation and Academic Progress Plan. Theterms and conditions of the Academic Progress Plans must be met in full tocontinue to receive federal aid for future semesters by the conclusion of theprobationary semester.Students who do not appeal, or who are denied by the Committee, will notbe eligible for federal financial aid programs. Students will remain denieduntil their academic record is once again in compliance with the SatisfactoryAcademic Progress Policy. To attain compliance, students must attend schoolwithout federal financial assistance while clearing their Satisfactory AcademicProgress. When reinstatement is granted, a student may be considered forthose financial aid funds available at the time.This policy is effective beginning with the 2011-2012 aid year.Financial Aid Refund PolicyThe refunding of financial aid funds to the appropriate funding sourcecorresponds to federal regulations, the Return to Title IV fund requirements,and YSU’s refund policy regarding student fees upon withdrawal fromclass(es). For additional information, please see the section titled “Reduction/Refund of Fees and Charges Upon Withdrawal” within the Tuition, Fees, andCharges section of the catalog.Commonly Used Financial TermsCost of Attendance (COA): The total cost of attending school for one academicyear, including direct costs (tuition, fees, room, and board) and indirect costs(books, supplies, transportation, and additional miscellaneous expenses).Expected Family Contribution (EFC): The amount that a student and theirfamily will be expected to contribute toward educational expenses, asdetermined by the federal government, based on the information supplied onthe FAFSA.

Scholarships (p. 783) are alsoavailable.AssistantshipsThe assistantship program is predicated on the idea that graduate students,given an opportunity to assist the faculty, provide a service to the institutionand also gain valuable experience through this work in association with thefaculty. Appointments to assistantships are made by the dean of The Collegeof Graduate Studies only upon recommendation by the student’s academicdepartment. In those instances, in which the student indicates acceptanceof an assistantship award after April 15, the student may not accept anotherappointment without first obtaining formal release for this purpose.Applications for assistantships must be accompanied or preceded byapplication for admission to the College of Graduate Studies. All applicantsand current students with superior credentials including first-year internationalgraduate students may apply for graduate assistantships.Graduate assistants may be assigned to instructional, research, and/or otheracademic duties as determined by the department in which the assistant isappointed and as approved by the dean of The College of Graduate Studies.Graduate Assistant (GA) A GA is normally be assigned duties primarily focusedon the conduct of research/scholarly activity. A GA may be assigned teachingduties, but should not be the instructor of record. Appointment is typically forthe Fall and Spring semesters of an academic year.Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) A GRA is only be assigned duties focusedon the conduct of research/scholarly activity and will typically receive atwelve-month appointment.Graduate Assistant/Intern (GA/I) A GA/I is a special category of graduateassistant designated to provide opportunities for university offices ordepartments, community companies or agencies, or other appropriate externalsponsors to involve graduate students as academic assistants/interns in reallife experiences related to their fields of study.Teaching Assistant (TA) A TA will only be assigned duties focused oninstruction and may be the instructor of record for a regularly scheduled lowerdivision undergraduate class.Note: Additional academic services to the academic program in which thestudent is enrolled may be appropriate for all assistantship appointments.A student appointed as a graduate assistant (GA, GRA, TA and GA/I) will bepaid a stipend. The student transportation fee will be remitted during eachterm of appointment. The department/agency of service will provide a stipendto the university which will be paid to the student through the normal stipendprocess for GA/I appointments.Assistantships require 20 hours per week during the Fall and Spring semester,including exam week, for duties to be assigned by the department chair.Graduate assistants assigned to classroom or laboratory duties are underthe direct supervision of a full-service faculty member who will retain fullresponsibility for the maintenance of high academic and pedagogicalstandards.The Chair of the department will be responsible for assessing the oralproficiency in English. Students who do not achieve a satisfactory rating willnot be permitted to teach, and will be assigned non-teaching duties (research,grading, etc.) International graduate students, who have been appointed asteaching assistants, including graduate assistants who are assisting withteaching duties, are required to demonstrate oral proficiency in English. Thespeaking subsection of a standardized test will be utilized in the assessmentprocess. For a TA, a minimum of 23 on the TOEFL is considered satisfactory; ascore of 7 is considered satisfactory on the IBT.Graduate students who are in provisional status because of undergraduatecoursework deficiencies cannot be appointed as teaching assistants untilthe required coursework is completed. Such students can be considered forresearch appointments. Exceptions to this policy may be considered and mustbe reviewed and approved by the dean of the College of Graduate Studies.To remain eligible for the assistantship, an appointee must discharge his orher duties satisfactorily and maintain good academic standing. An appointeemust maintain full-time enrollment (9 semester hours of degree-creditcoursework per term for the regular academic year. In addition, studentsappointed as Graduate Research Assistants must also enroll in at least 6semester hours during the summer term. With the advisor’s approval, graduatecoursework that is not part of the graduate assistant’s degree program maybe counted toward the 18-semester-hour minimum for the assistantship.Approval to carry more than 18 semester hours or fewer than nine semesterhours in any semester may be granted by the dean of The College of GraduateStudies only upon clear justification from the student’s academic programdepartment. (For a TA who is the instructor of record and has a teaching loadof five to six semester hours, the minimum required enrollment is six semesterhours, but the College of Graduate Studies must be notified of this). For ateaching assistant who is the instructor of record and has a teaching load offour semester hours or less, the minimum required enrollment remains at ninesemester hours.)Graduate assistants shall not hold other full-time employment but may acceptoccasional or temporary employment outside the University during the termof the assistantship, subject to the approval of the department chair or theprogram director of the department. Other employment on the YSU campusrequires the approval of the dean of The College of Graduate Studies.Each assistantship provides a stipend. Graduate assistants may also beawarded a Graduate College Premiere Scholarship 36.0.Graduate College Premiere ScholarshipGraduate College Premiere Scholarship is typically provided for 36.0 semesterhoursThe Graduate College Premiere Scholarship 36.0 provides:•Up to 36sh of instructional fees during the combined fall and springsemesters and up to 12sh for the summer term (for graduate coursesrequired to complete a single degree program) Note: Summer scholarshipsrequire renewal of the scholarship.•Nonresident tuition surcharge•Music performance fees (if applicable)Criteria for Initial Award:•Acceptance for regular admission to the College of Graduate Studies(Exceptions may be granted by the graduate dean)•Cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale.•Recommendation by the appropriate academic dean•Approval by the dean of graduate studiesTo Maintain the Scholarship:•Student must remain in good standing•Student must maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA on a 4.0-point scale for allgraduate coursework•Student must maintain enrollment of at least 18 semester hours of degree-credit coursework for the academic year and no fewer than 9 semesterhours in each of the fall and spring semesters (Exceptions may be grantedby the graduate dean)Youngstown State University            781•Making good progress towards degree completion, as determined by thedepartment chairNotes:•Awards are subject to availability of funds•This compensation may be subject to taxation•Typically, the initial scholarship will cover Fall and Spring terms and therenewal of scholarship will include Summer, Fall and Spring.Failure to meet any of the criteria to maintain this scholarship will result intermination of the scholarship.Graduate assistants who have been admitted with undergraduate coursedeficiencies will make up course deficiencies by taking the appropriatecourses at their own expense.Further information regarding assistantship stipends and scholarships isavailable at The College of Graduate Studies Assistantship and Fellowshipwebsite (http://cms.ysu.edu/college-graduate-studies/assistantships-fellowships).Guidelines for Graduate Assistant LeaveCircumstances occasionally occur that prevent graduate assistants (includingGAs, TAs, and GAIs) from performing the duties of their appointment.Consistent with Youngstown State University’s effort to support all membersof our community, these guidelines seek to reduce the professional andpersonal stresses that can develop when graduate assistants encounterextenuating circumstances that warrant a temporary absence from theirassistantship duties. The purpose of these guidelines is to outline howinstances of personal and/or family illness, injury, childbirth or adoption, andother agreed upon and valid reasons for absence should be addressed bythe unit funding the assistantship. These guidelines are intended to ensurethat the graduate assistant support be maintained to the extent possibleduring an approved absence. In the cases of foreseeable events, the graduateassistant should inform his/her direct assistantship supervisor as soon asthe circumstances and dates of needed leave are known. For unforeseeableevents, notification should be made as soon as possible once the need arises.It should be noted that leave requests may be jeopardized or denied forreasons including, but not limited to, multiple leave requests, unsatisfactoryperformance levels, evidence of dishonesty, and insufficient documentation.Furthermore, these guidelines pertain only to issues related to the individual asa graduate assistant. There are separate attendance policies for the individualas a graduate assistant at YSU.Short-term graduate assistant absences may be requested for valid periodsof absences which typically span less than two weeks in duration. In theseinstances, the graduate assistant should make the request to his/her directassistantship supervisor as promptly as possible, so that coverage of dutiesduring the requested short-term absence can be addressed. Reasonablerequests for short-term absences can typically be approved with all graduateassistant benefits maintained. The graduate assistant should work with thedirect assistantship supervisor and the department chair to ensure that thetime can be made up in a reasonable manner through creative ways such asworking up to an extra five hours per week, working over university breaks,etc. The graduate assistants, the direct assistantship supervisor, and thedepartment chair should agree to this plan in writing through the Short Term/Extended Leave Form (See Attached).For needed absences from graduate assistant duties of longer than twoweeks, a graduate assistant must formally request an extended leave. Long-term absences may be requested for a variety of valid reasons as previouslynoted. These types of requests should be reasonable and include writtendocumentation related to the reason for absence (such as a letter from amedical doctor, legal documentation, etc.). The request for extended leavemust be made to the chair of the department providing the assistantship inconsultation with the direct assistantship supervisor. Whenever possible,the department chair should not reassign workload to another graduateassistant. Graduate assistants who are formally approved through the ShortTerm/Extended Leave Form will be excused from their regular graduateassistant activities for the duration of their approved leave. Although tuitionremission will continue during the extended absence, graduate assistantswill no longer receive the monthly stipend for the duration of their approvedleave. The graduate assistant’s monthly stipend resume upon successfulreturn to the graduate assistant position within the particular appointmentperiod. Should the graduate assistant require additional leave time beyond theoriginal agreement, this must be formally approved by the department chair inconsultation with the direct graduate assistant supervisor through the ShortTerm/Extended Leave Form. Should the graduate assistants be unable toreturn until after the original appointment ending date, there is no guarantee ofthe availability of a continued graduate assistantship. However, the graduatestudent would be considered for future graduate assistant appointments in amanner consistent with all other graduate students.Graduate Assistant/InternA special category of graduate assistant, designated as a graduate assistant/intern (GA/I), provides opportunities for University offices or departments,community companies or agencies, or other appropriate external sponsorsto involve graduate students as academic assistants/interns in “real life”experiences related to their fields of study. The department/agency of servicewill provide a stipend to the University, which will be paid to the studentthrough the normal stipend process. The GA/I will be expected to work in theinternship work environment 20 hours per week.Further information about graduate assistant/intern appointments may beobtained from the College of Graduate Studies.Cushwa/Commercial ShearingGraduate FellowshipsCushwa/Commercial Shearing Graduate Fellowships are available forselected outstanding graduate students in YSU’s master’s degree programs inScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Upon successfulcompletion of the program, Cushwa Fellows will be awarded a master’sdegree in their field of study. The Charles B. Cushwa, Jr./Commercial Shear-ing Inc.

A student must attempt to resolve the complaint by first discussing theissue with the faculty member. If the complaint is not resolved at that level, thestudent should direct his or her complaint to the department chair and, if thecomplaint is still not resolved, then to the dean of the college.Complaints not resolved following a discussion with the dean will beconsidered by an associate provost or designee, who will serve as JudicialChair. Upon his or her review, the Judicial Chair determines whether thecomplaint is grievable. If the complaint is grievable, it is presented to theStudent Academic Grievance Subcommittee. Per the YSU-OEA Agreement,Article 20, academic matters that may be grieved are the following:•Material deviation from the grading scale or weight distribution indicatedon the course syllabus by the faculty member, to the detriment of theindividual student or the entire class.•Material deviation of faculty contractual obligations as specified in thearticle on Teaching Rights and Responsibilities in the Faculty CollectiveBargaining Agreement, to the detriment of the individual student or theentire class.Other areas of contention between a student and a faculty member may not begrieved under this section. The student should contact the department chairof the faculty member's department or the dean of the college housing thefaculty member's department for further advisement in these situations.Students wishing to file a grievance should contact the administrativeassistant in the Office of the Provost for an appropriate referral.

leadingto teacher licensure and to the Bachelor of Science in Education degree.MissionThe Beeghly College of Education serves Northeast Ohio, WesternPennsylvania, and beyond as a premier provider of programs that prepareteachers, counselors, educational administrators, and school psychologists aswell as providing developmental education programs to the YSU community.The Beeghly College of Education, within our conceptual framework Reflectionin Action, is dedicated to:•preparing teachers, counselors, school psychologists, and administratorswho apply rigorous scientifically-based professional knowledge tocontemporary educational practice and issues;•facilitating, encouraging, and supporting all departments and alliedprograms in meeting internal and external standards;•recruiting, tenuring, promoting, and rewarding faculty who demonstrateexcellence in teaching, scholarship, and service to the university,community, and stakeholders;•promoting the educational ideals of a democratic and diverse society forcandidates and P-12 students, faculty, staff, and the community acrossage, race, class, gender, culture, ethnicity, disability, and lifestyle;•educating reflective practitioners and leaders who are committed toempowering those whom they serve.Conceptual Framework: Reflection inActionAt the initial level, the College’s professional education programs aredefined within a conceptual framework that articulates goals and identifiesinstitutional standards that all teacher candidates are expected to meet.Our Conceptual Framework, Reflection in Action, seeks to develop reflectiveteachers who are:98         Majors in Teacher EducationReasoned: Candidates exercise rational judgment and give thoughtfulconsideration to their professional activities and decisions.Ethical: Candidates act in a moral, legal, and principled manner inprofessional practice.Fair: Candidates exercise democratic fairness, principled concern, andhumane care in their professional activities.Logical: Candidates think analytically in a deliberately consistent andrationally defensible manner.Effective: Candidates apply professional knowledge in a consciouslypurposeful and deliberate manner.Critical: Candidates use professional knowledge, objectively applying itto their own professional actions and the professional actions of othersto the benefit of their students and clients.Technical: Candidates attend to procedural details and optimize the useof technologies appropriate to professional practice.This conceptual framework functions to inform, guide, and inspire faculty andteacher candidates by providing a central core of related ideas from whichprograms evolve, are explained, and are assessed.Academic Departments•Department of

Students wishing topursue a minor should consult the list of official minors and seek advisementin the department that houses the minor. Minors consist of at least eighteen(18) semester hours, and one-third of the hours must be upper-division. Inapproved interdisciplinary minors, courses from the student's major disciplinecan be counted in the minor provided that the same courses are not countedtoward the major.Field ExperiencesThe field experiences designed by the Beeghly College of Education provide anopportunity for teacher candidates to implement the ideals embraced in theconceptual framework in actual classroom practice. These field experiencestake place in a variety of school and community settings that encompasscultural and demographic diversity, as well as exceptional populations. Thenature and duration of field-based activities vary in the amount of observationand participation based on specific course and program requirements,culminating in the clinical experience referred to as student teaching. Studentteaching is a full day commitment for sixteen weeks for all majors. All fieldand clinical experiences encourage the teacher candidate to reflect on currentpractices both observed and experienced. An integral part of the reflectionprocess is the feedback that candidates receive from the College of Educationfaculty, school faculty and their peers.AccreditationYoungstown State University teacher education programs are accredited bythe Ohio Department of Education and the National Council for Accreditationof Teacher Education (NCATE). These programs are subject to the sectionsof the Ohio law and regulations governing teacher education and licensure.The Beeghly College of Education serves as the recommending agent for allYoungstown State University graduates who wish to qualify for state of Ohiolicensure as well as for licensure in other states.Degree RequirementsRequirements for completion of a baccalaureate degree (BSEd) within theCollege of Education include all University requirements detailed in theAcademic Policies and Procedures section of the Undergraduate Catalog (i.e.,graduation and general education requirements, university credits, courselevels, majors, grade point average, residency and degree applications).Specific requirements for each major in the College of Education are listed inthe catalog.For more information, visit the Beeghly College of Education (http://www.ysu.edu/academics/beeghly-college-education).Majors in Teacher EducationThe following designations indicate student majors:•Early Childhood Education/Early Childhood Intervention Specialist withTeaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) Endorsement- (Pre-kindergarten through grade three).

At the graduate level, we offer master's degrees inEconomics and Financial Economics. At both the undergraduate and graduatelevels, all students must complete a capstone project which gives them “handson” experience in empirical research. Our new “4+1” program allows highlyqualified students to take up to nine semester hours of graduate courseworkthat can be counted both towards a bachelor's degree and a master's degree,giving students the opportunity to complete a master's degree in Economics inone year after they have earned their baccalaureate degree.The Department of Economics is very proud of the many alumni of ourprograms who have gone on to successful careers in government, the privatesector, and academia. Career opportunities for economists continue to bestrong, especially for students who complete a graduate degree.Since 2009, the department’s faculty have had more than 30 publications,either articles in refereed journals or chapters in books. Faculty have publishedin such highly-regarded journals as the Journal of Financial Research, EconomicInquiry, and Public Choice. Three of the department’s faculty have receiveddistinguished professor awards for scholarship.The Economics Club, a student organization, regularly sponsors speakerswho describe their careers in the field of economics. We also have an activechapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the national honorary society for economicsstudents. The department stays in touch with students, alumni, and the YSUcampus community through our biannual newsletter.Welcome from the ChairEconomic theory provides a powerful set of tools to analyze behavior andevaluate policies. Studying economics opens a wide variety of different careerpaths while also being fun because the questions asked are both intellectuallystimulating and relevant to people’s lives.

They assumeresponsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate foran organization. They integrate those products with organizational needs andinfrastructure, and install, customize and maintain those applications, therebyproviding a secure and effective environment that supports the activities of theorganization’s computer users. In IT, programming often involves writing shortprograms that typically connect existing components (scripting).Planning and managing an organization’s IT infrastructure is a difficult andcomplex job that requires a solid foundation in applied computing as wellas management and people skills. Those in the IT discipline require specialskills – in understanding, for example, how networked systems are composedand structured, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. There areimportant software systems concerns such as reliability, security, usability,and effectiveness and efficiency for their intended purpose; all of theseconcerns are vital. These topics are difficult and intellectually demanding.The program supports work processes and employee performanceenhancements; is designed to improve overall workgroup and individualproductivity; and addresses the creation, distribution, storage, and use ofinformation in all its states.

Mechanicalengineers are concerned with the practical purpose and function of a machineor system, as well as its design for strength, reliability, safety, economy, andappearance.Program MissionThe mission of the mechanical engineering program is to further the missionsand objectives of the University and the College of Science, Technology,Engineering and Mathematics by providing an opportunity for a qualityeducation in Mechanical Engineering to the people it serves, particularlythose in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The program also strivesto provide professional service to the local and regional industry and to the558         Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineeringpublic. The program is committed to meeting regional and state-wide prioritiesin higher education by providing its students with a broad, general educationand an up-to-date technological curriculum in a four-year undergraduateprogram, and an application-oriented evening graduate program, offering aMaster of Science in Engineering degree to practicing engineers and recentengineering graduates. The program also strives to enhance quality researchand scholarly activities to be integrated with teaching and meet the needs ofthe region by providing area schools, businesses, industries, and governmentagencies with technical expertise.Program Educational ObjectivesThe program educational objectives of the mechanical engineeringundergraduate program are to educate graduates who will be professional,productive, and ethical members of society. As they progress professionallyafter graduation, our alumni will do the following:1.Demonstrate successful application of mechanical engineering knowledgeand skills through:a.employment in leadership roles in industry, academia, government, orother organizationsb.engagement in research and development in graduate study orindustryc.analytical problem solving in less traditional careers such as law,medicine, business, public policy, secondary education, serviceindustries, etc.d.mentorship of younger engineers in careers involving management orentrepreneurship2.Demonstrate the commitment to lifelong learning through:a.active participation in professional development opportunities in theirdisciplines; such as conferences, short courses, graduate educationb.development of new knowledge and skills necessary for new areas ofexpertise or careersc.adaption of their fundamental engineering knowledge foreffectiveness in changing global markets and workforce trends3.Demonstrate active engagement in professional service through:a.application of their engineering knowledge to advance society and tohelp solve technical and societal problemsb.engagement in activities that promote sustainable economicdevelopment that enhances the quality of lifec.promotion of the engineering profession as a source of societal goodd.participation in community activities where their engineeringknowledge adds significantly to their contributionsThese Program Educational Objectives describe long-term accomplishmentsfor which we seek to prepare the graduates of Youngstown State Universitymechanical engineering program. It is expected that progress toward theseobjectives is measurable.Vision StatementMechanical engineering and mechanical engineering education, in particular,face dramatic challenges in the future due to rapidly changing technologiesand a new pattern of societal and industrial demands. The vision of theprogram is to meet these challenges and exceed the expectations of itsconstituents by focusing on the following primary strategies of the program:•Continuous improvement of an educational environment for outstandingteaching and learning•Development of a productive research program through a strategic focuson technology development in emerging areas such as green energy,computer simulation, and nanotechnology•Successful co-op and internship programs that provides students with on-the-job training opportunities•An assessment program and procedures in order to insure a high qualityprogram focusing on the needs of the program's constituents (thestudents, alumni, employers, faculty, administrations, community and thegeneral public)•Healthy enrollment that facilitates diversification of curriculum and facultyresearch and professional developmentIn order to achieve its educational objectives and to further the missionsand objectives of the University and the College, the program provides aneducational environment, teeming with opportunities for students to learn andacquire essential knowledge and skills that are defined in the ABET Criteria2000, through its curriculum and extra-curricular activities. The programmaintains undergraduate and graduate curricula that are well balancedin engineering fundamentals, state-of-the-art technology, and real-worldengineering applications, in the primary specialty areas of fluid thermalsciences, and mechanics of deformable bodies. The undergraduate curriculumalso contains courses that foster:•critical and independent thinking•decision making•development of interpersonal communication and a life-long learningattitude•working within a team•integration of knowledge, skills, ethics, and personal responsibilityAlthough the program intends to cultivate the capabilities of its students'problem solving, fundamental and advanced engineering analyses, design,research, and development, it also intends to provide the students withmaximum exposure to hands-on, experimental skills to insure the highquality of its graduates. Through courses like stress analysis, thermal fluidapplications, and finite element analysis, students will acquire strong toolsfor design and pertinent knowledge to solve real-world engineering problems.Our emphasis on engineering applications, computer simulation, and hands-onexperience are complementary to each other and encourage students to applyanalytical methods to engineering problems.This approach enhances the effectiveness of teaching and also facilitatesthe students' understanding of abstract and difficult subjects. The ultimategoal of the program is to provide the society and industry with "whole person"mechanical engineers with superior technical capability.Mechanical Engineering LaboratoriesThe mechanical engineering program maintains six physical experimentallaboratories in Moser Hall. A wide array of modern equipment, instrumentationdevices, and department-owned computers are housed in spacious roomsthat support academic instruction and research activities in appliedthermodynamics, heating and air conditioning, fluid mechanics, heat transfer,stress analysis, vibrations, and material property characterization. Othermechanical engineering laboratories are simulation and computing-relatedlaboratories that include computer-aided design, machine design, kinematicand dynamic systems, and finite-element analysis. The College and themechanical engineering program maintain modern computing facilities inMoser Hall and constantly upgrade hardware and software. The studentsand faculty also use the university computing facilities in Meshel Hall andKilcawley Center.For more information, visit Mechanical Engineering (http://www.ysu.edu/academics/science-technology-engineering-mathematics/mechanical-engineering-major).Cooperative EducationThe mechanical engineering program strongly encourages its studentsto actively participate in the optional cooperative education program. Theparallel co-op arrangement which combines work and study each semesteris recommended. However, full time employment in the summer can also beincluded. Students must register for a co-op course and submit documentationas specified by professional practice office.Youngstown State University            559AdvisementThe mechanical engineering program specifies mandatory advisement.

Here, you will find a medium-sized department(a little more than 350 students) with a warm and cheerful environment thatputs students first. Our facilities include smart classrooms, audio and videolabs, journalism labs, and an full-HD television studio.For more information about the department, including meeting with a facultymember who will help you prepare for the future, contact the departmentoffice at (330) 941-3631, or email our department administrative assistant, Ms.Debbie Yiannaki, at dayiannaki@ysu.edu. The department office is located inBliss Hall, Room 2000.ProgramsCommunication Studies, B.A.Courses in this B.A. degree program provide students with the necessarycommunication skills for an evolving global marketplace and future careerdemands. The Communication Studies program deals, in part, with peoplein conversations in settings that are usually face-to-face, but that areincreasingly becoming mediated (such as computer-mediated). Publicspeaking, media and public relations, persuasion, conflict management, socialmedia, and gender communication are some of the areas students examinein this major. Courses touch on a wide variety of areas including social andpolitical movements, the process of legislation, or new media communication.Program TracksCommunication Studies courses address the universal emphasis placedon effective, competent communication skills by employers and recruiters.The core curriculum of 18 credit hours includes courses covering thesecommunication skills. The curriculum is then divided into four unique tracks tobetter prepare students for a particular career. Each of the tracks is describedbelow. The overriding goal of each track is to challenge each student toexplore and apply the many forms of communication:•Human resources or management careers in profit or nonprofitorganizations, or those looking for a general, all-encompassingcommunication degree, should consider the interpersonal/organizationaltrack.•A career path in media management, media criticism, or public relationsand advertising should choose the media track.•Careers in pharmaceutical sales, industrial sales, retail and corporatesales, politics, or law (including law school) should choose the persuasiontrack.•Our newest curricular offering focuses on social media management,marketing, literacy, communication, and campaigning. Students interestedin these new media options should choose the social media track.Students completing their degree in communication studies are uniquelyqualified to enter the job market and compete effectively throughout theircareers for advancement and promotion.Through course offerings and applied learning experiences, thecommunication studies program combines a rich liberal arts emphasis witha much needed specialized professional and career focus for undergraduatestudents.Admission Policy for Communication StudiesTo major in communication studies, entering freshmen may simply declarea communication studies major. Transfer students must have a GPA of2.00 and be in "good academic standing." Students are expected to meetwith a communication studies faculty advisor prior to registration and areencouraged to meet with an advisor when they have questions or concerns,and to monitor progress.Journalism, B.A.Information is power. Society must have professionals who can supply peoplewith the information they need to make decisions about their lives and theirfutures. At Youngstown State University, we believe in the importance ofjournalism to society and to democracy. We believe that journalists have thepower to shape the world.Guided by this philosophy, YSU's journalism major gives you a balance ofpractical and theoretical experience. We teach you to ask tough questions, touncover and interpret information, to write leads, to conduct interviews, andto work with technologies to deliver the news in multiple platforms from printto broadcast to podcast. We also encourage you to think critically about thestories you report and the impact they will have on communities and society ingeneral.The journalism program trains students for entry-level positions in reporting,editing, and newspaper design. The curriculum is a blend of courses thatsupport this goal, such as news reporting, editorial and opinion writing,feature writing, editing and design for newspapers, a journalism practicum(journalism workshop) in which students write for the student newspaper,and a battery of courses designed to enhance editing, writing and publishingskills. Journalism majors are encouraged to declare minors that support theirspecific career objectives, such as public relations, photography, politicalscience, telecommunications, or art/design.Why Journalism?There has never been a better time to study journalism.With the explosion of available information, people now need and wantcredible information. They need what journalists do and there are more venuesnow than at any other point in history for how to disseminate that information.Be prepared. This is not the journalism of yesterday. While still loyal to thebasic principles of giving people accurate and reliable information that theyneed to make decisions about their lives, journalism has changed in how newsis delivered.Ink and newsprint are virtually obsolete. Instead, you will be telling stories withvideo cameras and still cameras and you will be getting story tips from readersand linking to other people's reporting. The world of modern journalism is allabout innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.Why Journalism at YSUAt Youngstown State University, we understand the importance of journalismin society.With a hands-on teaching philosophy and a strong belief in practicalexperience, YSU journalism instructors train students for careers in journalism.We also train students to be entrepreneurial in their thinking about how toapply their journalistic skills. From the basics of news judgment to moresophisticated ethical decisions, YSU journalism majors graduate with the skillsto land jobs, build careers and most importantly, report important stories in allmedia platforms.We keep close watch on trends in the industry and are always eager for waysto integrate new ideas and technologies into what we teach. We are alsodeeply committed to innovation and experimentation. We work hard to help ourstudents gain professional experience and routinely help them get their workbroadcast or published by local, state and national media.Reporters and editors from numerous legacy and new media organizations,from The Vindicator and The New York Times to ProPublica and WFMJTelevision, offer us regular feedback about our program and what we need tobe offering students.Admission Policy for journalismTo major in journalism, entering freshmen may simply declare a journalismmajor. Transfer students must have a GPA of 2.00 and be in "good academicstanding." Students are expected to meet with a journalism faculty advisorYoungstown State University            217prior to registration and are encouraged to meet with an advisor when theyhave questions or concerns, and to monitor progress.Telecommunication Studies, B.A.Telecommunication Studies (TCOM) at YSU is a dynamic, cutting edgebaccalaureate program comprising about 125 majors and 12 full- and part-time faculty. We focus on the messages that bombard us every day — throughadvertising, television and film, news, the Internet, magazines, friends, familyand more. We study how to make those messages, how to package anddistribute them, and how to profit from them.Our program addresses human communication that passes through somemedium such as television, radio or the Internet. For example, in this area,students may study how the Internet impacts traditional forms of broadcastmedia (i.e., radio, television). Students learn about early stages of the field,as well as contemporary combinations of telecasting through the Internet.Courses in the TCOM curriculum provide students with an in-depth knowledgeand intellectual challenge in electronic communication. Students receivepractical orientation to the skills and techniques of broadcasting. Studentsexplore contemporary theories and problems which are central to media, aswell as examine new communication media.From a liberal arts perspective, the TCOM curriculum is designed to aid thestudent in pursuit of careers not only in broadcasting but also in recentlyexpanding avenues of communication such as non-commercial broadcasting,corporate communication, industrial communication, cablecasting, andindependent production. Internships are available in media organizations tostudents of superior academic achievement.Program TracksYour degree program will comprise several clusters of requirements:General Education, which helps you learn the core knowledge for a collegeeducation and to master the skills you’ll need to be effective in learning atadvanced levels.Major and Minor, where you develop mastery of your main interest areas. Also,you study at levels far above that in any other course area.You’ll find two types of courses in your major.

Wealso offer a certificate in Gerontology and minors in seven different areas,including Archaeology, Forensic Anthropology, and others. All of our programsare hands-on, offering students opportunities for internships, fieldwork, andstudy abroad so that they emerge well-qualified to pursue graduate degreesand rewarding careers.352         Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and GerontologySOCIOLOGYSociology is the scientific study of society, human social relationships, andsocial institutions. At the core of sociology is the sociological imagination –a need to make the familiar strange and look beyond what is normally taken-for-granted to more nuanced understandings of social life. Much like societyitself, sociological investigations are diverse, covering everything from theanalysis of strangers interacting on the street to global social movements.The Sociology Program at YSU gives students a broad education in the fieldof sociology, emphasizing contemporary issues related to inequality, socialinstitutions, gender and the family, deviance and criminology, aging, andresearch. Students learn how to think critically about human social life, seekanswers to research questions, and help others understand how society worksand how we might improve it. Our students have the opportunity to internwith a number of local and regional organizations, such as the Northeast OhioCoalition Against Human Trafficking and Compass Community and FamilyServices.ANTHROPOLOGYAnthropology is the cultural and biological study of humankind. It is adiscipline that asks such question as, “What makes us human?” “How didwe develop biologically and culturally?” “Where did we come from and whereare we going?” Through the study of Archaeology, Biological Anthropology,and Cultural Anthropology at YSU, students explore these questions and theways in which we begin to answer them. Students are broadly trained in thediscipline and emerge well-trained to pursue graduate degrees and careersin and related to anthropology. The program offers numerous opportunitiesto work with materials in the classroom and lab, including osteologicaland faunal remains and artifacts. Our students participate on faculty-ledarchaeological class projects in Guatemala, the Bahamas, and in northeastOhio and have joined anthropological field schools in Belize, Canada, SouthAfrica, Cypress, and elsewhere.GERONTOLOGYGerontology is the study of aging and the related issues of aging throughinterdisciplinary perspectives. The YSU Gerontology Program provides accessto innovative internship opportunities that align with coursework to betterassist older individuals, starting with our older adults living in the MahoningValley. We require internships and have partnered with over 30 organizations.Our courses also offer community based projects with the Mahoning CountyProbate Court and the Area Agency on Aging XI.LONG-TERM CARE ADMINISTRATION (LTCA)The LTCA program prepares students to work in any part of the spectrum oflong-term care services and supports.

Themilitary science program at YSU offers a four-year course of study that addspractical management training and leadership experience to students' chosendegrees.ROTC expands a student's education by providing leadership and managementexperience. This training helps students develop self-discipline, physicalstamina, and poise--qualities basic to success in any worthwhile career.Students genuinely interested in military service can earn commission assecond lieutenants in the U.S. Army (which includes the Active Army, ArmyNational Guard, and Army Reserve) while earning their college degrees.Through ROTC, the Army gains Officers with diverse educational backgroundsand contemporary ideas. At the same time, ROTC graduates have the chanceto use their training in positions of leadership, and they enable the Army torelate to the thoughts and feelings of our ever-changing society.At present, over 70 percent of all second lieutenants for the U.S. Army comefrom ROTC programs nationwide. Students who have career goals outside theArmy that require leadership or managerial skills, with interests in nationaldefense structure, and who wish to explore the benefits of the Army areencouraged to enroll in the introductory lower-division military sciencecourses. These courses can be applied as elective credit toward graduation.Participation in these classes is voluntary and carries no military obligation.Army ROTC is one of the programs at YSU that provides leadership training. InArmy ROTC, students quickly gain the confidence and self-discipline necessaryto succeed in college. As they progress, students acquire skills and experiencein taking charge of activities, setting goals, managing people and resources,and making decisions in demanding circumstances. When they complete theArmy ROTC program and graduate from YSU, students will have gained bothleadership and academic credentials necessary to take on responsibility asArmy Officers and/or step into corporate America. A minor in Military Scienceis available in consultation with the academic major advisor and the MilitaryScience Department.Opportunities for Veterans/Junior ROTCGraduatesBecause military experience may serve as total credit for the ROTC BasicCourse, most veterans and students with three years of Junior ROTC (highschool) are eligible for the ROTC Advanced Course without further instruction.Army ROTC/Army Reserve/Army NationalGuardStudents can further broaden their college experience and earn extra incomeby combining ROTC with service in the Army Reserve or Army National Guardthrough the two-year Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP). If studentsqualify, and SMP vacancies are available, they may join the Army Reserve orArmy National Guard unit as Officer trainees and simultaneously enroll in theArmy ROTC Advanced Course. In addition to an annual subsistence allowancereceived for Advanced ROTC, SMP participants are paid for their Reserveor Guard drills and summer training sessions.

YSU offers the equivalent highschool courses for those not meeting these pre-college requirements. Thesehigh school deficiencies do not count toward graduation requirements andshould be completed during the first two years of enrollment.Each engineering program has minimum graduation requirements. Theserequirements can affect a student's enrollment in senior-level classes. Ifa senior-level student reaches a point where it is not possible to achievegraduation requirements, further enrollment in engineering classes willbe denied. In addition to the overall recalculated C average required bythe University, an unrecalculated C average in the major is required. Also,an unrecalculated C average in all engineering courses is required in allmajors. These minimum graduation requirements are referred to as a triple Crequirement.Youngstown State University            459Chemical EngineeringA student who is failing to meet the triple C requirement prior to the senior yearwill be denied enrollment in ngineering Communication with CAD2ngineering Communication with CAD2ngineering Communication with CAD2ngineering Communication with CAD2ngineering Communication with CAD2"

We have entered an era where genomicsequencing and the examination of entire biological systems is commonplace.In this era of genomic sequencing and genetic engineering of a whole hostof organisms a knowledge of Molecular biology is essential. The Bachelorof Science in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology is designed to preparestudents for careers in fields where an in depth knowledge of molecularbiology and biotechnology are needed.The current Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences is very broad. Noclear track to knowledge and skills in Molecular Biology and Biotechnologyis discernable. In this program students will be prepared for research ortechnically intensive graduate programs and career positions requiringa knowledge set and expertise in molecular biology/ biotechnology. Alsostudents from this program that choose a public policy career will be betterinformed of the issues facing society in regards to molecular biology than theirpeers.This program is aimed to be an interface between fundamental basic sciencesand applied sciences. The degree will require almost no additional resourcesfrom the University. The Department of Biological Sciences and the STEMcollege already have the faculty, research base, and courses to implement thisprogram. The Bachelors degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology willsimply clarify for students a pathway to acquiring a specific set of skills andknowledge that are already available at Youngstown State University.The B.S. Certificate in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology is designedto give the student a competitive edge in obtaining career opportunities inpharmaceuticals, biomedical, biotechnology, recombinant DNA technologybased fields as well a broader opportunities. This is a research and techniquesfocused curriculum that emphasizes the molecular biology sciences.Criteria for admission to the certificate program: Due to the research-intensiveaspects of this program, a limited number of competitive candidates willbe selected for participation in the Certificate. Minimum requirements foradmission to the Certificate in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology are; 1)completion of the prerequisite course in the certificate curriculum and 2) a3.0 GPA.

Students in these programs may work toward atwo-year associate degree and then continue to earn a four-year bachelor'sdegree. The programs include both classroom and laboratory experiences thatstress the application of established engineering and computer knowledgeand methods to the solution of problems. They include study of the sciencesand mathematics necessary to support a technology, as well as study ofthe methods, processes, skills, and materials used in that technology. Theprograms are designed to prepare graduates for job opportunities in industryand the public sector. Demands developed by an expanding technology placegraduates of these programs in one of the fastest-growing occupationalgroups in the country.Associate of Technical Study DegreeThe School of Engineering Technology offers an Associate of Technical Study(ATS) degree in•Power Plant (Electrical Utilities) Technology.Students in this program are awarded academic credit for skills-relatedexperience and training to compliment the academic coursework at YSU.Associate of Applied Science DegreeThe school offers two-year programs in:•Civil and Construction Engineering Technology•Electrical Engineering Technology•Mechanical Engineering TechnologyGraduates of these programs are awarded the Associate of Applied Sciencedegree and may serve as engineering technicians.Graduates of the associate degree programs are prepared to supportscientists and engineers. Their work is in the design, drafting (CAD),development, testing, and production phases of engineering projects. Theirtasks include laboratory testing, data gathering, evaluation, and instrumentcalibration. They may perform quality-control tests, serve as technicalsales representatives, or serve as technical writers in the formulation ofspecifications or trade manuals.Degrees in these programs may be earned in four semesters if studentsaverage 17-18 hours per semester.Bachelor of Science in Applied ScienceDegreeThe civil and construction engineering technology, electrical engineeringtechnology, and mechanical engineering technology programs are based onthe "two-plus-two'' educational system which provides the student with theflexibility of earning an associate degree and a bachelor's degree according tohis or her needs. After completing the requirements of the associate degree,the student may elect to either enter industry or, through an added two yearsof full-time study (averaging 17 hours per semester) or equivalent part-timestudy, earn the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science (BSAS).Graduates of the BSAS degree program obtain employment as engineeringtechnologists or engineering designers for government agencies, consultingengineers and architects, industry and manufacturing, and contractors.Because their education is more extensive, they are prepared for moreresponsibility and more-rapid advancement. BSAS engineering technologistsand designers plan, design, inspect, and direct construction, production, andmaintenance activities.Based on an evaluation of their work, transfer students who have a relatedassociate degree from a regionally accredited institution may be admitted tothe bachelor's degree program at the junior level.Accreditation and RegistrationThe civil and construction, electrical, and mechanical engineering technologyassociate and bachelor programs are accredited by the ETAC AccreditationCommission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. In most states, including Ohio,West Virginia and Pennsylvania, bachelor's degree graduates are qualified totake the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, and, with sufficient workexperience, the Professional Engineers (PE) exam. Graduates are also qualifiedto apply to the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies(NICET) for certification procedures in various specialty areas, depending onacademic major and employment area.Admission RequirementsAdmission to all School of Engineering Technology programs requires at leastone year of high school algebra and one year of high school geometry withgrades of "C" or better. Transfer students must be in good standing at theirprevious institution. All freshmen must take the Mathematics Placement Testprior to admission into the School of Engineering Technology.Students not meeting the admission requirements are enrolled as pre-majors in the College of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.While advising is provided by professional advisors within the college, thesestudents are also encouraged to see the coordinator of the program in whichthey are interested for further orientation.Qualified engineering technology students must enroll in the "

These may include, but are not limited to,•lack of a criminal record,•satisfactory background checks,•physical standards and conditions, and•emotional stability.Regular AdmissionTo obtain regular admission, students must have a cumulative gradepoint average in undergraduate work of 3.0 or higher (on a 4.0 scale) or asatisfactory standardized test score (30th percentile or higher on the GREoverall, or MAT group overall score) and undergraduate GPA of 2.7 or higher. Ifstudents meet these criteria but have undergraduate coursework deficiencies,they may be granted provisional admission.Provisional AdmissionA student with a cumulative GPA in undergraduate work below a 3.0 must haveeither of the following two criteria in order to obtain provisional admission:1.a satisfactory standardized test score (30th percentile or higher on theMAT, GRE, or GMAT)2.an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher (on a 4.0 scale) in the last 30-40hours of coursework.Upon admission to the criminal justice graduate program and selectionof emphasis area, each student is guided by a committee of three facultymembers. The student selects a graduate advisor in the area of concentrationfrom the faculty of the Department of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences.This advisor serves as the chair of the student’s graduate committee. Thestudent and advisor select the other two members of the committee, both ofwhom must be members of the graduate faculty and one of whom may comefrom a department other than Criminal Justice. This committee will assist thestudent as appropriate with the planning of the program, preparation and oraldefense of the thesis, or the graduate paper and its defense in the case of thenonthesis option.Academy Training and Life ExperienceOpportunities are available through the Department of Criminal Justice andForensic Sciences for students who do not have life experience or policeacademy training.Admission RequirementsWhile an undergraduate degree in this discipline is not required for admission,a substantial background in the social sciences is preferred. Students lackingsuch preparation will, at the discretion of the department, be required to makeup deficiencies. Each student must have completed:•the equivalent of "

This consists of:•6-9 semester hours of core courses,•9-12 semester hours of business courses,•12-18 semester hours of technical courses, and•a 3-semester-hour graduate project.A graduate student enrolled in a graduate project course will be requiredto defend the results of his or her project by giving a presentation to theengineering faculty and students.Civil and Environmental Engineering RequirementsAt the time of initial enrollment, the student will select a program plan (thesis,non-thesis, or management) and technical concentration area (structural/geotechnical or environmental/water resources ). The requirements for eachprogram plan are listed in the general description of the Master of Science inEngineering program. Lists of required courses and possible electives for eachplan may be obtained from the graduate program coordinator.In cooperation with an assigned faculty advisor, each student will establish aset of academic goals and desired outcomes, and a coursework plan to meetthose objectives. Upon completion of the graduate program, all students willcomplete either a written or an oral assessment of the effectiveness of theprogram in meeting their established goals and outcomes.Thesis students, who have registered for all required thesis hours and havecompleted all course requirements but have not finished the thesis, arerequired to maintain current student status if they expect to utilize anyUniversity service (e.g., parking, computers, library, advisors’ assistance, thesisdefense, etc.). This can normally be accomplished by registering for at leastone hour of thesis credit.Non-thesis students must complete a graduate project under the guidanceof a faculty member. Students with management option should consult thegraduate program coordinator to develop their coursework plan.Learning Outcomes: Civil andEnvironmental Engineering•an ability to formulate and solve advanced civil engineering problems; ;•an ability to apply knowledge in a specialized area of civil andenvironmental engineering;•an abillity to design and conduct research projects;•an understanding of business fundamentals, including project planningand management, asset management, leadership, and entrepreneurship;•an understanding of the role of engineers in society."

Once certified, graduates must applyfor a Certificate of Authority to practice as an Advanced Practice Nurse in theState of Ohio or in the state in which they intend to practice.Family Nurse PractitionerThe areas of coursework in the M.S.N. program include core courses (16semester hours), and one of the following options:•Family Nurse Practitioner option (37 semester hours)The breakdown of these course requirements is as follows:COURSETITLES.H.dult-Gero Acute Care 3 Practicum5Total Semester Hours29WorkshopsStudents who wish to take a workshop for graduate credit but who havenot completed the regular College of Graduate Studies admission processwill be permitted to register in the College of Graduate Studies as non-degree students. Graduate workshops are graded on an S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory) basis.Certain Youngstown State University workshop courses, upon approval of thegraduate advisor, may later be applied to degree work if regular admission tothe College of Graduate Studies is obtained and if those courses are part of thedegree program. Workshop courses are those specifically designated as suchin this catalog or by the Graduate Council.Transfer CreditsTransfer hours from an accredited institution will be considered foracceptance at the time of application/acceptance to the College of GraduateStudies. After admission to a program of study, a student who wishes toattend another university to complete coursework toward a YSU graduatedegree must complete the Request for Transient Status form available onthe College of Graduate Studies website in order to transfer credits to aYSU degree. Every transfer course must either replace a required course ofthe program or, if not a direct replacement, integrate satisfactorily into thestudent’s program. While transfer of a course might generate excess hours,such hours may not count toward degree requirements unless they replace acomplete course in the program.An accredited institution is one that is approved or accredited by theappropriate regional accrediting agency (e.g., North Central Association ofColleges and Schools) for graduate-level work.Credits for courses in which grades of S or CR were received will not betransferred. The number of transfer credits to be accepted in each case willbe determined by the graduate dean upon evaluation and recommendation bythe department of the student’s major. It is the responsibility of the student toinitiate a request for the approval of transfer credits. Transfer hours are not in-cluded in the calculation of the student’s cumulative grade point average.In general, workshop format courses are not acceptable for transfer.Professional development workshops are not acceptable. However, if theworkshop fulfills the following requirements, credit may be considered fortransfer to Youngstown State University:•The workshop must be taught as part of a master’s degree curriculum ofthe university at which the course was taken.•The workshop should consist of a minimum of 12.5 contact hours persemester hour.•The workshop must include exposure to the disciplinary research literatureappropriate to the course.•The workshop must include the opportunity for outside work, such as termor research papers or other major assignments appropriate to a graduatecourse.•Credits for courses in which grades of S or CR were received will not betransferred.Graduate Certificate and Degree ProgramsThe following guidelines indicate the maximum credit hours of graduatework completed at other accredited institutions that may be applied toward agraduate certificate or degree at YSU, provided the student earned a grade of Aor B in such courses:•Up to 3 semester hours (4 quarter hours) for programs requiring 12-15semester hours•Up to 6 semester hours (8 quarter hours) for programs requiring 16-29semester hours•Up to 9 semester hours (12 quarter hours) for programs requiring 30-44semester hours•Up to 12 semester hours (16 quarter hours) for programs requiring 45-59semester hours•Up to 15 semester hours (20 quarter hours) for programs requiring 60-89semester hours•Up to 18 semester hours (24 quarter hours) for programs requiring 90 ormore semester hoursMilitary CreditGraduate courses, approved by the American Council of Education to beequivalent to a graduate level course, will be considered by the graduateprogram to determine if transfer credit will be granted.MBA Credit from Chinese University ofPetroleumThe MBA program may accept up to 14 hours of transfer credit from theChinese University of Petroleum.RegistrationAdvisementBefore initial registration, the student would be well advised to consult withthe faculty member in charge of the program to which the student has beenadmitted or with an assigned advisor for advice in developing a program ofstudy that leads to the desired degree. The ultimate responsibility for selectionof graduate courses, based upon the requirements of the student’s programas set forth in the Catalog, remains with the student. Continued consultationwith the advisor is encouraged. Because of the nature of certain programs, anadvisor may require consultation before each registration.Registration ProcedureAll Youngstown State University class registration takes place online throughthe MyYSU Portal (http://my.ysu.edu). Registration days and times aredetermined by a student’s classification and earned hours completed.Registration dates and appointment times for current students are determinedby the Office of the Registrar and available to view on the MyYSU Portal undere-Services for Students - Important Dates. All significant dates are also listedon the Registrar’s website and on the MyYSU Portal announcements for eachspecific semester. Registration requires that the student agrees to pay alltuition and fees associated with the registration. Failure to withdraw duringthe 100% refund period does not release the student from his or her financialobligation incurred by registration. Assistance with all registration relatedfunctions can be found at the Student One Stop located on the second floor ofMeshel Hall (Phone: (330) 941-6000, Email: onestop@ysu.edu).Change of RegistrationStudents may change their registration up to the last day to add a class. Alldates are available on the /MyYSU/ Portal.Withdrawal from a course must be accomplished through the onlineregistration system. Failure to attend class or notification to an instructor isinsufficient. A grade of F will be recorded unless a student officially withdraws.Complete Withdrawal of RegistrationThe student who wishes to withdraw from all classes in a particular semestermust also process this through the /MyYSU/portal (http://my.ysu.edu). If astudent withdraws from all classes during the first two weeks of the semester,Youngstown State University            765the academic record will contain the statement, “Student completely withdrewduring the first two weeks of the semester.”Cross-Registration of Courses AmongNortheast Ohio Public UniversitiesUnder specific circumstances, a graduate student may take one or moregraduate courses at Cleveland State University, Kent State University,The University of Akron, NEOMED, Ohio University, or Youngstown StateUniversity without registering as a transient student at the university deliveringinstruction. The course should contribute to the student’s program of studyand be unavailable when needed to complete the student’s program at thestudent’s home institution. The student must be in good standing (GPA > 3.0)and be within the time limits for completion of the program. The graduateprogram unit at the student’s home institution will establish a graduate specialtopics or independent study course identification capable of being tagged bythe home university with a title that will correspond to the course title at thehost university and with the initials of that university (i.e., CSU, KSU, or UA).Registration for such a course is controlled by the home department and willbe permitted only upon receipt of the Approval for Acceptance of Course Workat Northeast Ohio Public Universities form, which is available on the graduateschool’s website: www.ysu.edu/gradcollege (http://www.ysu.edu/gradschool).Any department that has no established special topics or independent studycourse may not participate in this cross-registration program.Time LimitMaster’s DegreeAll coursework, including transfer credits, offered in fulfillment of the minimumcredit-hour requirement for the degree, all comprehensive exams, and thesis(if required) must have been taken within the six-year period immediatelypreceding the date on which the last requirement is completed.Doctoral DegreeAll post-master’s coursework, including transfer credit, must be taken withinan 11-year period.Matriculation to Doctoral CandidacyDoctoral students shall be granted a six-year period to successfully completethe general examination and acquire candidacy status.Doctoral Candidacy to Final DissertationCopyDoctoral candidates will have five years from the acquisition of candidacystatus to file the final dissertation copy. Failure to meet this time frame willresult in cancellation of the candidacy. With the approval of the dissertationadvisor and the College Graduate Studies Committee, the student may takea supplemental general examination to reacquire candidacy. If the studentpasses the supplemental general examination, he or she is readmittedto candidacy and must complete the dissertation within two years. Thesupplemental general examination may be repeated once.In special cases, with appropriate justification by the student, the dean ofThe College of Graduate Studies may grant an extension of the courseworktime limit upon the written request of the chair or program director of thedepartment of the master’s or doctoral study.Courses approved upon entering a graduate program remain active for thelength of time the student remains current in their program.Other RegulationsGraduate CoursesGraduate credit may be earned in the following courses:•8000-level courses, which are for doctoral students only•6900- and 7000-level courses, which are open to graduate students (seeGraduate Courses for Undergraduates). At least one-half of the creditsapplied toward the master’s degree must be earned in courses in the 6900-and 7000-series.•Upper-division undergraduate swing courses (5800-level), in which thestudent may enroll for graduate credit onlyOnly certain upper-division undergraduate courses may be taken for graduatecredit. Those in this category are listed in the Courses section of this catalog.To earn graduate credit in an upper-division course, the student must beadmitted to the College of Graduate Studies before the course is taken.Graduate students in undergraduate courses that offer graduate credit will berequired to pursue the subject matter in greater depth than the undergraduatestudent.Graduate students may register for 4000-level or lower courses, but thesecourses do not apply toward the requirements of a graduate degree. Althoughthe grades received and semester hours for such courses appear on thestudent’s record, the hours and quality points are not included in the student’scumulative totals.SeminarA seminar generally consists of a group of advanced students studying asubject under a professor, each making some pertinent contribution and allexchanging results through informal lectures, reports, and discussions.Research Using Human or AnimalSubjectsResearch using human or animal subjects requires prior approval by theappropriate committee (YSU Human Subjects Research Committee or YSUInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee). Assistance with the process ofobtaining approval may be obtained from the Office of Grants and SponsoredPrograms.Thesis or DissertationCertain programs accept or require a thesis or dissertation as partialfulfillment of the requirements for the degree. Students are asked to initiatean online form as soon as thesis committee is identified. Students follow thestyle manual used by the field as determined by the department. The deadlinefor presenting one copy on regular paper and all signed signature pageson acid-free cotton bond paper and the Originality of Thesis/DissertationVerification form for approval to the Dean of College of Graduate Studies is:Fall and Spring semesters: Dissertations submitted by the Monday of the 14thweek of class. Theses submitted by the Monday of the 15th week of class.Summer semester: Dissertations submitted by the Monday of the 10th weekof the full term. Theses submitted by the Monday of the 11th week of the fullterm.Additional thesis and dissertation presentation information is available on theCollege of Graduate Studies website and individual departments. Researchusing human or animal subjects requires prior approval by the appropriatecommittee (YSU Human Subjects Research Committee or YSU InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee).The oral defense is a public presentation and must be advertised within thecollege.766         Other RegulationsSecond Master’s DegreeA student who has a master’s degree from YSU and desires a second master’sdegree must earn a minimum of 12 semester hours of credit in additionto the total that the student had when requirements for the first degreewere completed, and he or she must complete the requirements for anothergraduate program. Students with a master’s degree from another universitywill be limited to the maximum of transfer credit hours as determined by thetransfer credit policy.Interrupted EnrollmentStudents who interrupt their attendance for three or more semesters (onecalendar year) must apply for readmission as former students at least twoweeks before late and final registration. Graduate students who fail to takecourses or otherwise pursue their graduate education for one year will bereadmitted only under regulations at the time of reapplication and after reviewby the department for approval of the readmission.Full-Time StatusFull-time students carry nine or more semester hours for credit. Graduatestudents who complete less than nine hours per semester may lose eligibilityfor federal financial aid as a full-time student.Reduced Load for Employed StudentsThe College of Graduate Studies recommends that the employed student carryless than a full academic load as determined in consultation with his or heracademic advisor.Graduate Courses for UndergraduatesThe Application by Undergraduate to Enroll in a Graduate Course form isavailable in the College of Graduate Studies office.An undergraduate student who is enrolled as a senior at Youngstown StateUniversity or at another member institution of the Academic Alliance (currentlyincluding Lake Erie College, Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania, ThielCollege, Walsh University, and Westminster College) or another institutionof higher education with which YSU has a formal academic agreement atthe graduate level, and who has an grade-point average of at least 2.7 mayenroll in 5800-, 6900- and 7000- level graduate courses, provided the totalschedule for the semester (including undergraduate courses) does not exceed15 semester hours. Before registering for courses, the student must have theapproval of the Graduate Program Director in the program where the creditwill be applied, the course instructor, and the Dean of The College of GraduateStudies. The credit earned may be used for graduate credit at YSU only afterthe student is admitted to the College of Graduate Studies and the credit isaccepted by the department in which the student continues graduate work.(Such coursework intended for graduate credit cannot count toward fulfillmentof the requirements for a bachelor's degree at Youngstown State University.)The maximum amount of such credit that will be accepted at YoungstownState University is 9 semester hours.Students in accelerated programs will be accommodated to allow completionof degree requirements as specified in the program curriculum.Academic StandardsA cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) is requiredfor graduation. All graduate courses taken at YSU are included in the gradepoint average calculation (see Grading System for grades less than C). Goodacademic standing for graduate students is a cumulative grade point averageof at least 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) for all graduate credit courses taken at YSU.Satisfactory Academic ProgressSatisfactory academic progress at the graduate level is maintained bysatisfying the following criteria:•A degree-seeking graduate student must maintain a minimum grade pointaverage of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale). Any required course grade of D or F mustbe repeated and passed with a grade of C or better.•A degree-seeking graduate student must successfully meet therequirements, including the time requirement, of all comprehensiveexaminations of the degree program.•A degree-seeking graduate student must complete with a passing gradeany thesis requirements (or the equivalent) of the degree program.•A non-degree graduate student must maintain a minimum grade pointaverage of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale).For degree programs requiring up to 39 semester hours for completion, astudent may count no more than six semester hours of coursework with agrade of C toward the minimum graduation hour requirements. For students inprograms requiring 40 semester hours or more for completion, no more thannine semester hours of coursework with a grade of C may count toward theminimum graduation hour requirement.Academic SuspensionA graduate student who is not maintaining satisfactory academic progressas determined by the graduate academic program director or departmentchairperson and graduate dean may be excluded from registration anddropped from the program in which he or she is enrolled. Such actionconstitutes academic dismissal from the College of Graduate Studies.Academic suspension for a student with regular admission is automatic if:•The semester grade point average is below 3.0 after one semester studentregistered “not in good standing”;•The student fails to pass a comprehensive exam after three tries.A provisionally admitted graduate student must maintain a minimum gradepoint average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale). A provisional student whose GPA fallsbelow a 3.0 will immediately be dismissed.Any student in non-degree status whose cumulative grade point average dropsbelow the minimum (3.0) will be prohibited from enrolling in further graduatecoursework.Registration for any session or continuous registration during a full summercounts as one semester for these purposes.A graduate program may utilize additional academic standards to determinesatisfactory academic progress and/or standards for academic suspension;however, such standards must be distributed in writing to all graduatestudents in the program and must be filed and approved by the dean of TheCollege of Graduate Studies.Readmission Procedures•Under exceptional circumstances and with the approval of the Dean ofThe College of Graduate Studies, a program may readmit a suspendedstudent. In such cases, the normal six-year limitation on coursework shallbe applied.•Graduate students suspended for failing to maintain satisfactoryacademic progress may appeal their suspensions within one year inwriting to the Graduate Council. The decision of the Council is final.•After a period of one year, a graduate student who has been suspendedfor academic reasons may reapply to the College of Graduate Studies inorder to begin a new degree program or to pursue studies in non-degreestatus. A readmitted graduate student is not permitted to register for anycourses offered by the program from which he or she was academicallysuspended.Grading SystemThe following grading system is used in reporting a final evaluation of the workof graduate students in courses or thesis research: A, B, C, D, and F. The gradepoint equivalents are 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively. A graduate student may notelect to take a course under the credit/no credit option.Youngstown State University            767Grades of D and F carry no graduate credit but will be used to determine thestudent’s grade point average. Failure will normally be indicated by a D; agrade of F indicates that the student has not achieved even a minimum graspof the essentials of the course. A student has the privilege of repeating acourse once, but the repetition is treated merely as another course, along withthe first, in calculating the student’s grade point average. Any required coursegrade of D or F must be repeated and passed with a grade of C or betterUpon transfer to a new graduate program, a student with concurrence of theadvisor, program director and department chair, may petition to the dean ofGraduate Studies for the exclusion from the calculation of the student's gradepoint average previous courses that do not apply to the new degree program.The grades will be removed from the GPA calculation but will remain on thetranscript. In no case may courses be excluded from the calculation of thegrade point average once a graduate degree has been conferred.Graduate workshops are graded on an S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory) basis.An incomplete grade of I may be given to a student who has been doingsatisfactory work in a course but, for reasons beyond the control of thestudent and deemed justifiable by the instructor, had not completed allrequirements for a course when grades were submitted. A letter grade maynot be changed to an I (Incomplete) after the term has ended and grades havebeen recorded. A written explanation of the reason for the I must be forwardedby the instructor to the Office of Records for inclusion in the student’spermanent record, with copies to the student and department chairperson. Forfall term courses, the final date to complete an I will be:•March 1 of the following term;•for spring term courses, September 1;•for all summer term courses, October 1.With approval by the instructor and the dean of the college where the course istaught, the completion date may be extended. Courses not completed by theappropriate date will be converted to an F.A grade of W represents a withdrawal properly processed at any time fromthe end of the full-refund period through the last day to withdraw with a W(as published in the Academic Calendar for each semester). Withdrawalafter the designated date (or an improper withdrawal) is recorded as F.Withdrawal thereafter (or improperly done, at any time) is recorded as F.If the grade resulted from circumstances over which the student had nocontrol, the student may petition the dean of the College of Graduate Studiesfor a late withdrawal. Any grade of F assigned because of absence may bereviewed upon petition to the dean of The College of Graduate Studies. Wherewithdrawals change the student’s status from full-time to part-time, thestudent immediately forfeits any privileges contingent upon full-time status,and all interested parties will be notified by the appropriate university officials.In the case of thesis work, independent study, and other courses whereresearch or scholarship is still in progress at the time grades are to bereported, a PR may be reported in place of a conventional grade. The PR gradeis intended to indicate that it is the nature of the scholarship rather than thestudent’s ability to complete the work that is preventing the issuance of aconventional grade. A PR grade must be converted to a regular grade priorto graduation. However, a PR grade can remain on the student’s permanentrecord if the course is not needed. A PR grade in and of itself will not prevent astudent from graduating.AU signifies that the student was enrolled in the class as an auditor.Grade ChangesApplications for grade changes may be secured from the Office of Records,must be completed by the instructor, and must contain the signature of thedean of The College of Graduate Studies unless the change is from incomplete(I) or progress (PR). All grade changes must be submitted to the Office ofRecords by the dean or instructor; they will not be accepted from the student.In no case may a grade be changed for the purpose of changing the gradepoint average of the completed degree after a student has received a graduatedegree.Intrauniversity Transfer (Change of Curriculum)A student must request in writing a transfer from one graduate program toanother. A transfer is not complete until an advisor in the program to which thestudent is transferring has been appointed and has accepted the student as anadvisee, and when the change has been reported to and approved by the deanof The College of Graduate Studies. In such cases of transfer, courses taken inthe original curriculum that also apply toward the degree in the new curriculumwill be accepted. The student’s academic record and grade point average willreflect all graduate courses taken.Auditing CoursesA graduate student may register for and attend any course as an auditor. Anauditor is not held responsible for the regular classwork, class attendance, andpreparation of assignments and receives no credit for the course. The studentpays the regular tuition as well as any other applicable fees for the course(s)audited. Assistantships and scholarships do not cover audited courses. Auditcourses are carried in a student’s load only for fee purposes. A student whohas registered for a course for audit may not change that status to credit afterthe last day to add a class. An AU may be given only to a student who hasbegun a course as an auditor or who has changed status to that of auditor onor before the last day to add a class.Foreign Language ProficiencyExaminationsThe Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures administers proficiencyexaminations in the following languages:•French,•German,•Italian,•Latin,•Russian, and•Spanish.The graduate student should consult the major department to learn specificdegree requirements. A grade of pass or fail on the proficiency examinationwill be registered with the College of Graduate Studies.It is the responsibility of neither the University nor the Department of ForeignLanguages and Literatures to tutor students or to recommend tutors for theseexaminations.CommencementThe Graduation application must be completed by stated deadline of thesemester the student intends to graduate. Submission of the graduationapplication is the student’s responsibility. There are two graduationceremonies each year:•fall commencement at the end of the first semester in December and•spring commencement at the end of the second semester in May.Please refer to the “Special Purpose Fees and Service Charges” list as well asthe section titled “Other Fees” for information about the graduation fee. TheGraduation application can be accessed through My YSU.Posthumous DegreesA deceased student who was enrolled in an undergraduate, graduate ordoctoral degree program at the University at the time of his/her deathmay be recommended for a posthumous degree by a faculty member,department chairperson, or dean of the appropriate college or academic unit. A768         Student Fees and Chargesrecommendation must be in writing and proceed, respectively, for approval asfollows:•faculty member to chairperson,•chairperson to Dean,•Dean to Provost and•Vice President of Academic Affairs.The Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs will notify the Registrar ifthe recommendation is approved.In order for a posthumous degree to be awarded, a student must be in goodacademic standing and have substantially completed the applicable degreerequirements. Substantial completion means:•For undergraduate degrees and master degrees without a thesisrequirement, the student must be within one semester of completing allcoursework and degree requirements.•For doctoral programs and master degree programs with a thesisrequirement, the student must be within one semester of completingall coursework and degree requirements; and the student must havecompleted a full draft of his/her thesis to the satisfaction of his/her thesischairperson.If approved, the appropriate Dean will notify the immediate family of thestudent who may choose to have the diploma presented at commencement orin a private ceremony. If the diploma will be presented at commencement, itwill occur at the next feasible commencement.Diplomas for posthumous degrees will be identified as “AwardedPosthumously.”Catalog of EntryThe Undergraduate Catalog in effect when a student first enrolls at theuniversity or any one subsequent catalog will be the guide to graduationrequirements, provided the student is in continuous attendance and does notchange majors.When a student changes majors, the guide to graduation requirements willbe the catalog in effect at the time of change or any one subsequent catalog.Exceptions to this rule include the requirements for the minor and generaleducation requirements. Unless the minor is specified by the new major, astudent who has been in continuous enrollment and changes majors can fulfillthe requirements for a minor by using the criteria in effect in either the catalogof entry or the catalog in effect at the time of the change in major. See thesection on General Education Requirements for the relevant policy on generaleducation.Readmitted students will use the catalog in effect at their last readmissionor any one subsequent catalog as the guide to graduation requirements. Anyexceptions to requirements must be approved by the student's departmentchair and/or college dean. The University reserves the right to change courseofferings and academic requirements.Visiting Graduate StudentsA visiting graduate student is defined as one who is completing graduateacademic work at Youngstown State University for credit at another university.All visiting graduate students shall be required to be granted visiting studentstatus while engaged in academic work at YSU. Applications for visitingstudent status are available from the College of Graduate Studies. Visitingstudent status shall provide access to the following campus resources (feesmay be required):•a YSU identification card;•access to campus buildings and laboratories, including computer labs;•use of library facilities; and•campus parking.The Code of Student Rights,Responsibilities, and ConductYoungstown State University is “a student-centered institution committed tothe education, development, well-being, and success of students of all agesand from all walks in life.
