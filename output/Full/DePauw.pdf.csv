DePauw is a coeducational, residential liberal arts institution. The University offers a Bachelor of Arts degreewith majors in the arts, humanities, sciences and social sciences. In addition, there are three degree optionswithin the School of Music.The study of the liberal arts provides a foundation for a lifetime of learning, intellectual challenge andpersonal growth. At DePauw, it allows students to explore widely and come to appreciate how different waysof knowing may interact, yet it also encourages sustained and focused inquiry. Through the program ofgeneral education, students not only learn about, but also participate in, a variety of artistic, humanistic andscientific endeavors. Majors encourage students to understand what it means to master a subject or area ofknowledge.A DePauw education means more than gathering knowledge. It emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, interpretation, learning through experience and learning through reflection. Along with developingideas, it emphasizes expressing them articulately and distinctively in speaking and writing.The liberal arts curriculum is dynamic and incorporates emerging fields as well as interdisciplinaryapproaches to ideas, culture and human experience. A DePauw education asserts that developing a globalperspective and an appreciation and tolerance for a more diverse society are vital for living in an increasinglyinterdependent world.Since its founding by frontier Methodists, DePauw has sought to foster moral reflection and humane valuesamong its students. Its strong tradition of service to humanity – whether in the Greencastle community oraround the world – manifests its belief that moral engagement and civic responsibility should guide ouractions and commitments.DePauw is a place where world leaders discuss the issues of the day. Speakers on campus have includedformer Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev; retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General ColinL. Powell; former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; former First Lady Barbara Bush; former WestGerman Chancellor and Nobel Prize winner (the late) Willy Brandt; former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley; formerCanadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; civil rights leaders Jesse Jackson and Julian Bond; Nobel Prizewinners, including Holocaust writer Elie Weisel, physicist Leon Lederman and DePauw alumnus Dr. FeridMurad; journalists Bernard Shaw and George Will; novelists, including Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winner ToniMorrison, Roger Wilkins and alumna Barbara Kingsolver; retired Apollo 13 astronaut James A. Lovell Jr.;and important voices in the marketplace of ideas, such as former U.S. Secretary of Education and drug czarWilliam Bennett, magazine publisher and presidential candidate Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., educator and socialcritic Jonathan Kozol, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author James B. Stewart, an alumnus.It is a place for theater and debate, self-expression and self-understanding, art exhibits and musical recitals,student publications and media productions. As a residential college, DePauw fosters learning in how to buildand govern a community. Students occupy many positions of responsibility in living units and campusorganizations, and DePauw is deeply committed to realizing the ideals of civic responsibility in itself as acommunity. Among these ideals are the inclusion of diversity and respect for difference so that all can bemembers of the community without all being alike.DePauw is a place for activity. Its variety of intercollegiate and intramural sports and recreation programsinvites every student's participation and promotes an active, healthy life.Finally, DePauw is a place where the intellect is challenged by experience. Through internships, off-campusstudy and research projects, DePauw students enrich the classroom with practice and application.Much of DePauw's reputation for excellence can be attributed to the uncommon success of its alumni.DePauw graduates have distinguished themselves in the arts, business, education, government, journalism,law, medicine, music, science and many other fields.DePauw University, a residential liberal arts college, provides a diverse learning and living community whichis distinctive in its rigorous intellectual engagement and international and experiential learning opportunities.DePauw teaches its students values and habits of mind which serve them throughout their lives as each ofthem makes a positive difference as an active citizen of the world.(adopted by the Board of Trustees in January, 2006) (An institutional statement approved by the faculty.)DePauw University stands today as a prime example of the independent liberal arts college which has servedits state and nation in the best traditions of American educational institutions. It views the normal four-yearperiod of college as a foundation for a lifetime of continued learning and growth. Therefore, while it stressesparticular patterns of prevocational and pre-professional learning, it does so in the context of a commitmentto an examination of values, a pursuit of heightened aptitude in critical thinking and the establishment of asufficiently broad base of general learning to constitute a foundation for living with meaning as well asmaking a living.DePauw reaffirms its commitment to academic excellence, growth in personal and social awareness andpreparation for leadership.The general intellectual aims of the University are to seek truth and educate minds. To these ends themembers of the University strive:to foster the love of learning and the increase of knowledge and to recognize and support intellectualand creative excellence;to enlarge capacities for clear, thorough and independent thought;to understand and appreciate cultural and scientific achievements, past and present;to encourage serious reflection on the moral and ethical aspects of experience;to respect and sustain the freedom of inquiry and speech; andto demonstrate integrity and honesty, courage and compassion in academic work and in the activities ofthe University generally and in all such matters to be open to the views of others.These intentions shape the pattern of DePauw University's environment and direct its activities. Students anddeans, staff and alumni, faculty and president are all members of a community whose governance they share.Ours is a residential campus with provision for a variety of student lifestyles; and because of its residentialnature, students and faculty exchange ideas outside as well as within the classroom and seminar, and studentshave the benefit of experience in governing themselves and living with others.The DePauw curriculum is designed to introduce students to basic methods and areas of inquiry; to developtheir analytic abilities; to improve their skills in writing and speech; to broaden their perspectives onhumanity and culture; to give them an understanding of the contemporary world and the human prospect forthe next decades; to offer them intensive training and mastery of at least one subject area; to prepare them forfuture careers; and to afford them the foundation for more advanced and professional studies.DePauw provides individual guidance to meet the particular educational and emotional needs of students andto assist them in identifying personal career preferences and possibilities. It seeks to conserve and developphysical health and has a tradition of athletic competition for men and women in a variety of intercollegiateand intramural sports, with an emphasis on participation and preparation for lifelong recreational pursuits.DePauw is a place of theatre and debate, of art exhibits and recitals, of publications and many other activities.Its honorary societies recognize academic excellence, leadership and outstanding achievement in specialfields.DePauw seeks to encourage in its students the capacity to ask hard and basic questions about the world,themselves and their commitments; to elicit a serious interest and a delight in ideas and books and works ofart; to provide the intellectual setting for those who enter its community to become wise and humane persons;and to prepare them for a lifetime of service to the wider human community.DePauw University was founded in 1837. The original name, Indiana Asbury University, came from the firstAmerican bishop of the Methodist Episcopal church, Francis Asbury. At its conception, the school was to bean ecumenical institution of national stature. In fact, the college was "forever to be conducted on the mostliberal principles, accessible to all religious denominations and designed for the benefit of our citizens ingeneral."Greencastle was the chosen site because the community worked diligently to raise $25,000--a huge sum inthose days--to convince the Methodists to establish their college in the rough, frontier village. The GeneralAssembly of the State of Indiana granted a charter for the establishment of the University on January 10,1837, and the cornerstone of the first building was laid that year.Three years later the first president, Matthew Simpson, a friend and counselor of Abraham Lincoln, wasinaugurated, and the first college class graduated. Over several decades, the curriculum developed from atraditional classical one to a set of courses that included history, composition and the natural sciences.From its humble beginnings of one professor and five students, Asbury College grew quickly, although manymen left the University to fight for either the North or South during the Civil War. In 1867, with the strongsupport of the faculty and Board of Trustees, the college admitted a small group of women.In 1870 the construction of East College began. Although it took several years to build, East College was andstill is the centerpiece of the campus. During the economic hardships of the 1870s, businessman WashingtonC. DePauw and his family generously gave more than $600,000 to the University, and in appreciation thetrustees authorized the change in name to DePauw University.W. C. DePauw and his family took a special interest in the formation and progress of the School of Music,which was founded in 1884 and is one of the oldest in the country.Two other benefactors have helped shape the history of DePauw. In 1919 Edward Rector gave $2.5 millionfor the establishment of the Rector Scholarship Fund. DePauw alumni Ruth Clark and Philip Forbes Holtongave a total of $128 million, and in 1999 the Holton Memorial Fund was established in order to providescholarships to students of "high character and with academic and leadership potential." Both scholarshipfunds continue to make it possible for deserving students to pursue a DePauw education.Indiana's first Phi Beta Kappa chapter is located at DePauw. Admittance is limited to students with highacademic achievement. Strength in one field is not enough, as Phi Beta Kappa expects its members to showan interest and aptitude in a broad and well-rounded liberal arts education. Considerations of moral characterand contributions to the community enter in, but the dominant factors are academic.DePauw University boasts a number of other "firsts." It is home to the first sorority in the nation, KappaAlpha Theta, established in 1870. The Alpha chapter of Alpha Chi Omega sorority was founded at DePauw.DePauw students founded Sigma Delta Chi, a national journalistic honorary fraternity in 1909. It spread toother campuses and today is also known as The Society of Professional Journalists.Other DePauw firsts include the first 10-watt college FM radio station in the country, WGRE-FM, whichwent on the air in 1949. DePauw's student-managed newspaper, The DePauw, is the oldest college newspaperin Indiana.DePauw, under the leadership of its 19th president, has a distinguished faculty and an academically talentedstudent body.

Thecurricula are developed through departmental and interdisciplinary programs in the Asbury College ofLiberal Arts and in the School of Music.Normally, students are subject to the graduation requirements that are in effect when they first enroll atDePauw. If graduation requirements are subsequently changed, students have the option of graduating underthe new requirements. Students who require more than four and one-half courses to complete their degree andinterrupt their studies for more than a total of five years must meet the graduation requirements currently ineffect when they graduate. Coursework more than 10 years old will be reviewed by the appropriatedepartment to determine whether it is still applicable toward the degree or needs additional work to bring itup-to-date.Graduation RateDePauw graduates an average of 80 percent of first-time degree students in four years. An additional 3-4percent will graduate within 6 years of enrolling at DePauw.Academic ExpectationsDePauw has considerably different academic expectations than those of high school, and it is important thatstudents adjust to these new expectations early in their college careers.1. College is not the end of the educational process but a foundation for a lifetime of continued learning andgrowth. Therefore, two of the central goals of college are to help students develop a sense of responsibilityfor their own learning and the ability to learn on their own.2. Accordingly, college students spend much less time in class than they did in high school; but arecorrespondingly expected to do much more work outside of class than they did in high school.3. Full-time students should plan to spend between 40 and 50 hours a week (or more) on their academicwork, the equivalent of a full-time job.4. Students are responsible for learning a great deal of the material on their own outside of the classroom.5. Students should expect that course material will be covered at a much more rapid pace than they haveexperienced before. This expectation is partially based on the assumption that students are preparing carefullyfor class so that more material can be covered in class.6. Students are expected to come to class prepared and ready to participate actively in the class session. Theyare expected to have read the texts and used other required materials carefully and comprehensively beforethe class session.The policies and requirements below apply to all students earning a bachelor's degree at DePauw.

Subsequent off-campus experiences (WinterTerm, off-campus study, internships) help students develop intellectual and personal maturity, as well as a spirit ofindependent inquiry. The increasingly complex courses within the major field of study during their first three years providestudents with a deep knowledge of a particular area and an understanding of its fundamental questions and methodologies. The senior year at DePauw University represents the culmination of students’ curricular experience. Seniors use this time todraw together and synthesize these various threads of study and experience through a variety of intellectual activities: seniorseminars, comprehensive exams, theses, projects, performances and/or exhibitions.  Satisfactory completion of a seniorcapstone is required to complete a major at DePauw. Departments, schools, and programs are responsible for determiningthat each student in the major is sufficiently prepared in the field as a whole, and for certifying that the student has satisfiedthe senior capstone requirement.  Departments, schools, and programs must notify students of their senior capstonerequirements by the seventh week of the first semester each year. In the senior capstone experience, students intentionally integrate, interpret, and create knowledge in their chosen fieldsthrough scholarly or artistic exploration and expression.  This is both the challenge and the reward of their four years spentin the intellectual life of the University. Capstone experiences also prepare students for the intellectual, ethical,interpersonal, and professional challenges that lie ahead after graduation, whether or not they go on to formal graduatestudy. Academic disciplines vary, so each department, school, and program has designed its own senior capstonerequirements.  These are described in detail in this catalog under the requirements for each department, school, or program,and on the department, school, or program website.  A number of departments, schools, and programs offer students a senior seminar that provides a summative experience ofthe discipline. Some senior seminars focus on particular topics or themes. Senior seminars often require completion of asubstantive piece of original work.A department, school, or program may require students to complete a senior thesis or project over the course of one or bothsemesters of their senior year. Some departments, schools, and programs provide an option for students who havecompleted the core senior requirement to pursue additional independent work. All seniors with appropriate academiccredentials, as determined by each department, school, or program, may apply for the opportunity to conduct a departmentalor interdisciplinary capstone project or thesis by contacting a faculty member of their choice.Departments, schools, or programs may require examinations that serve as a comprehensive review and synthesis of crucialmaterial in the discipline as a component of the senior capstone.  Satisfactory performance on these exams is required toearn a major. Students who do not perform satisfactorily on a comprehensive examination the first time have the right to bereexamined once. Students must pass the comprehensive examination within one academic year after the firstcommencement date following the initial examination. At the discretion of the department, school, or program, a studentmay take a maximum of two re-examinations.Senior Capstone CelebrationDePauw University is proud of the work done by our senior students.  To express this pride, and to recognize student work,the university sets aside time in the Spring semester for campus-wide celebration of senior accomplishments.  Theuniversity encourages departments, schools, and programs to highlight or display the work of all successful senior capstonestudents in ways that are most appropriate for the discipline (e.g., public poster presentations, performances, exhibitions,readings, etc.).  In addition, the university publicly honors the best senior work in various ways such as a special awardsceremony, a senior honors booklet, and/or on the university website.Competence RequirementsCompetence requirements represent a University-wide commitment to the basic areas essential to a liberal arts education:expository writingquantitative reasoningoral communicationStudents pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree must earn certification in all three competencies. Students pursing the Bachelorof Music, Bachelor of Music Arts, or Bachelor of Music Education must earn certification in the Writing and OralCommunication competencies. Students must demonstrate their competence in these areas by satisfactorily completingcourses that integrate these skills with academic subjects. Competence course offerings may not be taken Pass/Fail unlessthe student has previously established competency and has the permission of the instructor.WritingAll English composition courses begin with critical thinking. Their aim is to teach college level thinking through collegelevel writing. Courses are designed to position students for academic success.The writing program at DePauw has a range of levels to meet students' needs. Students are placed into the writing programbased on a variety of factors: standardized test scores (SATV and ACTE), Advanced Placement in Writing (AP) score,writing samples, portfolios of previous college-level writings, transfer credit and college professors' recommendations.They may be placed into College Writing I, College Writing II, Writing Seminar for Non-Native Speakers of English I or II,or a W course. W courses may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis, and certification of writing competence is separate fromthe grade earned in the course.Writing Seminar for Non-Native Speakers of English I and II (-289).Co-curricular participation: The equivalent of one-fourth course may be earned in any semester through non-creditparticipation in DePauw Theatre, forensic team, Eye on the World, Midwestern Review, Mirage, The Cauldron, TheDePauw, student TV or WGRE-FM faculty-directed activities. Editors of The DePauw earn the equivalent ofone-half activity credit per semester. No academic credit is awarded toward the 31 courses required for graduation.Varsity Athletic Participation: The equivalent of one-fourth course PE credit may be earned in any semester throughparticipation in a season of a varsity sport. No academic credit is awarded toward the 31 courses required forgraduation. (This policy was passed by a vote of the faculty on Feb. 4, 2008, and goes into effect in Fall 2008.)Additional Policies for Distribution Requirements (Fall 2005)No course may satisfy more than one distribution requirement, and no more than two courses from anydepartment may be used to fulfill the requirements of Groups 1 through 4.With the exception of physical education activity courses, courses used to fulfill distribution requirements maynot be taken on a Pass/Fail basis.Students may satisfy graduation requirements by satisfactory performance in proficiency examinations.Credit earned for AP courses generally does not fulfill distribution requirements, but there are someexceptions. Check the current AP credit policy at http://www.depauw.edu/admin/registrar/ap.asp.A student may receive up to two course credits toward the distribution requirements by participation in aDePauw-approved Off-Campus Program. No more than one course may be counted in any group. Approval ofthese courses is granted by the Registrar.A minimum of 31 coursesOne major subject that includes satisfactory completion of a seminar, project, thesis or departmental comprehensiveexaminationAt least a 2.0 GPA in the major subjectFirst-Year Seminar for beginning studentsNineteen courses outside the major subject (16 courses outside the subjects in interdisciplinary majors)At least a 2.0 cumulative GPAWriting competenceQuantitative reasoning competenceOral communication competenceSatisfactory completion of distribution requirementsThree Winter Term projectsNot more than three Pass/Fail registrations (excluding physical education activities courses and "

In addition, the university publiclyhonors the best senior work in various ways such as a special awards ceremony, a senior honors booklet,and/or on the university website. Competence RequirementsCompetence requirements represent a University-wide commitment to the basic areas essential to a liberalarts education:expository writingquantitative reasoningoral communicationStudents pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree must earn certification in all three competencies. Studentspursing the Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Music Arts, or Bachelor of Music Education must earncertification in the Writing and Oral Communication competencies. Students must demonstrate theircompetence in these areas by satisfactorily completing courses that integrate these skills with academicsubjects. Competence course offerings may not be taken Pass/Fail unless the student has previouslyestablished competency and has the permission of the instructor. WritingOverview of the Writing CurriculumWriting at DePauw is taught across the curriculum on the assumption that skill in written communication isintimately connected with clear thinking in all subjects. We believe that writing is an essential means forthinking and learning across the University. Writing requirements are also premised on the idea that studentsdo not learn to write in any one particular course, that is, no single course completes one’s growth anddevelopment as a writer and thinker. Rather, writing is a skill that must be nurtured and developed throughoutone’s intellectual journey.DePauw’s writing program begins with a writing intensive First-Year Seminar, builds with a required writing-competency or ‘W’ course during the sophomore year, and culminates with demonstrated writingcompetency within the major. This last feature in particular marks DePauw’s embrace of the idea that thenature and role of writing varies across disciplines. Writing for different purposes and audiences must betailored to demands inherent in the disciplines themselves. Regardless of one’s chosen major, a DePauweducation emphasizes the importance of writing to thinking and learning.Core Components of the Writing CurriculumAs part of the writing program, each student takes a writing intensive First-Year Seminar (described in detailabove). First-Year Seminars introduce students to skills essential for success at DePauw generally, but focuson writing and oral communication specifically given their centrality to everything we do. The course beginsnurturing essential skills in writing, thinking and speaking with the expectation that these skills will bereinforced and further developed throughout students’ time at DePauw both in courses specific to the writingcurriculum and in broader general education and departmental/program curricula.As part of the developmental approach DePauw embraces, students must complete a course with a Wdesignation during their sophomore year. Sophomore W courses are offered across the curriculum eachsemester; enrollment is limited to approximately 18, with sophomores receiving first priority duringregistration. The sophomore W combines an emphasis on academic content with practice in writing. Suchcourses encourage:the logical development of argument, clear and precise diction and a coherent prose style;the development of general skills of expository writing as they apply in the academic disciplines; andthe responsible, appropriate and effective use of sources and special or technical language.Students must achieve W certification during their sophomore year. (Music degree students have until thesecond semester of their junior year to complete the W requirement.) If certification is not attained before thesecond semester of the sophomore year, students must complete a W course each succeeding semester untilthey achieve certification.In a few exceptional cases, students may fulfill the W requirement through a portfolio of college-levelwritings. Students seeking such exemptions should speak to the director of writing placement.DePauw’s writing curriculum also includes requirements–developed by each department or program–thatfocus on the skills, methodologies, and types of writing specific to one’s chosen major. The writingcurriculum thus sharpens skills throughout the college career, culminating in explicit focus on the role ofwriting within specific academic fields.Other Writing-Specific CoursesWriting and the teaching of writing are emphasized in many courses at DePauw, far more than will be listedspecifically here. Still, certain courses deserve special attention.Writing Seminar for Non-Native Speakers of English I and II (, ,  (First-Year Seminar: Understanding Music), "
ENG 110," and  or 115 in the semester assigned. Students placedin  in the Fall Semester will be expected to take  and , 115, 120 or 130 in the semester assigned. They may withdraw from thesecourses only under exceptional circumstances, such as extended illness, with the permission of the Petitions Committee.In addition to the writing courses, students must fulfill the University's expository requirement in W courses taught byfaculty members representing most departments throughout the University.A student is eligible to elect a W course either through placement or after earning the grade of C- or better in CollegeWriting II (. This course focusesmore on academic writing proficiency and critical thinking in preparation for the advanced level of challengeoffered by "
ENG 115,") are offered forstudents whose first language is not English. English courses for non-native speakers of English are aimed atstrengthening existing language skills and developing new skills necessary for academic success. Placementin the appropriate English courses is made based on three criteria: 1) English language assessmentsadministered on campus during orientation, 2) recommendation from the English language coordinator, and3) confirmation by appointed faculty representing the English department (department chair, W Centerdirector, etc.). Students are expected to complete  in the Spring. They may withdraw fromthese courses only under exceptional circumstances, such as extended illness, with the permission of thePetitions Committee.College Writing I () are offered as prerequisites toCollege Writing II ("

By means of short essay assignments, some of which may be reflections on theirown experience, students will build fluency in written expression, clarity of style and proficiency in the useof language.  is offered to first-year students in the fall semester as an elective on a Pass/Fail basis.College Writing II () stresses the development of writing skills fundamental for expressing ideas, imagination andopinion. By means of short essay assignments, some of which may be reflections on their own experience, students willbuild fluency in written expression, clarity of style and proficiency in the use of language.  is offered on aPass/Fail basis.College Writing II ()A maximum of three internship course credits and five internship experiences (including Winter Terms)Fifteen courses, including six of the last eight courses leading to a bachelor's degree, must be completed in residenceat DePauw or in a DePauw University-approved program.See School of Music, for minimum degree requirements for the Bachelor of Music Degree, the Bachelor of Musical ArtsDegree and the Bachelor of Music Education Degree. Each student completes at least one major as a part of the degree program. Although not required, manystudents also elect to complete a minor area of study.Each candidate for the bachelor's degree must complete one major with at least a 2.0 (C) grade point average.Department, school or program requirements for the major are those in effect at the time the student declaresthe major. Changes in departmental requirements after a major is declared may apply provided they do notrequire a student to enroll in more than a normal course load in any semester or do not prolong the timeneeded to meet degree requirements. Departments, schools and programs are responsible for determining andcertifying that each student in the major is sufficiently prepared in the field as a whole.The Senior Capstone experience may consist of one or more of the following options, as determined bydepartments, schools or programs: senior seminar, comprehensive examination, theses, projects,performances and/or exhibitions.  Descriptions of the senior capstone experience requirement(s) for eachdepartment, school, or program are in Section III. The Major under each department, school, or programsection.Satisfactory completion of a senior capstone is required to complete a major at DePauw. For departments,schools, or programs that require an examination as a component of the senior capstone experience,satisfactory performance on this exam is required to earn a major. Students who do not perform satisfactorilyon the comprehensive examination the first time have the right to be reexamined once. Students must pass thecomprehensive examination within one academic year after the first commencement date following the initialexamination. At the discretion of the department, school, or program, a student may take a maximum of twore-examinations.Each student completes at least one major as a part of the degree program. Although not required, a studentmay also elect to complete a minor area of study.Declaring a Major Each student is required to select a major and a faculty advisor in that major departmentor interdisciplinary program by the sixth week in the second semester of the sophomore year. Facultyadvisors, staff members in the offices of academic affairs, the registrar, and career services may assiststudents in making appropriate choices. Students planning for a study abroad program must declare a majorprior to applying for off-campus study.The Academic Standing Committee will take appropriate warning actions in the case of students who havefailed to declare their major by the end of the sophomore year. The committee may also require students whofail to demonstrate satisfactory progress toward the major to drop that major and select a new major beforecontinuing at DePauw.Departmental Major The departmental major consists of eight to 10 courses in a single academic department,including at least three courses at the 300-400 level. A department may designate as many as two coursesfrom other departments as requirements of its majors. A department may also require as many as six coursesfrom related departments. The total number of courses required for a major may not exceed 14 courses. Indepartments designated as single-subject departments, i.e., history or political science, at least 19 of the 31courses required for graduation must be outside the major subject.In departments designated as dual-subject departments, i.e., sociology and anthropology or modernlanguages, a minimum of 19 courses must be outside the student's major subject, and 16 of 31 courses mustbe outside the major department.Two Majors Students may complete a maximum of two majors. A student with two majors must meet allrequirements for each major. Students who have double majors must have at least six courses that do notoverlap between the two majors.(see the School of Music in this section for description of the majors available within the three music degreeoptions.)AnthropologyEarth SciencesGreekPolitical ScienceArt (History)East Asian StudiesHistoryPre-engineeringArt (Studio)EconomicsIndependent InterdisciplinaryPsychologyBiochemistryEducation StudiesKinesiology (Sports Medicine)Religious StudiesBiologyEnglish (Writing)Kinesiology (Sports & ExerciseScience)Romance LanguagesBlack StudiesEnglish (Literature)LatinSociologyChemistryEnvironmentalGeoscienceMathematicsSociology andAnthropologyClassicalCivilizationFilm StudiesMusic (College of Liberal Arts)SpanishCommunicationFrenchPhilosophyTheatreComputer ScienceGeologyPhysicsWomen's StudiesConflict StudiesGerman   An independent interdisciplinary major consists of an integrated series of courses selected from at least twoof the conventional academic disciplines. Students may devise, in consultation with faculty advisors, anacademic program suited to an area of special interest. Although any general problem of a genuine academic,scientific or intellectual nature may constitute the subject of an independent interdisciplinary major, such amajor is ordinarily defined in one of three ways:an area of the world, geographically, politically or culturally prescribed, such as the United States,Latin America, Asia, East Europe or the Middle East;a period of time in the history of some part of the world, such as the Victorian Age, the Enlightenment,the Renaissance or the Middle Ages; ora specific problem that is treated by several disciplines, such as the concept of social justice, the artistin the modern world, the rhetoric of revolutionary movements or political modernization.The independent interdisciplinary major includes a total of 10 to 12 courses in at least two disciplines and atleast four courses from each of the two disciplines. At least four courses in the total must be at the 300-400level. Each individualized major is supervised by a committee of three faculty members.An independent interdisciplinary major must include at least 16 courses outside the subject matter of the areamajor involved and may have no more than eight courses in any one discipline (subject) comprising themajor. However, up to 10 courses may be taken in a language as part of the independent interdisciplinarymajor.In selecting a subject for an independently designed interdisciplinary major, students should be guided by twofurther considerations. First, a mere interest in certain academic disciplines, however closely related they mayappear, is not a significant justification for an interdisciplinary major. Students must have in mind a subjectthat can serve as a focal point for the courses chosen. Second, although the subject to be examined in themajor may coincide with the vocational interests of a student, it must at the same time be a legitimate objectof study in its own right.The student must earn a 2.0 GPA in all course credit applied to the major, and, as a part of the major, eachstudent during the senior year must satisfactorily complete one or more of the following: a seminar, thesis,appropriate project or departmental comprehensive examination. Each independent interdisciplinary majorcommittee shall designate ways in which students may fulfill this comprehensive requirement.Upon the recommendation of two faculty members from the discipline relevant to the major, students applyto the Office of Academic Affairs for admission early in the second semester of the sophomore year. Studentstaking an independent interdisciplinary major should have the major approved and filed with the Office of theRegistrar by the end of the sixth week of the second semester of the sophomore year.The latest thatapplications may be considered is the sixth week of the junior year.A student may elect a minor that consists of at least four courses in a single subject or centers on a specificinterdisciplinary topic. At least one course must be at the 300-400 level.A 2.0 grade point average must be achieved in the minor, and no courses in the minor subject may be takenon a Pass/Fail basis. Double minors must have at least four courses that do not overlap. At least three coursesin the minor must be outside the student's major area.Declaring a Minor: To complete a minor a student should declare it by the end of the junior year. Finalcertification must be filed in the Office of the Registrar by November 15 of the senior year.AnthropologyConflict StudiesJapaneseReligious StudiesArt (History)Earth SciencesJazz StudiesRhetoric and InterpersonalCommunicationArt (Studio)EconomicsJewish Studies(described below)RussianAsian StudiesEducation StudiesKinesiologyRussian StudiesBiochemistryEnvironmentalGeoscienceLatinSociologyBiologyEuropean Studies(described below)Latin American andCaribbean StudiesSpanishBlack StudiesFilm StudiesLiteratureTheatreBusiness Administration(described below)FrenchMass CommunicationWomen's StudiesChemistryGeographyMathematics ChineseGeologyMusic (Applied) Classical ArchaeologyGermanPhilosophy Classical CivilizationGreekPhysics CoachingHistoryPolitical Science Computer ScienceInternational Business(described below)Psychology  Asian StudiesDePauw University offers an interdisciplinary major and minor in the area of Asian Studies. For furtherinformation, see Asian Studies, in this section.Black StudiesDePauw University offers an interdisciplinary minor in the area of Black Studies. For further information, seeBlack Studies, in this section.Business AdministrationThis interdisciplinary minor is designed for students interested in obtaining exposure to the concepts ofbusiness administration from a liberal arts perspective. Six courses are needed to complete this minor.Requirements for the MinorRequired Core:  and the activity courses in physical education (PE)may be taken Pass/Fail, regardless of the student's classification.The credit received applies toward the degree for which the student is working as elective credit only, and,with the exception of PE activity courses, does not fulfill any specific graduation requirement. Grades for aPass/Fail enrollment are on a P-D-F scale, with P indicating performance at the C- level or above, D passingperformance below the C- level, and F failure.Students indicate the work to be done on a Pass/Fail basis at the time of registration. Courses may bedesignated as Pass/Fail or changed from Pass/Fail to a grade through the eighth week of classes.Pass/Fail courses may not be taken in a student's major or minor area, to satisfy distribution requirements orto earn competence certification; nor can students take courses over the required number of elective coursesin the major or minor area Pass/Fail. Pass/Fail courses are not counted in computing the student's scholasticaverage.A student has the right to request approval from the Petitions Committee for any of the following that is notin accord with regular practice:to deviate from the normal student course load;to carry a normal course load when registering late;to make an adjustment in registration after the adjustment deadline;to modify graduation requirements;to deviate from other academic regulations.Petition forms are available from the Office of the Registrar or on DePauw's Web site and should besubmitted to the registrar's office. The Student Handbook has additional information about petitions.Each semester the Office of the Registrar produces a Schedule of Classes on the web that lists registrationprocedures as well as the courses offered, class meeting times, room assignments, and instructors. The finalexam schedule is also available as a part of the Schedule of Classes. See my.depauw.edu/e/reg/soc-view.Students who do not complete registration by paying tuition and fees by the designated date may forfeit theirclass enrollment. Students must receive permission from the Petitions Committee to begin classes after thefirst week of class and may be limited in their course loads. No student may enroll after the second week ofclasses. The act of registration indicates that the student intends to comply with the University regulations.The University reserves the right to change a course and cancel any course for which enrollment is fewer thanfive students or for which satisfactory arrangements cannot be made. Most classes have enrollment limits tofacilitate learning.Adjustments in Registration. Students are responsible for the accuracy of their course registrations. Theymay check their class schedule at any time on Student e-Services. Students, in consultation with theiradvisors, make changes to their course schedule within the deadlines specified as follows:The add/drop period extends through the first six class days of the semester. During this period,students may add or drop courses.Adjustments involving withdrawal from a course after the add/drop period or changes in the grade orcredit status (grade to pass/fail, pass/fail to grade, credit to audit) may be made until the end of theeighth week of classes.The deadline for adjustments in seven-week courses is the end of the fourth week of classes. Adjustments after the above deadlines may be made only under extraordinary circumstances with permissionof the Petitions Committee and a late adjustment fee may be assessed.Prerequisites. Prerequisites follow course descriptions and are in italics. A prerequisite defines conditionsunder which a student may enroll in a course.Students may repeat one time a course in which the original grade is a D+ or lower provided:the advisor and department concerned approve the repeat;the repeated course is taken for a grade, if that is the way the original course was taken; andthe course is repeated at DePauw.In the case of repeated courses, only the second grade counts toward the cumulative GPA. The original gradeand credit remain on the students' academic record, however. If credit was already earned in the course, noadditional credit is given.With the permission of the Petitions Committee, students may also repeat a grade of C- if it is needed to raisethe major GPA to a 2.0. The above policies apply.Transfer students who are required, on the basis of placement tests or official recommendation, to repeatcourses for which they have credit elsewhere receive the credit and grade earned at DePauw. The originalcredit is rescinded. Courses voluntarily repeated carry the original credit and grade points.The number of courses carried each semester constitutes the student's course load, even if courses do notapply toward a degree or are Pass/Fail. The normal course load is four courses. The course load may varyfrom three to four and one-half courses.Normally, first-year students should limit their registration to courses numbered 100-199 unless they haveprerequisite preparation for advanced courses. It is not recommended that students in the College of LiberalArts register for more than two fractional courses in any semester.Students with a cumulative or immediately preceding semester GPA of at least 3.0 may take up to four andthree-quarter courses, and those with a 3.25 GPA or better may take up to five course credits. Students will becharged additional tuition for all courses over the maximum four and one-half, including PE activity coursesand dance. An exception is made for music ensembles; a limited number of ensembles may be takentuition-free each semester.Degree students must receive permission of the Petitions Committee to take an overload or fewer than threecourses or to withdraw from a class that reduces the course load below three courses. Last semester seniorsdo not need to petition if they need fewer than three courses to graduate.Upon official request, the Office of the Registrar furnishes a transcript of credits that includes all theinformation on the student's record: credit, grades, degrees received and dates awarded. Transcripts alsoinclude any transferred credits accepted, but not grades.Normally, transcripts should be sent directly to potential employers and graduate schools upon request of thestudent. The cost of transcripts may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar.The University does not release transcripts or official statements of student records until all student accountsare paid.DePauw students who take part of their work at another institution with the intention of transferring the creditto DePauw should obtain advance approval from the advisor and the department chairs concerned. TheTransfer Credit Approval Form is available in the Registrar's Office. Final transfer credit evaluation will bemade only after DePauw has received an official transcript of the coursework directly from the issuingschool.DePauw generally accepts course credits earned at accredited institutions as elective credit if the grades are Cor above and the subject and level are appropriate for a DePauw liberal arts degree. However, the Universitydoes not accept credit awarded at another institution by national tests or departmental examinations. Othertransfer credit policies are:Courses are evaluated on the basis of equivalent course offerings at DePauw. Department chairsdetermine those courses that meet major requirements. In general, transfer credit or credit earnedthrough off-campus study may not be used to satisfy other graduation requirements.DePauw records, without credit, physical education activity courses taken if an institution does not givecredit for those courses.The University may accept courses taken Pass/Fail, if the grade P indicates that the student has done Cwork or better in accordance with the grade standards of the institution or if the student can provethrough the institutional authorities that the course performance was a C grade or above. A grade of Pin PE activity courses is accepted up to the equivalent of one course credit.Students transferring to DePauw from another school at which January or interim session courses are apart of the regular curriculum that is offered during the academic year may receive credit for thecourses. DePauw students wishing to attend another school that gives credit for a January interimsession normally receive Winter Term credit only. Exceptions allowing for credit transfer may bearranged through the Office of the Registrar.DePauw accepts course credits from junior or community colleges when the quality and extent of thework prove to be the equivalent of DePauw work.When credit allowed for work taken at another institution is not justified by the quality of subsequentDePauw work, the credit may be rescinded.Students may not earn transfer credit from courses offered concurrently with their DePauw enrollmentsexcept by permission of the Petitions Committee.Online courses with a fixed beginning and end date which allow regular interaction with the class membersare treated the same as other transferred classes. For correspondence or open ended online courses, amaximum of one course credit may be earned. All policies governing transfer credit apply to courses takenonline or by correspondence: they must be sponsored by an accredited institution and be accepted for creditby that institution toward its own bachelors degree; they must be on a liberal arts topic; and they must bepre-approved by the chair of the department into which the course transfers, the student’s academic advisor,and the Registrar’s Office. Normally, the University does not award credit for modern language or laboratoryscience courses taken online. Students may not earn transfer credit from online or correspondence coursesoffered concurrently with their DePauw enrollments except by permission of the Petitions Committee.DePauw students should complete the transfer credit approval form, available in the Registrar’s Office, priorto enrolling in any course of study intended for transfer credit. This includes summer school courses, summerstudy abroad programs, and online courses. This form requires the signatures of the department chair orprogram director in the academic area in which the course will count, the student’s academic advisors, andthe registrar, who will approve the amount of credit to be awarded and the applicability of the course togeneral graduation requirements.If the student is attending classes on a college campus with students who have already matriculated at thatcollege and the course is taught by a regular college faculty member, DePauw will treat this as regular collegetransfer credit (see above).For courses taken in a high school dual enrollment or early college program, unassigned, elective credit maybe awarded. To receive credit the courses must be at a level equivalent to DePauw courses and the studentmust earn at least a B in the courses. Unassigned credit is listed as University Studies (UNIV) credit and isapplicable to the credit required for graduation but not to majors, minors, competence and distributionrequirements.

Because we value our students' rights to have a place to study, sleep, relax and socialize, we workto help students build strong residence communities. Building positive living and learning communitiesmeans that we hire and train excellent student leaders to assist students in our halls; maintain clean, safe andsecure physical environments; continue to make physical improvements to our residence facilities; providesocial activities and shared governance opportunities through the Organization of Resident Students (ORS);and provide quality services to our residents through direct contact with professional staff members.Our residential system at DePauw includes residence halls, Rector Village suites, duplexes, University-ownedapartments and houses and Greek houses. All first-year students live in the residence halls. Sophomores areeligible to live in the residence halls or Greek houses and juniors and seniors are eligible to live in all housingoptions. The residence halls are divided into the North Quad and the South Quad. The South Quad residencehalls include Bishop Roberts, College Street, Hogate, Humbert and Longden Halls. The North Quadresidence halls include Anderson Street, Bloomington Street, Lucy Rowland, Mason, and Senior Halls aswell as Rector Village. We are proud of all of our residential communities and believe that each offers anexcellent environment in which to live, learn and grow.In our communities, residents have the opportunity to become involved in a variety of activities, including theOrganization of Resident Students (ORS), intramural athletics and a variety of social and personaldevelopment programs that are planned by the Campus Living and Community Development staff and ORS.First-Year Resident Assistants and Community Resource Assistants are upper-class student leaders who livein the residence halls and University Owned Apartments and Houses (UOAH); these students are available toassist you and meet your needs. We encourage you to utilize their support and provide them with input onhow we can continue to improve our residential communities in order to better meet the needs of ourstudents.The residential communities at DePauw are intended to be far more than just places to eat and sleep.However, how much you gain from the opportunities available is largely up to you. Your relationships withyour community members and activities in the halls can provide you with some of the most significant partsof your collegiate experience.Fraternities and SororitiesIn addition to providing housing for many DePauw students, fraternities and sororities are based upon afoundation that encourages an atmosphere of learning, social responsibility and constructive development formembers.While fraternities and sororities are private, independent units, Greek Life Coordinators work with students inGreek organizations. Greek Life Coordinators have direct contact with each fraternity and sorority chapterthrough the undergraduate officers, advisers, house corporations and house directors who encourage highstandards of group living and supervise domestic affairs of the chapter houses.The rush/recruitment process occurs after Winter Term in late January, and rules governing such arepublished each year by the respective governing association--the women's Panhellenic Council and the men'sInterfraternity Council.Three historically African-American sororities and one historically African-American fraternity are currentlyrecognized by the University. They are active members of the Greek community and belong to the NationalPanhellenic Council. In addition, two historically Latina sororities are active on campus and are members ofthe Multicultural Greek Council. Recruitment is done on an individual chapter basis.DePauw's sororities include:Alpha Chi OmegaAlpha Kappa AlphaAlpha PhiDelta GammaDelta Sigma ThetaKappa Alpha ThetaKappa Kappa GammaOmega Phi BetaPi Beta PhiPsi Lambda XiSigma Lambda GammaZeta Phi BetaDePauw's fraternities include:Alpha Phi AlphaAlpha Tau OmegaBeta Theta PiDelta Tau DeltaDelta UpsilonPhi Delta ThetaPhi Gamma DeltaPhi Kappa PsiSigma Alpha EpsilonSigma ChiSigma Nu  The First-Year Experience (FYE) program at DePauw University aims to provide first-year students achallenging yet supportive experience that inspires self-discovery and an active engagement with the learningand growth opportunities available to them as they transition and integrate into the DePauw community.There are two main components of the First-Year Experience program, the First-Year Seminar and theMentor program.During their first semester at DePauw, students enroll in a seminar that counts as a full academic credit. Dueto the small class size (approximately 15 students), the faculty instructor has the ability to facilitate acomfortable and engaging learning environment that promotes participation from all students. The goal ofthis course is to encourage an effective transition from a traditional high-school classroom to the academcrigors of DePauw. The faculty member also serves as the first-year student's academic advisor until thestudent has decided on a major.The second component of the First-Year Experience program is the Mentor Program. Each first-year seminaris assigned an upper-class mentor who spends time with the students outside of the classroom. Mentors arecarefully selected and specially trained to help first-year students make a smooth transition into the DePauwcommunity. Mentors serve as excellent resources for first-year students as they begin navigating their waythrough the university. These student leaders engage their mentor groups in team building activities that allowfor the group to become close and serve as a source of support for one another. Mentors strive to promoteintellectual, social, and personal development of first-year students during their entire first year here atDePauw.Convocation ProgramsThe convocation series at DePauw brings to campus nationally and internationally recognized public figures,scholars, government leaders, authors, artists and scientists.

There are plenty of opportunities at DePauw to participate in community service, be involved inthe leadership of an organization or just be entertained.How can students get involved in these activities or organizations? One of the best ways is to attend theCampus Activities & Community Service Fair, which is usually held at the end of Orientation Week.Although it takes place during Orientation, the Fair is designed to let all DePauw students know about thedifferent clubs and organizations available and how students can get involved.In addition to theCampus Activities & Community Service Fair, another way for students to get informationis to ask. Talking to professors who seem to have interests similar to individual students, visiting the CampusActivities Office, going to the Office of Academic Affairs, Student Life Office or any other University office,talking to resident assistants, mentors or other students are all excellent ways to get information about what isgoing on at DePauw.Finally, students should read signs and ads posted on bulletin boards; in The DePauw student newspaper; inthe DePauw Weekly, an electronic newsletter; and check out information on DePauw's web site in theUniversity Calendar. These places contain a wealth of information on things to do at DePauw.Clubs, Organizations and HonorariesDePauw's recognized student organizations are listed at http://www.depauw.edu/studentlife/campus-activities-clubs/student-clubs-groups/.

DePauw's Winter Term, international study, fellowsand honors programs, internships and pre-professional preparation in the context of strong liberal artscurriculum lay the groundwork for initial opportunity and the development of fulfilling personal lives andcareers.All DePauw University students complete at least three Winter Term projects before graduation. WinterTerm, which takes place each January between fall and spring semesters, is a time of intellectual explorationand enrichment that reflects DePauw's serious commitment to non-traditional, experiential learning.Five main types of Winter Term projects are possible:on-campus coursesoff-campus study and service projects, led by faculty membersinternshipsindependent study projectsstudy at another school or organizationWinter Term provides the opportunity for a rich variety of experiences. Students may study or workintensively on a specific problem or topic of personal interest and educational merit; explore a new subject;work collaboratively on a project with faculty members or professionals with similar interests; study aproblem or topic from a cross-disciplinary perspective; experience a new culture; work and live with othersand provide a valuable community service; learn and practice a new skill; participate in a valuable groupexperience in a work, performance or educational setting; explore a potential career or a field unrelated tocareer; or learn about oneself in relation to potential academic majors.On-Campus CoursesThe on-campus Winter Term program offers DePauw students a chance to focus on a single topic of interestthat is well-suited for an intensive period of study. Typically, Winter Term courses are not part of the regularcurriculum and range in style and approach from the academic to the experiential, from the traditional to theinnovative. The academic component of the on-campus Winter Term strives to maintain high expectations forengagement, learning and accomplishment, while allowing for exploration of non-traditional areas of study.Short-Term Off-Campus Study and Service ProjectsWinter Term off-campus study and service projects, designed and led by members of the DePauw faculty,offer students the opportunity to expand their awareness of the global community in the context of anintegrated and carefully designed learning experience. Students explore and study new cultures, performvaluable community service and develop new skills.InternshipsInternships during Winter Term offer students the chance for an intense, concentrated exploration of personaland career goals in a professional setting. DePauw students develop projects in virtually every professionalfield, including: business, education, health sciences, law, research, communications, media and thenon-profit sector.Independent Study ProjectsStrongly motivated upper-class students are encouraged to set up independent study projects that focus indepth on an area of special interest. Projects range from the traditionally academic to the highly experientialand may be carried out on-campus or off-campus. Students develop their projects in conjunction with asupervising member of the faculty.Study at Another InstitutionMany other institutions and approved organizations also offer courses during the month of January.Upper-class students can therefore take advantage of an even greater number of course offerings by enrollingin a Winter Term program at another 4-1-4 college or participating in a group project sponsored by anotherorganization.One of the major goals of the University is to provide its students with an understanding and appreciation ofthe many different human cultures. With this in mind, DePauw offers off-campus study opportunitiesdesigned to broaden intellectual horizons and to enable the student to achieve a deeper sense of individualidentity and cultural awareness.By its very definition, a liberal arts education should be inseparable from direct contact with many people anddiverse cultures. Through participation in an international program or an off-campus program in the UnitedStates, the student is able to enhance and strengthen academic goals and personal objectives. Off-campusstudy stimulates the growth of new thinking. Leaving the shelter of familiar circumstances encourages greaterself-reliance and sophistication in thought and action. With an understanding of other cultures, one becomesdramatically aware of the need to search for solutions to the problems confronting humankind.Therefore, DePauw has endeavored to integrate off-campus experiences into the academic program studentspursue on campus by encouraging them to spend one or two semesters in approved international or statesideoff-campus study programs. Students may participate in these programs during the period extending from thesecond semester of their sophomore year through the first semester of their senior year.Three features distinguish DePauw's approach to international and off-campus education.A wide range of program options is available to students to meet their diverse academic and culturalinterests. Where feasible, Civic, Global & Professional Opportunities arranges for direct enrollment ofDePauw students in foreign universities and educational institutions. In other cases, special programsare designed to achieve cultural immersion or to meet specialized academic needs. Foreign languagestudy and immersion are available at all levels of language proficiency. Some off-campus programsinclude an internship component, which allows students to obtain practical experience in an area thatinterests them.1.There is continual supervision and assessment of program content and organization by the staff ofCivic, Global & Opportunities and the International Education & Off-Campus Study Committee.2.All students interested in off-campus study are personally advised by the staff of Civic, Global &Professional Opportunities and appropriate faculty members. This advising is designed to matchstudents' needs to program offerings on a case by-case basis.3. Application ProceduresSelecting and applying for off-campus study is rather like selecting a college in a process of matchingstudents' aptitude and interests with the academic strengths and cultural immersion aspects of a program.Students interested in studying off campus should start the process early and begin by exploring theOff-Campus Study website at http://www.depauw.edu/academics/centers/cgpopp/off-campus-study/semester/. Students receive assistance from the staff of Civic, Global & Professional Opportunities,returned off-campus study students and faculty members in their major and minor departments.The off-campus study application procedure has two steps. Students first apply for approval to study offcampus on a particular program by the off-campus study deadline, early in the spring semester. Applicationsare reviewed by the professional staff members of Civic, Global, & Professional Opportunities. Onceapproval is granted, students then apply to the off-campus study program itself by the program's deadline.Nearly all students who are approved are also approved by their chosen programs, provided they meet theprogram's deadlines and prerequisites.Requirements — A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 in the semester of application is required forparticipation in an off-campus program. Host programs set their own requirements, usually between 2.5 and3.0. In addition, the student's aptitude for adaptation to a different cultural experience is considered. Allstudents studying in a country where English is not the national language must take the national language or alocal one if it is offered by the program. If DePauw teaches the language, the students should take at least onesemester of the language immediately before going away. When this is not possible, those students' cases willbe dealt with on an individual basis.Participation in all off-campus programs depends on satisfactory completion of the prior semester's work andcompletion of DePauw's competence requirement within the mandated time frame. In addition, participantsmust be in good disciplinary standing. Other eligibility and prerequisite requirements may apply. Applicantsare advised to contact Civic, Global & Professional Opportunities or see the Web page for detailedinformation on program requirements and participation conditions.Off-Campus Study Fees — There is a uniform tuition charge, which is the same as on-campus tuition for allDePauw-approved off-campus study opportunities. Students receive financial aid towards meeting this tuitioncharge according to the normal rules for financial aid at DePauw. International degree-seeking students arenormally eligible for financial aid to support only one semester of off-campus study; international degree-seeking students may apply for a special exception to this policy by petition to the IEC. The off-campusprograms bill DePauw for tuition and academic fees. Students should continue to use the same method oftuition payment during off-campus study as for other semesters. The off-campus program bills the studentdirectly for all other expenses, which usually include room, board and, in some cases, field trips, books andtravel from the US to the program site.In addition to the uniform tuition charge, all students enrolling in off-campus study will be billed asupplemental off-campus study fee. The off-campus study fee is $2,500.00 for a semester and $3,000.00 foryear-long study at one program or for an approved pair of programs. The fee is packaged for need-basedfinancial aid loans, which are administered by the Financial Aid office. There are some additional fundsavailable for need-based awards to support the additional costs of off-campus study, including the off-campusstudy fee and travel costs associated with the program destination. Students approved for off-campus studywho are on need-based financial aid are eligible for these supplemental awards. The awards will beadministered by the Financial Aid office in consultation with the administrative staff of Civic, Global &Professional Opportunities.The student is responsible for any additional expenses not included in the host program bill. Studentsreceiving scholarships should inform themselves about program costs on the off-campus study web page andthen discuss their plans with the Financial Aid Office. Eligibility to receive federal and state grants and loansgenerally applies to off-campus study.Course Credit — All coursework taken off-campus for credit must have the final approval of the Office ofthe Registrar and, whenever possible, be assigned to a DePauw academic department. The amount of creditgranted in any one department normally does not exceed two courses per semester. The department shalldetermine those courses that meet the requirements for its major.Care should be taken to ensure that students have 19 courses outside their major subject; students indual-subject departments must have 19 courses outside the major subject and 16 courses outside thedepartment.A maximum of 10 courses may be earned in off-campus programs with no more than four and one-halfcourses taken in a semester. Summer school courses taken abroad, which are not part of the regular program,are not included in this limitation.Final credit evaluation for study off-campus is made by the Office of the Registrar after the student hasreturned to campus. The recording of credit is based on the official academic transcript available from theoff-campus program, the foreign school or the international study program. On all programs, grades arerecorded on the DePauw transcript but not calculated in the GPA.In those off-campus courses where grades are not available, the courses are recorded on a credit-only basis. Insuch cases, credit determination is made upon the recommendation of the appropriate academic departmentand the approval of the Office of the Registrar with no grades reported. Students receive grades of S(Satisfactory) or U (Unsatisfactory) for the internship component of off-campus programs.Off-Campus Study ProgramsDePauw offers a choice among a wide variety of strong academic programs on six continents. Programs areregularly reviewed, and some are added to the roster while others are dropped. Check the Website or contactCivic, Global & Professional Opportunities for a current and complete list of approved programs. A sample isgiven below of DePauw's consortial and exchange programs.GLCA-Recognized ProgramsPrograms recognized by the Great Lakes Colleges Association (GLCA) combine the excitement ofoff-campus study and the strengths of a liberal arts college. GLCA's member institutions have cooperated inthe area of off-campus study since 1962. GLCA-recognized programs get consultation and advice fromcommittees that include faculty and administrators from several member campuses. Programs are regularlyevaluated, earning the GLCA label by meeting high academic and administrative standards. Faculty membersfrom GLCA campuses generally serve as on-site academic directors for these programs, giving students dailyaccess to advice and support from a professor who knows the program and the local culture as well as U.S.higher education.A member institution of GLCA, or an affiliated organization with special strengths in the program area,administers each program. The primary affiliated organizations are the Associate College of the Midwest(ACM) and the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE).GLCA-recognized international programs include The Border Studies Program and the Japan Study Program,administered by Earlham College.GLCA-recognized domestic programs include the following internship and research programs: The NewYork Arts Program, administered by Ohio Wesleyan Univeristy; the Newberry Library Program, administeredby the ACM; the Oakridge Science Semester, administered by Denison University; and the PhiladelphiaCenter, administered by Hope College.DePauw University's Exchange ProgramsDePauw has direct exchange relationships with four universities in Japan: Waseda University in Tokyo (TheJapan Study Program), Nanzan University in Nagoya, Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka, and AoyamaGakuin University in Tokyo. DePauw also has exchange relationships with Tsinghua University in Beijing,China; Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea; and Koç University in Istanbul, Turkey.DePauw Affiliated ProgramsStudents may also choose to participate in a wide range of programs offered by affiliated organizations anduniversities. A partial list of these organizations includes: Australearn, Arcadia University, Brethren CollegesAbroad, College Year in Athens, CIEE, Denmark's International Study Program, EPA internship programs,IES, The School for Field Studies, The School for International Training, University College Cork (Ireland),The University of Queensland (Australia) and the University of Westminster (England).   Honor Scholar ProgramThe Honor Scholar Program is designed for students who thrive on discovering and exploring connectionsbetween different fields, are insatiably curious, and are eager to engage difficult and unfamiliar topics. Theprogram plays a pivotal role in DePauw's commitment to excellence in a liberal arts education. HonorScholars come from all majors and go into all fields. The Honor Scholar Program represents modern liberalarts education at its best. Our program provides an intellectual home for students who seek an especiallystimulating intellectual experience and want to share that experience with a close-knit community of studentsfrom all fields who share a passion for learning and exploration.The Honor Scholars Program explores the connections between areas of human knowledge, lets students acton their curiosity about a wide range of topics, and calls on their intellectual courage as we examine difficultand important issues. The program will challenge students, and will ask that they challenge themselves.Being an Honor Scholar is demanding, but ultimately very rewarding. Honor Scholars develop expertise intheir majors, minors, and concentrations, but are never satisfied with looking at the world through one kind ofintellectual lens. They excel at thinking critically and creatively about individual topics, and integrativelyacross topics.The Honor Scholar Program offers a series of small, intellectually challenging, discussion-based courses inwhich students actively engage with each other and with professors to investigate important topics in, andconnections between, the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. First-year students take twointerdisciplinary Honor Scholar First Year Seminars ("

In this course, students base their writing on both personalexperience and the critical reading and viewing of materials from a variety of disciplines.  is offeredto first-year students in the fall semester as an elective.Writing Intensive Topics (WIT) courses are offered for first-year students who enjoy writing andseminar-style discussion, and/or who seek to sharpen their skills in college writing. WIT courses are offeredin the spring semester as electives, with priority given to first-year students; other interested students mayenroll as space permits. Quantitative ReasoningCourses designated as fulfilling the quantitative reasoning (Q) competency requirement encourage:understanding quantitative concepts, representational formats and methodologies of a particulardiscipline;evaluating quantitative evidence and arguments;making decisions based upon quantitative information; andlearning through problem-solving, laboratory experiments and projects.Students must achieve Q certification by the end of their junior year. If students do not achieve certificationby the end of the first semester of the junior year, they must complete a Q course each succeeding semesteruntil certification is achieved. Q courses are offered in several academic subjects each semester, subject toapproval by the Q committee, and normally carry one course credit each. They emphasize both quantitativereasoning and mastery of course content.Based on standardized test scores and other evidence of preparation, incoming students may be invited totake Introduction to Quantitative Reasoning () for students whose first language is not English. English courses for non-native speakers ofEnglish are aimed at strengthening existing language skills and developing new skills necessary for academic success.Placement in the appropriate English courses is made based on three criteria: 1) English language assessments administeredon campus during orientation, 2) recommendation from the English language coordinator, and 3)confirmation by appointedfaculty representing the English department (department chair, W Center director, etc.). Successful completion in eachcourse is required to advance to a higher level course.College Writing I () refines and builds writing skills. It stresses the development of critical thinking skills, logicaldevelopment of ideas and a coherent and readable style. In the course, students base their writing on both personalexperience and the critical reading and viewing of materials from a variety of disciplines.Students are expected to complete ). Several W courses are offered each semester, have limited enrollments and carry one course crediteach.They combine an emphasis on academic content with practice in writing. Such courses encourage:the logical development of argument, clear and precise diction and a coherent prose style;the development of general skills of expository writing as they apply in the academic disciplines; andthe responsible, appropriate and effective use of sources and special or technical language.Students must achieve W certification by the end of their sophomore year. (Music degree students have until the secondsemester of their junior year.) If certification is not attained before the second semester of the sophomore year, studentsmust complete a W course each succeeding semester until they achieve certification.In a few exceptional cases, students may fulfill the W requirement through a portfolio of college-level writings. To requestthis exception, students must:be eligible to take a W course;submit an application (and learning contract, if certification is to be based on anticipated work) to the WritingPlacement Coordinator with a copy to the Office of Academic Affairs by the eighth week of the first semester of theirsophomore year, or, in the case of those who transfer after that, by the eighth week of their first semester at DePauw;andsubmit a portfolio of their own college-level writing, done either at DePauw or at another college or university, incourses that provide attention to the writing process similar to that found in W courses at DePauw.The portfolio must contain both out-of-class and in-class writing (essay examinations, for example). There must be aminimum total of 16 pages (at least 4,000 words) in the portfolio. The quality of the writing in the portfolio mustcorrespond to the quality of writing of those who have completed W courses at DePauw, according to the judgment of theWriting Placement Coordinator and at least one other W-certified instructor. The Writing Placement Coordinator will notifythe Office of the Registrar and the Office of Academic Affairs of the outcome and report this action to the Writing ProgramCoordinating Committee.Quantitative ReasoningCourses designated as fulfilling the quantitative reasoning (Q) competency requirement encourage:understanding quantitative concepts, representational formats and methodologies of a particular discipline;evaluating quantitative evidence and arguments;making decisions based upon quantitative information; andlearning through problem-solving, laboratory experiments and projects.Students must achieve Q certification by the end of their junior year. If students do not achieve certification by the end ofthe first semester of the junior year, they must complete a Q course each succeeding semester until certification is achieved.Q courses are offered in several academic subjects each semester, subject to approval by the Q committee, and normallycarry one course credit each. They emphasize both quantitative reasoning and mastery of course content.Based on standardized test scores and other evidence of preparation, incoming students may be invited to take Introductionto Quantitative Reasoning (.

Oral CommunicationEffective expression in speech as well as writing has been perennially at the core of liberal education. Thecompetent expression, exchange and examination of facts and ideas remain vital to the educational processitself. It is also essential for service and achievement in professional, civic and personal life.To satisfy the oral communication requirement, students must demonstrate such competence in an S course orin a designated alternative. S courses are offered in many departments at the 300-400 level.S courses help students develop:the presentation of logical arguments and refutation;the ability to distinguish and identify important substantive arguments;the ability to skillfully analyze, evaluate, and integrate of supporting material;the selection and implementation of effective presentation style(s);the ability to adapt the manner of delivery to specific audiences and situations;the demonstration of techniques for leading and participating in discussion(s);the demonstration of critical listening skills;the demonstration of effective and reflective listening; andthe knowledge of the ethical obligations of speakers, discussants, and listeners.Under unusual circumstances, students may receive S certification outside of an S course, while enrolled atDePauw, when the following criteria are met:the course meets the guidelines for an S course, or the activity is equivalent to college-level work withthe complexity of ideas worthy of at least a 300-level course;the instructor or supervisor of the activity is S-certified;the student's application and learning contract (available in the Office of Academic Affairs) areapproved by the faculty member and the Office of Academic Affairs prior to the beginning of thecourse or activity;the activity must be a sustained one, usually over a full semester or Winter Term;arrangements are made prior to the senior year;the activity is initiated by the first semester of the senior year; it may extend into the second semester,but may not be initiated then; andthe faculty member notifies the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Academic Affairs of theoutcome. Liberally educated students connect disciplines and approaches, integrate learning, consider the ethical valuesand problems inherent in the acquisition and interpretation of knowledge, and develop skills to communicateclearly the results of their investigations. With these purposes in mind, students explore different modes ofinquiry, content areas, and languages early in their college career, becoming aware of their intellectualopportunities and better informed to choose meaningful paths for their lives.To build a foundation for a liberal arts education at DePauw University, students complete two course creditsin each of three distinct areas of study and attain second-semester ability in a language other than English.Each of the six course credits used to complete the Arts and Humanities, Science and Mathematics, andSocial Science distribution requirements must be from different course listing areas to ensure that studentsexplore a broad spectrum of the liberal arts and are introduced to the ways these areas study and describe theworld.Arts and Humanities: Two course credits in the arts and humanities. These courses explore fundamentalquestions of experience, belief, and expression. Through critical observation, textual analysis, and creativeengagement, they consider the realms recalled or imagined in the arts, history, literature, philosophy, andreligion.Science and Mathematics: Two course credits in the behavioral, computational, mathematical, and naturalsciences. These courses explore the physical, mechanical, and quantitative working of numbers, matter, andlife. Through observation, experimentation, and scientific and mathematical reasoning, they seek tocomprehend the world and model its operations.Social Science: Two course credits in the social sciences. These courses explore cultural, economic, political,and social questions. Through observational, comparative, and analytic methods, they seek to understandhuman identities and interactions at the personal, local, and global levels.Language Requirement: Students attain second-semester ability in a language other than English. In thesecourses students practice effective and appreciative communication within another language and acrosscultures. Students also may satisfy this requirement through a proficiency/placement examination orparticipation in an off-campus study program in a non-English-speaking country and enrolling in a minimumof two courses, including a language course and a course related to the program’s location. Students whosefirst language is not English may be certified as meeting this requirement through the Office of the Registrar.Courses that meet the distribution requirements are listed in the Courses section of this Catalog and in theSchedule of Classes each semester, with the abbreviation of the area of study following the course title.Policies for Distribution RequirementsWorking closely with their academic advisors, students should complete these requirements within thefirst two years. If the requirements in Arts and Humanities, Science and Mathematics, and SocialScience have not been completed by the end of sophomore year, students must enroll in at least oneeligible course in each succeeding semester until they complete the requirements.1.Each of the six course credits used to complete the Arts and Humanities, Science and Mathematics, andSocial Science distribution requirements must be from different course listing areas. The course listingarea is denoted by the text code preceding the course number in the schedule of classes and on thetranscript.2.No course may satisfy more than one distribution requirement.3.Courses used to fulfill distribution requirements may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis.4.Course credit used to fulfill the distribution requirements in Arts and Humanities, Science andMathematics, and Social Science must be earned through courses offered at DePauw. Advancedplacement and transfer credit do not apply to completing distribution requirements.5.Individual departments, programs, and the School of Music, with the guidance and approval of theCommittee on the Management of Academic Operations (MAO), determine which of their coursesmeet distribution requirements.6. Winter TermEvery DePauw student must complete three Winter Term projects with a satisfactory grade. (Winter Termprojects are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.) Only one of the three required Winter Termprojects may be satisfied by participation in a semester off-campus study program or Fellows internship.Students opting to fulfill one of their Winter Term credits in this way will not receive additional credit if theyparticipate in a Winter Term project during January of the same academic year.One Winter Term project is considered full time, and students may be enrolled in only one project perJanuary session. DePauw Winter Term projects do not receive regular units of academic credit and do notmeet distribution requirements for graduation or requirements toward a major. Students are expected to beaware of and follow all appropriate procedures and deadlines, which may be found on the Winter Term website.Students who receive incomplete (I) grades in a Winter Term project must complete the project by the end ofthe following semester or the grade will automatically convert to an unsatisfactory (U). Students who have adeficient number of Winter Terms may petition to the director of Winter Term to make up a project during thesummer. Graduating seniors who receive an unsatisfactory Winter Term grade during the senior year maypetition to make up the project during the final spring semester if appropriate arrangements can be made.Tuition is charged to enroll in a make-up Winter Term project.Transfer students receive credit for one Winter Term project for every full year of full-time study at anotherinstitution. These graduation requirements are effective for students entering between Fall 2005 and Spring 2012.Jump to a SectionSenior Capstone CelebrationCompetence RequirementsWritingQuantitative ReasoningOral CommunicationWinter TermDistribution Requirements for the B…Summary of Minimum Requirements for…Minimum Requirements for the Three …Home Academics Catalog …Graduation RateAcademic ExpectationsGeneral Policies for all Undergradu…Maximum LimitsGrade RequirementResidence RequirementExplanation of Graduation Requireme…First-Year SeminarThe Senior Capstone ExperienceGraduation requirements and special academic programs at DePauw University lead to the Bachelor of Arts degree andthree degrees in the School of Music: Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Musical Arts and Bachelor of Music Education. Thecurricula are developed through departmental and interdisciplinary programs in the Asbury College of Liberal Arts and inthe School of Music.Normally, students are subject to the graduation requirements that are in effect when they first enroll at DePauw. Ifgraduation requirements are subsequently changed, students have the option of graduating under the new requirements.Students who require more than four and one-half courses to complete their degree and interrupt their studies for more thana total of five years must meet the graduation requirements currently in effect when they graduate. Coursework more than10 years old will be reviewed by the appropriate department to determine whether it is still applicable toward the degree orneeds additional work to bring it up-to-date.DePauw graduates 80 percent of first-time degree students in four years. An additional 3-4 percent will graduate within 6years of enrolling at DePauw.DePauw has considerably different academic expectations than those of high school, and it is important that students adjustto these new expectations early in their college careers.1. College is not the end of the educational process but a foundation for a lifetime of continued learning and growth.Therefore, two of the central goals of college are to help students develop a sense of responsibility for their own learningand the ability to learn on their own.2. Accordingly, college students spend much less time in class than they did in high school; but are correspondinglyexpected to do much more work outside of class than they did in high school.3. Full-time students should plan to spend between 40 and 50 hours a week (or more) on their academic work, theequivalent of a full-time job.4. Students are responsible for learning a great deal of the material on their own outside of the classroom.5. Students should expect that course material will be covered at a much more rapid pace than they have experiencedbefore. This expectation is partially based on the assumption that students are preparing carefully for class so that morematerial can be covered in class.6. Students are expected to come to class prepared and ready to participate actively in the class session. They are expectedto have read the texts and used other required materials carefully and comprehensively before the class session.The policies and requirements below apply to all students earning a bachelor's degree at DePauw. Although faculty advisorsand others assist in academic planning, students are responsible for planning their programs and meeting all requirementsfor graduation.Thirty-one courses are required for students earning Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music (B.M.) and Bachelor ofMusical Arts (B.M.A.) degrees. The Bachelor of Music Education (B.M.E.) degree requires at least 33 courses.Required ensemble credit is above the 31 or 33 credits for Music degrees.Each student must complete a major and achieve a 2.0 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) in that major and satisfy the senior majorrequirement. See Majors, for more information.Fifteen courses, including six of the last eight courses leading to a bachelor's degree, must be completed in residenceat DePauw or in a DePauw University-approved program.Students must attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0. Students in the B.M.E. program need a minimum 2.5 GPA.All first time degree students must enroll in a first-year seminar.Students must complete distribution requirements appropriate to their degree objective. Satisfactory performance inproficiency examinations may count toward meeting distribution requirements.Students in the College of Liberal Arts must demonstrate competence in writing (W), quantitative reasoning (Q) andoral communication skills (S). Students in the School of Music B.M., B.M.A., and B.M.E. degree programs completeW and S certification.Students must complete three Winter Term projects with satisfactory grades.Transfer students must earn a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) for all courses taken at DePauw and meet the requirements ofthe class with which they expect to graduate.Maximum LimitsA maximum of one course credit of physical education (PE) activities is applicable toward the bachelor's degree and Group6 (in the 2005 distribution requirements).

Students may elect majors or minors in studio art and art history. Studio courses (in drawing,painting, ceramics, sculpture, photography, video and digital art) stress the fundamentals of visualcommunication and help students cultivate the technical skills necessary for the effective expression of theirideas in a given medium. Art history courses combine traditional and non-traditional approaches to the studyof art, past and present, and stress the importance of viewing visual artifacts and architecture within theirsocial and cultural contexts. Students are encouraged to look at art in an active and engaged way and to thinkcritically about the meaning of art and visual culture in the contemporary world. Both programs, studio andart history, prepare students for graduate programs or entry into a wide variety of professional careers in thearts. Studio majors in the department have gone on to successful careers as practicing artists, commercialillustrators and art educators; those with majors in art history have become art critics, art historians, museumor gallery professionals or arts administrators. Every year, in addition to the usual courses of study, the artand art history department sponsors a number of cultural events that connect the department to the campus atlarge. The Art Center's three large gallery spaces provide a changing schedule of 10-12 exhibitions annually;visiting artists, critics and historians present their own work and meet with students for critiques anddiscussions; department faculty and students get together for group critiques and the annual major-minormixer, and the department sponsors a popular bus trip each semester to visit museums and galleries inChicago, St. Louis, or Cincinnati.Art HistoryTotal coursesrequiredEight + 2 (see below)Core courses, , "

ARTH 226C,"ontemporary Art & TheoryThis course will be focused on art from the late 1960s to the present. This is the tradition in art which rejectsmany of the basic principles and qualities of Modernism; that is, it rejects an exclusive focus on oil paintingand pedestal-based sculpture, the autonomy of the artwork from the wider world, and the ideal of the artist asa larger-than-life person who reaches a level of personal emotional or spiritual insight, turning that insightinto a cultural achievement, in painting or sculpture, beyond the abilities of ordinary mortals. We willexamine how this new tradition, critical of the earlier era of Modernism, emerged and developed, and how itstill essentially defines the agenda of today's art world. We will address the crucial question: Is the rejectionof those earlier ideals and goals in contemporary art a liberation or a defeat? We will also address thesituation in contemporary art, the direct result of that rejection, in which art takes on a bewildering array ofmaterials, methods, procedures, goals, and modes of self-presentation; rarely does one see in contemporaryart exhibitions a simple framed painting, hanging on the wall, unless it is presented with exquisite irony andambivalence.

ARTH 240R,"ome: City and MythThis interdisciplinary course is organized both chronologically and thematically. It covers the period from theRenaissance to Fascism with ancient Rome being an overarching theme, since antiquity (its physical remains,how it was mythologized, conceptualized and fantasized in history, literature, travel writing and film) hasbeen so integral to Roman identity through time and so much a part of the fabric of how others haveconceptualized Rome as well. In dealing with Rome as a material entity, we cover primarily architecture,public sculpture and urban planning which were all driven by complex political, social, religious andaesthetic motivations that got encoded in the imagery. In dealing with Rome as an accumulation of 'mythic'narratives about the city, we look at poetry, short stories, novels, films, letters, journals and other forms oftravel writing -- created by some of the many footloose pilgrims -- men and women of different time periodsand nationalities--some famous and some not --who have journeyed to Rome and been forever changed bythe experience. The 'real' and the 'mythic' Romes are, in the end, impossible to pry apart, so interwoven is thedream of this urban landscape with its material reality.

What are the conventions of documentaryfilm practice, that provide the necessary impression of "authenticity;" when and for what purposes have theseconventions been challenged? What is the ethical responsibility of a filmmaker to his/her subjects who are,after all, not actors, but people going about the business of their lives?

ARTH 340L,"ove and War in Medieval Art and Literature"Love is a kind of war, and no assignment for cowards." Thus spoke Ovid in c. 2 B.C.E. with great pertinenceto love and war in the Middle Ages and to the endeavors of this class. I propose to work with you throughthree forms of vernacular writing and imagery: war epic poems, Arthurian romances, and allegorical lovepoetry. All three of these forms were articulated in the incredibly rich 12th - 14th centuries, though often theyrefer to much earlier periods. All three of these forms flourished outside the purview (and approval) of theChurch. And all three of these forms interacted with that most troublesome (because uncontrolled) of allentities: the secular image. Both the texts and images of medieval love and war existed without the sanctionor authority of sacred text (i.e. the Bible in its many medieval manifestations). This "unmoored" qualityresulted in an especially productive, volatile and fascinating interaction between orality, memory, writing,and transmission. The course seeks to be aware of how "timeless" stories move between various verbal andvisual forms, what the impacts of those forms are on the stories, and what happens to them in our modern era(where they are still consistently translated into film and further fiction).

Representing a strongand continuous intellectual presence in the academy, Black Studies challenges all students to explore issuesof identity and subject formation, of race and difference; to understand the collective experience of blackpeople in today's world; to develop the ability to examine, analyze and interpret these experiences within thecontext of liberal learning. Involving black people throughout the world and over time, Black Studies is theonly discipline that situates black people at the center of study and offers an intellectual tool without seekingintellectual hegemony. Black Studies at DePauw is conceived as a multidisciplinary study of the collectiveexperience of Africa and the African Diaspora. As an intellectual pursuit attuned to the ways in which nation,race, social class, ethnicity and gender inform relations, Black Studies describes, represents, critiques andinterrogates the multiple and shifting historical, cultural, social and political meanings of blackness, focusingon the disaporan societies, cultures and people of the United States, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.Black StudiesTotal coursesrequiredTenCore courses"

Students willenter into a formal contract. The contract will define the parameters of the study,including the general terms and conditions to be met by way of completing the project.Distribution of the signed contract will be as follows: 1 copy to be kept by thesupervisor of the thesis/project, 1 by the student, and 1 by the Black Studies director.The project is to be completed within the semester in which it is offered (1 course) andso designed so that the director or the supervising faculty in consultation with thedirector, having determined that the student has completed the written part of theproject with minimum grade of C-, will arrange for the student to defend the thesisbefore a committee of Black Studies faculty, made up of at least 4 persons, two ofwhom shall be the Director of Black Studies and the thesis faculty supervisor, plus twoto three other faculty members who teach in the Black Studies program. Prior to thedefense, the student's project will be circulated to members of the defense panel. Thestudent will be required to do a 15-20 minute presentation on the thesis/project afterwhich members of the panel will ask him/her questions on the thesis/project.Following the question and answer period, the student will be asked to leave the room.The defense panel will then adjudicate whether or not the student passed the defense.A simple pass/fail grade is required for successful completion of the defense. On thebasis of the student's performance in the defense, the panel will decide on the student'soverall grade, including the written part, for the senior project.

Coursework in chemistry naturally prepares one tounderstand the physical and living worlds; it also prepares one to make scientifically-informed contributionsto many other fields and to society. Areas such as molecular biology, environmental law and policy, bioethics,patent law, medicine and education are examples of fields where chemical knowledge is needed. Bothbiochemistry and chemistry majors pursue graduate studies in chemistry, biochemistry or medicine upongraduation. Other career paths available to these majors include employment in fields such as thepharmaceutical industry, law, environmental monitoring and technical sales/management. The chemistryfaculty encourages students to participate in collaborative research during the school year, Winter Term andsummers. Such research is an important facet of a student's education. Students may also choose to pursue aninternship at a national laboratory or in an industrial or medical setting at some point in their training. Allchemistry students may participate in the activities of the award-winning Chemistry Club. The Women inScience group also sponsors speakers and activities of interest to chemistry students.

Other courses commonlyrequired or recommended include English and humanities courses, psychology, biochemistry, statistics andforeign language. Students should check the prerequisites for programs they are interested in early and oftento make sure they are meeting entrance requirements.Allied Health ProfessionsStudents who begin their college study with premedical interests often find their talents and interests arebetter suited for an allied health profession rather than a degree in medicine. There are many possible careersincluding: physician assistant, medical technician, athletic trainer, nurse practitioner, public healthprofessional, occupational therapist, physical therapist, paramedic, clinical psychologist, health-careadministrator, health-care social worker,  and wellness/ fitness educator. Most require students to have afour-year degree before matriculating; a few programs are open to students who wish to transfer in after twoor three years at a liberal arts institution. Students interested in these fields should consult with a member ofthe Health Sciences Committee.Physical TherapyPhysical therapy is a dynamic health-care field with employment opportunities in a variety of settings.Professional (entry level) physical therapy education programes are offered at two levels: doctoral andmaster's. It is anticipated that the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree will become the future entrydegree for the physical therapy profession.DePauw University recognizes the highly competitive process for admission into professional programs inphysical therapy. Students are identified as "Pre-PT" for advising purposes. Pre-physical therapy students canchoose a major in any academic department (Biology, Kinesiology and Psychology are common choices) andthen additionally take the prerequisite courses that are required by the physical therapy program for which thestudent plans to apply. There can be differences in prerequisites among various physical therapy programs. Itis essential to check the specific prerequisites of each program in which the student may have interest. Somecommon prerequisites requirements are: two semesters of chemistry with labs, two semesters of physics withlabs, human anatomy, human (animal) physiology, one or two biology courses with labs, introductorypsychology, and statistics. One or more of the following courses may also be required by an individualprogram: developmental psychology, abnormal psychology, sociology, exercise physiology, philosophy,English composition, speech, computers, anthropology, research methods, calculus, and medical terminology.A strong academic record is essential for gaining admittance to a physical therapy program. GPA in theprerequisite coursework, as well as overall GPA, are two of the most heavily weighted admission criteria inthe student selection process. Other common selection criteria include:Diverse clinical experiences (observing, working, volunteering) to ensure a well developedappreciation of the physical therapy profession. The opportunity to work with physical therapists andother health care professionals is a valuable experience and an important inclusion in the applicationfor physical therapy school. DePauw's Winter Term provides a mechanism for students to complete aninternship in a physical therapy setting. In addition to Winter Term, students can also gain theseexperiences around their school schedule or during the summer.1.Score on the Graduate Record Exam (a small number of schools might require a different aptitudeassessment).2.Involvement in school and community activities, personal qualities, motives and goals which are oftenevidenced from narrative statements, personal interview and letters of recommendation.3.Pre-physical therapy students at DePauw are encouraged to take advantage of information and programssponsored by the Health Sciences Advising Committee. The Committee disseminates information viameetings, e-mails, career fairs, speakers and the health sciences web page http://www.depauw.edu/academics/academic-resources/advising/health-sciences-advising/. The web page contains information not only onphysical therapy but also prerequisites for professional programs in other health profession areas.Religious Service ProfessionsAppropriate preparation for professional religious service is as varied as the types of career paths that areavailable. DePauw offers individualized guidance and support for persons who are considering professionalwork as a minister, chaplain, priest, rabbi, cantor, church musician, religious educator or other form ofreligious service or faith-based community activism. DePauw's religious service professions advisory groupencourages each student to consider both curricular and extracurricular components of their preparation.Graduate education is required or recommended for many forms of religious service. The requirements foradmission to graduate programs vary widely. In most instances, the broad background acquired through aliberal arts education is good preparation for further study. Based on the requirements of a particular graduateprogram or proposed field of study, knowledgeable faculty members in the religious service professionsadvisory group are available to advise students of appropriate academic courses and opportunities.Whether pursuing graduate education or not, extracurricular opportunities can be a useful way to prepare forand gain experience in religious service. The religious service professions advisors can suggest possibilitiesfor on- and off-campus service, internships, mentoring relationships and other possibilities as a way tointegrate intellectual and experiential learning. Additionally, religious service professions advisors can directstudents to relevant short-term service programs, which can be a powerful means for students to explore theirsense of vocation and prepare for future work or study after they graduate.Students are encouraged to contact the religious service professions advisors as soon as possible in theiracademic career in order to take full advantage of the opportunities described above. A student does not haveto be certain of his or her vocation goals in order to do so. The religious service professions advisory groupvalues and supports wide-ranging vocational exploration and discernment.LawAs a prerequisite to admission, most law schools expect a student to have acquired a sound liberal artseducation, without regard to any set of prescribed courses or any particular course of study (e.g. majors andminors). The quality of the student's undergraduate preparation, in other words, far outweighs its particularsubject matter or choice of major. All law schools do require, however, the completion of the bachelor'sdegree for admission.Successful legal study requires well developed speaking, writing and analytical skills. For the pre-lawstudents, DePauw's W, S, and Q competency requirements address these expectations. In addition, suchacademic skills ought to develop from the student's work in any number of courses and in a wide range ofdisciplines as an integral part of the liberal arts experience.Along with the GPA, the Law School Aptitude Test provides the most important statistical data foradmissions consideration. The LSAT, taken at the end of the student's junior year or early in his or her senioryear, seeks to measure the candidate's verbal abilities and logical and analytical skills. Extracurricularactivities, leadership positions, internships of various kinds, summer employment, off-campus experiencesand a demonstrated sense of purpose are additional qualities valued by law admissions committees, but theyshould not be seen as substitutes for a good GPA or LSAT result. Refer to the Law School web site foradditional information: www.lsac.org.At DePauw, students thinking of law school, whatever their undergraduate major, are counseled on anindividual basis by their faculty advisor or by the pre-law advisor.Students are encouraged to research the schools that they are interested in so they are familiar with thespecific requirements at the respective schools. This research enables potential candidates to take a moredirected approach to the application process, making adjustments to their schedules when necessary.Aerospace Studies (Air Force ROTC)DePauw University students interested in being commissioned as Air Force officers upon graduation canenroll in classes offered through the Air Force ROTC department at Indiana University.

Thus, majors inclassical studies have the opportunity to explore a wide range of humanistic disciplines. Work with theancient languages encourages logical and creative thought, provides a sophisticated grasp of the possibilitiesof language and gives the student the opportunity to study in detail some of the greatest works of the humanspirit.A major in Classics is a good foundation for a wide variety of careers. Classics majors have gone on tosuccessful careers in such fields as law, medicine, business, journalism, government, teaching, theatre and thearts. Some of our majors have double majored in fields such as Political Science, Philosophy and Chemistry.The major in classical studies may be completed in any one of the following areas of concentration: Greek,Latin or Classical Civilization. Minors are offered in Classical Civilization, Greek, Latin and ClassicalArchaeology. Students majoring in Classical Studies are usually expected to complete their seniorcomprehensive requirement through the department's senior seminar. The seminar presents the opportunityfor majors in Classical Civilization, Greek, or Latin to address a particular topic at an advanced level. Recentseminar topics include: "Rome in the Age of Augstus", "Athens in Contemporary Classical Scholarship", and"Test and Art in the Ancient World". Within the seminar, each student is expected to complete an independentresearch project related to the topic of the seminar. In exceptional cases, students may opt to complete thesenior comprehensive requirement by completing an independent thesis project. Students interested in thispossibility should confer with their departmental advisor about the specific requirements. Students who aredouble majoring in two Classical Studies disciplines (e.g., Latin and Classical Civilization) must complete asenior comprehensive requirement for both majors.Majors and minors in Classical Studies are encouraged to participate in Winter Term trips to Italy and Greece(or elsewhere in the Mediterranean) and in semester abroad programs such as the College Year in Athens orthe Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome. In many cases, courses taken in these programscount toward a Classical Studies major or minor. Students interested in Classical Archaeology are alsoencouraged to participate in summer fieldwork in the Mediterranean.Students who are interested in teaching Latin in high school should take as much Latin as possible andconsult with the Classical Studies and Education departments about certification. Students planning to attendgraduate school in classics should either double major in Greek and Latin or major in one language and minorin the other.

The contexts ofcommunication, including rhetoric, interpersonal communication, media, and theatre, are analyzed anddistinguished. As a crossroads discipline, communication is studied from the humanities, artistic, and socialscience perspectives. The study of communication is built around a framework that allows for anunderstanding of theory, opportunity for criticism of messages and practice and research in the discipline.Students study a wide range of communication areas, including rhetoric, interpersonal communication, mediaand theatre. Communication students can apply their understanding of this vital process in a variety of fields,such as corporate communication, public relations, personnel, advertising, marketing, law, mass media, sales,public service and the performing arts. Most communication students participate in co-curricular activities,such as debate, theatre (DePauw Theatre) and student mass media (WGRE-FM radio and D3TV cable accesstelevision).

We view a wide variety of documentary styles: poetic, ethnographic, direct cinema,government sponsored, social advocacy, rockumentary, mockumentary, pseudo-documentary, and differenthybrid forms. These styles and themes are used as springboards to explore larger questions: What is thesource of our fascination with the real? How can documentary evoke discourses of truth, realism andauthenticity when the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction have become ever more fluid; when digitaltechnology makes possible the absence of any camera or original referent from the 'real' world; and whendocumentarians make use of strategies such as staging, re-enactments, discontinuous editing, or variouspoetic devices? What are the conventions of documentary film practice, that provide the necessaryimpression is the ethical responsibility of a filmmaker to his/her subjects who are, after all, not actors, butpeople going about the business of their lives? To understand better the complex nature of representation, wealso take into account how context, expectations, institutional supports, viewing communities, culturalframeworks, and historical and social forces (and their interaction) all contribute to the making of meaning invisual images.Distribution AreaPrerequisitesCreditsArts and Humanities1 course"

Students studyalgorithmic processes and the design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to carry outthese processes. Since computers are used for a variety of purposes by people in all walks of life, there is asignificant human side to computer science as well.Some graduates choose to continue their studies in graduate or professional school (not necessarily incomputer science) before seeking employment. Majors accepting positions upon graduation typically workfor companies that provide computing hardware, software or services for use in business, education,government and research.The department regularly offers Computer Science I and other courses of a more general nature for studentsinterested in surveying key topics in computing. Departmental programs consist of a computer science majorand a computer science minor. Most courses provide hands-on computing experience.Computing facilities include pen-based computer laboratories that are part of the University network. Theyprovide tools for computer science, standard desktop productivity, e-mail and connectivity to the Internet.The department maintains a state-of-the-art laboratory of Linux workstations with high-end servers thatprovide robust file services and a full array of software development tools. The department also has acomputer-based, cooperative-work laboratory and a lounge for use by its majors.University programs of interest to computer science majors include: Science Research Fellows Program,Information Technology Associates Program and Winter Term internships. Some employment and researchopportunities with the department and the Computer Center are available during the year and summer.Finally, the student computer clubs (Association for Computing Machinery and ACM-Women) providecoordinated programs each year.Computer ScienceTotal coursesrequiredTen CSC + "

It sharpens our abilities to think clearly and analytically aboutthese and other matters. It may also help students reach a variety of specific career goals. For example, mostmajors take entry-level positions in business: they are hired by banks and other financial institutions,accounting and management consulting firms, and companies in manufacturing, public utilities andcommerce. Some majors go on to earn graduate degrees in economics; they may then work in areas such asbusiness, government service or academia. (Students considering graduate study in economics should consultwith a department faculty member about the large number of mathematics courses that are highlyrecommended.) A background in economics is also excellent preparation for graduate study in law andbusiness. Many of our graduates have gone on to reach exceptional levels of recognition and responsibility ineducation, government and industry. Students wishing to apply economics courses taken off-campus toward amajor in economics must have prior approval from their economics advisor and the chair of the economicsand management department. Students wishing to count economics courses taken off-campus toward therequirements of the Business Administration Minor or the International Business Program must have priorapproval from the relevant program advisor and the chair of the economics and management department.

Trained to think inventively and writeexpressively, English majors of both concentrations are prepared for work in various professional spheres,including graduate study in the field, education, communications, publishing, law and business. Some haveestablished reputations as important scholars, journalists and authors. Literature classes enable students tostudy literature as an art form. Through courses covering a spectrum of historical, cultural and ethnicperspectives, literature also invites students to explore their own lives and times as well as think beyond theirown experience. Classes typically combine lecture and discussion, introducing students to representativeworks of English, American, and Anglophone writing and encouraging them to develop methods of criticalinterpretation. The study of writing directly engages students' imaginations and knowledge and helps themdevelop their potential as writers through courses in fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwritingand journalism.

European intellectual and socialtraditions are the foundation of many aspects of American life. During the past decade, relations betweenEurope and the United States have begun to evolve and to move in dramatically new directions, challengingus to understand the unique phenomenon that is Europe. The end of the Cold War has broken down theEast-West divide, and the European Union promises to alter in significant ways the international landscape ofthe future.Currently we offer a minor in European studies which integrates course work from several fields into a broadyet coherent program of study. The minor allows students to engage in a critical examination of Europeansociety and the cultural, economic, and political issues of historical and contemporary interest. The programoffers a context for DePauw's study-abroad programs located throughout the continent and for those whowish to understand the relationship of Europe to the rest of the world. Many fields, from the humanities togovernment, business, and scientific research, have increasing interactions with the European Union. Theminor in European studies thus contributes to the preparation for a career in a wide variety of professions.The goal of the program is to produce graduates who have the linguistic competence, the culturalcomprehension, and the specialized knowledge to operate effectively on the European scene - either in one ofthe countries of Europe or within a US-based organization dealing with them.European StudiesTotal coursesrequiredFiveCore coursesA fourth-semester proficiency in a modern Western European language other thanEnglish that suits the logical and coherent grouping of the five courses that form theminor.

REL 275R,"eligion and FilmThis course uses major theories of religion in order to investigate religious themes and symbols in a numberof contemporary films. In this course we use the screening of a dozen or so religiously evocative films inorder to open up a discursive space within which we can think critically about ourselves and the time we livein. In order to do this we look at the ways in which powerful religious themes have been dealt within film. Attimes the religious themes addressed inmoves are overt and trandition-specific while at other times they arecovert and universal. Throughout the course we interrogate filmic texts in order to understand the ways inwhich religious themes are dealth with through the cinematic medium. But we also allow the films tointerrogate us! In this class we view the screening of the films as an opportunity for us to reflect upon thenature of religion as we try to come to a better understanding of its place within society and our own lives.The purpose of the course is twofold: first, students learn how to think critically about religion and its placeas a social and cultual force in the contemporary world; second, they learn how to apply a critical attitude andcritical tools to view films and other aspects of popular culture.Distribution AreaPrerequisitesCreditsArts and Humanities1 courseCourse CatalogGeoscientists study the Earth, including the materials that compose the planet, the processes that continuouslychange the planet, and the evolution of the earth and life through time. Because these studies involveinvestigations of relationships between the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, theGeosciences are inherently interdisciplinary by nature and include aspects of chemistry, biology, and physics.Geoscientists also are addressing increasingly challenging problems that confront a growing humanpopulation as we begin the twenty-first century: dwindling water, mineral, and energy resources; earthquakeprediction and natural hazard identification; human impacts on the environment at regional and global scales;and safe disposal of toxic and radioactive waste materials. The goal of the Department of Geosciences is toexpose students to the complex interplay of Earth systems through active, hands-on learning. Therefore, aDePauw education in the Geosciences goes far beyond the traditional classroom. Students work in modernlaboratories with extensive mineral, rock, fossil, and map collections. They use computers to model complexsystems and simulate geological processes. They receive training on emerging technological tools such asGPS (global positioning systems) and GIS (geographic information systems). They participate on field tripsthat take them to some of the best geological exposures in the world. Many students spend a summer workingclosely with faculty on important research problems using state-of-the-art instrumentation. These student-faculty collaborations commonly result in student presentations at national meetings and co-authoredpublications in refereed journals.Earth ScienceTotal coursesrequired8.5 GEOS + 2.25 CHEM/PHYSCore courseseligion and FilmThis course uses major theories of religion in order to investigate religious themes and symbols in a numberof contemporary films.

By exploring the complexities of peoples and societies in the past, the present becomes morecomprehensible. As a core discipline of the liberal arts, history encourages students to think critically, toargue logically and to examine the values of their society and those of other societies. By developingresearch, analytical, writing, oral communication and problem solving skills, the undergraduate major inHistory is valuable preparation for a broad range of occupations, for graduate and professional schools andfor the responsibilities of informed citizenship. Recent history majors have pursued careers in education, law,government service, journalism, public history, social agencies, business and finance. The History departmentbrings historians and history makers to campus, encourages off-campus study and travel, shows films anddocumentaries, sponsors field trips to historical sites and assists students in finding history-relatedinternships. The History department offers introductory and advanced work in the following geographicfields: Africa, East Asia, Europe, Latin America and the United States. Students wishing to count coursestaken off-campus toward a major or minor in history should note that approval is not automatic and that theymust obtain prior approval from their academic advisors and the department chair.HistoryTotal coursesrequiredNineCore courses"

Both experiences requirestudents to employ and refine the research, writing and communication skills theyhave developed over the previous three years at DePauw by producing a piece oforiginal historical research. These writing-intensive projects require sophisticatedapproaches to sources, analysis, and presentation, as well as imagination anddiscipline in the selection and refinement of research topics.Senior Seminar (History 490) is a one-semester class devoted to the design andimplementation of historical research in a subfield and historical methodology of eachseminar member's choosing. The seminar instructor assumes primary responsibilityfor guiding the seminar participants, though students are encouraged over the courseof the semester to consult other department faculty whose regional, thematic, andchronological specializations correspond to the selected topic. The end result is anoriginal piece of historical research typically totaling between 30 and 40 pages ofwriting. (For a list of some recent Senior Seminar papers, click here; for a sampleHistory 490 syllabus, click here). In addition to producing a paper, students mustcontribute actively to the development of their peers' projects through brain-storming,editing, and commentary; each student will make a research presentation to theseminar and invited guests toward the end of the semester.Senior Thesis (History 495-496) requires two-semesters of intensive research andwriting on a topic approved by a member of the department who serves as thestudent's principal thesis supervisor.

Visual markers of past eras-historical landscapes, buildings, and artifacts-are powerful placesfor learning about the past. But who decides which "pasts" are worth preserving and whose stories are retold?What is the relationship between history learned in the classroom and history learned at public sites? Thiscourse examines these questions from three perspectives: material culture, the objects that are the primaryhistorical documents for interpreting the past at historical sites and museums; history museums and their rolein determining how the past is displayes; and public member, or popular uses of the past for commemorationor for heritage purposes.Distribution AreaPrerequisitesCredits1 course"

Onlyone of the classes can be in the student's major.The student is also expected to complete four semesters of work in campus media. It can be done intelevision, radio, newspaper, literary magazine, or other activities that are approved by the director. Inaddition, the student is expected to attend four special lectures and seminars each semester.In order to remain a Media Fellow in good standing, the student must achieve a 3.1 cumulative GPA at theend of three semesters and a 3.2 GPA at the time of graduation. In addition, the student must satisfactorilycomplete all required coursework as detailed above.Admission — The Media Fellows Program is highly selective. Application to the program is made the senioryear of high school and is contingent upon acceptance to the university. The Media Fellows admissionsprocess includes a written essay, an interview with a Media Fellows faculty steering committee member andcurrent student, proven academic ability and desire to learn more about the media. There is also very limitedentry to the program for first-year students already enrolled at DePauw.Contact the director of the Media Fellows Program, Eugene S. Pulliam Center for Contemporary Media, toobtain more information about the Media Fellows Program.Science Research Fellows ProgramThe Science Research Fellows at DePauw University is an honors program that combines curricular andco-curricular experiences to train future scientific leaders. Undergraduate students work in closecollaboration with faculty members from their first semester in the program to both learn and apply scienceresearch methods. This early exposure to research opens doors for students to conduct research off-campus inexternal science research internship programs and to delve more deeply into research on campus. Studentsbecome proficient at writing and speaking to science and non-science audiences about their work andscientific endeavors. They learn to articulate how science and scientists impact society and gain appreciationfor the diversity of science. Rich research experiences combined with important complementary skillsprepare them to be top candidates for post-graduate study and a wide variety of careers science.Admission - For admission into the Science Research Fellows Program, students must exhibit high academicpromise and have a firm commitment to study and to conduct research in a scientific field. Students mustapply to the program separately from applying to DePauw University. The strongest candidates are invited tothe campus for interviews with members of the Science Research Fellows Steering Committee before finalselections are made. A lateral entry process is also available for first-year students already at DePauw to enterthe program as sophomores.A student in the Science Research Fellows program may major in any of the science departments (biology,chemistry and biochemistry, computer science, geosciences, mathematics, physics and astronomy,kinesiology, or psychology). Each year approximately 10-15 students from the entering class and about 5-10lateral entry students are selected to participate in the program.First-Year Experience - During students' first year in the program they participate in one research seminarand one experience involving collaborative research with a faculty member. These courses have aninvestigative focus and provide exposure to various science disciplines, helping to develop skills for futureresearch experiences.Research Internships — The university supports Science Research Fellows for one summer on campus,usually following their first year in the Science Research Fellows Program, working on a collaborativeresearch project with a science faculty member. Students also participate in a semester- or summer-longresearch internship in a major scientific laboratory or research site in either the public or private sector duringthe sophomore or junior year. A number of students have completed their internships outside of the UnitedStates. Students are required to present their research in an on-campus poster session the fall after each ofthese experiences.Capstone Experience - Science Research Fellows close their DePauw careers by taking a senior-levelcapstone seminar. The class provides the opportunity for students to share their research internshipexperiences with other SRF students and to read about and discuss how science relates to topics such aspublic policy and education. As part of that course, they explore science careers, work on clear articulation ofpast research and future goals, and write an original research proposal. Special projects for the course mayinclude educational outreach or outreach to science alumni.Speakers and Co-curricular Activities - The Science Research Fellows Program brings to campus speakersfrom a variety of scientific settings—academic, industrial and governmental—to provide enlightening viewsof how science is done and at the same time to raise the general scientific awareness of the DePauwcommunity. The Program also provides workshops on topics such as scientific ethics, finding an internship,preparing and presenting a scientific poster and scientific careers. DePauw defines itself as a place where the intellect is challenged by experience. DePauw has been nationallyrecognized among liberal arts colleges for its commitment to internships, as well as for its innovativeinternship programs. Internships are viewed not simply as a way of gaining experience in "the real world."Rather, for many students they are a way of discovering greater purpose and focus in their classroom studies.Through internships, off-campus study and research projects, DePauw students enrich the classroom withpractice and application. Students return from their internships knowing how important it is to become goodlearners and how abstract discussions of values, aesthetics, ethics and knowledge come to matter outside theclassroom.DePauw students have the opportunity to earn experiential or internship credit by participating in approvedoff-campus study programs with an internship component. Among these are the Philadelphia Center programand the New York Arts program. There are many other approved off-campus programs, both domestic andinternational, that offer internship opportunities.The Fellows Programs at DePauw include an internship opportunity, typically during a student's junior year.The Management Fellows, Media Fellows, and Science Research Fellows internships are set up inconjunction with the Director of the respective program.Internships are a significant component of DePauw's Winter Term. Following the procedures established bythe Winter Term office, around 300 students arrange month-long, full-time internships each year. Typicallythese projects are unpaid but earn DePauw Winter Term credit.Students may apply a maximum of three courses of internship credit toward graduation and may have nomore than a total of five internship experiences, including Winter Term Internships. Independently-Designed Internships (Semester Long)DePauw's Independently-Designed Internship is a semester-long internship that provides opportunities forstudents who desire to have high-quality active learning experiences as part of their formal education but forwhom other available options are not appropriate or possible.This two-credit internship is considered to be essentially a full-time work experience (at least 30 hours perweek). Applicants assume most of the responsibility for organizing their internships. They develop athorough preliminary proposal, which is reviewed by their academic advisor and the Academic Affairsadministrator of the program; then, after they receive preliminary approval they find a faculty sponsor willingto supervise the project and an off-campus internship host.To ensure that students reflect upon and synthesize the work experience, an additional one-credit readingscourse associated with the internship experience and/or the student's major field of study is required. Thiscourse will require an additional 10-12 hours a week of the student's time, and may include web-basedinteractions with interns at other sites.This application process begins a year in advance with a preliminary application deadline of mid-March forFall Semester internships and a preliminary application deadline of mid-April for Spring Semesterinternships. Students approved for this program will register for "

History, religion, philosophy, literature, art history, anthropology, political science¿-all ofthese approaches provide a lens through which we can view the diversity and complexity of Jewishexperience from ancient times to the present. There are two strands that are central to Jewish Studies: one isthe study of Jewish intellectual life in both its religious and secular aspects: the other is the study of Jewishidentity, again both religious and secular. And central to both these strands is the understanding that there isno singular or essential Judaism, Jewish thought, Jewish place, or Jewish identity. Jewish Studies, like all theliberal arts, poses questions and is never satisfied with an answer. Students interested in exploring JewishStudies can begin by taking one of the variety of courses that will be offered in the coming year. They arealso encouraged to seek out one of the affiliated Jewish Studies faculty for advice and conversation."

Students maypetition to have their class standing changed.Special students are those not pursuing degree programs. Special students may take any subject for whichthey are eligible without regard to requirements for a degree. The Alpha Program enables selected studentsfrom Putnam County high schools to take courses for credit at a special fee of $200 per course.Auditors are registrants who attend classes as listeners and do not receive credit or grades for their work. Inorder to audit a course, the student must first obtain the instructor's permission to register for the course as anauditor. At that time, the instructor and student are to agree on the amount of participation required in orderfor the student to have the audit appear on the transcript. If the class is not completed to the instructor'ssatisfaction, the class will not be recorded for degree students. Special and audit students who do notcomplete the class will receive a W (withdraw) grade. There is no refund for withdrawal from an audit classafter the adjustment period.

The student receives no credit.IAn incomplete grade (I) is to be used only when a student has not completed therequirements of the course for reasons beyond the student’s control, such as illness orequipment failure in the case of laboratory classes. In addition, the class must have beenessentially completed so that only an examination remains or a paper or project alreadywell underway needs to be completed. An I may not be given for failure to submit work ontime because of inadequate planning or to extend time to improve a grade.The student must complete the work within the first two weeks (ten class days) of thefollowing semester in which the student is enrolled at DePauw. Exceptions to the two weekdeadline may be granted by the Petitions Committee. When the student completes thework, a letter grade is recorded. If the I is not completed within the time limit and thestudent has not been approved for an extension, the grade becomes an F.Students who withdraw and return to campus more than a year (two semesters) followingthe incomplete may not complete the course. The grade will be converted to a W providedthe student demonstrates that the original I grade was for appropriate reasons.Students may not graduate with an incomplete grade on their record.WWithdrawal (W) indicates that the student withdrew from a course before the end of thesemester; no credit is given. A student may withdraw with a grade of W through theFriday of the eighth week of classes. The Petitions Committee will approve withdrawalsafter the eighth week of classes only under extraordinary circumstances. A student mustalso have permission of the Petitions Committee to withdraw when doing so meanschanging to a part-time status or not completing a first-year seminar or competence coursewithin the required time period.In a case involving an allegation of academic dishonesty, the student in question may notwithdraw. If, however, the case is resolved in the student's favor, the student may petitionto withdraw from the course even after the close of the semester in which the course wastaken.LDeferred (L) indicates that the final grade is deferred because evaluation is dependentupon work being done the succeeding semester. Permission to give an L in a course mustbe secured in advance from the Office of the Registrar. The L should be changed to a finalgrade as soon as the subsequent coursework makes it possible to determine the grade. Itmay be changed to any grade from A to F.P-D-FA Pass (P) grade indicates that the student has done C- work or better in accordance withgrade standards of the class. Pass/Fail courses are not counted in computing the student'sscholastic average. A grade of D indicates work is of below average quality, but credit isgranted for the class. A Fail (F) grade indicates that the student has not successfullycompleted the work in the class. The student receives no credit for an F, but it does notenter into computing the cumulative grade point average.See Pass/Fail for additionalpolicies regarding P-D-F.S-D-USatisfactory (S), D or unsatisfactory (U) grades are reported for on-campus Winter Termprojects. S-U grades are also used for other Winter Term projects, internships andnon-credit courses.#A # is recorded when no grade has been reported.XAn X indicates that a course has been taken for audit. There is no credit or other gradedesignation for a class taken as an audit. A student's cumulative GPA includes all grades recorded on the transcript, except for grades in courses:taken Pass/Fail;not applicable toward the degree; andtaken while studying on approved off-campus programs (except the DePauw program in Vienna) ormusic ensembles. These off-campus grades and music ensembles are recorded on the transcript but notcalculated into the DePauw GPA.Change of Grades. Grades reported to the Office of the Registrar may be changed by one of two procedures.A grade of I, L or W may be changed as set forth in the preceding paragraphs.1.A grade of A, B, C, D or F may be changed only upon the instructor's request and with the approval ofthe registrar. Approval to change a grade will be made for such reasons as: calculation error or materialthat was turned in on time but was not considered. Students are not to be given additional time tocomplete or re-do work after the semester has ended to improve their grade.2.DePauw students learn and demonstrate writing (W), quantitative reasoning (Q) and oral competence (S) bysuccessfully completing designated upper-level courses across the curriculum. Certification in each of thecompetence areas will be recorded upon completion of the designated courses. The following designationswill show on the student's record after the course credit:W Writing CompetenceQ Quantitative Reasoning CompetenceS Oral Communication CompetenceStudents may access their midterm progress reports, final semester and Winter Term grades throughe-services. Students are encouraged to share their grades with their families. Staff in academic affairs and theoffice of the registrar, dean of students, and dean of student academic support services may discuss academicprogress with parents or guardians of dependent students.Progress Reports. Instructors submit progress reports the Monday of the seventh week of the semester for allfirst-year students, students on academic probation, and upper class students who are making grades of C- orlower.Mid-semester progress reports are not permanent or final but serve as a basis for advising students of theirprogress. Students (and their academic advisors) with midterm grades receive an e-mail to check theire-Services. Students having a GPA of less than a 1.3 at mid-semester may be advised to withdraw from theUniversity. Parents of first-year students and students on academic probation with low midterm grades maybe notified that the University is concerned about their student's progress.Final Grade Reports. Students may access their final semester and Winter Term grades through e-servicesas soon as grade reports are processed, generally after 4:00 pm the day grades are due.Letter grades translate into grade points for each class.The cumulative grade point average determines thescholastic standing of all students.A4.00A-3.67B+3.33B3.00B-2.67C+2.33C2.00C-1.67D+1.33D1.00D-0.67F0.00I0.00W0.00L0.00P-D-F0.00S-D-U0.00#0.00X0.00Regular attendance at classes and laboratories is expected of all students according to guidelines establishedby individual instructors. There are no "allowed cuts" or "free" absences from class sessions. Students may bedropped from a course if absences are too frequent or if the student's behavior seriously disrupts the learningenvironment in the classroom.Students who miss classes for medical, personal or psychological reasons may notify the Student AffairsOffice. Student Affairs staff will confirm with faculty that serious illness or an emergency has been reportedto them. Students are responsible to contact each faculty member, preferably before missing class, to arrangefor making up the work.Absences for medical reasons: When an absence due to medical reasons will result in a student beingunable to fulfill academic responsibilities--for example, papers and examinations--the student should notifythe instructor in advance. Each instructor should let the students know how to give this notification. Theinstructor and student should work out arrangements for possible extension or makeup work. In cases wherestudents are hospitalized, the University physician will, with the student's permission, notify the StudentAffairs Office. It is the student's responsibility to contact the faculty; in addition, the faculty will be notifiedby student affairs personnel.If a student misses two or more weeks of class for medical or other reasons beyond the student’s control, thestudent’s faculty instructors, in consultation with a member of the Academic Affairs staff, will decidewhether the student may reasonably make up the missed work. Students who miss two or more weeks ofclass may no longer be eligible to continue in the class. The final decision about whether a student maycontinue with a class rests with the faculty instructor.Absences for personal or psychological reasons: Occasionally student affairs staff will encounter studentswho must miss class for personal or emotional reasons. These cases include such events as death or illness ofa family member or emergency psychological crisis. When possible, student affairs staff will ask the studentto notify faculty and indicate that faculty may call student affairs staff for confirmation if such validation isdeemed necessary. In some of these cases, the student affairs staff member has no real way to validate thestudent's statement. Maintaining such information over a period of time, however, could help determinepossible patterns of dishonesty for an individual student. In some extreme emergencies, student affairs staffmay notify faculty directly.Early Departure or Late Return from Breaks: Faculty are expected to hold class on the days immediatelybefore and after breaks. Students will not be excused from class attendance or from taking examinations attheir announced time to accommodate travel schedules. It is the responsibility of students and their familiesto make travel arrangements accordingly.Extracurricular Activities: DePauw University believes that both curricular and extracurricular activitiesmake important contributions to the education of students. The University reminds students, however, thatclassroom performance takes priority over all extracurricular activities. When conflicts between regularlyscheduled classes and academically approved extracurricular activities arise, all parties involved in suchconflicts have certain responsibilities toward resolving them. These responsibilities are enumerated in theStudent Handbook.Absences for religious holidays: Students who miss class or other academic responsibilities because theyare adherents of a faith tradition that prohibits such activities are expected to notify their instructors of theirintent to fulfill the obligations of their faith tradition. Special scheduling or rescheduling arrangements shouldbe made well in advance. A list of the holy days that regularly occur during the academic year that may affectattendance are listed in the Student Handbook.Students have primary responsibility for knowing graduation requirements and planning adequately to meetthem. Faculty advisors work closely with students in planning their programs of study.First-year students are advised by the faculty instructor of their first-year seminar (or by a faculty memberclosely associated with the seminar). Students normally work with their advisor through the first two years oruntil they choose a major, but they may change advisors at any time.Students declare a major and choose a faculty advisor in the appropriate department by the sixth week of thesecond semester of the sophomore year.Full-time faculty members are eligible to serve as advisors after they have been associated with theUniversity for one year. Advisors confer with students individually each semester, provide academic adviceconsistent with the aims and obligations of a liberal arts education and help plan individual programs inkeeping with each student's abilities, academic interests and aspirations.A university presupposes a basic integrity in its members as a foundation for the mutual trust necessary to itslife as an academic community. For this reason, academic dishonesty in any of its forms is regarded as aserious offense against the University.Forms of academic dishonesty and procedures for handling violations of academic integrity are set forth inthe Student Handbook.The committee on academic standing reviews records of each student who achieves less than a 2.0 semesterand/or cumulative GPA or has less than a 2.0 in the major, and it takes appropriate action. Students arewarned that scholastic improvement is necessary and are offered resources to help improve academically.Students who achieve below a 2.0 in two consecutive semesters, receive less than a 1.3 any given semester ordo not make satisfactory progress are subject to academic suspension. The Student Handbook contains morespecific information regarding academic probation and dismissal.First-year students may earn a maximum of eight courses through a combination of the following programs:Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board.Students who have passed the CEEB Advanced Placement (AP) examination with ratings of 5, 4 andsometimes 3 may enroll for those higher-level courses for which the department concerned determinesthem to be qualified. Any student who receives a score of 5 or 4 on an examination is granted onecourse credit toward graduation, except for studio art and economics. Students must take bothmicroeconomics and macroeconomics in order to earn a full course credit in economics. In some cases,an additional course credit may be granted upon recommendation of the department concerned and theapproval of the Office of the Registrar. Students with ratings of 3 may receive credit at the discretion ofthe department concerned. The full AP Policy is available at the Registrar's web site: Advanced Creditand Placement.1.College-level Courses Taken While a High School Student.If the student is attending classes on a college or university campus with students who have alreadymatriculated and the course is taught by a regular college or university faculty member, DePauw willallow credit if the student receives a grade of C or higher and provided that subsequent testing atDePauw, when appropriate, indicates satisfactory learning.2.Unassigned, elective credit will be awarded for courses taken in a high school dual enrollment or earlycollege program. To receive such credit the courses must be at a level equivalent to DePauw coursesand the student must earn at least a B in the course. To receive assigned credit (i.e., credit that isassigned to a particular department and counts toward a major or minor) the student must meet with theappropriate department chair or program director who will review the course content and the student’sperformance in it.Departmental Placement Examinations.Students may qualify for admission to higher-level courses on the basis of departmental placementexaminations given on campus during the orientation period. Departments have establishedexaminations to evaluate the competence and preparation of new students in their respective fields andwill assign them to courses on the basis of the examinations. In some cases credit for lower levelcourses will be awarded when the student completes the higher level course.3.International Baccalaureate.(IB) credit may be awarded for subjects taken at the higher level upon departmental review andrecommendation. A student normally receives at least one course credit for each higher-levelexamination with a score of 5, 6 or 7, subject to departmental approval. Students may receive onecourse credit for higher-level examinations with a score of 4 following further departmentalexamination. Advanced credit or exemption from requirements is also available through regularUniversity placement and testing.4.International Advanced Placement ProgramsCredit for British A-Levels, French Baccalaureate, German Abitur and other international advancedstudy program is awarded based on individual review. In general, students may earn up to two coursecredits (8 semester hours) for each A-Level subject passed with a grade of C or better.5.DePauw University is committed to excellence in its academic programs. To assess and improve its academicprograms, the University obtains periodic measurements of student perceptions and intellectual growth.Participation in assessment activities is expected of all students. The information obtained through theseassessment procedures is used solely to improve the quality of the educational experience at DePauw.The University awards degrees in December and May. Commencement exercises are held only in May,however.Students who are within two courses and/or a Winter Term of meeting all graduation requirements mayparticipate in commencement exercises. The diploma will be awarded in either December or May followingsuccessful completion of the required course work.Students whose financial obligations are not settled before commencement are ineligible to receive theirdiplomas. See Student Financial Obligations.Eligibility is based on the completion of at least three courses with a 3.5 semester GPA or better with noincomplete or failing grades. Once Incomplete grades are completed, eligibility is reevaluated.Instructors schedule all but the final examination in their courses. No hour examinations may be given thelast five class days of the semester except for laboratory portions of final exams. Only assignments thatsubstitute for a final exam should be given a due date during finals week. In addition, assignments for papersand projects due in the last five days of class should be provided well in advance.Final ExaminationsAn examination period is provided at the end of each semester for instructors to give such examinations asthey deem proper to cover the course work. Normally, a final examination should not exceed three hours.Final examinations are not to be given at any time other than that announced in the official schedule,although the laboratory portion of final examinations in science courses may be given in a regularlyscheduled lab period in the last week of classes. The Vice President for Academic Affairs must approve anyrequest to move an exam time for a whole class. Instructors may allow individual students with unusualcircumstances (such as a death or serious illness in the family, postseason athletic events, or having threeexams in one day) to take an examination at another time. Problems involving transportation, familyoccasions, and/or jobs, for example, are not sufficient grounds for changing an examination. No student maybe excused from taking the final examination in any course in which an examination is a requirement forcredit in the course.Multiple Exams PolicyNo student may be required to take more than two in-class final exams on the same day. Any student withthree final exams in one day is responsible for trying to reach a solution by talking with the professorsinvolved at least two weeks before the beginning of the final exam period. If none of the professors involvedvoluntarily agrees to give the student his/her exam on another day, the professor whose exam is scheduledsecond in the day will offer an alternative date for the exam. The student should obtain a final exam changerequest form from the registrar's office to provide written verification to the professors involved that threefinal exams are actually scheduled and being given on the same day.Graduating seniors who have excellent academic records at DePauw University may earn the baccalaureatedegree with honors, summa cum laude, magna cum laude and cum laude. To be eligible for graduationhonors, students must complete at least 15 courses at DePauw University with the required scholastic averagefor the DePauw work. Approximately 20 percent of graduates in the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) and in theSchool of Music earn Latin honors.

Through experiment and theory physicists seekto explain the interactions of matter and energy in terms of a small number of basic laws. Physics deals witheverything from the very large (e.g. the structure of the universe) to the very small (e.g. atoms, nuclei, quarksand even smaller structures). The devices we depend on in our technological society are based onfundamental principles of physics. Both experimental and theoretical physicists are people who enjoyunderstanding how things work. Studying physics develops excellent critical thinking and problem solvingskills, which are applicable to many careers. Many of our physics graduates continue with graduate school inphysics, astronomy or engineering. Others continue with professional training in medical school or lawschool. However, it is not necessary to pursue more education to have a rewarding career with physics. Anundergraduate physics degree is a spring board to a broad spectrum of career options, including engineering,systems analyst, financial analyst, management, national security, medical research, education andjournalism. Nationally, employment opportunities for physics graduates have been especially good in recentyears. The department offers a major and a minor in Physics. Students planning to major in Physics shouldconsult with a member of the department as early as possible in their college careers. Incoming students whoplan to major in Physics should take "

Majors in Psychology receive training in the scientificapproach as it has been applied to the study of such topics as: brain function, perception, learning,motivation, memory, development, social influence, attitudes, organizational behavior and mental disordersand treatments. Understanding how these topics have been investigated scientifically requires thedevelopment of critical thinking skills, quantitative reasoning skills, and speaking and writing abilitiesnecessary to communicate research knowledge to others, as well as an appreciation for the ethical issuesinvolved in dealing with colleagues, clients and subjects. Although these skills are developed throughout thePsychology curriculum, demonstrated competence in the Statistics and Research Methods courses isessential.

It is intimately related tosuch key aspects of communities as the structure of political power, economic organization, class structures,conceptions of gender, marriage, work and war. In short, religion shapes both the institutional order and thethought and behavior of individuals who inhabit it. The study of religion, therefore, is basic to the liberal artsand helps prepare students for a variety of career paths, including journalism, law, business, education andwork in philanthropic and religious institutions. The department offers a major and a minor in ReligiousStudies; it also offers a bridge major, which involves the combination of work in religion with courses inanother or other fields. Key to the program are courses on the history, scriptures, thought, practices andinstitutions of both Western and Asian religious traditions. Attention is also given to the interaction betweenreligion and society and to the comparative study of religions.Religious StudiesTotal coursesrequiredNineCore courses"

Majors discover thepatterns, rules and logic that undergird criminal justice systems, gender and race relations, sexuality, family,work, law, medicine, religion, and the arts, as well as the cultural variability in these. Majors examinestruggles for power and privilege and the ways in which humans have transformed their own societies andthose of others. Sociology and Anthropology majors also learn how to question received knowledge; thinkcritically and imaginatively; interpret, situate, and evaluate an argument; design and carry out research onhuman behavior, social groups, and societies; formulate, articulate, and support a position; write cogently,persuasively, and with sensitivity to ethical issues; develop an historical and comparative gaze in tacklingcontemporary problems; and act in a world that is complex, global, and multi-faceted. Sociology &Anthropology courses are interactive, combining lecture and discussion. Many majors enhance theirunderstanding of other cultures and societies by studying abroad, e.g., in Australia, China, France, Italy,Mexico, Spain, and South Africa.

ANTH 256A,"nthropology of FoodThis course explores aspects of the cultural uses and symbolic meanings we attach to food and eating.Students explore such questions as: How do we use food? What is changing in our food consumptionpatterns? What is the relationship between food consumption and the environment? What are some of thepolitics and the ethics involved in food consumption? What is the significance of eating out, of "ethnic"restaurants? And how do we analyze the smell and taste of food cross-culturally? Prerequisite "

ANTH 260W,"ars and MilitarismThis seminar is on wars and militarism and how these effect and shape human lives. We discuss whether ornot wars and the concomitant militarization of human societies are inevitable aspects of our existence. Dowars and militarism reflect primordial human biological and psychological instincts and are thereforeinevitable features of human existence? Or can these be traced to certain social, political, and economiccontingencies and processes? Can wars be conceptualized only in terms of armed conflicts between nation-states or do wars encompass much more than is usually accepted or understood? This course is intended toblur several boundaries: normative understandings of wars and peace; differences between legitimate andunjust wars; and wars waged by nation-states and by insurgent and terrorist groups. Through aninterdisciplinary lens that brings together insights from anthropology, security-studies, cultural-studies,feminist theory, political-science and history, we will define, identify, and understand the different kinds ofwars that are being fought in contemporary times. The focus of the course will be to highlight the livedexperience of wars and militarism, the strategies of survival that people employ in sometimes extremelyadverse situations; the underlying assumptions of wars and militarism that are reflected in social institutionsseemingly little connected to them; and most importantly, the power differences that underpin and drivecontemporary wars.Distribution AreaPrerequisitesCreditsSocial Sciences1 course"

ANTH 351H,"uman Nature and AnthropologyHuman diversity has always been the central subject matter of anthropology. Cultural diversity is so great thatmost introductory cultural anthropology courses seem to lead to the conclusion that there is simply no suchthing as human nature. However, biological anthropology shows that all humans are members of a singlespecies and have more commonalities than differences. This course explores how biological as well ascultural evidence may give us new insights into what makes us all human.Distribution AreaPrerequisitesCredits1 course"
ANTH 355A,"nthropology of DevelopmentDevelopment is often considered synonymous with progress and economic growth. This course seeks tochallenge the framework within which development policies and practices have been conceptualized sincethe 1940s. How do discourses and practices of development reflect struggles over power, history, andculture? Why has development often been understood as a "neocolonial" endeavor that seeks to maintain theglobal hegemony of the first world over the third world? How has the trajectory of development shifted in thepast five decades to encompass divergent agendas, practices, and meanings? How have these "macro"agendas shaped the lives of millions of men and women living across the globe? Can development beunderstood as a monolithic category or is it experienced differently by men and women cross-culturally? Thiscourse will also highlight some of the most pressing concerns over the merits and limitations of globalizationthereby engaging students with ongoing social, political and economic debates. Using anthropologicalinsights, we will explore the connections between colonialism, development, capitalism, and globalization toanalyze how "development" is embedded in social inequities, and whether or not a more equitable form ofdevelopment can be envisioned.Distribution AreaPrerequisitesCredits1 course"

The School ofMusic offers several degree options so students can tailor their educations to match their levels of interest andfuture plans. All students receive careful and close advising from faculty members in order to choose theprogram that best suits their needs.Students are admitted to the School of Music by audition.The following degree options are available to students interested in majoring in music:Bachelor of Music (B.M.)PerformancePerformance with a Second MajorPerformance with an Emphasis in BusinessFive-year Bachelor of Music/Bachelor of Arts Double Degree Program (B.M./B.A)Bachelor of Music Education (B.M.E.)Choral/General Music EmphasisInstrumental/General Music EmphasisBachelor of Musical Arts (B.M.A.)General Music EmphasisEmphasis in BusinessSecond MajorBachelor of Arts (B.A.), with a major in Music (through the College of Liberal Arts)The following options are available to students interested in minoring in music:School of Music studentsMinor in Instrumental Jazz StudiesCollege of Liberal Arts studentsMinor in Applied MusicMinor in Instrumental Jazz StudiesDetailed degree requirement worksheets for all majors within the School of Music can be foundat http://www.depauw.edu/music/currentstudents/advisingworksheets/Bachelor of Music in PerformanceThe Bachelor of Music degree (B.M.) is ideal for the student who wishes to pursue music as a career. TheB.M. is the most common professional degree in music and the most music-intensive of all options, withapproximately two-thirds of all coursework in music and one-third in other liberal arts courses. Individualand ensemble performance standards are high for all majors. Students choosing the B.M. generally practiceseveral hours daily on a primary instrument, in addition to carrying a normal class load. With carefulplanning, students in the B.M. degree program may also complete a second major in a liberal arts disciplineor an emphasis in business.Students are admitted to the B.M. degree program by meeting all academic prerequisites and the successfulcompletion of a qualifying performance examination at the end of the sophomore year. For additionalinformation on the Sophomore Proficiency Examination, visit the School of Music Handbook. Performancemajors complete a half recital in the junior year and a full recital in the senior year. Students pursuing theB.M. degree satisfy the senior capstone requirement by successfully completing the senior recital jury andthe subsequent presentation of a senior recital that is 60 minutes in length.Five-year Bachelor of Music/Bachelor of Arts Double Degree Program: Students who wish to completethe professional study in music required for the Bachelor of Music degree as well as the full liberal artscurriculum required for the Bachelor of Arts degree in a discipline outside of music have that option. Theprogram requires five years of study. Unlike the B.M. and B.M.A. degrees with a second liberal arts major,the double degree program requires that students fulfill all College of Liberal Arts degree requirements,including the distribution area requirements and the competency requirements, as well as complete work in aCollege of Liberal Arts major. A minimum cumulative liberal arts GPA of 2.8 and a minimum cumulativemusic GPA of 2.8 are required. Completing the requirements for both degrees will require 34.5-40 coursecredits. Students in the double degree program are expected to take lessons and participate in ensembles eachof their five years in the program.Bachelor of Music EducationThe Bachelor of Music Education degree (B.M.E.) is designed for students who wish to become certifiedmusic teachers. The program meets requirements for P-12 teaching certification in Indiana and reciprocalstates. The curriculum for the B.M.E. degree involves approximately one-half of the coursework in music(performance and musicianship studies) and approximately one- half in liberal arts courses and professionaleducation courses. Two majors are available: an instrumental/general music emphasis and achoral/general music emphasis.All students who wish to complete the B.M.E. degree must be admitted to the Music Teacher EducationProgram, preferably by the end of the sophomore year. Please confer with the music education faculty aboutrequirements for admission and certification. (A GPA of 2.5 is required to be admitted to this program.)Students pursuing the B.M.E. degree, must successfully complete 14-weeks of full-time teaching experiencein an approved music department of a school district. Students are under the supervision of a cooperatingteacher and, at least, one University supervisor. In conjunction with student teaching, students enroll in themusic education senior seminar, which stresses a professional examination of principles of classroommanagement, legal rights and responsibilities, certification, accountability, and current issues in education. Students participate in a final exhibition that involves a formal presentation of personal growth andcompetence via the electronic portfolio process.Bachelor of Musical ArtsThe Bachelor of Musical Arts degree (B.M.A.) is an interdisciplinary music degree which requires students todevelop a secondary area of emphasis outside of music. Students personally design these interdisciplinaryliberal arts components through a process of individual advising with faculty members. The programculminates in a capstone experience relating studies in music to the secondary area of emphasis. As with theB.M. degree, students complete a rigorous core curriculum in theory, musicianship, music history andliterature.Three majors are available. For the general music emphasis, students individually design aninterdisciplinary liberal arts component. The second major curriculum combines the general music emphasiswith another major in a liberal arts discipline. (A minimum GPA of 2.8 is required to complete the secondmajor.) For the emphasis in business, the liberal arts curriculum combines core and career-related electivecourses.The B.M.A. degree provides an education that is more general than the B.M. degree while still emphasizingmusic. This degree differs from the B.A. degree in that it generally requires more music theory and historyclasses. The B.M.A. effectively prepares students for graduate study in music.Students pursuing the interdisciplinary B.M.A. degree fulfill the capstone requirement by satisfactorilycompleting "

The Bonner Scholars Program is a four-year scholarship designed to provide access to education andopportunity to serve. Involved students work and learn in Greencastle and throughout Putnam County.Twenty new students are awarded the Bonner Scholarship each year with approximately 80 Bonner Scholarsin the program.Students selected for the Bonner Scholars Program must demonstrate financial need as well as commitmentto service through participation in community service activities or services to their family (i.e. caring foryounger siblings or other relatives).Bonner Scholars are expected to maintain a good academic and social standing at DePauw and participate ineducational and enrichment activities planned in conjunction with their direct service. First-year students alsotake a service-learning seminar during their first Winter Term on campus.Students are involved in community service for an average of 10 hours per week during the school year.Bonner Scholars choose from a variety of service opportunities in the local community, partnering withschools, social service agencies, and government organizations.During two summers, Bonner Scholars work in full-time internships with non-profit organizations. Thisopportunity allows students to further explore community issues. Students may select sites locally, nationallyor internationally.Bonner Scholars receive book and travel stipends at the start of each semester as well as monthly stipendsthroughout the academic year. Additional financial support is provided for summer service. Upon graduation,students are eligible for loan remission based on the successful completion of their service. DePauw’s BonnerScholars Program is one of 24 nationally and is endowed by The Corella and Bertram F. Bonner Foundationin Princeton, N.J.The Information Technology Associates Program (ITAP) offers students the opportunity to learn and use thelatest information technologies during all four years at DePauw. ITAP blends the traditional liberal artseducation with cutting-edge experiential learning in an academic environment. From a variety of majors,students participating in the program are interested in learning more about emerging technologies. They bringunique perspectives to leadership roles within a community of learners developing keen critical thinking,problem solving, and communication skills.First-year ITAP students spend an average of 8 to 10 hours a week learning about the latest technologicaladvancements as paid interns. They begin the program with 4 six-week rotations, developing theirprofessional skills and technology knowledge under the guidance of DePauw's award-winning faculty andstaff.After the first year, students participate in on-campus internships working closely with faculty, staff and ITprofessionals. Interns receive training, real-world experience, and close mentoring in areas of their choice. DePauw offers a dual degree program in cooperation with other institutions in engineering. Typically,students spend three years at DePauw and then transfer to cooperating colleges and universities. Studentsreceive their Bachelor of Arts degree from DePauw after completing the professional program or aftersatisfactorily completing the first year of the professional program if that program leads to a graduate degree.General Requirements for the Dual Professional Degree ProgramDuring the first three years at DePauw, students select pre-professional courses and complete therequirements listed below. Because of the variation in admission requirements among the professionalschools, students should study the entrance requirements of the professional school they plan to attend andconfer with their faculty advisors before selecting pre-professional courses.Interested students should apply for these programs as early as possible and no later than the second semesterof the sophomore year.Candidates wishing to receive the Bachelor of Arts degree from DePauw University are expected to continueand complete the professional course of study immediately after leaving DePauw.To obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree from DePauw University under the pre-professional program, studentscomplete the following:At least 23 courses applicable toward the B.A. degree. A minimum of 15 courses, including six of thelast eight courses preceding entrance into the professional school, must be earned in residence atDePauw University. The minimum number of courses must include:a. Major: for interdisciplinary majors (e.g., pre-engineering) 10-12 courses in at    least two disciplines with at least four courses in each of two disciplines. For    single-subject majors, a minimum of six courses with at least two at the 300-    400 level.b. At least 10 courses outside the subjects involved in the major.c. Prescribed courses required by the professional school.1.These additional graduation requirements must be met prior to leaving DePauw:Cumulative GPA of 2.0GPA in the major of 2.0First-year seminarDistribution requirements fulfilledTwo Winter Term projectsSuccessful completion of W course (writing competency)Successful completion of Q course (quantitative competency)Successful completion of S course (speaking competency)2.Pre-EngineeringDePauw has formal agreements with two engineering schools—Columbia University and WashingtonUniversity (St. Louis). These agreements enable students to earn both the B.A. from DePauw and the B.S. inengineering after a five-year course of study. Normally, this includes three years at DePauw and two years atthe engineering school. However, due to the intensive character of engineering education, some students insome fields may require two and one-half to three years beyond the DePauw phase.Other options, including the 4-2 program leading to either a bachelor's or a master's degree in engineering,are available. Prospects for transfer to other engineering schools with which DePauw does not have a formalagreement should be discussed with the pre-engineering advisor.The pre-engineering student should plan four or four and one-half courses each semester, and never less thanthree and one-half. This course load allows for the fullest benefit of science electives and as insurance againstschedule conflicts or need for a course withdrawal.In addition to DePauw's requirements, students must satisfy the requirements of the chosen engineeringschool. All students must complete a course in differential equations, one year of physics, one course incomputer science, one course in chemistry and a two-course concentration outside the sciences, mathematicsand economics. Additional science course requirements vary with the chosen engineering field. The standardminimum GPA for transfer to one of the two engineering colleges is 3.25/4.0.Health ProfessionsReligious Service ProfessionsLawGenerally, DePauw recommends students complete four years at DePauw to gain a background appropriate toundertaking professional study and obtaining admission to nationally recognized graduate universities.Health ProfessionsSchools in the various health professions (including medical, dental and veterinary schools) are interested instudents who have acquired a broad background in the arts, humanities and social sciences, as well as in thebiological and physical sciences. Students may fulfill the prerequisites for most health professions programswhile majoring in almost any academic area. Those majoring outside the natural sciences have as good anacceptance rate into programs as those majoring in the sciences. More important than the type of major ishow well students do in academic programs they have chosen. Since competition for admission to healthprofessions is keen, students should build an academic program that provides alternatives to the healthprofessions.Programs differ widely in their expectations of applicants. It is essential that students interested in the healthprofessions plan their course work carefully, with the assistance of faculty and health science advisors, andthat they check the specific requirements of the programs and schools in which they are interested. Suchinformation can be obtained from health science advisors, the Health Sciences website, Civic, Global andProfessional Opportunities, and the Web sites of schools and professional organizations.Besides providing evidence of intellectual ability and academic achievement, students must demonstrate thatthey have the character, interest and aptitude for a career in a health profession. Graduate programs in thehealth professions expect that students have some practical experience in the field. This may come from workor volunteer experience, observation of health professionals at work, or internships. Students are stronglyurged to take advantage of the Winter Terms and summers, as well as their opportunities to do volunteerservice during the academic year, to obtain such experience.Course Work for Doctoral Health ProfessionsAllopathic medicine (M.D.), optometry (O.D.), dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D), osteopathic medicine (D.O.),podiatric (D.P.M.), pharmacy (Pharm.D.) and veterinary medicine (D.V.M.)Most programs in the doctoral health professions use a qualifying examination for applicants (MCAT, DAT,VMCAT, OAT, GRE, etc.). This examination is often taken during the spring semester of the junior year or inthe summer prior to the senior year. By that time, students need to have completed (or be completing) thecoursework necessary to prepare for the examination. For the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), werecommend the following minimum:Two semesters of introductory biologyOne upper-level biology courseTwo semesters of general chemistryTwo semesters of organic chemistry and/or biochemistryOne year of physicsOne semester of calculusAdditional coursework in the sciences may be desirable, but is not specifically required for the test. The testincludes a verbal reasoning section, so coursework that develops reading and critical thinking ability isstrongly advised.Required coursework for application to programs varies not only by field, but by school. The courses listedabove are part of the prerequisites for most doctoral degree programs in the health sciences. Most require thatscience courses have a lab and be appropriate for the major in that field. Many schools now accept a semesterof biochemistry ("

Department Office:Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Indiana State University, Army ROTC. Website: http://armyrotc.com/edu/rosehulmantech/index.htm. Email: eversoll@rose-hulman.edu.ROTC is a college elective program open to all full-time students at DePauw University through anagreement with the Wabash Battalion at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. It is not a degree program,although it complements any degree program. Upon completion of the course curriculum, students earn acommission as an officer in the Active or Reserve Component of the Army.The ROTC program builds students' leadership expertise, communication skills and self-confidence.Leadership and management skills taught in ROTC are in high demand in the civilian market as well as themilitary. These leadership skills often complement other academic degree programs in order to make astudent more marketable upon graduation. The program includes the Basic Course curriculum for freshmenand sophomores and the Advanced Course curriculum for juniors and seniors. On-campus Basic Coursesfocus on military leadership, basic military concepts, management techniques, and hands-on training in thelaboratory sessions. There is no obligation to serve in the military to take the Basic Courses. The AdvancedCourse concentrates on small team tactical operations as well as advanced techniques of management,leadership training and command operations. The Advanced Courses are offered to cadets who havecontracted to serve in the Army after graduation and are generally closed to others.Qualified students must satisfy certain administrative requirements for enrollment and retention in theAdvanced Course. There are several ways to accelerate the program if a student has missed taking some or allof the Basic Courses:1. ROTC offers the 28 day Leaders Training Course (LTC) for those motivated, qualified students who wishto commit to the program no later than the second semester of their sophomore year. LTC is conducted duringthe summer between their sophomore and junior years. Students may compete for an Army ROTCScholarship for the remaining two years of college at the Leaders Training Course or for other scholarships asthey are available. Students who qualify are selected to attend LTC make a contractual commitment andcontract with Army ROTC. Upon completion of LTC, students earn constructive ROTC credit for theMilitary Science I and II courses and are accelerated into the Advanced Course.2. Qualified students may seek permission to compress the first-year and sophomore classes, allowingcompletion of the basic course in one year.3. Another option for acceleration into the Advanced Course is the Alternate Entry Option (AEO). Studentspursuing this option must be highly motivated and physically fit, possess a 3.0 grade point average, and beapproved by the professor of military science. Contracted junior cadets attend the Leadership Developmentand Assessment Course - Warrior Forge (LDAC) at Fort Lewis, Washington, during the summer prior to thesenior year.4. Another option to enter Army ROTC is by completing sister service ROTC, such as Air Force ROTC, andrequesting a transfer to Army ROTC prior to the beginning of the senior year. Consideration is done on acase-by-case basis and requires approval of the Army ROTC Professor of Military Science.Students who received ROTC training in high school and veterans should conact the ROTC Program officeand university registrar concerning credit for part or all of the ROTC Basic Course. Graduate students whocan commit to two fulltime years of graduate study should contact the Army ROTC Program office for moredetails.Credit received as a result of successfully completing military science courses may count toward degreerequirements as general open electives. Grades received for military science course completion are includedin cumulative grade point ratios.Allowances and Incentives. Military science textbooks and uniforms, when appropriate, are furnished to thestudents without charge. Students enrolled and contracted into the Advanced Course receive a monthlystipend allowance during 2012-2013 school year of $450 each month; senior year cadets receive $500 eachmonth. Cadets in attendance at the LTC and LDAC receive a ROTC-based salary while in training.Scholarships. The Department of the Army annually awards a limited number of four-, three- and two-yearROTC Scholarships to qualified student-athlete student leaders.  Awarded on merit, the scholarship coversthe cost of tuition, books, laboratory fees and related expenses, plus the monthly stipend, which ranges from$300 to $500 each month for up to ten months per year that the scholarship is in effect.Four-year scholarships are open to high school graduates prior to entering Army ROTC as first-year students.Any student enrolled at DePauw University may apply for an on-campus three- or two-year scholarship basedon merit and leadership potential.

Weseek to determine those applicants who are academically capable of success at the University and select thosewho demonstrate the motivation to be actively engaged students and conributing members of the DePauwcommunity. DePauw believes that a diverse student body not only enhances the learning environment, butalso better prepares students to lead in a diverse workforce and society. Accordingly, DePauw admitsqualified students from many environments, cultures and viewpoints whom we believe will contribute andenhance our learning community.Detailed information about the required admission credentials which must be submitted and how to obtainthem is detailed below. The purpose of this introduction is to help applicants and other interested partiesunderstand the intellectual and personal attributes we seek in our students and how we ascertain thosequalities from the application process.There is no precise set of academic and personal credentials that will guarantee admission to DePauwUniversity. In general, successful candidates demonstrate strong academic achievement, intellectual curiosity,the desire to learn from and with others in a collaborative setting, and a lively interest in taking advantage ofthe many campus opportunities for personal and social development. The greatest weight in the admissiondecision is given to evidence of superior academic accomplishment and a passion for learning.The Admission Committee considers each applicant on an individual basis, and each is measured againstimportant academic and personal standards in general as well as in relation to other applicants in a particularyear. Specifically, the Admission Committee will evaluate each student’s academic potential as reflected onthe high school transcript (and college transcripts if applying for transfer admission), and review his/herscores on the SAT I and/or ACT. The transcript is particularly important because it illustrates the rigor of theacademic program as well as the grades earned in each course. It is the Admission Committee’s expectationthat students will take as rigorous an academic program as they can handle and that it should include honors,AP and/or IB courses if offered. Although the Committee does not expect students to excel in all academicareas, we do expect students to challenge themselves and earn excellent grades. Successful candidates shouldtake a minimum of five academic solids per semester, in each of their academic terms, and achieve at the A/Blevel.SAT I and/or ACT scores are another important component of admission consideration. Because no two highschools are the same, standardized test scores help measure knowledge across the broad educationalopportunities students experience in the United States and around the world. Although the single bestpredictor of academic success at DePauw University is the high school transcript, including both coursestaken and grades earned, standardized testing can be helpful in substantiating student achievement.Beyond the applicant’s academic record, the Admission Committee (and the DePauw faculty) is veryinterested in a prospective student’s facility with the written word. Applicants are asked to submit a personalessay. This writing sample is reviewed with interest, and the Admission Committee will evaluate eachapplicant on his/her ability to communicate their thoughts in writing. Both form and content are important.Students should focus on a subject of particular interest to them and write to the best of their ability,remembering that everyone’s work improves with advance preparation and revision.The Admission Committee is also very interested in school and community involvement, as they demonstratethe level of activity a student is likely to pursue at DePauw. Examples of the kind of involvement we oftensee include school clubs and activities, athletics, music performance, community service, religious activitiesand/or part-time employment. There is no preference for one kind of activity over another. Rather, theAdmission Committee looks for evidence that an applicant has made a significant contribution in one or moreareas. In other words, peripheral involvement in a number of activities is not particularly compelling. Weseek students who have substantive roles in a number of activities that hold meaning for them.Admission interviews, although not required, are highly recommended for all applicants. It is an importantway that students can personalize the admission process and breathe life into the information they provide onan application. Interviews may occur on campus during an admission visit; in the student’s home communityin conjunction with an admission staff member’s visit; or over the telephone. Admission interviews atDePauw are evaluative, meaning the staff member is charged with finding out each applicant’s academic andpersonal goals, and exploring with them how or if those goals are well suited to DePauw University. Studentsare asked to respond to questions about their academic preparation and record, school and communityinvolvements and goals for the future. Information gained during these interviews becomes part of thecandidate's application and will be reviewed by the Admission Committee.Recommendations from the applicant’s counselor and teachers are reviewed carefully as well; their insightsinto a student’s high school career are very helpful and provide additional context in which to evaluate acandidate. Applying for AdmissionApplicants to DePauw should demonstrate outstanding academic preparation. A high school diploma is notrequired for admission consideration but students should offer evidence of commensurate preparation. Toensure adequate academic preparation for success we recommend the following pattern of secondary schoolcoursework:four years of English, emphasizing literature and compositionthree to four years of science (two or more laboratory sciences)four years of mathematicsfour years of social sciencea minimum of two (preferably four) years of the same foreign languageApplication ProcessCandidates may complete a fee-waived online application at DePauw's admission website  or an applicationform may be downloaded for your convenience.

Should a student follow the course of study agreed upon with his/heracademic advisor and not be able to graduate within eight consecutive semesters, tuition will be waived forany subsequent course work necessary for graduation provided the student:declares a major by the middle of the sophomore year and persists in that major,completes a full-time course load with grades of C or higher for a total of 31 course credits over eightconsecutive semesters andadheres to the distribution and competence requirements.With appropriate planning, most students can participate in special honors programs, pursue off-campusstudy opportunities and/or earn a minor or even a second major within four years. However, the guaranteeapplies only to the basic degree requirements for programs that require 31 courses. Certain specializedprograms in the School of Music and dual degree programs are exempt.

Under special circumstances students may be awardeda ninth semester of financial aid.
