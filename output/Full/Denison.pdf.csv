As a student's major and vocationalgoals become more clearly deﬁned, it is likely that the student will chooseto change to an advisor more familiar with those developing interests.Students may, with the consent of the new faculty advisor, ofﬁciallyswitch to a new advisor. All changes must be reported to the Registrar'sOfﬁce.The Lisska Center for ScholarlyEngagementThe Lisska Center for Scholarly Engagement is Denison's hub forprograms that promote dialogue and scholarly excellence on campus.Our mission is to (1) mentor and support students, recent alumni,and faculty applying for nationally- and internationally-competitivefellowships and scholarships; (2) coordinate the Summer Scholarsprograms; (3) provide funding for student research and academicenhancement travel; and (4) sponsor an array of multidisciplinaryprograms and events, including Research Tables and the ExperimentalCollege.1. Fellowships AdvisingThe Lisska Center staff assists students and recent alumni applyingfor nationally- and internationally-competitive fellowships at both theundergraduate and graduate levels. Fellowships fund summer programs,study abroad programs, service projects, and postgraduate study andresearch both in the U.S. and abroad.Examples of prestigious fellowships include the Rhodes Scholarship, theMarshall Scholarship, Fulbright awards, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship,the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship in Science and Mathematics, theMorris K. Udall Scholarship in National Environmental Policy, NationalScience Foundation Fellowships, the Boren Scholarship for InternationalStudy, DAAD (German Academic Exchange) grants, and many others.Denison is proud of the many students and alumni who have won suchawards over the years.In collaboration with the Director of Foundation and Corporate Relations,the Lisska Center also works with Denison faculty members interested inapplying for nationally-competitive fellowships and grants.While some fellowship applications require an institutional endorsementand have a minimum GPA requirement, many do not. All interestedstudents are encouraged to schedule an individual appointment and/orattend group information sessions. Comprehensive listings of nationaland international fellowships can be found on the Lisska Center'sMyDenison page (https://my.denison.edu/node/44).The Lisska Center provides intensive one-on-one support tothose applying for any fellowship or grant opportunity.  We helpapplicants identify appropriate opportunities, prepare their applicationmaterials, and write their application essays. We also coach fellowshipcompetition ﬁnalists preparing for interviews.2. Summer Scholar ProgramThe Lisska Center coordinates Denison’s Summer Scholar Program. Eachyear, more than 120 students across all disciplines receive funding tosupport independent research under the close supervision of a facultymember, or full-time collaborative work with faculty members, during thesummer. Summer Scholar projects do not confer credit hours and arenot graded. Summer Scholars receive a stipend ($4,000 for 10 weeksin 2018) and housing allowance allowance and supplemental researchfunds (up to $500 per student). Faculty advisors also receive a stipendper student supervised (three students maximum).The Lisska Center holds information sessions and works closely withthe Student Research Grants Committee (SRGC), which selects therecipients of Young Scholar, Early Experience, and Off-Campus SummerScholar awards. The Lisska Center also works with the coordinators ofthe Anderson Summer Science Program, the Woodyard Scholar awardsin the Department of Religion, the Ashbrook Summer Scholar awards,and the Battelle Summer Scholar awards. Guidelines can be found onthe Lisska Center’s MyDenison page (https://my.denison.edu/node/44).The Lisska Center approves and coordinates the logistics of all SummerScholar stipend payments, housing, and supplemental research grants.These activities include hosting a kick-off luncheon as well as weeklyresearch dinners where Summer Scholars and faculty members shareinformal updates on their projects. The Lisska Center also organizesthe early fall Summer Scholar poster sessions and performances wherestudents present their ﬁnal work.Denison’s Summer Scholar Program permits students to pursueindependent research under the close supervision of a faculty member,or full-time collaborative work with faculty members, during the summer.It gives students in all disciplines a unique undergraduate venue inwhich to experiment with ideas and artistic expression, pursue anintellectual passion, and focus intently on the resolution of a questionover a sustained period of time. Summer Scholar projects do not confercredit hours and are not graded.Denison Course Catalog 2018-2019            9Denison’s endowed funds provide students with a stipend ($4,000 for 10weeks in 2018) and a campus housing allowance. Faculty advisors alsoreceive a stipend of $2,500 for one student, $1,500 for a second student,and $500 for a third student in 2018).Additional funds of up to $500 per student are available for the purchaseof materials required for research if they are not otherwise available, aswell as travel. All students must produce a scholarly project (e.g., ﬁnalposter, paper, performance, or equivalent) and present their summer’swork in a public forum.Qualiﬁed rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in all disciplines areeligible to apply for Summer Scholar awards. A qualiﬁed student is onewho:•will be returning to Denison in the fall and has registered for classes;•will be on an approved off-campus study program in the fall;•is on an approved academic leave;•is on an approved leave of absence and does not have to reapply toreturn.Projects do not necessarily need to be in the discipline of the student’smajor. Interdisciplinary projects may be proposed as well. Any studentwho does not fall into one of the above categories is not eligible.Applications for Summer Scholar awards are typically due at the end ofJanuary. Students are expected to identify their proposal, and secureagreement from their faculty mentor well in advance and to work withtheir mentor in developing their application materials. See below fordetails.Decisions on faculty eligibility to supervise, or share in the supervision,of student summer research shall be made on a case-by-case basis bythe Provost. In most cases, tenure track and non-tenure track faculty whoteach at least 75% of a full-time load, and who have a contract to teachat Denison in the fall semester following the summer research, will beeligible to supervise summer research.Young Scholar awards support students pursuing projects in the socialsciences, humanities, ﬁne arts, and interdisciplinary projects. YoungScholars work under the close guidance of a Denison faculty memberfor projects that typically last 10 weeks between mid-May and the endof July. In 2018 students received a stipend of $4,000 for 10 weeks,plus a room allowance for campus housing. Students may not hold jobsduring the term of their research. Awards will not be made for projectsrequiring a substantial portion of time away from campus, although shortresearch trips may be permitted on a case-by-case basis. (For projectsrequiring more than 1 to 2 weeks away from campus, see the Off-CampusSummer Scholar guidelines below.) Applications for Young Scholarawards are evaluated by the Student Research Grants Committee (SRGC),an elected committee of four faculty members (one from each division ofthe college), overseen by the Lisska Center for Scholarly Engagement.Faculty members are expected to work closely with students as theydevelop their project proposals in the fall and must submit a detailedletter of endorsement supporting each student’s application for a YoungScholar award. Applications, including letters of support, are typicallydue in late January.  Faculty advisors are expected to be on campus(except for short absences) and should meet at least twice weeklywith each student during the project’s 10 weeks. Faculty membersmay not supervise more than three individual or joint proposals.Complete program guidelines can be found on the Lisska Center (https://my.denison.edu/node/44) MyDenison page.The Anderson Summer Science Program provides summer researchassistantships in the sciences. Denison students conduct researchunder the guidance of a Denison science faculty member for projectsthat typically last 10 weeks between mid-May and the end of July.In 2018 students received a stipend of $4,000 for 10 weeks, plus aroom allowance for campus housing. The program guidelines andthe application and selection processes are routinely revised inconsultation with chairs of the science departments. Current informationis maintained on the Anderson Summer Science Program (https://my.denison.edu/node/1032)MyDenison page. For additional information,contact the Anderson Endowment Coordinator.Off-Campus Summer Scholar awards support a limited number ofstudents and faculty conducting a full-time independent research,scholarly, or creative project in any discipline (including the sciences)that requires some or all of the time to be spent off-campus. Projectstypically last 10 weeks between mid-May and the end of July. (Some timemay be spent on campus before and/or after the off-campus portionof the project). A Denison faculty member must be the primary mentor,but a non-Denison mentor may help supervise the project on site, asappropriate. Proposals must specify the role and time commitment ofthe Denison and non-Denison mentors; faculty stipends will be awardedaccordingly. The student stipend and guidelines are the same as foron-campus awards, but also cover travel expenses and provide anallowance for off-campus housing. Applications for Off-Campus SummerScholar awards are evaluated by the SRGC. For complete guidelines, seethe Lisska Center (https://my.denison.edu/node/44) MyDenison page.Early Experience awards provide an opportunity for ambitious risingsophomores to explore interest areas and build relationships with facultymembers that supplement their experiences in the classroom. Qualiﬁedstudents pursue independent research, scholarly, or creative projectsin any discipline (including the sciences) under the close mentorshipof a faculty member for a period of 5 to 6 weeks. The 10-week stipendis prorated based on the number of weeks, and a room allowance isprovided for campus housing. Applications for Early Experience awardsare evaluated by the SRGC. For complete guidelines, see the LisskaCenter (https://my.denison.edu/node/44) MyDenison page.Woodyard Scholar awards provide students with Summer Scholarawards to carry out individual or collaborative projects in the area of“Religion and Civic Responsibility.” Woodyard Scholars will be supervisedby members of the Religion Department for 10 weeks between mid-May and the end of July. (For projects involving other disciplines, otherfaculty members may also be involved). In 2018, the student stipend was$4,000 plus a room allowance for campus housing. For more information,contact the Department of Religion (p. 171).Ashbrook Summer Scholar awards are intended to “foster and promoteresearch and educational cooperation between faculty and students inexploring ways to improve the political and economic betterment of theunderprivileged Licking County person.” The Ashbrook Scholarship isopen to any student who has engaged in community service (broadlydeﬁned as including, but not limited to, DCA involvement, work withAmerica Reads or as a Community Service intern, and service learningcoursework). Scholars work under the guidance of a Denison facultymember as they carry out research and engage in service with anorganization that provides some kind of assistance to the community.In 2018 students received a stipend of $4,000 plus a room allowance forcampus housing. For complete guidelines, see the Lisska Center (https://my.denison.edu/node/44) MyDenison page.10         The Lisska Center for Scholarly EngagementBattelle Memorial Institute awards support Denison studentsparticipating in science research projects throughout the world. Someawards for entire summer support may be given, whereas other awardsmay be for a student’s short stay at a remote location to carry out datacollection. For complete guidelines, see the Lisska Center’s MyDenisonpage. For additional information, contact the Battelle Student ResearchCoordinator.Denison University Research Foundation (DURF) awards supportstudents working as research assistants for Denison faculty membersduring the summer. (Note: research assistants are only consideredSummer Scholars if they are doing a piece of independent work, notjust assisting with the professor’s project). Denison faculty apply forDURF funds to support a Denison student assistant. Any qualiﬁedDenison student is eligible. Faculty may contact the Associate Provostfor Faculty Affairs for more information.Student research may also be supported by outside grants received byfaculty in various departments. Students receiving outside funding toconduct summer research (e.g., McNair Scholars, DAAD-RISE, etc.) mayalso be included as members of the Summer Scholar Program.3. Academic Enhancement The Lisska Center serves as a hub for funding for student research andacademic enhancement travel. Speciﬁcally:•The Course Enhancement Fund provides small amounts of funding tofaculty members wishing to take a class on a ﬁeld trip or other classactivity.•The Student Academic Travel Fund provides up to $500 per studentfor travel to academic conferences to students presenting papers orposters. Requests should be made to the Assistant to the Director ofthe Lisska Center.•The Undergraduate Research Fund provides up to $500 per studentfor students conducting senior research or other research during theacademic year. The SRGC reviews and approves all awards.•The Academic Enhancement Travel Fund supports students travelingindividually or in small groups with a Denison faculty or staff memberto conduct research, attend a conference or workshop (where theyare not presenting a paper), or similar activity not covered by othersources of funding (up to $1,000 per student over their four years incollege).The Lisska Center also administers a number of other Denisonscholarships and awards, including the A. Blair Knapp, K.I. Brown, andAlumnae Endowed Scholarships, the Kenneth Joseph Hines MemorialAward, the Malchow-Weigert Award for Excellence in German, the MeganLisska and Elin Lisska Christiansen Award in the Humanities, and theProvost's Academic Excellence Award.4. Intellectual ProgrammingThe Lisska Center sponsors an array of programs and events designed topromote a culture of intellectual life on campus.Research TablesThe purpose of Denison’s Research Table’s is threefold: (1) to bringtogether faculty members from across the college and other institutionsto explore various aspects of the liberal arts, using practices that sustaina strong academic community; (2) to create a forum for faculty membersfrom different disciplines to learn from one another; and (3) to deepenthe intellectual tone on campus by increasing opportunities for differentdisciplinary perspectives to intersect and new pathways among facultyand students to form.Research Tables should focus on multidisciplinary issues of interest toparticipants who are committed to sustained intellectual explorationwithin the liberal arts. Research Tables may vary in scope, rangingfrom limited undertakings similar to reading groups (e.g., locally basedmembers, one-year time-frame) to more ambitious projects (e.g., one ormore outside faculty members, travel component, up to a three-year time-frame). All Research Tables must culminate in a focused symposiumthat brings other scholars and practitioners to Denison. Research Tablemembers must complete a ﬁnal report summarizing the Research Table’sfocus, activities, and outcomes in terms of student learning and facultyresearch.Students in good academic standing may be invited by faculty sponsorsto participate in a Research Table. Calls for new Research Tables are putout intermittently so that there are no more than four Research Tablesrunning at any given time. Proposals are reviewed by the SRGC.Experimental CollegeThe Experimental College is a program of student-led, non-credit classes.Teaching an Experimental College course gives students an opportunityto design a syllabus, guide classroom discussion, and engage a smallgroup of peers in a topic of intellectual interest.  Students do not receivecourse credit for leading or taking the class.Students interested in teaching an Experimental College course mustsubmit a proposal, including a syllabus, to the Lisska Center for approval.All proposed Experimental College courses must have a designatedfaculty or staff advisor and must be approved by the Director andAssociate Director of the Lisska Center and the Chair(s) of relevantacademic departments. The Lisska Center will provide a certiﬁcate tostudents who attend all course sessions and satisfactorily complete thework for the course. The Center also offers a small amount of ﬁnancialsupport to cover any costs of course preparation, supplies, and possibleﬁeld trips. The Lisska Center will put out calls for a limited number of newExperimental College classes once or twice a year.Faculty EventsThe Lisska Center sponsors the Tuesday Faculty Lunch series, the FridayFaculty Lunches in Curtis, and the Faculty Research Dinners.Other ActivitiesThe Lisska Center hosts Chowder Hours, home-cooked lunches forstudents, faculty, and staff featuring presentations on the scholarship ofan individual or group.The Lisska Center also coordinates the MondayMusings series of informal presentations led by faculty members on theirscholarly interests.Gilpatrick HouseHousing is available for up to ten students who have done intensiveresearch (such as Summer Scholars), or who will be doing independentresearch during the coming academic year.The Lisska Center encourages students at every stage of their academiccareer, from ﬁrst-year students to seniors, to keep in touch with people atthe Center, who will help them ﬁnd and take advantage of research andscholarship opportunities appropriate for each student.Denison Course Catalog 2018-2019            11Special Academic ProjectsStudents have the opportunity to undertake Directed Studies,Independent Studies, and Senior Research. These are explained below.Directed StudyA student in good standing may work intensively in areas of specialinterest under the Directed Study plan. A Directed Study is appropriatewhen a student wants to explore a subject more fully than is possiblein a regular course, or to study a subject not covered in the regularcurriculum. A Directed Study should not normally duplicate a course thatis regularly offered. A student electing a Directed Study must submit tothe Registrar a proposal with appropriate departmental approval no laterthan the ﬁrst Friday of the semester. Directed Studies are normally takenfor 3 or 4 credits. A one-semester Directed Study is limited to a maximumof 4 credit hours. The form required for Directed Studies is available in theOfﬁce of the Registrar.Independent StudyIndependent Study engages a student in the pursuit of clearly deﬁnedgoals. In this effort a student may employ skills and informationdeveloped in previous course experiences or may develop some masteryof new knowledge or skills.A proposal for an Independent Study project must be approved inadvance by the faculty member who agrees to serve as the projectadvisor. The approval must be submitted on the appropriate form to theRegistrar no later than the ﬁrst Friday of the semester.The chief distinction between this and other options for individualstudy is that an individual faculty member works with the studentonly prior to the initiation of the study (or at its very beginning) andat the completion of the study. A student may propose an extensiveindependent project up to the equivalent of a full semester's work. AnIndependent Study project that constitutes a student's total academicload in a given semester may be done either on or off the campus. Anyproposal or combination of proposals to do independent work, carryingmore than four credit hours, must be submitted to the Academic AffairsCouncil. Such proposals would be subject to careful review and only withextenuating circumstances would be considered for approval. Examplesof Independent Studies approved recently include: "An Existential Searchfor Religion," "Genetics of Sarracenia," "Creativity and the New YorkMusician," and "Behavioral Studies of the Primates of the PeruvianAmazon."Senior ResearchStudents may enroll in Senior Research in their ﬁnal year at Denison.Normally, Senior Research requires a major thesis, report or project in thestudent's ﬁeld of concentration and carries eight semester-hours of creditfor the year. Typically, a ﬁnal grade for a year-long Senior Research willnot be assigned until the completion of the year-long Senior Research atthe end of the second semester. In which case, the ﬁrst semester SeniorResearch grade will remain "in progress" (PR) until the completion of thesecond semester Senior Research. Instructors who choose to assign agrade at the completion of the ﬁrst semester Senior Research shouldnotify the Registrar at the beginning of December. Semester hours ofcredit for Senior Research shall not be counted toward the maximumhours allowed in the student's major. Each semester of Senior Researchis limited to a maximum of 4 credit hours. The form required for SeniorResearch is available in the Ofﬁce of the Registrar.Special Academic HonorsThe Dean's ListA student earning a superior academic average is placed on the Dean'sList. Notice of this accomplishment is sent to the student's hometownnewspaper(s).Academic qualiﬁcations for inclusion on the Dean's List require that a 3.7academic average be maintained for the semester, with no D's, F's, U's, I's,X's, or W's, and that a minimum of 12 academic hours be completed for agrade. Students with X-grade notations are not eligible to receive Dean'sList honors, neither contemporaneously nor retroactively.Phi Beta KappaThe Denison University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established in1910. Election to Phi Beta Kappa takes place during the second semesterof the senior year and is based primarily on a record of outstandingacademic achievement. Election is also possible during the secondsemester of the junior year for a student whose academic record is trulyexceptional.Recognition of Senior Research or SeniorCreative ProjectA student who plans to complete a yearlong senior research or seniorcreative project may declare to the major department/program and tothe Registrar the intention to submit a ﬁnal product for Recognition.This declaration must be completed by February 1 of the senior yearand requires the signatures of the Project advisor, a second evaluator,and the chair of the department/program. Departments and programswill determine the guidelines governing the design and execution ofthe project and may establish minimum requirements for students toundertake a project. A Senior Research or Senior Creative Project willbe judged to merit Recognition if both the advisor and second evaluatorgive it a B or above, and at least one of the grades is a B+ or above.(These grades are separate from the grade for the Senior Researchcourse submitted by the advisor.) A Senior Research or Senior CreativeProject that is judged to merit Recognition will receive the followingacknowledgment:1.the student's name, the title of the project, and the name of theproject advisor will be included in the commencement program,2.the title of the project and Recognition will be indicated on thestudent's transcript,3.a copy of the ﬁnal product, in its appropriate form as determined bydepartment or program, will be preserved in the library.Students should consult with the Academic Department for speciﬁcrequirements regarding Recognition of a Senior Research or SeniorCreative Project.Graduation with HonorsA student who meets the general college requirements and the particularrequirements for a Denison degree may graduate with Honors. There arethree levels of Honors.Highest Honors - Summa Cum LaudeThis highest distinction is accorded to students who earn a cumulativegrade-point average of 3.9 or higher.12         RegistrationHigh Honors - Magna Cum LaudeThis second highest distinction is accorded to students who earn acumulative grade-point average of 3.75 or higher.Honors - Cum LaudeThis third distinction is accorded to students who earn a cumulativegrade-point average of 3.60 or higher.Please note: The calculation of a student's GPA for "Latin Honors" isbased on all semesters of academic work at Denison, with a minimum of64 graded hours completed at Denison. Students with X-grade notationsare not eligible to receive Latin Honors, either contemporaneously orretroactively.President's MedalsEach spring at the Academic Awards Convocation, the President awardsmedals to outstanding graduating seniors who have made especiallygood use of their undergraduate education and have contributedsubstantially to the community. The range of accomplishments thePresident seeks to acknowledge and honor are comparable to thoseassociated with the winners of a major national scholarship such as theRhodes or Marshall. The preeminent criterion for receipt of a President'sMedal, Denison's most prestigious award, is academic achievement. Inaddition, candidates must embody some combination of the following:•service to the community,•contribution to the arts,•enlargement of the community's global perspective,•athletic ﬁtness and achievement,•leadership ability and contribution to community discourse.RegistrationRegistration is the formal enrollment in the College. In registering, thestudent subscribes to all the regulations, terms, and conditions, academicand ﬁnancial, as set forth in this Catalog. A student must, therefore,conﬁrm registration during the scheduled registration period eachsemester.Normal RegistrationA normal load is set at 16 semester hours of credit per semester. Thistotal should include the appropriate requirements. The normal academicload enables a student to meet the graduation requirements within eightsemesters. A student who pays regular tuition charges is permitted toaudit, with the approval of the faculty instructor and without additionalcost, one course a semester for which no credit may be claimed. Auditsmay not be allowed by the various departments until after credit seekingstudents have been accommodated.Reduced RegistrationThis classiﬁcation is recommended for a student, who for any reason,cannot carry a normal schedule satisfactorily. If reduced registration isadvisable, a student may be required to carry a schedule of 12 to 14 credithours and be asked to devote an extra semester to fulﬁll the graduationrequirements. Without special permission from the Associate Provost, 12hours shall be minimum registration for any regular student. With specialpermission a regular student may register for 9 to 11 credit hours. Thereduced registration option could have ramiﬁcations for ﬁnancial aideligibility.Excess RegistrationThe payment of tuition for fall or spring semesters of any given academicyear entitles a full-time regular Denison student to 18 credit hours in thatsemester. See the Annual Cost section of Catalog for the fee, billing, andpayment arrangements if taking more than 18 hours in any semester.With extenuating circumstances and evidence of careful planning, astudent may request twice during the Denison career to take up to 20hours and waive the excess hours fee. Any such request should besubmitted to the Registrar's Ofﬁce in writing prior to the beginning of thesemester in question.Partial RegistrationWith the permission of the appropriate Dean, a regular student may takea part-time schedule of eight or fewer academic semester hours of credit.A part-time regular student may pay by the credit hour and must carryeight hours or fewer. Regular students carrying more than eight hoursare counted by the University as full-time students and must pay fulltuition. A full-time student normally carries 15 to 16 hours. For studentson ﬁnancial aid or scholarship, a minimum registration of 12 hours isrequired.Special RegistrationSpecial registration is open to persons living within commuting distanceof the campus, certain foreign students who want to take for credit,or to audit, certain courses of special interest but who are not degreecandidates, and certain graduates who want to take post-graduatework. A special student may not register for more than 8 credit-hours ofacademic work except by permission from the Academic Standing Board.A special student desiring credit must submit appropriate credentials tothe Ofﬁce of Admissions. If, after one semester, a special student hasfailed to maintain a 2.0 average, the special standing can be terminated.Additional CreditWith the consent of the instructor, a student may request to take a coursefor an additional hour of credit. The nature of the additional work that thestudent must do in order to receive the additional credit, and how thatwork will be evaluated, must be clearly outlined in the petition. Usuallyinstructors award one grade, but may choose to assign different gradesto the regular course and the additional project.A student whose petition for additional credit is granted may not dropthat credit after the deadline for dropping courses has passed.Special academic projects (p. 11) including Directed Study andSenior Research are not eligible for additional credit over 4 credit-hours;additional credit over 4-credit hours for Independent Study requires aproposal to be considered by the Academic Affairs Council.Changes in Registration: Adding ofCoursesStudents may add courses or credits to their registration during the ﬁrsttwo weeks (10 class days) of a semester. The student should consult withthe advisor and must have the consent of the instructor and academicadvisor. The appropriate documentation must be ﬁled promptly.Denison Course Catalog 2018-2019            13Changes in Registration: Dropping ofCoursesA drop of a course or credit may be permitted through the end of the ninthweek of classes by submitting to the Ofﬁce of the Registrar a properlycompleted change of registration form. This excludes Denison Seminars,Private Music Lessons/Ensembles, which have an add/drop date at theend of the second week of classes. Please note that excess hour feesand applied music lesson or other course fees are not refunded after thefourth week in the case of a student withdrawing for any reason froma course or from the University. Change of registration after the stateddeadlines requires action of the Academic Standing Board. The decisionof the Academic Standing Board is ﬁnal.Late RegistrationStudents failing to register by the deadline date prescribed in Universitypublications and/or failing to respond properly to University ofﬁcial'snotices regarding the problem shall be withdrawn from all preregisteredcourses. Such withdrawal carries with it ﬁnancial forfeitures of 50 percentof all fees due. Appeal of this action shall be to the Academic StandingBoard and, with a resulting decision of reinstatement, normally carriesa minimum penalty of $50 and other disciplinary sanctions as deemedappropriate.Academic PoliciesStatement of Petition PolicyOn the advice of the Registrar, students may petition the AcademicStanding Board for exceptions to rules concerning academic policiesand procedures. However, the Board will consider only those petitionssubmitted sufﬁciently far in advance so that, if denied, the petitioner willstill have time to remedy the deﬁciency by suitable re-scheduling or otherappropriate action.Attendance PolicyA hallmark of a Denison education is the small, interactive, andparticipatory classroom, situated on a residential campus. Therefore, it isessential that students be present on campus and be active participantsin their courses. Attendance policies are designed to promote thesuccess and well-being of the individual students as well as thecommunity of learners in each class and each co-curricular undertaking.For oneself and one’s peers, attendance and presence on campus arevital to the Denison education.It is expected that all students will attend and participate in regularlyscheduled classes. If a class is missed, for any reason, the student isresponsible for determining what occurred in the missed class. Absencefrom a class will not be accepted as an excuse for not knowing classmaterial. Students are responsible for all information, discussion, andconceptual analysis that takes place during classes.Attendance policy is set by the instructor. It is the responsibility of theinstructor to establish1.a policy on class attendance,2.any criteria for excused absences when attendance is required, and3.a policy for makeup of missed work.The latter is particularly important because class absence is a loss ofopportunity for learning. It is vitally important that each faculty memberreview these points in class early in the semester. The course syllabus isthe contractual agreement between instructor and student. It is importantthat the instructor outline clearly the expectations and all other factorsthat determine grades and penalties.It is the student's responsibility to provide any needed documentationfor class absences, including medical excuses. At the student's request,Whisler Health Center will issue a dated documentation of visit in theevent of a situation requiring class absence.Each semester, students must be on campus and attend the ﬁrst meetingof their registered classes. If circumstances prevent a student fromarriving on campus for the ﬁrst day of classes, the student must notifythe Dean of Students. Students who miss class for an extended periodof time during a semester because of personal, medical, or psychologicalreasons must also notify the Dean of Students. Without prior notiﬁcationand approval for these types of absences, the student may be withdrawnor be required to take a leave of absence by the Dean of Students inconsultation with the Associate Provost and relevant campus ofﬁces andindividuals (including faculty).Denison's orientation programs are designed to welcome and introducenew students to our campus resources, community, and culture. Allstudents attending Denison for their ﬁrst semester (new First-YearStudents and Transfer Students) are required to attend Denison'smandatory orientation programs. Failure to attend and/or complete therequired orientation activities may result in a student being withdrawn orhaving their offer of admission revoked.Absence PolicyStudents at Denison University are expected to give the highest priority totheir academic commitments. However, sometimes conflicts arise amongvarious academic pursuits. At these times, students, faculty, staff, andadministrators all share the responsibility of recognizing, minimizing, andresolving these conflicts.Legitimate Conflicts: Courses and activities that earn academic credit atDenison may place legitimate demands on a student’s time outside ofthe regularly scheduled meeting times for that course or activity. Thismay give rise to potential conflicts to regularly scheduled classroom/lab hours. Such activities might include, but not be limited to, course-related ﬁeld trips, ﬁne arts performances (but not rehearsals), and varsitysports contests (both regular season and all post-season contests, butnot scrimmages or practices).When the demands of one course or credit-bearing activity impinge uponanother, the student and the faculty or staff members are encouragedto work together to achieve a reasonable accommodation that resolvesthe conflict without sacriﬁcing the academic integrity and rigor of thecourse or activity. Moreover, all parties (students, faculty, staff, andadministrators) have the following speciﬁc responsibilities when dealingwith legitimate conflicts.Scheduling responsibilities of all faculty, staff, and students:a) to conﬁne course instruction and examinations to the time slots forthe course, following the course grid and ﬁnal examination assignedtimes, unless speciﬁc exception has been granted for the course by theProvost’s Ofﬁce;b) to indicate clearly on the course syllabus the policies and expectationsfor class attendance, assignments, and examinations, and, if attendanceat a supplemental event (such as a lecture, ﬁeld trip, or performance)14         Academic Policiesis expected and that event occurs at a time outside of the regularlyscheduled meeting times, to inform students of the event as soon aspossible;c) to provide students alternative means of meeting the requirements ofthe course when attendance at a supplemental event for that course isscheduled for a time outside of the course’s regularly scheduled meetingtimes;d) to avoid scheduling any supplemental events in the Monday-Friday4:30- 6:30 p.m. time period;e) if a scheduling conflict arises (that is, if a student is asked to attenda supplemental event, an athletic competition, or a similar universityactivity at a time in which they are required to attend another class).i. the student should inform both faculty or staff membersimmediately and seek a mutually agreed upon resolution;ii. the faculty members should work with the student to resolvelegitimate conflicts without sacriﬁcing the academic integrity andrigor of the course;iii. faculty and staff members should provide an alternative wayfor students to meet course requirements or the expectations ofcreditbearing activities;iv. in situations when the student, faculty, and/or staff membercannot reach an acceptable resolution to the conflict, the AssociateProvost for Academic Affairs will be asked to provide consultationto all parties.Academic IntegrityEvery Denison student is expected to know and uphold Universitystandards in matters of academic honesty. Students who practiceacademic dishonesty assault their own integrity as well as that of theUniversity. Behavior that is in direct violation of these standards isdiscussed in the student handbook. Each Denison student is expectedto be familiar with this policy. Please note that violations may resultin suspension or expulsion from the University.  Denison's Code ofAcademic Integrity (https://denison.edu/academics/curriculum/integrity) is the foundation of the university's commitment to and policiesregarding Academic Integrity.Student ClassiﬁcationClassiﬁcation of students is determined by the amount of academiccredit earned.•First-Year Standing - A student is classiﬁed as a ﬁrst-year student ifhours earned are fewer than 26 semester-hours of credit.•Sophomore Standing - A student must have earned 26 semesterhours of credit.•Junior Standing - A student must have earned 60 semester hours ofcredit.•Senior Standing - A student must have earned 90 semester hours ofcredit.Eligibility RuleA regularly enrolled student registered on a full-time basis (normally 12semester-hours or more) and in good academic standing shall be eligibleto participate in all college and intercollegiate activities. The studentwhose scholastic record falls below a 2.0 average will not be permitted toparticipate in intercollegiate athletics. First-year students are eligible toparticipate in intercollegiate athletics during their ﬁrst semester.Credit Earned by Advanced PlacementTestingFirst-Year Students and Transfer Students who score a 4 or 5 on a CollegeEntrance Examination Board (CEEB) Advanced Placement Examination(AP) will usually receive academic credit for their scores. Should resultsbe presented in academic disciplines or areas that are not part of theDenison curriculum, credit will be subject to departmental review andcredit hours may or may not be assigned. Two other kinds of advancedplacement testing can be considered for credit. A student presenting "A"marks on the British System "A" Level Examination or a score of 6 or 7 onan International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level Subject Exam may askthe appropriate Denison department for advanced placement credits. Ina few instances positive results from advanced placement examinationscan be applied toward general education or major/minor credits butdepartments reserve the right of review and the ﬁnal determination ofhow such credits count.Recognition of Credit Earned Elsewhere /Transfer CreditDenison accepts transfer credit for courses that are either equivalentto a course in the Denison catalog or at a level deemed appropriateby the department or program (hereafter called "the Department") inwhich credit is being sought. Requests to have transfer credit fulﬁll amajor, minor, or concentration requirement are subject to approval by theDepartment. The initial determination of the satisfaction of a competencyrequirement, including Power and Justice (P), Quantitative Reasoning(Q), Oral Communication (R), and Writing Competency (W), will be madeby the academic department closest to the discipline in which thetransferred course was taught. Appeals to the initial determination maybe directed to the General Education Competency Committee for the P, Q,and R requirements, and to the Writing Committee for the W requirement.Denison will not normally accept credits earned in disciplines other thanthose in the Denison curriculum. Transfer credit will be honored onlyif taken at an accredited college or university and only if the studentsubmits an ofﬁcial transcript of credit within 180 days of the coursecompletion. Students considering off-campus work for Denison credit(especially summer school work) must confer with the Registrar, theiracademic advisor, and the chairperson of the Department (or a designate)prior to enrolling elsewhere. The University has no obligation to awardtransfer credit for course work that was not approved in advance. Thecourses must be completed with grades of "C" or better in order to beconsidered for transfer credit. Course work completed in non-traditionalfashions, such as distance learning formats, web-based formats, PostSecondary Enrollment Option, including college courses for whichhigh school credit was also granted, CLEP and other college creditbearing instruments, may be subject to review by the Registrar and theDepartment.Grades Earned Elsewhere / TransferGradesGrades received at another institution shall not be computed into theDenison quality-point average, or be used to remove Denison quality-pointdeﬁciencies. Denison will not award credit for work below "C" on transferfrom another institution. Students who have received prior approval ofthe Denison Off-Campus Study Ofﬁce will have their grades earned atDenison Course Catalog 2018-2019            15the program site appear on their Denison record. The grades will not beincluded in GPA calculations.Matriculation RequirementTo be a candidate for a Denison degree, a student who enters Denison asa ﬁrst-year student must complete at least 64 credit hours of the required127 at Denison, and a transfer student must complete a minimum of 64semester hours of the required 127 at Denison. Generally, all students,except those enrolled in recognized preprofessional 3-2 programs, mustcomplete the last two semesters in residence at Denison. A course taken"in residence" is deﬁned as any course scheduled by the Denison registrarand taught on the Denison campus, or any course scheduled by theDenison registrar and taught off-campus by a full-time Denison facultymember. This policy prescribes a university-wide minimum residencerequirement; individual departments may have stricter requirements.Exceptions may be made by the Academic Standing Board.Commencement ExercisesCommencement Exercises are held annually at the conclusion ofthe spring term. In order to participate in Commencement Exercises,the student must have completed successfully all requirements forgraduation. No exceptions are granted to this regulation. Studentscompleting graduation requirements in August or December are eligibleand invited to participate in the next May Commencement Exercise.Withdrawal From the CollegeWithdrawal from the University at any time is ofﬁcial only upon writtennotice to the Dean of Students. For more information, see the Dean ofStudents (http://www.denison.edu/campus/dean-of-students) web page.A request to the Registrar for a transcript or failure to participate in roomlottery is not considered withdrawal from the University.A student who withdraws from school without ofﬁcial permission willreceive a grade of F (failure) on his or her permanent record. Petitions forexception must document unusual circumstances, and such petitions aresubmitted to the Academic Standing Board.In addition, a student who ﬁnds it necessary to leave Denison before theclose of the semester must, in order to receive an honorable dismissal,report to the Dean of Students and arrange for an ofﬁcial withdrawal.Students withdrawing completely from school may receive grades of "W,""WP," or "WF" for all enrolled courses. Students receiving permission towithdraw from an individual course after midterm will have the courseentered on the permanent record with a grade of "WF" or "WP." Studentswho withdraw under the condition of medical leave may petition to havethe grade of "WF" or "WP" changed to "W."The college may, when in its judgment, such action is in the best interesteither of the student or of the student body, dismiss or refuse to enroll orre-enroll any student.For further information, please consult Refund or Forfeiture of Tuition,Activity Fee, Student Health Fee and Room and Board, page 303.Privacy PolicyDenison University is committed to protecting the privacy of students'personal information. Denison respects students' right to privacy andrecognizes its obligation to keep information secure and conﬁdential.For more information, see the University Privacy Policy (http://www.denison.edu/forms/university-privacy-policy).Grading System and EvaluationGrading SystemBeginning in 1976, plus and minus grades carry the following weights inthe computation of grade-point averages.Letter GradeGPAA+4.0 for each credit-hourA(Excellent) 4.0 for each credit-hourA-3.7 for each credit-hourB+3.3 for each credit-hourB(Good) 3.0 for each credit-hourB-2.7 for each credit-hourC+2.3 for each credit-hourC(Fair) 2.0 for each credit-hourC-1.7 for each credit-hourD+1.3 for each credit-hourD(Passing) 1.0 for each credit-hourD-.7 for each credit-hourF(Failure) 0 for each credit-hourI(Incomplete)S(Satisfactory) 0 for each credit-hourU(Unsatisfactory) 0 for each credit-hourWD(Withdraw)WF(Withdrawn Failing)WP(Withdrawn Passing)CR(Credit) 0 for each credit-hourNG(No Grade Reported)WV(Waiver of Course or Requirement)PR(Progress) Course in progress(usually the ﬁnal mark isdetermined at conclusion of thecourse sequence)AU(Audit)XPrecedes a grade that was affectedby academic misconduct penaltiesPlus or minus grades given before the fall semester, 1976-77, are notreflected in the grade-point averages.Incomplete GradeAn incomplete grade in a course may be granted only with permissionfrom the Academic Standing Board. The student shall petition the Board,giving the reasons for the desired extension of time. The statementmust be signed by the instructor of the course and the student's advisor.All such requests must be submitted prior to the last day of scheduledclasses for the semester. Should a request for an incomplete grade begranted, completion of the work must be accomplished by the end of thesixth week of the following semester, or any time previous, as prescribedby the instructor.Satisfactory (S/Grade) EvaluationCourses graded on an S/Grade basis result in an S on the transcript if thegrade reported is C or above, and the grade earned if it is C- or below. Thegrade of Satisfactory (S) does not affect the student’s GPA.  Letter grades16         Academic Standingof C- or lower in an S/Grade graded course are included in the student’sgrade point average. Sophomores, juniors and seniors may elect to takeone course per semester on the S/Grade basis.  There is a limit of onecourse per semester which may be taken on the S/Grade basis. Thisoption may not be exercised for courses within a student's major, minor,or concentration ﬁelds, including required cognate courses, and it is notan option for any General Education requirement. Via the appropriateform at the Registrar's ofﬁce, students must request S/Grade grading,or request to switch back from S/Grade grading to a letter grade, by theend of week nine. Neither the instructor’s approval nor the instructor'ssignature is required for a student to opt to take a class S/Grade, nor areinstructors notiﬁed that a student has elected this option.  A few coursesare offered to everyone utilizing a "satisfactory" grading format, and suchcourses are not included in the option described above.Repeating CoursesStudents may repeat courses in order to develop greater mastery of thesubject matter. However, second efforts do not erase original efforts,including failed ﬁrst attempts, and both grades will be included in the GPAcalculations. Should students take and successfully complete a coursetwice, they must be aware that both grades will be included in the GPAcalculations but the credit hours cannot be included twice. You may wishto discuss all potential ramiﬁcations with the Registrar if this scenariois a factor for you. Students who want to re-enroll for a course for whichthey have already received a passing mark must receive permission fromthe chairperson of that department and the instructor of the course inquestion. Repeating a previously passed course may present FinancialAid implications.Academic StandingAcademic Standing, Warning, Suspension,and ReinstatementStudents' academic performance can be negatively impacted by avariety of factors. In order to alert students, their advisors, and otherrelevant parties when academic performance falls below expectationsand students do not hold Academic Good Standing, the university relieson the following designations: Academic Warning, Continued AcademicWarning, Academic Suspension and Reinstatement.Academic Good Standing applies to all students who meet or exceeda cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.00.  Any student with acumulative GPA below 2.00 at any time will be enrolled in the AcademicResource Center’s programming for academic success.Academic Warning occurs when a student's cumulative GPA is below2.00.  Students placed on Academic Warning are expected to raise theircumulative GPA to a 2.00 or better within two semesters; if a studentearns a semester GPA at or below 2.00 while on Academic Warning, thestudent will be placed on Academic Suspension. Any semester GPAbelow 1.00 will automatically result in Academic Suspension, unlessthis occurs in the student’s ﬁnal semester prior to graduation.  Thus,a student may bypass Academic Warning and be placed on AcademicSuspension if the semester GPA is below a 1.00.Continued Academic Warning is designated when a student who is onAcademic Warning is successful in achieving a semester GPA abovea 2.00, but did not raise the cumulative GPA to a 2.00. Students onContinued Academic Warning are expected to achieve or exceed a 2.00cumulative GPA at the conclusion of their next semester.Academic Suspension occurs when a student earns a semester GPAat or below 2.00 while on Academic Warning. A student may also besuspended when the student does not attain a 2.00 cumulative GPA afterbeing on Continued Academic Warning.  Performance of less than 1.00GPA for any semester will result in suspension regardless of the student'scumulative GPA, unless this occurs in the student's ﬁnal semester prior tograduation.Reinstatement occurs when an academically suspended student onceagain becomes eligible for enrollment. Students on Reinstatement willbe given conditions by the Academic Standing Board that must be fullymet during the subsequent semester(s) in order to remain eligible forenrollment. The procedures for seeking Reinstatement are found below in“Eligibility for Reinstatement.”Eligibility for ReinstatementA student on academic suspension who has shown marked improvementover his or her Denison record in work taken at some other accreditedcollege or university, or can present evidence of a maturing nonacademicexperience, may petition the Academic Standing Board for reinstatement.In nearly all cases, a student is expected to demonstrate some degreeof academic improvement by taking course work elsewhere. Thispetition must be submitted to the Ofﬁce of the Registrar by July 1 forfall reinstatement and by November 1 for spring reinstatement. Shouldthe student be reinstated, he or she must meet all the conditions of theAcademic Standing Board or again face suspension.A former student who was in good academic and social standing whenhe or she left the College may be re-admitted to Denison by writing tothe Ofﬁce of Student Development and by repayment of the enrollmentdeposit.  Situation-speciﬁc information regarding reinstatement and re-enrollment (https://denison.edu/academics/registrar/reinstatement-re-enrollment) is available.Library, Information Resources, andInformation Technology ServicesThe Denison University Library, housed in the William Howard DoaneLibrary/Seeley G.

Six of those courses comprise a core curriculumincluding:CodeTitle - Advising Circles,•academic advising,•academic and adjustment counseling, and•the summer orientation programs, among others.The advising relationship is an important place for conversations thatconnect the dots between learning that happens inside and outside theclassroom. Advising Circles provide an opportunity for small groups ofﬁrst-year students to come together with their Academic Advisors to talkabout curricular and co-curricular opportunities and what it means to bea member of the Denison community. Participating in a Circle allows astudent to explore how the Denison community is shaped by a diversityof perspectives and to begin planning for four years of meaningful,educational experiences.Students who have participated in Advising Circles have beenoverwhelmingly positive about their experience  — "I got to knowmy advisor so well, I wish our group had continued meeting weeklythroughout the spring." Ninety percent of students who have takenan Advising Circle would strongly recommend it to entering students.Faculty are equally enthusiastic about their experience — "This is byfar the best I have gotten to know my advisees.

AHVC 263," - World Views: Spatial Imagination in East Asia (4 CreditHours)This course engages the question: ‘How are images used to imagine ourplace in the world?’ Students are invited to study fascinating practicesof spatial image-making in East Asia from the inside out, by exploringthese world-views from the perspective of their makers. You will be askedto pay special attention to how social and economic power structuresinflect these representations: to envision and decode spatial imageryas a site of imagination, control and resistance. Artists and patrons inChina, Japan, and Korea have for centuries produced elaborate maps andlandscape imagery, photographs and ﬁlm to imagine the world in a varietyof ways. This course invites you to approach modern and contemporaryrepresentations of space in East Asia both in theoretically and historicallyinformed ways. In the ﬁrst part of the course, students build a frame ofreference for their analysis of post-war case studies, by reading core textsin spatial theory, and exploring important visual representations of spacefrom pre-modern East Asia. In the second part of the course, studentsapply these theoretical and historical approaches to select cases thatexemplify more recent struggles over space and its imagination in EastAsia.."

Students will also learn how to use several alternative printingtechniques, such as cyanotype, Van Dyke and combinations of traditionaland alternative printing processes. Students will develop a historicalunderstanding of the materials of early photography, as well as use thosesame materials to make work that investigates and critiques questionsof photography and representation. One of the greatest challenges forcontemporary photography is to discover how it wants to position itself inrelation to the reality it mirrors, or reflects on. Questioning of the indexicalnature of the photograph will be encouraged in assignments, criticalreadings, and discussion.Prerequisite(s): "
ARTS 219," - Photo: Writing with Light (4 Credit Hours)This class will be an in depth exploration of light as material, and itsrelationship to photography. Because of photography’s presence in boththe art and commercial world, it has always been a slippery mediumto place deﬁnitively as art, craft, document or commercial enterprise.This is ironic, because never have we been more surrounded by photosand asked to ingest them as signs of truth from topics as diverse asjournalism to images of what a beautiful body should/could look like.During this course, we will try to slow down our visual consumptionby being speciﬁc about the medium that makes the image possible --light. We will begin in the night, travel to day, and then to the indoor andportable lighting kits (strobe, flash, tungsten).Prerequisite(s): "

Placing practice in context,comics history will be explored with the emphasis on contemporarycartoonists and graphic novelists as artists focused on relevantﬁrst person narrative storytelling and comics journalism. Traditionaltechniques of layout, design and storyboarding will be included alongwith drawing and writing exercises. Course projects will extend technicalexercises to address content concerns through in-class workshops,presentations on cartoonists, critiques, ﬁeld trips and a range of shortand long outside projects that will gradually build to more ambitiouscreative comic undertakings by semesters end. No previous studio art ordrawing experience is required."
ARTS 223," - The Ceramic Surface (4 Credit Hours)In this studio course students will explore the numerous options forsurface expression in ceramic art making. One of clay's unique propertiesis the ability to faithfully record impressions in its surface - from theﬁngerprint of a potter to patterned designs stamped into the surface.Today, mark making on clay has caught up with technology, incorporatingdigital processes into the roster of print technique possibilities. Studentswill learn to make their own glazes, effectively use slips, glazes, chinapaints, lustres, print-transfers, photo-decals and alternative ﬁringtechniques.

Thisis achieved in part through an introductory core of three courses thatprepare students for a deep exploration of sub-disciplines and researchmethods through subsequent advanced courses. The core covers themajor concepts of biology, encompassing an exploration of the natural32         Biologyhistory of life on Earth, coupled with the basic skills of acquiring andprocessing information, solving problems, and analyzing data. Ourprogram then allows students the flexibility to explore speciﬁc areas ofbiology in depth through a suite of advanced courses in which they canexpand and apply their knowledge and skills.The major prepares students for careers in science and related ﬁelds,as well as graduate and professional schools (including pre-medical,pre-dental and pre-veterinary studies), while allowing students theflexibility to design the program that best suits their speciﬁc interestsand career goals. In addition, biology majors are offered the opportunityto collaborate with faculty in research and laboratory instruction, topresent exceptional work at professional meetings, and to assist in themaintenance of the 350-acre Biological Reserve and other departmentalfacilities. Information on studies in Pre-Health is provided in the "SpecialPrograms and Opportunities" section of the catalog.Writing is an integral component of science, and as such, the BiologyDepartment understands that the development of writing skills isessential for all students who pursue the study of biology. The goal forour students is that they emerge as strong writers, able to constructcohesive bodies of written work in which they express clear, concise andlogical arguments, supported by empirical evidence and/or informationfrom appropriate sources. A developmental model of writing skills istightly woven into the biology curriculum to achieve this goal. Our majorcore curriculum establishes the foundation of good writing practices.Basic grammatical expression is addressed in  - Experimental Physics (4 Credit Hours)A course in the theory and practice of physical research with emphasison the understanding and use of present-day research instrumentation.May be repeated once for credit.Prerequisite(s):  or consent of chairperson. or Consent of Chairperson."

While theProgram's primary focus is the study of the Black experience in NorthAmerica, fundamental to this enterprise is a recognition of the triangularrelationship between Africa, the Caribbean and the United States.The Program seeks to serve the general needs of the college by providingcourse offerings across the full range of academic divisions. At thesame time, it is designed to meet the specialized interests of studentsthrough an interdisciplinary major and minor. Therefore, many appropriatecourses are found under the rubric of other departments. Black Studiesmajors and minors are encouraged to complete some portion of theirundergraduate education abroad; many off-campus study opportunitiesavailable through Denison are relevant to Black Studies and help majorsand minors gain global perspectives and experiences.Through our courses, we teach students to write using variousdisciplinary frameworks to place Black life, experiences, and cultureat the center of their analyses or to interrogate societal dynamics thatshape, and are shaped, by Black life and culture. To do this, our students'writing might include personal narratives, formal essays, or theoreticaldiscourses. Our aim is to support students in selecting the mode ofwritten expression and developing the tools to utilize those modes ofexpression in ways that reveal, articulate, and analyze Black life andculture and the relevant dynamics of society.The Black Studies curriculum is administered by a faculty committee andthe director of the Center for Black Studies. This committee reviews andapproves the educational plans developed by majors in consultation withthe director of the Center for Black Studies.

First, we seek to promotea level of scientiﬁc literacy and chemical understanding among allstudents taking courses in the department that will contribute to theUniversity’s fundamental mission “to inspire and educate our studentsto become autonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents and activecitizens of a democratic society.” Secondly, we will provide a rigorousand comprehensive program in chemistry and biochemistry suitablefor those students pursuing careers in science and technology. In itscourses the department seeks to progressively develop skills in buildingqualitative and quantitative interpretation of chemical phenomena, inexperimental analysis and design, and in written and oral communicationof scientiﬁc ideas. Graduates of this program, grounded in a well-developed molecular worldview, are expected to explain the behaviorof chemical and biological systems based on physical models. The44         Chemistry and Biochemistrydepartment is also deeply committed to sustaining a vigorous anddiverse range of collaborative student-faculty research. A community ofmutual support among students, faculty, and staff is a vital element inachieving our goals.The Chemistry and Biochemistry curriculum provides courses that aredesigned to enable students, as contributing professionals and engagedcitizens, to deal effectively with a world increasingly dominated by theideas and methods of modern science. Majors are qualiﬁed for immediateemployment in industry. However, many elect to attend graduateschool in chemistry, biochemistry, and related areas, or enter schools ofmedicine, dentistry, or engineering. The department is approved by theCommittee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society tooffer a Certiﬁcate of Professional Training in Chemistry to students whosatisfy certain requirements.Associate Professor Michael M.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.48         ChineseWith a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.FacultyAssociate Professor Christine Armstrong, ChairProfessor Xinda Lian; Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow Cong Li; FulbrightTeaching Assistant Yumei Wu; Academic Administrative Assistant LizBarringer-SmithView faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/chinese/contacts)Additional Points of InterestGeneral Departmental RegulationsStudents who want to fulﬁll the basic requirement in language bycontinuing one begun in secondary school will ﬁnd it advantageousto begin their course work in the ﬁrst year. The Department of ModernLanguages strongly recommends that students complete their languagerequirement by the end of their sophomore year.The Language LabAn important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its27 Macs, zone-free DVD player and document camera. It also has aVIA Connect PRO, which is a wireless collaboration and presentationsolution that makes sharing and presenting easier for all computersin the room. The lab provides support for learning activities outsideand inside the classroom, ranging from grammar drills to researchand collaborative writing projects, as well as discussions of authenticmaterials published on the Internet. The area is designed not only forindividualized instruction but also for group work and small seminars thatuse a variety of digital materials for class discussion.Cultural EnrichmentEach semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.The Foresman LoungeLocated in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denisoncommunity with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions,classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette witha table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It isalso equipped with a wide range of technological devices to enrich ourstudents’ learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screenTV connected to cable; the TV is also connected to a zone-free DVDplayer and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted dataprojector, which connects to a networked Mac computer, the DVD playerand document camera.The Language and Culture ProgramThis exciting residential option gives students the opportunity to honelanguage skills and to participate in special cultural events. Students whochoose this residential option will live in close community with their peerswho share enthusiasm for language and culture study. Extracurricularactivities and programming in the Language House support languageacquisition and permit a closer relationship with professors and languageassistants from the Department of Modern Languages.Although the Department of Modern Languages offers majors in French,German and Spanish, other languages are also offered for the purposeof general education and support of other college programs.

CINE 452," - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)Classical StudiesDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsThe Department of Classical Studies offers courses in the languagesand culture of ancient Greece and Rome. Students are introduced tothe intellectual, social, and cultural achievements of classical antiquitythat are the foundation for the formation and identity of modernwestern society. It is a curriculum that engenders both interdisciplinaryapproaches to knowledge and the development of analytical skills. Themajor and minor in Classical Studies entails an education focusingon the history and culture of classical antiquity. Whether throughcourses focused on classical languages, ancient history, the rhetoric ofpolitics, the logic of philosophy, or the art of poetry, the study of classicalcivilization inculcates a lucidity of expression and a predilection forreason, as it inspires creativity, civic awareness, ethical behavior, andcritical inquiry. The minor in Greek focuses on the language and cultureof ancient Greece from the Mycenaean world of Olympian gods, kingsand heroes, through the cultural and intellectual domination of thedemocracy of ﬁfth century Athens, to the Hellenistic empire and legacyof Alexander the Great. The study of Greek enables students to read theoriginal works that have deﬁned western literature and philosophy, fromthe epics of Homer to the dialogues of Plato. The minor in Latin focuseson the language and culture of ancient Rome from its origins as a smallvillage in central Italy, through its transformation into the capital of aMediterranean and European empire, to its identity as the "eternal city"and center of Christendom.

In the tradition of theliberal arts, we encourage students to take courses from all threeareas of study to appreciate the complexity of communication. It isour commitment to educate autonomous thinkers who use moraldiscernment when addressing the issues of our time through acurriculum that engages students in intersecting media, texts, andinteractions when analyzing meaning-making in any given context.Our curriculum emphasizes cognitive complexity in processes of inquiry,analysis, reflection, writing, and speaking.•At the 100-level, courses introduce topics relevant to the study ofcommunication and ways of thinking about communication in theworld;•200-level courses introduce theoretical perspectives, assistingstudents in formulating and investigating questions appropriate tothe discipline as taught at Denison;•300-level courses explore theory and research that helps studentsutilize the power of communication perspectives and methodologieson topics important to them and to society;•400-level courses engage students in developing proﬁciency inthe study of communication and producing new knowledge that issocially signiﬁcant, ethically informed, and fundamental to cultivatingone's self as a life-long learner.Throughout the curriculum we generate opportunities in many waysfor students to practice what they are learning. Students practice thediscipline through structured opportunities that promote original researchin senior seminars, conference presentations, journal publications,and summer research. In terms of less traditional modes of practicestudents have multiple opportunities to address publics through speakingand writing, ethically engaging with other students from a variety ofbackgrounds and perspectives, using technology as agents rather thanconsumers, and interrogating and rethinking the performance of the self.Insofar as "practicing" the discipline involves mindful awareness andreflection on the processes of communication that continually surroundstudents, the department does this as a matter of course.FacultyAssociate Professor Bill Kirkpatrick, ChairProfessors Suzanne E.

COMM 140," - The Politics of Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours)The terrain of popular culture has historically been a site of contentiousstruggles and debates. For long (as is the case even today) one’s cultural“taste” was a signiﬁcant factor in determining one’s standing in thesocial hierarchy. Debates about “high” vs “low” culture and about whatcultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a communityhave involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us witha lens through which to understand historical social changes. It alsoallows us to appreciate that several contemporary debates (for instanceabout the cultural meaning of Hip Hop or Reality TV) have historicalprecedents that inform and precede them. This introductory course seeksto trace those debates from their origins in middle century Europe totheir culmination into contemporary battles over popular culture. In sodoing it seeks to politicize popular culture and unravel the competingideologies and worldviews embedded within it. We begin by reading someof the prominent theorists of “high” culture and then problematize theirarguments by studying the challenges to them (most stridently posedby the Birmingham school of scholars). We will then use this historicaldebate to inform our understanding of the contemporary world of popularculture in America. In the process we will also learn various ways toanalyze and critique objects of popular culture around us that we oftenunthinkingly consume."
COMM 141," - Why does Music Communicate?

Rather than focusing onquestions of harmonic theory (as a music theory class would do) or thescience of cognition (as a psychology or neuroscience class would do),it explores how musical meaning is rooted in cultural experience. As aCommunication course, it explores how our everyday interactions aroundmusic—our aesthetic arguments, our uses of music to sell productsand ideas, even also our uses of music to police behavior and eventorture others—are deeply tied to social processes of identity, ideology,and power. Class materials and methods will be drawn from sources inmusic, sound studies, cultural studies, rhetoric, media studies, relationalcommunication, and newly emerging sub-, inter-, and trans-disciplinaryﬁelds.Denison Course Catalog 2018-2019            55"

COMM 234," - Media Theory (4 Credit Hours)In this course, we think critically about the political, economic, andcultural dimensions of media forms (e.g. television programs, viralvideos) and practices (e.g. sending text messages, participating in socialmedia networks). In readings, screenings, written assignments, anddiscussions you develop a working knowledge of different intellectualtraditions used to study media. From the very start, the course pushespast simplistic, binary assessments of media consumption as beingeither “good” or “bad.” Instead, we survey the complicated routes throughwhich media forms and practices inform people’s understandings ofthemselves and the world around them. Organized into three units, thecourse aims to provide you with conceptual frames for 1) understandingthe relationship between media and culture, 2) identifying how mediamake claims to represent truth and authenticity, and 3) comprehendingthe role of media in ideological conflict. Throughout the term, you areasked to question many ideas and beliefs that people take for granted:that media are “bad” for children, that some television programmingis “realistic,” or that we could ever exist outside the web of mediatedcommunication that informs our day-to-day lives, even if we wanted todo just that.

COMM 345," - Cultural Globalization and Identity (4 Credit Hours)This course will critically engage with the phenomenon of the globalcirculation of culture. It will seek to understand the consequences ofthe process whereby texts, ideas and images that for long remainedconﬁned to their locations of origin are today increasingly mobile andde-territorialized. Objects of popular culture such as television, cinemaand music, are circulating and being consumed around the world andare helping challenge the traditional markers of human identity suchas nation, culture and language. While they are allowing individuals toimagine alternatives to existing realities they are also engendering abacklash against a perceived imposition of new ideas, values and culture.This course will seek to familiarize students with these ongoing changesand the conflicts over cultural and national identity that it has given riseto. We will begin with arguments that present a totalizing view of thisprocess (the Cultural Imperialism thesis) and then over the course of thesemester complicate and nuance those arguments by introducing agencyand empowerment for the consumers of global culture. We will do thisby closely studying actual case studies (from reality TV in Saudi Arabiaor McDonalds in Japan) in order to understand the stakes involved inthe struggle to deﬁne and "protect" national and cultural identity. At theend of this semester long course students should have gained a deepunderstanding of why the process of global flow of culture is a deeplycontentious and political phenomenon. Understanding these conflictsthrough the lens of identity will help students complicate that term aswell as interrogate their views about their own identity.Prerequisite(s): "

Our missionsupports the development of student artists/scholars who are informedcitizens and responsible agents of positive change in a world where themoving arts are essential. Our goal of exposing students to cutting edgeand experimental dance practices from diverse cultures and with globalperspectives is embedded in our curriculum and ideology. The focus ofour movement practices intentionally centralizes Modern/PostmodernDance and African/African-Diasporan forms, shifting the paradigm ofdance education away from a ballet-centered model. The integration ofembodied practices with scholarly inquiry is integral to our mission.Writing within the Major: Both dance scholars and dance artists cometo better understand their ideas and those of others through writing.We focus our teaching of writing on experiential and conceptual ideasprompted by, and about, the body, to generate precise description andsophisticated analysis. Our aim is to hone students’ observation andreflection skills, and ability to document these intelligently and conciselythrough writing.Student Learning GoalsStudents will be able to:•Broaden perspectives through risk taking, embracing ambiguity, andexposure to a range of choreography and performance.•Synthesize knowledge and generate new, independent and originaltheoretical and creative projects.•Demonstrate multifaceted practical, analytical, and reflexiveunderstanding of languages, history, and the cultural signiﬁcance ofdance's various bodily-kinesthetic forms.•Employ various methods for describing, discerning, analyzing,labeling, and categorizing human movement.•Be proﬁcient movers in a combination of aspects of embodiedmovement practices, at the intermediate level, at a minimum.•Demonstrate a fluency in disciplinary vocabularies both orally andwritten that is evident across coursework and utilized within the bodyof student's senior research.•Use basic 21st century technology including digital equipment andsoftware applications in order to access and document artwork, andto use it appropriately to market or create within those media.68         DanceFaculty and StaffChair and Professor, Sandra Mathern-Smith (MFA)Professor Gill Wright Miller (PhD);  Assistant Professor Ojeya Cruz-Banks (PhD); Visiting Assistant Professor Michael J.Morris (PhD);Visiting Assistant Professor Molly Shanahan (MFA); Resident Musicianand Composer Matthew Dixon (BA); Academic Administrative andProduction Assistant, Beth White (BA)View faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/dance/contacts)Requirements for the Major in Dance (B.A.Degree)36 credits minimum The Bachelor of Arts degree in Dance reflects aphilosophy that integrates principles of theory and practice resultingin the discovery of an original voice. "Movement Practices" coursesengage students in dance technique and performance work, and inlearning and applying physical skills to the creation and reconstructionof African/Diasporan and modern/postmodern dance. "Dance Studies"courses emphasize creating, moving, recording, reading and writing,exposing the fundamental patterns of skilled movement acquisition,generating close textual analysis of speciﬁc movement forms, practicingdance making, and culturally contextualizing the diversity of danceforms. Advanced Studies courses provide opportunities to deepen andintegrate through independent research. In all courses, the boundariesbetween practice and theory are purposefully blurred, indicating ourcommitment to a liberal arts curriculum rather than a conservatorymodel. Denison University works to make study abroad possible forall students. Studying dance abroad allows students to experienceanother culture and way of life through the lens of movement and dancestudies. These opportunities integrate the department’s mission andmake possible a deepening understanding and expansive perspective onmovement in a global context. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study ofﬁce to explore their options.Movement PracticesAll dance majors must take a minimum 12 credits in Movement Practices,combining coursework in any combination.

EAST 452," - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)EconomicsDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsThe purpose of the economics curriculum is to educate students inthe nature and uses of economic reasoning. We are an economicsdepartment that values diverse theoretical and methodologicalperspectives on economic analysis and its application. We are cognizantDenison Course Catalog 2018-2019            79of the importance of the other social and natural sciences, the arts, andthe humanities to a more complete understanding of human society. Ourcurriculum introduces students to a core body of economic knowledgeand to research skills, integrating disciplinary education with the liberalarts mission of the university. Economics majors develop the ability tothink analytically and creatively about complex economic issues andpolicy choices facing our global society.The content of our curriculum is tiered. In introductory courses studentslearn the basic principles of economics. In intermediate courses studentsdevelop their understanding of microeconomic, macroeconomic, andeconometric theory. The 200-level electives give students an opportunityearly in their careers to use introductory theory to better understand theirworld. The 400-level electives give students an opportunity to study indepth, a particular ﬁeld of economics through application of the requisitebasic skills, and appropriate theoretical models and empirical methods.These courses primarily focus on national and international concerns,public policies, and controversies in economic theory and policy.Good economic writing represents good economic thinking. TheEconomics Department encourages students to cultivate the habitsof good economic writing by requiring students to take one electivecourse that satisﬁes the department's writing requirement. Students areexpected to use the vocabulary and theories of economics to correctlymake cogent evidence-based arguments.The Department of Economics supports students who globalize theireducation by completing some portion of their undergraduate educationabroad. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study Ofﬁceto explore their options. If a student studies abroad then: (1) Only oneeconomics course can transfer in to satisfy major requirements. (2)That course must have economics prerequisites. If Economics 101 andEconomics 102 are prerequisites, then the course transfers in as a 200-level elective. If the prerequisite is Economics 301 or Economics 302,then it transfers in as a 400-level elective. (3) The course must be aneconomics course, not a business or similar course. (4) Economics 301,302, and 307 may not be taken abroad.Graduates of the Department of Economics seeking immediateemployment have been successful in securing interesting andchallenging positions in business, government, and non-proﬁtenterprises. The economics curriculum also provides students with theopportunity to prepare themselves for graduate or professional studies ineconomics, business, public administration, international affairs, law andothers.FacultyAssociate Professor Quentin M.

Whatare the differences, in terms of questions of justice, among slave labor,wage labor, and the work of an independent or cooperative partner? Whatis a fair distribution of economic resources? Is economic justice fulﬁlledby: any distribution of income and wealth produced by market processes;an equal distribution of income and wealth; or a partially adjusted marketdistribution? The deﬁnitions of economic justice and fairness are perhapsthe most controversial questions in political economy, and this course isdesigned for you to gain some insight into the contending perspectivesthat economists have advocated. We will examine natural rights theories,the contested meaning of equality of opportunity, and the potential trade-off between economic efﬁciency and the redistribution of income andwealth. We will examine perspectives ranging from libertarian to socialist.Prerequisite(s): "
ECON 202," - Economic Growth and Environmental Sustainability (4 CreditHours)Economic growth is traditionally perceived as the solution to thesocio-economic ills of poverty, unemployment and more generallyunderdevelopment. However, economic growth is also accompaniedby increased pressure on and, over time, deterioration of the naturalenvironment. The objective of this course is to explore the relationshipbetween economic growth and the natural environment. While theconcept of economic growth occupies a central place in economic policy-making, we will discuss whether economic growth is compatible with thesustainable-development worldview adopted by the UN and many otherglobal and local economic actors. Sustainable development emphasizesthe need to embark upon a development path that not only takes intoaccount the environmental, social and economic needs of the presentgeneration, but also those of future ones.Prerequisite(s): ."
ECON 204," - Income Inequality (4 Credit Hours)The substantive goal of this course is to facilitate an understanding ofchanges in the distribution of income in the United States, from 1945to the present. The ﬁrst part of the course studies the measurementand context of American income inequality. We will end the ﬁrst sectionof the course with an analysis of economic mobility in the US. Thesecond section of the course will look at a variety of explanations forincreasing income inequality. We will examine how the key themes oftechnical change, de-industrialization, immigration and globalizationshaped the American economy over the last several decades. The primaryfocus of the ﬁrst two sections will be upon income inequalities arisingfrom changes in the ideological, demographic, macroeconomic andinstitutional context. In addition, we will investigate the impact of thesetrends on the middle class and different segments of the labor force.Finally, we will discuss why inequality might matter and how the trendsdiscussed in the course could shape America’s future and discusswhether and what policy changes might be needed.Prerequisite(s): "

The Educational Studies major is designed for students who wishto prepare for a career in education in elementary or secondary schools,or in the broader community. The curriculum introduces students tolearning theory and the social foundations of education, and it allowsfor experiential learning in the ﬁeld. This study ﬁts well into a broaderliberal arts education and allows time for students to complete amajor in an additional ﬁeld of study, for example, in the discipline oneintends to teach. The Educational Studies major does not lead directlyto licensure; however, faculty in the Department of Education assiststudents in creating individually designed plans for obtaining licensureafter graduation through a range of graduate and other programs.Educational Studies students will have multiple opportunities tocommunicate original thinking through writing, to explore various genres,and to address diverse audiences through course assignments. Studentswill learn how to develop a focused, well-supported essay. Also, theywill acquire the skills to blend written language with other modes tocommunicate a message, and how to navigate various formattingguidelines informing the ﬁeld of education. During their senior year,students will reflect upon a collection of essays they have producedin previous courses through a capstone, portfolio project. The projectinvites them to assess the themes, areas of growth and quality, and towitness their engagement in writing as a process.Educational Studies students are encouraged to consider taking asemester off-campus. This option allows for comparative study ofeducation and often, extended apprenticeships in schools. EducationalStudies students have studied, for instance, in Chile, England, Denmark,Northern Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and The Philadelphia Center.Please contact an Educational Studies faculty member for more details.  The Department plans to launch a collaborative learning initiative withTurku University, Finland in 2019.FacultyProfessor Karen Graves, ChairProfessor Karen Graves; Assistant Professors Emily Nemeth, EstherOhito; Instructor Suzanne Baker; Academic Administrative AssistantBrenda Franks.View faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/educational-studies/contacts)Educational Studies MajorThe Educational Studies major consists of nine courses:CodeTitle.Crosslisting:  or consent of instructor); which in turn entailstaking another 3 courses (Econ 101,.MusicDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsThe music department serves the whole Denison community, offeringcourses and concerts that allow students to develop their artistic,creative, and intellectual potential.

ECON 417," - The Eurozone: Optimal Currency Area or IncompleteMonetary Union? (4 Credit Hours)Before 2010, the Eurozone was hailed as the ﬁrst successful multi-national, large-scale model of monetary and currency union. Severalcountries in many regions of the world (such as South America, theMiddle East, West Africa) have been considering following in the stepsof the European Union (EU) by creating similar currency areas in thenear future. However, the ﬁnancial crisis of the late 2000s followed bythe sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s have challenged the perception ofthe Eurozone has a fully functioning currency area. In this class we willseek to place the creation of the Eurozone in the context of the broaderevolution of the EU as a cosmopolitan project. We will examine the socio-economic theories and political ideologies behind the creation of theEurozone. This will require an understanding of the macroeconomicmodels which underlie the concept of ‘optimal currency area’ and aninvestigation of the degree to which the Eurozone is a fully completedproject. In particular the solutions provided by EU leaders and institutionsto the economic crisis in Greece (and other countries in the Eurozone)will give us a chance to reflect upon the future of the Eurozone and todiscuss the intellectual and practical implications of two alternatives thatmember-states may face as they look towards the future of the EU: 1. thepursuit of further EU integration through the creation of a supranationalﬁscal and political union or 2. the beginning of a process of political andeconomic devolution towards smaller scale European projects.Prerequisite(s): "

These are all questions that political ecology can helpus to answer. Political ecology is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld that situatesenvironmental change within broader networks of political, economic, andsocial relations. It differs from other environmental approaches in thatit views power, material nature, everyday struggles and practices, socialjustice, and discourse to be critical components of human-environmentinteractions. In this course, we will: (a) study the theoretical foundationsof political ecology, (b) evaluate some of the theses it puts forward,and (c) apply political ecology insights to contemporary environmentalissues.

ENVS 240," - Environmental Politics and Decision Making (4 Credit Hours)This course gives students a chance to explore the realm of proactivechange in the environmental arena. It combines the theories of policy, thetools of problem solving, and the practice of dealing with environmentalchallenges in the real world of American government. The premise ofthe course is this: if you want to improve the state of the planet, youhave to propose a solution. To make a solution happen, you shouldunderstand the process of getting an idea through the decision-makingsystem. Effecting change requires a background in the system(s) thatmake things happen, whether you ultimately want to work within thesystem or outside it. This course is divided into two main components:an overview and implementation of problem solving techniques, and anin-depth examination of the U.S. Congress' role in environmental policyformation. The latter section culminates in a "Moot Congress" undertakenby students at the end of the semester. Not recommended for ﬁrst yearstudents.

ENVS 256," - Farmscape: Visual Immersion in the Food System (4 CreditHours)Every human being has an intimate relationship with food, often withdeep emotional facets. Yet we in the U.S. know very little about the foodsystem that sustains us – it is a mysterious and often invisible set ofprocesses, organizations, and people. This remarkably complex web ofinputs, labor, machinery, laws, subsidies, mergers, and so many othercomponents is one that we take largely for granted. This class seeksto align that reality with another: we are an intensely visual species. Acritical part of our existence that we experience through all of our sensesis one we fail to comprehend through our primary sense. And we havethis occasion to use sight in a formalized way – photography – to tellnew stories, and to bring an artistic sensibility to our understanding offood, and perhaps ourselves. Through imagery, writing, and the curatorialprocess of exhibiting our work in a public setting, we have a truly uniqueopportunity. Our immersion in these critical issues can bring full circle theunderstanding we gain through many eyes to enhance awareness in otherpeople about the ways in which our food system connects us all together.Course fulﬁlls the ENVS Humanities/Arts requirement."

You will be askedto pay special attention to how social and economic power structuresinflect these representations: to envision and decode spatial imageryas a site of imagination, control and resistance. Artists and patrons inChina, Japan, and Korea have for centuries produced elaborate maps andlandscape imagery, photographs and ﬁlm to imagine the world in a varietyof ways. This course invites you to approach modern and contemporaryrepresentations of space in East Asia both in theoretically and historicallyinformed ways. In the ﬁrst part of the course, students build a frame ofreference for their analysis of post-war case studies, by reading core textsin spatial theory, and exploring important visual representations of spacefrom pre-modern East Asia.

The central goal of the department is to educate students aboutthe nature and history of the Earth, the processes that shape the Earth,and the impacts those processes have on human populations.An understanding of the Earth is an important component of globalcitizenship. Many critical environmental issues face humanity, includingglobal climate change, water shortages, loss of arable land, naturalhazards such as earthquakes and flooding, and the availability ofpetroleum and other energy resources. Citizens and professionals withtraining in the geosciences will contribute to addressing these and otherproblems, while increasing opportunities for humans to live sustainablyon the Earth.The department provides non-majors with a basic knowledge of theEarth and Earth processes that will serve their needs as future citizensand community leaders. Geoscience majors and minors develop astrong background in the geosciences in preparation for employmentopportunities in ﬁelds such as environmental science, geotechnicalengineering, exploration for natural resources, geologic research,environmental law, and earth science teaching. Many geosciencegraduates continue their training in graduate school; others enter thework force directly.FacultyAssociate Professor Erik W. Klemetti, ChairProfessor David C.

GEOS 451," - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)"
GEOS 452," - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)GermanDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsEducated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in subsequent courses dealing with the culture and society.The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of itscourses because it believes that students can best appreciate a culturefrom within its own mode of expression.With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, political science, and English. Courses in culturalstudies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, also presentmultiple perspectives on other cultures and various areas of intellectualexperience.A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.102         GermanFacultyAssociate Professor Christine Armstrong, ChairProfessor Gary Baker, Associate Professor Gabriele Dillmann; VisitingAssistant Professor Eva Revesz; Academic Administrative Assistant LizBarringer-SmithView faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/german/contacts)German MajorStudents majoring in German must take a minimum of nine coursesbeyond "

Students learn tosee the multiple layers of causes and effects, changes and continuities,individual experiences and broader social dynamics that shape humansocieties and cultures across time and place. History questions not only,what happened, but even more importantly, why did something happenthe way it did? How were different people engaged and impacted? Whatdid this change mean to people in that time and place? What has it meantto people in other times and places? What does it mean to us now, in ourown time and place?History students weave answers to these questions into compellingstories and persuasive arguments. These narratives, when wellconstructed, are moving and beautiful. They prompt thinking aboutthe diversity of human experience, both across the globe and closeto home, and about how peoples’ ideas and cultural practices vary byperiod, region, and social circumstance. With classes focused on theUnited States, Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East,history provides students the opportunity to explore the world broadlyand deeply. Moreover, history allows us to see the world through the eyesof others as we confront human achievement, struggle, and failure andthus provides the tools for empathy, objective thought, and engagedcitizenship.History majors graduate prepared to negotiate a complex, uncertain, andoften changing world landscape, equipped with unique abilities to discernand integrate multiple perspectives as they engage in creative problemsolving.History students can...1.Think Historicallya.Examine people, events, phenomena, and concepts within theirhistorical contextsb.Recognize the complexity of the historical record, valuingconflicting evidence and competing narrativesc.Understand causality and the dynamics of change over timed.Construct informed, nuanced historical narrativese.Articulate the distinctions between history and “the past,” andbetween history and historiography2.Think Criticallya.Analyze complex problems and generate discussion based onevidenceb.Identify, summarize, and respond to the points of view of othersc.Embrace skepticism and ambiguity as part of the process ofdiscoveryd.Practice empathy as a tool of inquiry3.Solve Problemsa.Generate open-ended questionsb.Conduct research—gather, sift, analyze, order, and synthesizeevidencec.Think imaginatively about gaps in the evidentiary recordd.Persevere through uncertainty4.Communicate EffectivelyDenison Course Catalog 2018-2019            111a.Write clearly, concisely, and persuasively, in multiple formats andfor various audiencesb.Speak clearly and persuasively in different forums and for variousaudiencesc.Listen to, absorb, appreciate, and respond to the ideas of others,both in written and oral form5.Think Globally and Locallya.Understand the diversity of human experience across time andspace and draw connections between their studies of differentpeople, times, and placesb.Consider historical problems from the perspectives of differentgroups and different social actorsc.Think critically about how different groups and/or societies haveinteracted over timed.Critically examine the relationships of power and explorequestions of justice, equity, and identity6.Practice Engaged Citizenshipa.Value the study of the past for its contributions to lifelonglearning and for the critical habits of mind it fostersb.Engage the perspectives of people different from ourselves in civiland constructive waysc.Employ all of the above-listed skills to make well informed andthoughtfully articulated contributions to civic discourseFacultyAssociate Professor Lauren Araiza, ChairProfessors Adam J.

INTL 200," - Themes and Approaches in International Studies (requiredfor sophomore International Studies majors)• - Themes and Approachesin International Studies, and  - Themes and Approaches in International Studies (4 CreditHours)The main goals of this course are to introduce sophomore students, whohave completed INTL100, to some of the key themes and theories withinthe purview of International Studies to help them shape their individualconcentrations in the major. The course also provides opportunities forstudents to examine various world problems through an interdisciplinarylens, drawing on both political-economic and sociocultural analyticalframeworks in various disciplines. Finally, students learn the basics ofacademic research and writing processes, i.e., formulating a well-deﬁnedtopic, posing a relevant research question, ﬁnding and interrogatingappropriate sources, justifying the research’s intellectual contributionto a broader scholarly audience and, when applicable, to the efforts tosolve real-world problems, through writing and revising a carefully craftedprose. Among numerous debates and issues that International Studiesscholars grapple with, the course focuses on four broadly conceivedthemes: economic development, nationalism and national identity,transnational migration, and mediated and material culture. After learningmajor scholarly approaches to theorize each of these themes, studentsdevelop individual research project and write a scholarly paper, completewith abstract, introduction, literature review, case study, and conclusion.At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to formulate,broaden, and contextualize their thematic and topical concentrationswithin the interdisciplinary scheme of International Studies, and beequipped with academic research skills to pursue their concentrations inthe major.Prerequisite(s): "

Through these processes, the students are expectedto not only develop strong camaraderie among them as the new INTLmajors, but also formulate comprehensive plans for how they will pursuetheir interests in International Studies during their ﬁnal two years atDenison. This involves charting out their courses in International Studiesfor the next two years-including coursework from off-campus studyprograms that they wish to count towards the International Studiesmajor. By the end of the course, students submit the major proposal, inwhich they synthesize coursework, off-campus study (or an internship),and language training in a way that allows them to develop a coherentarea of expertise within International Studies, and they will share theirgoals and plans with their cohort and a wider International Studiescommunity.

INTL 452," - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)JapaneseDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsEducated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of this opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsDenison Course Catalog 2018-2019            121and pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.FacultyAssociate Professor Christine Armstrong, ChairAssociate Professor Michael Tangeman; Visiting Assistant ProfessorYumiko Tashiro; Academic Administrative Assistant Liz Barringer-SmithView faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/japanese/contacts)Additional Points of InterestGeneral Departmental RegulationsStudents who want to fulﬁll the basic requirement in language bycontinuing one begun in secondary school will ﬁnd it advantageousto begin their course work in the ﬁrst year. The Department of ModernLanguages strongly recommends that students complete their languagerequirement by the end of their sophomore year.The Language LabAn important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27Macs, zone-free DVD player and document camera. It also has a VIAConnect PRO that is a wireless collaboration and presentation solutionthat makes sharing and presenting easier for all computers in the room.The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside theclassroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborativewriting projects, as well as discussions of authenticated materialspublished on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualizedinstruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a varietyof digital materials for class discussion.Cultural EnrichmentEach semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where the Denisoncommunity can ﬁnd information about upcoming events.The Foresman LoungeLocated in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denisoncommunity with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions,classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette with atable and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is alsoequipped with a wide range of technological devices with which to enrichour students’ learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screenTV connected to cable, The TV is also connected to a zone-free DVDplayer and a document camera.

It is founded on thebasic pillars of a Liberal Arts education such as understanding the personas a whole, promoting critical thinking and expanding cultural horizons.Its mission is to provide students a strong historical, social and culturalfoundation for the understanding of speciﬁc components of differingLatin American and Caribbean cultures. Through this approach, we striveto foster critical awareness of the heterogeneity that characterizesthe region as well as a critical understanding of the complexities of itsrelationship with the United States. The curriculum of the Latin Americanand Caribbean studies concentration expresses our commitment todeveloping the person as a whole by allowing students to explore,analyze, discuss, read and write about a variety of themes directly relatedto Latin America, from different theoretical frameworks. This in turnencourages students to reflect upon their own cultural background.FacultyDirector: Monica Ayala-Martínez (Spanish and Portuguese)Christine Armstrong (French), Monica Ayala-Martínez (Spanish andPortuguese), Isabelle Choquet (French), Dosinda García-Alvite (Spanish),Melissa Huerta (Spanish), Francisco López-Martín (Spanish), FrankProctor (History), Charles St-Georges (Spanish), Luis Villanueva(Economics), Micaela Vivero (Art Studio)View faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/latin-american-caribbean-studies/contacts)LACS ConcentrationCore RequirementsStudents in the concentration are required to take (or demonstrate thatthey have taken the equivalent of) the following courses:•Two modern language courses (or the equivalent), beyond thegeneral education requirements in a language spoken in the LatinAmerican and Caribbean area (Portuguese, Dutch, French, Spanish,or an indigenous language).

We will consider how various institutions such asparties, committees, and procedures help legislators reach their goalsand help solve problems such as collective action, voting cycles, andambition. While we begin by looking at Congress at its inception andthe electoral goals of members, the course will quickly move to thedevelopment of these institutions and in the early Twentieth Century(pre-1974) and their use today. Over the course of the semester, we willapply our institutional study of Congress to current events and througha multi-week simulation of the legislative process.

Today, we are moreappreciative of the multiple domestic inputs in foreign policy making,and more sophisticated in the use of analytic tools to facilitate ourunderstanding of the foreign policy formulation process. The class isstructured around four distinct “sources” of US foreign policy formulation:institutional; role; societal; and, individual. While we cover each source indistinct units for purposes of analytic clarity, throughout our study we willobserve that no one decision can be explained fully without some overlapof sources."
POSC 341," - The Conduct of American Foreign Policy. Theother two Track One course requirements may be fulﬁlled by completingany of the Political Science class offerings in the subﬁelds of AmericanPolitics. Students must earn a grade of C or better in each Lugar Programcourse. Completion of all four Lugar Program courses is required beforebeginning the congressional internship. Students may intern in anycongressional ofﬁce during the summer following either their sophomoreor junior year. The Lugar Program will endeavor to place interns in theofﬁce of a member of the House or Senate. Alternatively, students mayopt to participate in an approved off-campus program and intern for anentire semester under the auspices of their Washington program.The Lugar Program will only sponsor students for congressionalinternships who have a record unblemished by serious disciplinary oracademic infractions as reported by the Ofﬁce of Student Developmentand the Provost's Ofﬁce.Track Two has been designed for students with an interest ininternational affairs and foreign policy, especially with an aptitude forthe study of foreign languages and a desire to pursue a career in suchﬁelds as national security, homeland defense, weapons proliferationand foreign affairs. In particular, Track Two provides a foundation forgraduate study at the Graduate School of International Policy Studiesat the Monterey Institute in California, or at similar graduate programsthat also require extensive language training. To complete the TrackTwo program at Denison, students must take two years (four semesters)of coursework in a foreign language. Although French, German, andSpanish are acceptable, students interested in the Monterey option areencouraged to study Arabic, Chinese or Japanese. Some courseworkin a language could be undertaken at Monterey or another institution,most likely during the summer. Students must take four courses selectedfrom the Political Science Department offerings in the subﬁelds ofComparative Politics or International Politics. The minimum grade in eachof these courses and in every semester of foreign language instruction isa C.

Thisconcentration will prepare students to write for a wide readership acrossa variety of media platforms. It is ﬁrmly grounded in the liberal arts,bringing together existing courses in narrative writing and researchmethods, independent semester and/or summer research projects,and real world experiences, including internships and campus writingopportunities. The concentration supplements existing courses inexpository and creative writing to help students from a wide range ofmajors integrate their academic coursework with their extracurricular andwork experiences. It aims to provide the structure and faculty mentorshipthat will help students make those connections in a thoughtful andintentional way.FacultyJack Shuler, ChairRon Abram, Michael Croley, Peter Grandbois, Hollis Grifﬁn, Erik Klemetti,Sangeet Kumar, Jessica Hendry Nelson, Margot Singer, James WeaverView faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/narrative-journalism/contacts)Narrative Journalism ConcentrationCore Course RequirementsRequired courses for the completion of the concentration are:•"

Required for students pursuing the neuroscience concentration.Prerequisite(s): .Off-Campus StudyOverviewLearning through global experiences is integral to a Denison education.We provide individualized mentoring to help students craft their off-campus experience and take advantage of learning opportunities thatfoster global competencies essential in today’s workforce.  With morethan 180 Denison-accepted off-campus study programs to choose from,students have many opportunities to realize the full potential of theireducation, hone a language, develop workplace skills, and maximizemulticultural understanding.In addition to semester, or year-long study abroad, shorter termopportunities are also possible.  Denison Seminars, semester-long creditbearing courses with an off-campus travel component, are another waystudents can develop global competencies. Students can also participatein summer, short-term faculty-led credit bearing seminars.There are many other opportunities for students to apply and extend theiroff-campus learning.  These include independent research, internships,and lectures that connect students to international educators and peersaround the world.  Off-Campus Study works closely with the KnowltonCenter and Lisska Center to share information about the many globallearning opportunities and resources available to Denison students.Planning for Off-Campus Study ProgramThe ﬁrst step in planning for off-campus study is to attend a StudyAbroad 101 session led by student returnees.  Next, students schedulean appointment with an OCS advisor.  Working with OCS and theiracademic advisors, students articulate learning goals for an off-campusstudy experience, explore a range of options among the Denison-accepted programs, and carefully consider the timing of participation andintegration with degree requirements.Denison maintains a list of accepted off-campus programs thatmeet the pedagogical and academic standards associated witha Denison liberal arts education.  The current list can be found at<globaltools.denison.edu>. Students who withdraw from the university toattend a program that is not on Denison’s list of approved programs arenot eligible to receive transfer credit.Proposing Off-Campus StudyStudents normally seek approval for one semester and/or a summerof off-campus study during their Denison career, though approval foran academic year of off-campus study is also possible. (Note thatinstitutional ﬁnancial aid may be applied to a maximum of one semesterof study – see Financing Off-Campus Study.)To pursue off-campus study for academic credit, students must ﬁrstpropose a plan and obtain Denison approval for such study. Onceapproved by OCS, the student is then responsible for completing anapplication with the program provider.  OCS staff assists and advisesstudents with both steps in the process.Eligibility GuidelinesPlease note that eligibility guidelines for Off-Campus Study are reviewedannually and subject to change.Denison approval is granted only if the student is adequately prepared forthe proposed off-campus program.  The Denison evaluation criteria are asfollows:•The proposed off-campus study program represents a well-deﬁnedcontinuation of the curricular and pedagogical goals of a Denisonliberal arts education and the individual student’s academic program.•The student’s academic record demonstrates clear evidence ofcurricular preparation and academic achievement appropriate to theDenison Course Catalog 2018-2019            143proposed off-campus study program and the speciﬁc learning goalsassociated with the student’s proposal.•The student has completed a minimum of forty-eight credits priorto participation on an off-campus program.  Transfer students mustcomplete one year of study at Denison prior to participation on anoff-campus program.  These residency requirements do not apply tosummer study.•The student is enrolled at Denison the semester preceding off-campus study participation.  A student who applies institutional aidto a program must also enroll at Denison the semester following theprogram.  Failure to do so will result in the student charged for theinstitutional aid that was awarded for off-campus study.•The student must be in good academic standing the semesterpreceding participation on a program.  However, Denison alsoreserves the right to withdraw approval if there is a problematic shiftin a student’s academic performance before the start of a program,even if a student is technically in good standing.•A student whose disciplinary probation ends during the ﬁrst twoweeks of classes at Denison for the semester during which she/hewill be studying off-campus is eligible to pursue off-campus study.  Astudent whose disciplinary probation extends beyond that date is noteligible to pursue off-campus study until the following semester. Astudent with two or more adjudicated offenses on her/his disciplinaryrecord is not eligible to pursue off-campus study.  Denison alsoreserves the right to withhold approval for any student who has adocumented history of behavioral issues deemed inappropriate foroff-campus study regardless of the number of adjudicated offenseson her/his disciplinary record.•A student whose proposal is evaluated and approved while she/he ison disciplinary probation must address two special requirements.  Insuch cases, the student is required to provide a statement addressedto the program provider that explains the nature of the infractionand how it should bear on the provider’s admission deliberations. The student must also grant the program provider access to theinformation contained in the Denison disciplinary records. If a studentreceives conditional approval and an additional disciplinary offenseis adjudicated before participation on the off-campus study program,the approval will be withdrawn.Balancing ParticipationDenison strives to accommodate the off-campus study proposals of allqualiﬁed students.  There are, however, two related points that impactthis policy. First, Off-Campus Study establishes limits on the number ofparticipants in some programs in order to facilitate optimal integrationinto the range of experiential learning contexts and communities. Second,to facilitate the sustainable management of Denison's on-campushousing resources, slots for off-campus study in the fall semesterare awarded on a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served basis based on the date ofthe student’s required OCS appointment and the completion of therequired forms for Step One of the OCS Proposal Process. There are fourexceptions to this policy:•the student is proposing a program that is only offered during the fallsemester;•the student will be studying abroad during the senior year;•the student has a conflict with a speciﬁc course offering in her/hismajor program, as documented by the Academic Planning Form andconﬁrmed by the appropriate department chair;•the student is on the team roster for a spring semester sport, asconﬁrmed by the appropriate coach.If studying off-campus in the fall semester is not covered by one ofthese exceptions, the student should schedule the required advisingappointment to start the OCS Proposal process in April or at the verybeginning of fall semester, and then work diligently to complete theplanning meetings and forms required for that appointment.Financing Off-Campus StudyTo determine whether a given program is affordable, students shouldmake certain to consider out-of-pocket expenses as well as the invoicedprogram fees. A comprehensive cost estimate for any given program onthe Denison accepted list is available from the program provider.To promote off-campus study, Denison does not require students topay its tuition or room/board fees during their term off-campus. Anadministrative fee of $280 for a summer program, $895 for a semesterprogram, and $995 for an academic year of study with a single programor provider is charged to cover the administrative support associated withoff-campus study.  It is important to note that institutional aid, except for the GreatOpportunity (GO) program, and the OCS Grant program do not apply tosummer study.  In general, there are fewer ﬁnancial aid resources forsummer study, so students with ﬁnancial need are urged to considersemester study whenever possible.Denison students may pursue one semester of off-campus study withinstitutional aid eligibility if they submit their Free Application for FederalStudent Aid (FAFSA) by March 1 and provide the required veriﬁcationof tax data to the Denison Financial Aid Ofﬁce by April 1. EstimatedFinancial Aid Awards are made available to students by May 15 (for fallstudy), and June 15 (for spring study). While Denison does not provideinstitutional merit-based aid for off-campus study, institutional need-based aid is available for eligible students.A student’s eligibility is based on the estimated cost of participationfor the proposed off-campus study program and the estimated familycontribution from the FAFSA. Federal grants, State grants, and Federalloans, as well as any other external sources of aid, are the initial sourcesfor meeting ﬁnancial need for eligible students. If a student’s need is notfully met by those funding sources, Denison grant funding is available toassist in meeting a portion of remaining need. For students with unmetneed after the Denison ﬁnancial packaging process, OCS works withprogram providers to award additional grants to help bridge this gap.Academic Regulations for Off-CampusStudyDenison requires that students participate fully and responsibly in allacademic aspects of the proposed off-campus study program, includingrequired language and area studies courses.  Failure to do so will resultin a grade of U (Unsatisfactory) for the off-campus study placeholdercourse listed on the Denison academic record for the term abroad.Students are enrolled for a holding place registration of 12 credits foreach term of off-campus study in order to report full-time study to theFederal Clearinghouse to facilitate the portability of ﬁnancial aid and/144         Off-Campus Studyor to use of 529 college funds.  Students are therefore required to enrollfor at least 12 transferable U.S. semester credits for each semester ofoff-campus study, but may choose to enroll for up to 20 U.S. semestercredits per semester.  Students are limited to one course on an S/U gradebase per semester. The arrangements for such a choice must be madewith the program provider at the time of ﬁnal registration.To receive transfer credit for an off-campus study experience, studentsmust work with the Registrar’s Ofﬁce and academic advisors to obtainpre-approval for their courses through the OCS course approval process. The University is under no obligation to transfer coursework or applytransferred coursework toward speciﬁc degree requirements unless thatcoursework has been approved in advance.Students wishing to apply a course toward a major, minor, orconcentration requirements must receive approval directly from therelevant department/program.  Other coursework will be evaluated for itsrelevance to the Denison curriculum through the combined efforts of theRegistrar, OCS, and, as necessary, speciﬁc departments/programs.All courses reported on the program provider’s transcript are postedto the Denison academic record with course titles, credits, and grades. This includes any course for which a student receives a failing grade,even though credit will not be awarded. While the grades for off-campusstudy coursework are not factored into the Denison cumulative gradepoint average, it is important to note that they could be factored intoa composite grade point average should a student pursue graduate orprofessional school after graduating from Denison.Disciplinary PolicyRecognizing the role of students as ambassadors of Denison, thespecial privilege of participating in off-campus programs, and the levelof maturity required for students to be successful negotiating thechallenges and potential risks associated with study away, the Ofﬁceof Off-Campus Study routinely consults with the Ofﬁce of CommunityValues and Conflict Resolution to assess students’ disciplinary historyas part of the approval process for off-campus study. Frequency, severity,community impact of violations, and student’s disciplinary status(e.g., Disciplinary Probation) are the disciplinary variables that mayimpact eligibility. Students on disciplinary probation or suspension arenot eligible to participate in off-campus study during the semester ofprobation or suspension. Students must be on campus and cleared ofany disciplinary sanctions during the semester prior to study away.Violations that occur after a student has been approved for study abroad,but before their departure for off-campus study may also influence astudent’s eligibility to participate. Denison reserves the right to withholdor rescind approval for any student based on their disciplinary history orviolations, regardless of the number of incidents on the student’s record.The program provider may request information from the student abouttheir disciplinary record as part of the admission process.  In these cases,the student will be asked to sign a waiver allowing Denison to providethis information to the program. If you have concerns about how yourdisciplinary history may affect your eligibility for study away, pleaseconvey these during the advising process in the ofﬁce of Off-CampusStudy.Educational Enrichment Leave of AbsenceStudents may apply for an Educational Enrichment Leave of Absence(EEL) to pursue experiential learning opportunities that are not creditbearing or structured educational opportunities whose coursework is notapplicable to a Denison Baccalaureate degree.  Examples of structurededucational opportunities whose coursework is not applicable include theNational Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), Outward Bound, Semesterat Sea, specialized technical or training programs, religious education, orculinary institutes.Students wishing to pursue an EEL are required to meet with and anadvisor in OCS, as well as their academic advisor, and then to submit awritten rationale to OCS.  The rationale must articulate a clear connectionbetween the student’s broader educational goals and the proposedenrichment program. A student may opt to pursue study at a localinstitution as an adjunct activity as part of an EEL.  However, thiscoursework may not exceed eight credits and must be approved inadvance through the normal transfer credit evaluation process. Thewritten rationale should address the plan to obtain credit elsewhere.During an EEL, the student retains her/his Denison enrollment depositand information systems privileges. However, the student is consideredwithdrawn from Denison during her/his period of leave for the purposesof ﬁnancial aid and loan deferment.  EEL’s are usually for one semester,but may extend to an academic year. See the Student Handbook forspeciﬁc details regarding the processes for registration, housing, andﬁnancial aid following a leave. If a student does not enroll at Denisonfollowing the EEL, the leave reverts to a Withdrawal and the enrollmentdeposit is forfeited.Health Insurance CoverageDenison carries EIIA Insurance for all members of our community. Students participating on an international off-campus program arecovered for emergency medical, evacuation, and repatriation insuranceaccording to the stipulations of our policies (available upon request).  Forongoing and chronic problems or standard (non-emergency) health care,students should rely on their domestic health insurance coverage. Manyprogram providers include the purchase of either regular or emergencycoverage in the program fee, but it is important to make certain thatthis is the case and, if so, that it is adequate to a student’s particularhealthcare needs.   Denison also recommends that at least one parent/guardian obtain a passport so that travel will not be unduly delayed in thecase of a student medical or personal emergency abroad.Health Advisories, Travel Advisories, andTravel WarningsDenison strongly recommends that all students avail themselves ofthe travel information available at the U.S. State Department (http://travel.state.gov/), Centers for Disease Control (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/), and World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/en/)web sites.  In particular, students should carefully consider the safetyinformation included in State Department travel advisories for thecountry(ies) in which they are pursuing off-campus study and/or forany other country to which they are planning to travel during their timeabroad.Denison reserves the right to withdraw its approval for study on an off-campus program if a State Department travel warning or a CDC or WHOtravel advisory is in place for the program location at the start of theprogram. Withdrawal of approval for an off-campus study program bars astudent from receiving Denison credit for the program and from applyingﬁnancial aid to the program costs. To make certain that a student maymake an informed decision regarding participation on a program, theissue of potential loss of Denison approval for an accepted program willDenison Course Catalog 2018-2019            145be brought to the student’s attention as far in advance of the programstart date as is feasible.In the case of a State Department travel warning or a CDC or WHO traveladvisory arising after a program has started, Denison will work closelywith the educational partner and other informed parties to determinean appropriate course of action.  In the case of requiring that a studentreturn home, Denison will pursue reasonable steps with the programprovider to mitigate the ﬁnancial and academic impact of such an action.StaffKaty Crossley-Frolick, DirectorSandy Spence, Assistant DirectorAndrea Lourie, Off-Campus Study AdvisorCourtney Johnson Fowler, Program AssistantAnn Caldwell, Academic Administrative AssistantView faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/study-abroad/contacts)Organizational StudiesProgram Guidelines and GoalsThe Organizational Studies program is multidisciplinary in intentand grounded in the liberal arts. Developing a theoretical base fororganizational participation and leadership requires moving beyonda single area of specialization. Through a multidisciplinary approach,students will begin to develop;1.an understanding of the human condition as it is experienced inorganizational life;2.an understanding of the complex nature of systems and institutions,and;3.the capacity for analysis that moves beyond simplistic solutions toexplore the interplay of values, responsibility, and the achievement ofsocial goals.The goals of this theoretical base are to be supplemented by, andintegrally related to, both a signiﬁcant internship experience in anappropriate organization and the mastering of speciﬁc skills not availablein the regular curriculum.FacultyAssociate Professor of Psychology David P.

Studentshave the following options:i.An integrative directed study (or)ii.A senior research/honors project in the major that integrates theprogram into a new research project (or)iii.An elective course approved by the director.Additional Points of InterestSummer SessionThe premise guiding this four-week session is that organizationsneed persons capable of examining problems with a critical andimaginative eye and of responding in an ever-changing environmentwith policies, actions, and decisions derived from a broad knowledgebase. A major strength of Denison's liberal arts program is that it fostersthe development of this broad knowledge base, as well as critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. The summer seminar focuseson the application of those skills in organizations. Working primarilywith Denison alumni/ae, students are introduced to the language andfundamental principles of organizational management, decision-making,marketing, ﬁnance, and accounting. Equipped with this information,students serve as consultants for local nonproﬁt and commercialenterprises, taking on the tasks of researching and analyzing problems,formulating solutions, and presenting ﬁndings to clients. In addition,students travel to cities such as New York, Chicago, and Washingtonto learn ﬁrst-hand the nature of operations in advertising agencies,investment banks, manufacturing plants, and other organizations.Internship and Integrative PaperThe internship should take place during the months following thesummer session. The internship will become the venue where courseworkand the summer seminar are brought into play. The completion of theinternship shall result in a major, integrative paper.PhilosophyDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsTo do philosophy is to encounter some of the most fundamentalquestions that can be asked about human existence. Philosophicalinvestigation leads students to recognize the potentially unnoticedassumptions that underpin even our most ordinary ways of interactingwith other persons and engaging in human projects. Such assumptionsconcern, for example, the nature of human knowledge, action, and value.Philosophy challenges students to move beyond uncritical patterns ofthought, to recognize problems, and to exchange a more naive worldviewfor a more considered and justiﬁable one. In doing so, students learnto think in ways that are simultaneously disciplined and imaginative.Philosophy Department faculty members cooperatively approach theseconcerns from diverse perspectives, both in studying the works of majorphilosophers and in their own creative activity. Students are encouragedto join with the faculty in this inquiry and to philosophize creatively ontheir own. The courses and seminars in the Department are intended todevelop the abilities necessary for these activities.Typically students without previous experience with philosophy will enrollin "
PHIL 101," - Introduction to Philosophy,  - Introduction to Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)This course aims to introduce the student to the nature and concernsof philosophy by confronting fundamental issues in areas ofphilosophy such as ethics, political and social philosophy, metaphysics,epistemology and others. It is intended that the student develop skills inrigorous thinking and become involved in the process of philosophizing."
PHIL 121," - Ethics: PhilosophicalConsiderations of Morality or  - Ethics: Philosophical Considerations of Morality (4 CreditHours)This course explores the fundamental questions of ethical theory, askinghow ethical judgments can be made, what justiﬁcations they may receive,whether terms like "right" and "wrong" have ﬁxed meanings, whethermoral assertions can claim universal validity or whether morality israther relative to a culture or to an individual's beliefs. Depending on thesemester, issues of applied ethics - having to do with abortion, medicalethics, business and professional ethics, ethics and the environment, warand peace, etc. - will be raised as well."

This journal is edited and produced byphilosophy majors and minors in consultation with a faculty advisor.Episteme encourages and receives submissions from undergraduatephilosophy students throughout the country and internationally. Inaddition, philosophy students organize Philosophy Coffees, informaldiscussions of philosophical topics, about three times each semester.Special coffees are held annually for parents during Big Red Weekend,and during the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Celebration.Courses - Modern Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)Thinkers such as Rene Descartes, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant arecurrently referred to so often, in so many different contexts, that theirnames have been transformed into immediately recognizable adjectives(Cartesian, Humean, Kantian). But what did these philosophers actuallybelieve? And why did they believe it? This course is an intermediate-levelsurvey of western philosophy from their period (now known as the “EarlyModern” or “Modern” era, which runs roughly from 1600-1800). Whilethese and other thinkers (such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley)in this era dealt with a wide variety of subjects, we will focus mostlyon their contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophyof mind. We will address their writings with three different aims: a) toappreciate the sense in which they were, at one time, fresh and radical;b) to understand how, for better or for worse, they set the foundation formuch of the modern—western, anyway—worldview; and c) to determine ifwhat they say is either true or false.Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent. and one other Philosophy course or consent. and one other course in Philosophy or consent.150         Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE), and one other Philosophy course,and junior/senior standing, or consent."

PHIL 298," - Existentialism (4 Credit Hours)Existentialism asks how we can generate a meaning for our lives withoutappealing to outside sources. Many existentialists embrace a viewcharacterized with the slogan “existence precedes essence.” This sloganmeans that any attempt to ﬁgure out what one is must begin with thefact that one is. In addition, if existence precedes essence, then theremay well be a multiplicity of ways that one can be, making choosingbetween these ways a difﬁcult task. That one’s existence may well beexperienced as constrained by social forces seemingly beyond one’scontrol complicates matters. We will read from a variety of sources,including philosophical sources such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre,de Beauvoir, or Judith Butler as well as literary or biographical sources,e.g., Beckett, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, and others.Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, or consent."

PHIL 305," - Metaphysics (4 Credit Hours)This course is an introduction to the methodology of and various issueswithin metaphysics. Typically, these questions address certain generalfeatures about the nature of reality. Many of these are ontological,concerning whether certain kinds of entities exist—e.g., numbers, holes,ﬁctional characters, gods, and possibilities. Other metaphysical questionsconcern the nature and interrelations among entities and various featuresof the world. Among the familiar metaphysical issues are debatesregarding the nature of human beings, the reality of space and time,the limits of thought and possibility, and the connection between truthand existence. Readings will be drawn from a mix of contemporary andclassical sources.Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy or consent."
PHIL 306," - Theories of Knowledge (4 Credit Hours)An inquiry into the meaning, possibility, conditions, criteria, and typesof truth and/or knowledge, and a discussion of representative theoriesof knowledge. The class aims to achieve clarity in respect to bothclassical and contemporary approaches to the problem of knowledge.The adequacy of those approaches will be assessed.Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy or consent."
PHIL 321," - Metaethics (4 Credit Hours)We spend much of our time trying to answer such questions as: Howought we to act? What should we value? and What type of person shouldwe be? But, it seems right that we can evaluate our answers to thesequestions and decide among them only if we correctly answer anotherset of questions ﬁrst. For instance, how can we know what we shouldvalue unless we understand what values are, whether they exist andwhether we can know them if they do? How can we know how we oughtto act if we do not know what it means for an act to be morally goodor why we are even obligated to do what is morally good in the ﬁrstplace? This course pursues answers to this other set of questions. Itinquires into the nature of ethical statements, properties, judgments andattitudes. As such, it draws on many other areas of philosophy, includingepistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language.Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy or consent."
PHIL 326," - Theories of Justice (4 Credit Hours)This course focuses on contemporary work in political philosophyconcerned with justice, including that of philosophers such as Rawls,Dworkin, Nozick, Young, MacIntyre, Sandel, Nussbaum, and Habermas.We will examine questions such as: What is justice? Can it be deﬁnedindependently of consideration of what the "good" is for human beings?Is justice possible in a society marked by signiﬁcant religious, ethnic,cultural or other sorts of pluralisms? What is the relation betweenjustice and nationhood, and what can be said about justice betweennations? How is justice connected to social equality, and to liberty?What is meant by economic justice? What is the relation between justiceand democracy? The course will examine contemporary philosophicaldebates about these questions, in order to help students think criticallyabout the issue of justice in the context of the pressing real world issuesin which such questions play a crucial role.Prerequisite(s): "
PHIL 330," - Nineteenth-Century Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)This course examines some of the most important developments inEuropean philosophy during the nineteenth century. Figures to be readmay include Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Mill,Frege, and others.Prerequisite(s): "
PHIL 333," - History of Analytic Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)This course is an introduction to the methods and the history of theanalytic tradition. This tradition can be distinguished in a number ofways. Methodologically, it tends to employ careful argumentationand formal tools like logic and mathematics to provide analyses ofscientiﬁc, psychological, and linguistic data. Historically, it is usuallytraced back to a group of Anglo-European philosophers—Frege, Russell,Moore, and Wittgenstein—writing around the beginning of the twentiethcentury. Thematically, it is primarily driven by the ambition of providinga systematic account of the relationship between language, thought,and the world. This course explores early and recent contributions of theanalytic tradition to epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language,philosophy of science, and ethics.Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy or consent."
PHIL 334," - History of Continental Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)This course traces the development of Continental Philosophy from 1900to the present, including the phenomenological movement of Husserl,Heidegger, Sartre, and others; the neo-Marxism of the Frankfurt Schooland Habermas; the hermeneutics of Gadamer and Ricoeur; and the post-structuralism of Foucault, Derrida, and others.Prerequisite(s): "

Senior seminars will vary in topic butall emphasize skills in research and writing that will provide a capstoneexperience in the major.PortugueseDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsEducated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroad,with programs approved by Denison, should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.FacultyAssociate Professor Christine Armstrong, ChairAssociate Professor Mónica Ayala-Martínez; Academic AdministrativeAssistant, Liz Barringer-SmithView faculty proﬁles and contact information (https://denison.edu/academics/portuguese/contacts)Additional Points of InterestGeneral Departmental RegulationsStudents who want to fulﬁll the basic requirement in language bycontinuing one begun in secondary school will ﬁnd it advantageousto begin their course work in the ﬁrst year. The Department of ModernLanguages strongly recommends that students complete their languagerequirement by the end of their sophomore year.The Language LabAn important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27Macs, zone-free DVD player and document camera. It also has a VIAConnect PRO, which is a wireless collaboration and presentation solutionthat makes sharing and presenting easier for all computers in the room.The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside theclassroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborativewriting projects, as well as discussions of authenticated materialspublished on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualizedinstruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a varietyof digital materials for class discussion.Cultural EnrichmentEach semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The DepartmentDenison Course Catalog 2018-2019            161maintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.The Foresman LoungeLocated in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denisoncommunity with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions,classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette with atable and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is alsoequipped with a wide range of technological devices with which to enrichour students’ learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screenTV connected to cable. The TV is also connected to a zone-free DVDplayer and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted dataprojector that connects to a networked Mac computer, the DVD playerand document camera.Although the Department of Modern Languages offers majors in French,German and Spanish, it also offers courses in other languages for thepurpose of general education and support of other college programs.Courses in Portuguese are listed below.The Language and Culture ProgramThis exciting residential option gives students the opportunity tohone their language skills and to participate in special cultural events.Students who choose this residential option will live in a smallcommunity of their peers who share their enthusiasm for languages andcultures. Extracurricular activities and programming in the LanguageHouse support language acquisition and permit a closer relationshipwith professors and language assistants from the Department of ModernLanguages.Courses"

POSC 311," - Political Organizations in the U.S (4 Credit Hours)"Democracy is unthinkable save in terms of the parties." Yet, some,including the Founding Fathers, have been less sure of Schattschneider'struism, warning of the mischiefs of faction. Political organization,however, by most accounts has been the engine and structure ofAmerican democracy throughout its two centuries. Parties, interestgroups, and social movements have formed and acted to create andinsure that American democracy truly is of, by, and for the people. In thecourse, we will investigate the formation, maintenance, and death ofpolitical organizations, the effectiveness and representative nature ofpolitical organizations, the strategies and resources of organizations,as well as recent challenges by such factors as increased individualism,media, technology and money.

POSC 326," - Radical Right Parties and Politics in Europe (4 Credit Hours)What accounts for the emergence, persistence and demise of "radical" or"far right" political parties in Europe? After a period of post-war stability,European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led toseveral new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation;a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; andthe emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This coursefocuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in WesternEurope during the 1980's and 1990's. Speciﬁcally we focus on whatmany scholars label the "far" or "radical" right. These parties tend to beorganized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizingnationalism, exclusion of "foreigners," a strong state, welfare chauvinismand, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semesterstudents will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties andtheir politics across Europe and discern the differences between whatscholars describe as "populist radical" or "populist far" right parties fromother parties on the extreme right, namely neofascist or neo-Nazis partieswhich are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist."

POSC 347," - The Middle East in World Affairs (4 Credit Hours)The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the politicalhistory, international signiﬁcance, and the dimensions of political lifein the Middle East. Owing to the ever-present potential for conflict, theseeming intractability of disputes, and the oil factor, what happens in theMiddle East is of vital importance to international politics. We examinethe role that politics in the Middle East has played in world affairs as wellas the region's importance in the future."
POSC 348," - Foreign and Security Policy in Western Europe (4 CreditHours)This course aims to compare key post Cold War foreign policy behaviorsduring crisis situations concerning the three "big" states in WesternEurope: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (also referred to asthe EU3, as they all are members of the European Union (EU). Why is itthat we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries whichhave been the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years?Are these countries "middle powers" or "big powers"? What role do theyplay in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europealso conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviatefrom the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes ofEurope. Thus, the "three big" can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreignpolicy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guidesour analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-makingprocesses, the domestic and international environment, and foreignpolicy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, stateand systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparingthe foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas ofinquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national roleconception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system."
POSC 349," - Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since thebeginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorismdates only from the French Revolution (1789-1799). In this course, wewill explore what terrorism is, whether it is new (and why some analystsargue it is), who uses terrorist tactics, why they do so, and how terrorismdiffers from other forms of political violence such as war, insurgency, andso on. We will investigate various deﬁnitions of terrorism. Most scholarsthink that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorismas planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lotof disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how itcan be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We willcompare the various deﬁnitions and perspectives to determine whichmight work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, wewill focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science andhow they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, andthe media."

For thisreason, psychology majors are urged to select a broad range of coursesin addition to those offerings that are particularly relevant to their primaryinterests. Students of psychology should aim for both breadth anddepth of knowledge in the discipline. The requirements for a major inpsychology at Denison are relatively flexible in order to provide studentswith the opportunity to select those courses and experiences that bestcomplement their personal goals. At the same time, the flexibility of theserequirements requires that psychology majors work closely with theiracademic advisors to develop an appropriate plan of study.Writing Program Statement: Psychology students will demonstratecompetence in reviewing, developing, conducting, and analyzingpsychological research, and crucially, in communicating scientiﬁcresearch to diverse audiences. Writing manuscripts describing theirempirical psychological research will be one core-learning goal. Studentswill write formal research reports that are modeled on the majorcomponents of the American Psychological Association’s PublicationManual. The development of these essential scientiﬁc writing skills willbe coordinated across the department’s research courses; those aredevelopmentally and systematically linked at the 200 and 300-levels.Writing critical analyses or literature reviews of research will be a secondcore-learning goal. Students will write formal papers that include a criticalanalysis, or review, of a body of research and that draws conclusionsfrom existing literature on a topic of interest. Students will have multipleopportunities to develop critical analysis writing skills in lecture anddiscussion-based courses at the 200 and 300-levels and in History andSystems of Psychology, which is the curriculum’s capstone course.

By engaging with this diverse range of ﬁelds, the work of QueerStudies distinguishes itself in that it focuses on issues surroundingsexuality and gender (and other axes of marginalized identity) andthe way(s) that the questions raised in these other arenas might bemodulated through that central lens. To that end, Queer Studies examinesthe cultural, social, historical, and political implications of sexuality andgender from the perspective of those marginalized by the dominantsexual and gender ethos; it explores the ways that culture deﬁnes andregulates sexuality and gender (and more broadly normativity) as wellas the reverse, the ways that sexuality and gender structure and shapesocial institutions and power structures.FacultyCommittee: Sandy Runzo, Director (English), Ronald Abram (StudioArt), Gina Dow (Psychology), Barbara Fultner (Philosophy), KarenGraves (Education), Amanda Gunn (Communication), Warren Hauk(Biology), Sarah Hutson-Comeaux (Psychology), Ching-chu Hu (Music),John Jackson (Black Studies), Clare Jen (Women's and Gender Studies/Biology), Bill Kirkpatrick (Communication), Maia Kotrosits (Religion),Linda Krumholz (English), Lisbeth Lipari (Communication), May Mei(Mathematics), Lisa McDonnell (English), Michael Morris (Dance), EmilyNemeth (Education), K.

QS 452," - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)ReligionDepartmental Guidelines and GoalsThe academic study of religion is a multi-disciplinary exploration ofthe many ways in which religion functions in the lives of individuals,American society, and the global community. It critically examines therole of religion as an active force that has social, ethical, and ideologicalconsequences. Students learn to assess how religion has shaped theircultures, their family lives, their suppositions of what matters and what isethical, and their sense of who they are. Students thus gain the analytical,relational, and expressive skills essential to a liberal arts education.One need not be religious to study religion.  The academic study isa lens through which the persistence of religion in the social spherebecomes evident and the personal sphere is enriched.  This academicexercise conﬁrms and contests the prevailing sense of reality.  Whatis considered normal in our society is subject to critical review.  In theprocess it enhances skill-sets with transfer value in the vocational sphereas well as deepened awareness of what deﬁnes us as individuals andnations.  Critical consciousness on moral issues, global relationships,and the existence of community is a result of this academic exercise.172         ReligionTherefore, the questions raised may be more important than the answersconstructed. Students who study religion learn how to ask these criticalquestions.FacultyAssociate Professor K. Christine Pae, ChairProfessors John E. Cort, David O. Woodyard; Associate Professors JohnL.

In other words, it is a history of revisions, as Israel attemptedto make sense of itself amidst changing times and new empires. Thiscourse introduces students not only to the historical contexts, literaryvariety, and major narrative traditions of the Bible, but the social forcesguiding its eventual composition as a book.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the realization that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understandingOur basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms).

Our program aims to develop these habits of mind. We expectstudents to be able to make cogent arguments, anticipate and meet theneeds of their audience, gather and synthesize evidence, and apply theconventions of style and grammar. By repeated experiences in writing-intensive courses situated within the context of academic programsacross the university, students will develop writing skills and deepen theirliberal arts education.This program consists of three parts:1.W 101 - First-Year Writing Workshop taken during the ﬁrst year,2.two writing- intensive courses (W-overlays), one of which must becompleted in the sophomore year, and3.the writing requirements speciﬁc to each student's major.CoursesW 101 - First-Year Writing Workshop (4 Credit Hours)Required of all students during their ﬁrst year, the W101 courseintroduces students to the rigors of college-level writing and providespractice in formulating and presenting a signiﬁcant argument in a cogentessay; in ﬁnding, evaluating, and incorporating research into their writing;and in assessing their own work and that of their peers. W101 can beused only to satisfy the "S" Writing GE requirement. Open to First Yearstudents only.188         Special Programs and OpportunitiesSPECIAL PROGRAMS ANDOPPORTUNITIESPre-Professional ProgramsDenison's commitment to the liberal arts, the strength of our pre-professional advising, and the success of our graduates have madeDenison well-known by professional schools ranging from medicine andbusiness to law and engineering. Pre-professional career coaching isprovided by the Austin E. Knowlton Center for Career Exploration, which,along with faculty, provides a strong and knowledgeable advising system.Denison has earned the respect of deans of professional and graduateschools who recognize the value of the liberal arts education receivedat Denison.  Whether a student earns a bachelor's degree at Denisonand then goes on to a professional school or combines three years ofstudy here with time at another university, a Denison education willcontribute signiﬁcantly to the attainment of professional goals. Pleasenote that Denison ﬁnancial aid can be applied only during the student'stime at Denison. Interested students should discuss other ﬁnancial aidopportunities with partnering institutions.Pre-HealthHealthcare admission decisions, including but not limited to, medicine,dentistry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, nursing and veterinarymedicine, etc., are based on performance on nationally-sponsoredadmissions tests (Medical College Admissions Test, Dental AdmissionTest, Graduate Record Examination) and on academic achievement inboth science and non-science courses. Students whose test and gradeproﬁles are strong enjoy a high rate of acceptance by health-relatedprograms in their state of residence and by selective schools throughoutthe country.Most of our undergraduates considering the health professions bolstertheir preparations and gain an overview of several related ﬁelds byconducting internships, externships and health-related volunteer work inhospital and/or clinical settings.Pre-LawDenison graduates are typically successful in gaining admission tolaw schools across the country. Students' performance on the LawSchool Admission Test and their academic records are the majordetermining factors in the admissions decision. The acceptance rateof Denison graduates is consistently well-above the national average.Representatives from a number of schools regularly visit the campus.Attending career panels, programs and completing internships in legalsettings helps students make informed career decisions.BusinessA broad-based undergraduate program in the liberal arts is one ofthe most satisfactory preparations for graduate study in businessadministration and management, and many Denison graduates continuetheir studies in programs across the country. The current national trend isto encourage students to work several years between undergraduate andM.B.A. programs and Denison students can receive advice on preparingfor business school.EngineeringWith a long-standing tradition of strength in science and pre-engineering,Denison offers two plans to prepare for an engineering career. In theﬁrst, students receive a bachelor's degree after four years at Denisonwith a major in natural sciences or mathematics, followed by two yearsof graduate work at another institution leading to a master's degreein engineering. Denison students are regularly accepted to graduateengineering programs at leading universities.The second plan is a "3-2" program in which students study three or fouryears at Denison, and an additional two years at an afﬁliated engineeringschool, resulting in two bachelor's degrees. Denison is afﬁliated in suchdual-degree programs with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, WashingtonUniversity (St. Louis), and Columbia University. Students interestedin these plans should contact the 3-2 Engineering Advisor, in care ofDenison Physics Department, at their earliest opportunity.

Inparticular, the law speciﬁes that "all impact resistant lenses must becapable of withstanding an impact test in which a ﬁve-eighths inch steelball weighing approximately ﬁfty-six hundredths of an ounce is droppedfrom a height of ﬁfty inches upon the horizontal upper surface of the lensin the manner prescribed under the code of federal regulations, Title 21,Section 3.84."Please note that eyeglasses normally supplied by your optician,optometrist, or ophthalmologist may be speciﬁed to be "impact-resistant"and still not meet the speciﬁcations of the Ohio law, as quoted above.Accordingly, students enrolled in the above departmental courses andwho do not ordinarily wear glasses will, without exception, be required topurchase a pair of safety glasses meeting the above speciﬁcations. Suchglasses will ordinarily be available in the Denison bookstore, but theymay be purchased elsewhere. Students who already wear prescriptionlenses (either contact or otherwise) will also be required to wear safetyglasses when in the laboratory, studio, or work areas. These may be of avariety that cover their ordinary glasses, or they may be a pair preparedaccording to the student's prescription and meeting the safety standards.The university has arrangements with a local supplier to furnish bothkinds at prices that are both fair and competitive.Financial Aid InformationDenison is strongly committed to enrolling highly qualiﬁed students,regardless of their ﬁnancial means.

Studentsare not required to work; however, if they have been awarded a workprogram on their award letter, they may earn up to the amount listed forthe academic year.

TheDenison Scholar Loan and Federal Direct Subsidized loans are similar inthat there is no interest or repayment on the principal while the student isin school at least half-time, and interest begins to accumulate followinggraduation or upon ceasing to be enrolled half-time.

The loan termsare similar to the subsidized loan except that interest is charged whilethe student is in school for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan.
