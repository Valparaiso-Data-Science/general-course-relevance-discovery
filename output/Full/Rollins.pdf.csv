The courses and programs of study are designed to meet the interests and needs of professionals and other adult learners.  The Rollins College liberal arts curriculum is designed to develop and refine analytical and critical skills. Small classes permit an active learning experience stressing problem-solving and organizational abilities. Students learn how to express and defend reasoned points of view both orally and in writing.  Students may either study for a bachelor of arts degree or take courses for career development and personal enrichment. Students will be held responsible for requirements that are in effect at the date of entrance into the Holt School. If students do not attend for a period of two years or more, they will be held responsible for the requirements in effect at the time of their reentry. Master’s degree programs available through the Hamilton Holt School are described in separate graduate publications.  GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Students need both breadth and depth in their learning experience. By majoring in at least one area of knowledge, students gain the depth necessary for disciplinary expertise. The general education curriculum at Rollins College exposes students to varied perspectives and domains of knowledge, fosters critical thinking, and encourages students to consider the ways various areas of knowledge may reinforce and enrich each other.   The Arts and Sciences faculty have identified a set of core competencies within the general education program: 1. To obtain knowledge of the distinctive methodologies and subject matter of the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. 2. Ability to read, think, write, and speak critically and analytically. 3. Ability to identify and articulate ethical dimensions of a personal or social issue.  To be eligible for a bachelor of arts degree, students must complete one course from each of the general education areas listed below.  Expressive Arts (A) Artistic creation is a central and enduring activity in all cultures. The arts attest to the fundamental human need for self-expression and for the transformation of human experience into lasting symbolic form. Furthermore, the great diversity of art forms across cultures is evidence of the degree to which human experience, while shared, is also culturally determined. Expressive arts classes provide students with an appreciation for aesthetic experience by teaching the skills necessary for individual aesthetic expression or by focusing on acquiring a critical vocabulary with which to articulate aesthetic experience, or both, depending on the discipline. The expressive arts thus encompass both primary aspects of artistic creation: its practice and its scholarly study. 31   Knowledge of Other Cultures (C) Humans have adapted to a wide range of habitats and developed a variety of ways of interpreting and understanding the world. The diversity of these interpretations is part of what defines our species. By analyzing a non-Western culture, students will better understand what is common to human nature, how societies differ from each other, and how our lives are shaped by our cultural beliefs. They will also understand that culture is not an arbitrary construct, but rather consists of systems of beliefs and institutions that typically serve some purpose. Non-Western cultures are those that are not European derived, or that may be European derived but include a substantial cultural component from African, Native American, Asian, Australian Aboriginal, or Pacific Island sources.  Knowledge of Western Culture (H) The ideas, arts, and institutions that define Western society and culture have emerged from a rich historical process. In order to understand, appreciate, and critically evaluate any aspect of this culture, one must have an understanding of the context from which it arose. By studying the Western heritage in its historical development, students will be encouraged to see the historical dimensions of the issues they face as engaged citizens today.  Awareness of Literature (L) The L requirement seeks to develop lifelong readers sensitive to the richness of literary texts and to the pleasure of exploring that richness. In support of this goal, the L requirement develops students’ ability to discover and articulate the ways in which literature imaginatively reflects the human condition.  Oral Communication (T) Oral Communication is the process of sending and receiving verbal and nonverbal messages to create shared meaning. Students graduating from Rollins College will be able to use oral communication skills to shape public dialogue by offering perspectives, sharing facts, raising questions, and engaging others in discussion. To achieve this goal, students will be able to organize ideas and concepts persuasively, tailor messages to a particular audience, adapt to listener feedback, and—employing appropriate technology—make effective oral presentations.  Scientific Perspective (P) Humans live in and are part of the natural world. Our survival and success depends on our ability to understand, draw sustenance from, and sustain this world. These courses focus on understanding the nature of science: its discovery process, the scientific method, and the historical sequence leading to major discoveries. Where possible, these courses discuss the social context of the science courses, and give examples of the interplay between science and society. A laboratory experience is required.  Quantitative Thinking (Q) Quantitative methods have become increasingly important in the natural and social sciences, business, government, and in many other activities that directly affect our lives. Furthermore, with the advent of fast computers with huge storage capabilities, it has become possible to collect, process, and disseminate large amounts of data. Playing an 32  active role in the decision-making that shapes our society requires us to be able to interpret, analyze, and draw sound conclusions from the standard representations of data.  Written Communication (W) The communication of ideas, information, poetry, stories, intent, and even culture itself has been dependent on the ability of humans to effectively store facts and convert thoughts to written language. The ability to communicate ideas and information in writing is at the core of a liberal arts education and is essential for active citizenship. In covering both academic and (to a lesser degree) familiar writing, the W course focuses on understanding rhetorical strategies. Students will read the texts of others and learn to shape their own meanings by writing and editing a variety of forms.  This requirement may be fulfilled by a score of 500 or more on the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Achievement Test in English Composition, by scoring 65 or better on the English Composition with essay General Examination of the CEEB’s College Level Examination Program (CLEP), or by completing 9T 407.646.2232  |  F 407.646.1551  |  rollins.edu/evening"

The beautiful 70-acre campus is located in the heart of Winter Park and bounded by Lake Virginia to the east and south. At Rollins, our goal extends beyond the development of important workplace skills – we aim to nurture your mind in a small classroom environment so that you will lead a life of inquiry and fulfillment. Our programs promote broad, integrative learning and awareness of social issues.   The Hamilton Holt School, named for the college’s eighth president, features a wide range of bachelor’s and master’s degree programs offered during evening hours, with small classes, dedicated faculty, and diverse students of all ages and backgrounds. The average age of Holt undergraduates is 29. Approximately 1,200 students enroll each year. Most work part or full time and have family responsibilities. Many receive scholarship support and other financial assistance.   Our approach to education embraces principles that are widely recognized as promoting learning in adult students. These principles include:  Student-faculty contact. Rollins Evening students have the opportunity to interact with faculty on a regular basis inside and outside the classroom. Small class sizes, individual attention, and a supportive academic environment promote learning and make Rollins unique.  A blend of liberal arts and professional course offerings.  Adult learners benefit the most when they can apply what they learn in the classroom to their work environment.  Whether you are fresh out of high school or a working adult, the Holt School offers you a practical education that is designed to take advantage of your strengths.  We embrace the Association of American Colleges and Universities position that the “dividing line” between professional education and liberal education is artificial – that students benefit the most when they have access to a portfolio of courses that provide diverse professional and liberal arts experiences.  This is especially true for adult learners.   Active learning. Because our curriculum is practical, Rollins Evening students collaborate with faculty in order to solve complex, real-world problems. In many ways, we learn as much from our students as our students learn from us. Our commitment to sharing ideas with students and living the “life of the mind” means that your experience at Rollins will involve more than learning skills, you’ll become an intellectual explorer.  Prompt and appropriate feedback about academic performance. Small class sizes also mean more in-depth and constructive feedback. Your education is too important for you to feel like a number.  Rigorous learning experiences. With increased individual attention comes increased expectations of your intellectual development. At Rollins, both our faculty and students expect nothing less than excellence from each other.  A diverse community of faculty and peers. The considerable life experiences of our students and faculty make classroom learning exciting. At Rollins, you will meet leaders in the community, other professionals who are looking to advance professionally, and top notch artists and musicians.  Our students come from all walks of life and ethnic and cultural backgrounds.    Preparation for the future.  Your program of study will challenge your mind and prepare you for a career in a rapidly changing world. A great number of Hamilton Holt School students continue to live, work, and raise their families in Central Florida. Many of the Holt School’s 16,000 alumni have earned advanced degrees and have gained prominence in their professions. Their Rollins education continues to make a positive difference, empowering them to lead meaningful lives and productive careers. 8  ABOUT ROLLINS COLLEGE  Rollins College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees.

Applications for admission are considered on the basis of the qualifications of each applicant without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation, disability, or veteran status. Rollins is an equal opportunity institution that adheres to a nondiscriminatory policy with respect to employment, enrollment, and programs.  Application All new students must file an application with a $40 nonrefundable application fee. Applications should be filed before the published deadlines which can be found on our website. Official transcripts from high school and/or all colleges previously attended by the student must be on file with the Hamilton Holt School by the published application deadline.   Admission to a degree program is based on the achievement of a minimum 2.5 cumulative grade point average (GPA) from previously attended, regionally accredited colleges (averages from multiple institutions may be combined) or high school; as well as submission of college-level writing in the application process. Regionally accredited associations include Middle States, North Central, New England, Northwest, Southern, and Western. A letter of appeal must be included with the application if the cumulative grade point average is below 2.5. Acceptance to enroll at the Hamilton Holt School does not guarantee admission into some majors. Students who have been dismissed from another institution for academic or conduct-related matters must file a formal request for application review through the admissions committee.  In addition, all applicants are required to interview with the director of admission or members of the admission committee.   • First Year Applicants: Students who have not previously attended a regionally accredited college or university must provide an official transcript from a regionally accredited high school, a high school accredited by a state accrediting commission, or a public high school regulated by a school system and state department of education. If no high school diploma has been earned, an official General Education Diploma (GED) score report is required. Applicants submitting GED scores must also submit secondary records up to their point of leaving.   • Transfer Applicants: Students who have previously attended a regionally accredited college or university are required to submit an official transcript from each college/university attended. Students with less than sixty (60) earned semester hours of credit are also required to provide an official high school transcript or GED score report. A College Officials Report may be required.   • Second Bachelor’s Degree Applicants: Students who have previously earned a degree from a regionally accredited institution must submit a separate request for 11  approval for a second baccalaureate degree. The admission requirements for students seeking a second bachelor’s degree differ from first degree requirements in that they are based upon selective rather than performance criteria. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 is required and the intended major must be distinct from the previous major. Official transcripts from each previously-attended college/university are required.  • Returning Rollins Students: Students previously enrolled in any Rollins College academic program are required to have a 2.5 cumulative grade point average from Rollins. A letter of appeal must be included if the cumulative grade point average is below 2.5. Students who were academically dismissed or administratively withdrawn from any Rollins College academic program must appeal for readmission through the appropriate dean’s office. A College Officials Report may be required. Students approved for readmission will follow the catalog and curricular policies and requirements in effect at the time of return.   • International Applicants: Candidates for admission are required to submit evidence of successful completion of studies from accredited secondary schools or colleges. If the school records are in a language other than English, candidates for admission must submit a translation and an official credential evaluation of those records. Candidates whose native language is not English are required to submit evidence of their English language ability. The following are accepted as evidence: an official score report from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with a score of 550 or better (paper-based); 213 or better (computer-based); or, 80 or better (internet-based); or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) with a score of 6.5 or better.  Accepted international students are required to advise Rollins College of their current immigration status. The I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status, is issued only after the student has submitted (1) an Application for Admission with the nonrefundable application fee; (2) all official transcripts (translated, if necessary); and (3) a Statement of Financial Responsibility including appropriate documentation that sufficient financial resources are available to finance one full year in the Hamilton Holt School.   Accepted international students (with J-1 or F-1 visas) are required to purchase health insurance coverage that includes repatriation and medical evacuation. This requirement is not meant to be punitive, but is a protection for the international student against the high cost of medical care in the United States.  • Non-Degree Seeking Applicants: Applicants who wish to earn credit at Rollins but don’t wish to seek a degree must submit a full application and appropriate transcripts. In the case of current high school students (entering 11th and 12th grades), official SAT and/or ACT scores are required as well. Non-degree seeking students are restricted to taking no more than 12 credit hours and are not qualified for federal or state financial aid.  12  • Audit Applicants: Applicants interested in auditing courses (no academic credit) on a space-available basis are required to submit a formal application for admission.   • Transient Applicants: Applicants enrolled in other institutions may apply for limited admission to take specific transfer courses approved for credit by their home institution. An official transient letter issued by the home institution will serve in lieu of official college transcripts.  Any omissions or misrepresentations on a student’s application for admission will automatically invalidate consideration by, acceptance to and continuation at Rollins. If an applicant (a) is ineligible to enroll at any previously attended institution, (b) is on probation, suspension, exclusion, or any other standing indicating either an academic or a conduct deficiency at any previously attended institution, (c) has been found in violation of the academic or non-academic code of conduct at any previously attended institution, or (d) has been convicted or found guilty or pled nolo contendere of a felony in any jurisdiction, then the applicant’s case will be reviewed to ensure that the applicant meets the satisfactory academic performance, good character, and good conduct requirements. After a letter of acceptance has been issued, if information comes to light that shows that an applicant did not meet all admission requirements, the applicant’s admission offer will be withdrawn.  Applicants may defer their acceptance for up to one year. If a year has lapsed since an application was filed, a new application must be filed if a student wishes to pursue enrollment. A previously admitted student who has not attended Rollins for a period of two or more years must file a new application form, pay the application fee, and follow the curricular policies and requirements in effect at the time of return. All credentials submitted with the application for admission become and remain the property of the college and will not be returned to the student, duplicated, or transferred to another institution.  Admission Categories To ensure the success of our students, Rollins offers admissions types that are designed to help identify areas of need for students and connect them with academic plans that fit those requirements.   • Full Admission: Requirements listed in the Satisfactory Academic Progress Review below.  • Conditional Admission: Students are required to take "

Olin Library When Rollins College was founded in 1885, its library collection consisted of a Bible and a dictionary. More than 130 years later, students have at their disposal considerable library resources ranging from ancient tomes to the latest technology in information retrieval.  The Library’s collections reflect the liberal arts mission of the College and strongly support the curriculum. Holdings currently include 138 research databases, over 318,000 volumes, access to more than 67,000 journals online and in print, a number of special collections, and thousands of documentaries and movies streaming online and on DVDs. Ten librarians partner with faculty throughout the College to  teach students how to effectively search for, evaluate and use information resources, visiting over 100 classes each year and are available for individual research help by drop in or appointment, in person, online, and via phone for over seventy hours per week. Librarians are happy to sit down individually with Holt School students returning to school to bring them up to date with all that a modern academic library has to offer. The Olin Library, a $4.7 million gift of the F.W. Olin Foundation, was dedicated in 1985. Rising impressively near the shores of Lake Virginia, the four-level, 54,000-square-foot structure retains the Spanish Colonial architecture that dominates the campus. A second gift of $2.7 million established the Olin Electronic Research and Information Center. The combined facility features the latest technology, including computer workstations, a variety of software applications, online databases, full internet access, color and 3-D printers, and digitizing equipment. These tools facilitate students’ creativity as they 18  pursue research questions, and prepare multimedia presentations and web pages. Olin also houses Tutoring & Writing Consultations in which peer writing consultants work with individual students to help improve their writing and peer tutors help students improve their comprehension of course content. The main floor of the building is open 24/7 to all Rollins students through secure R-Card access. The College Archives and Special Collections Department, housed on the first floor of the Olin Library, provides further opportunities for research in rare books and manuscripts and the historical records of Rollins College. Special collections emphasize the liberal arts character of the Library. Examples include the William Sloane Kennedy bequest of Whitmaniana; the Jesse B. Rittenhouse library of modern poetry and literature, including her correspondence with many literary personalities; the Mead and Nehrling horticultural papers; and an outstanding collection of Floridiana. The Archives offer a wealth of information to local historians, collecting both documents of the institution and extensive holdings on the history of Winter Park.  The Olin Library has a robust wireless network throughout the buildings and houses the bookmark Café. It is an integral part of the instructional, intellectual, and cultural life of Rollins College.  For further information, call (407) 646-2627.   Tutoring and Writing Consulting at Olin Library  The Writing Center, staffed by trained peer consultants from across the curriculum, welcomes writers at any stage of the writing process, from brainstorming to revising to final editing. Writers of all abilities benefit from putting their work before an audience. Through one-on-one conversations and occasional group sessions, consultants serve Arts and Sciences and Hamilton Holt School undergraduate and graduate students, sharing strategies, questioning rhetorical choices, and summarizing their discussions for both clients and faculty members.   The Peer Tutoring Program hires and trains faculty-nominated peer tutors to help students understand and improve learning in specific courses. Since peer tutors have recently succeeded in these courses, they can often convince student clients to try more effective and efficient reading, learning, and problem-solving techniques. They then monitor students’ strategic use of these skills in later individual or group sessions. In addition, tutors give feedback on students’ understanding of course concepts in the early stages of writing. Professors and student clients receive copies of tutoring notes made during each session.  The Center is appointment-based, students must make their appointments before midnight of the previous day. Find the scheduler (WCOnline) through R-Net logins (at the bottom, Tutoring and Writing) or from the web pages in Olin Library’s web site. Students may log-in using their normal Rollins username and password, register (the first time) and then choose the appropriate schedule. Limit your search to the course you are taking in the tutoring schedule or to the kind of help you need in the Writing Center schedule. Then find an open appointment (in white) for the tutor or consultant you want to see. You will get a reminder email at 12:01 a.m. on your appointment day.

See below.  Tuition and fees are established by the Board of Trustees and are subject to change each fall. The tuition and fee schedule for graduate programs is published in relevant publications.  Students will be held financially responsible for registrations they initiate. Tuition is assessed on a term-by-term basis and is due by the published deadlines or at the time of new student registration. Financial aid recipients who have received their Rollins financial aid award letters may defer payment until their financial aid becomes available, but not past the end of the term. This deferment is a service to the student and does not constitute a guarantee of payment. Employer-sponsored students must have an original, approved corporate authorization form at the time of registration; otherwise, a 25 percent tuition deposit will be required.  Late Fee Policy   Late payment fee will be charged to all accounts (all programs) with a past due balance greater than $200.  Late payment fee will be charged on a monthly basis.  Late payment fee will be charged until the account goes to external collections, at which time the external collection costs will be incurred.  Late payment fee will be equal to 1% of the total past due balance.  Accounts unpaid at separation from the College will be referred to an external collection agency with a collection fee of up to 50 percent added to the outstanding balance. This debt will be reported to credit bureaus by the external collection agency.  In addition to monthly late fees, the College reserves the right to restrict services, contract for outside collections, and pursue legal action in the collection of any past due debt at the expense of the debtor. Collection costs can add an additional cost of up to 50% of the original debt.  Accounts will remain encumbered until the past due balance has been paid in full. This will restrict College services including transcript release and registration for future terms. Accounts will remain on hold until the past due balance has been paid in full.  26  Monthly Payment Plan Rollins College offers undergraduate and graduate students to pay education expenses monthly through our partner, Tuition Mangement Systems (TMS). The plan differs from a loan in that there is no interest rate or credit approval needed.  A $150 enrollment fee allows students and families to spread estimated costs for both fall and spring terms over a 10-month period to allow for smaller, affordable payments instead of paying your balance in one large lump sum.

Residence The last 48 hours (twelve full-credit courses) for the bachelor of arts degree must be taken at Rollins College Hamilton Holt School. At least one-fourth of a student’s major and minor courses must be taken at Rollins.  Credit Students must complete a minimum of 140 semester hours of academic work, at least 44 of which must be at the upper-division (300-400) level. Lower-level transfer courses may not be substituted for upper-division requirements unless approved by the appropriate academic department. Students may be required to take a number of overall elective courses in order to meet the semester-hour or upper-division requirement. A minimum of 16 semester hours must be from courses not used to meet either a general education or major requirement.   Grade Students must earn a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 (“C”) for all courses taken at Rollins and achieve a minimum GPA of 2.00 for all courses taken to fulfill major and minor requirements.  Major/Minor Students must satisfactorily complete the courses required for a major. The number of courses required varies between 10 and 17. Minors, consisting of six (6) to eight (8) courses, are optional. Students must earn a minimum GPA of 2.00 (“C”) in the courses approved for the major and minor as accepted on the senior audit.  Majors Majors are offered in the following fields of study. Individual programs of an interdisciplinary nature may also be designed. See Self-Designed Majors.   Business Management   Communication Studies   Economics   Education   English   Environmental Studies and Sustainable Urbanism   Health Services Management & Leadership   Humanities   International Affairs   Music   Organizational Behavior   Psychology  34  Minors Students have the option of completing any one minor in a specified area other than the student’s major. A minor is not a requirement for graduation.     African and African-American Studies   Business Management   Communication Studies   Dance   Economics   English   Health Services Management & Leadership   History    Humanities   International Affairs   Jewish Studies   Music   Organizational Behavior   Psychology   Secondary Education   Sexuality Women's & Gender Studies   Writing  Self-Designed Majors  Self-Designed Majors are intended for disciplined and highly motivated students who are clearly focused in their interests. These majors reflect the College’s recognition that not every student’s area of special interest will always fall neatly within the bounds of a single discipline as traditionally defined.   The Self-Designed Major is not intended as a way for a student to avoid the intellectual focus and methodological rigor required in the normal departmental major or to avoid certain difficult courses within majors. It should not be used to concentrate work in a narrowly pre-professional way. On the contrary, by successfully completing the courses and integrative research project that constitute the Self-Designed Major, the student is expected to achieve a depth of focused reflection and understanding at least comparable to that of a traditional major.  Guidelines for Submission of a Self-Designed Major Proposal 1.  Students proposing a self-designed major must have a grade point average of 3.33 or better.  2.  The proposal must include the names of three faculty members willing to serve on the senior research project committee. The faculty must represent the three disciplines represented in the major. The student must select a director, from among these three, who works with the student and the other committee members in preparing the proposal. The director also serves as an advocate in the approval process. Once the proposal has been approved, the director serves as the student’s 35  academic advisor, monitors the student’s progress in completing the major, and chairs the committee that reviews the senior research project.  3.  The proposed major program must have a coherent theme or topic that integrates at least three traditional disciplines. It must be different enough from a regular major that some combination of major and minor would not substantially achieve the same result. The student must include a rationale for choosing a self-designed major rather than a conventional major.  4.  The proposal must include a list of courses, all related to and converging on the theme of the proposed major, from at least three disciplines.  5.  The major must include a two-term, eight-semester-hour independent research project, (or combination of a four-semester-hour upper-level seminar and a one-term, four-semester-hour research project) integrating the major, to be completed in the senior year.  6.  The program must be at least 64 semester hours (including the senior project) in length, of which 32 semester hours must be at the 300 level or above. The proposal must be submitted to the Director of Student Services at the Hamilton Holt School  for approval by September 1, for fall consideration, or by February 1, for spring consideration. (Proposals received during the summer term will be held for fall consideration.) The director then submits the proposal to the Academic Affairs Committee for final approval. An Amendment Form must be submitted to approve any changes from the original proposal.  Declaring a Major Selection of a major does not imply a career choice. Concentration in a major field of study is designed to give a student command of the content and methods of one discipline or field, acquaintance with recognized authorities in the field, and general competence in dealing with sources of research or analysis. A decision as to a declaration of major is strongly encouraged by the second term of the sophomore year.  Return to Rollins Students who withdraw from Rollins and return after two or more years may be required to follow any curricular policies in effect at the time of their return.  Double Counting of Classes for Majors and Minors If students are enrolled in more than one major or minor, they may double count no more than half the number of courses in the smaller program. If the smaller program requires an odd number of courses, the student may round up. No course may be counted for more than two programs.  Responsibility for Requirements A student is responsible for becoming familiar with and meeting all graduation requirements listed in the Holt School academic catalog. Academic advisors assist in this 36  process, but it is ultimately the student’s responsibility to ensure that all necessary requirements have been met. Questions concerning the requirements should be addressed to an academic advisor.  SPECIAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES  Independent Study Independent studies, classified as either research or internship, offer students an opportunity for specialized study meant to encourage intellectual curiosity, initiative, and sustained effort. An independent study cannot normally duplicate a course that is regularly offered. Students are not eligible to participate in independent study until they have successfully completed the academic review process that follows admission to the program.  Students may apply no more than three independent study (research and/or internship) courses to the bachelor’s degree, of which no more than two may be internships. No more than two independent studies may be within one’s major or minor area of study. Independent studies may not be used to fulfill major/minor core or general education requirements.  Research To qualify, students already must have acquired the knowledge and skills necessary to do the research. This implies that the research is in the major (or in a closely allied field) and that students have achieved junior or senior status. Such projects usually involve original research with primary materials or original work in the laboratory or studio.  The purpose of the approval process is to ensure that independent studies are compatible with the philosophy and overall nature of the entire curriculum and to give the student adequate time to formulate a well-defined study before the beginning of the term in which the study will be conducted.  The deadline dates are published in each term schedule of courses and are strictly enforced. Students are responsible for completing the project proposal form, signing the form, obtaining the signatures of the faculty sponsor and the academic department chair, and returning the final, completed proposal form to the Holt School prior to the deadline. The Holt School will not accept incomplete forms. An authorized original copy of the independent study form is required prior to registration.  Please note that some academic departments have departmental expectations relevant to independent studies and internships that may include earlier submission or approval deadlines. Students will be held responsible for these expectations.  Internship In order to be eligible for the Academic Internship Program (AIP), a student must have earned a minimum of 30 (thirty) semester hours of credit and successfully completed one (1) semester in the Hamilton Holt School. In addition, students may not be on academic or judicial probation during the semester in which they are enrolled for the internship. Students may enroll in one (1) academic internship per semester, and a maximum of four (4) semester hours of credit may be earned for any internship in a single semester. A 37  student who completes the same internship multiple terms may only receive academic credit for that internship during one (1) term. A maximum of 8 (eight) semester hours of internship credit may be applied towards graduation. Appeals to these academic policies should be submitted in writing to the Holt Student Appeals Committee.   Students may register to earn 2, 3 or 4 semester hours of credit for an internship, which will require at least 80, 120 or 160 work hours respectively at the internship site. Each credit hour requires a minimum of 40 hours of work at the internship site within the dates of the semester. Academic credit cannot be granted retroactively for an internship that has already been started or completed.  Fall and spring internships for credit must be completed within the dates of the semester as listed on the Rollins academic calendar. Summer internships for credit must be completed within a 9-week semester (dates to be determined by internship instructor).  For additional information and registration instructions students may contact the Office of Career Services, 407-646-2195, careercenter@rollins.edu  or visit the Web site: http://www.rollins.edu/career-life-planning/index.html   SECOND BACHELOR’S DEGREE The admission requirements for students seeking a second bachelor’s degree differ from first degree requirements in that they are based upon selective rather than performance criteria.  Candidates for a second bachelor’s degree must have the approval of their academic advisor and the Director of Student Services. Approval of a second degree will be based on the following criteria:  1. A student should have obtained a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in his or her first bachelor’s degree. 2. The intended major of the second degree should be clearly different and distinct from the major of the first degree.  Students must be approved for a second degree prior to completion of their second term of attendance. All students are reviewed after their first semester in the Hamilton Holt School. Students with a cumulative grade point average (GPA) below 2.0 will be placed on academic warning and dismissed after two semesters if the GPA remains below 2.0.  Graduation requirements to receive a second bachelor’s degree from Rollins College include the following: completion of a major course of study that differs from that of the first degree, a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0, no less than forty-eight (48) semesters hours of Rollins credit, and verification through a degree audit of the satisfaction of all general education requirements via courses undertaken at other regionally accredited institutions of higher education or at Rollins College.    38  REGISTRATION  A period is set aside each term for students to consult with academic advisors and prepare registration materials. The class schedule provides details concerning registration procedures, withdrawal and payment deadlines, and refund periods. Students are expected to register by the published deadlines in accordance with published policies and procedures.  PAYMENTS Tuition and fees are the responsibility of the student and are due at the time of registration or by the published payment deadline. Methods of payment include cash (in person only), check, money order, cashier’s check, or wire. Credit card payments from Discover, MasterCard, Visa, American Express are accepted only via the QuikPAY Online Billing and Payment System, and authorized forms of financial aid. Late payment fees will be assessed for payments received after the published deadlines. A monthly payment plan is also available. (Please refer to “Tuition and Fees” section of the catalog for additional information.)  Please view the Bursar website for additional information. http://www.rollins.edu/bursar/payments-billing/payment-options.html  It is important for students to note that deferment of tuition for financial aid applicants is an extension of the payment due date, granted as a service to the student. It is NOT a guarantee of eligibility for financial aid. (Please refer to the section on Registration for Financial Aid Applicants in the term schedule.) Students will be held personally and financially responsible for registrations they initiate, whether or not aid is ultimately approved.  CHANGES IN REGISTRATION  Students can make changes to their registration during the add/drop period in FoxLink. Subsequent changes should be provided in writing to the Holt Offices by the published withdrawal deadline. Verbal notification or failure to attend class does not constitute withdrawal. Students will be held academically and financially responsible for registrations they initiate.   Generally, students may add a course if they have not missed more than the first week of class or the equivalent for weekend courses. Courses dropped after the first class meeting will be noted on the student transcript with a “W” and will not affect the student grade point average.   AUDITORS  Non-student auditors, College faculty or staff, and members of the community, must seek admission by submitting an Auditors Application for Admission to the Holt School Admissions Office and completing the College’s online and on-campus Title IX training class. Students registering to audit courses in Holt will be charged a nominal matriculation fee per course audited as determined by the program Dean and Provost in consultation with the President’s Cabinet. Rollins faculty and staff are not charged for course auditing in 39  Holt, but must complete an Auditor’s Application and register as an auditor. See term schedule for fee.   Auditors and degree-seeking students must contact the Holt School Student Services to register. Faculty approval is required. Registrations will be processed after first week of the term as priority is given to degree-seeking students. Courses will not be overloaded for an audit student. Also, some courses may be closed to auditors. Auditors may attend classes, but will not be guaranteed a seat until the week following the close of the schedule change (add-drop) period for degree-seeking students.  Audited courses are noted on the academic transcript with the grade of “AU” for “audit” that is assigned during the registration process. All auditors are responsible for any course fees or books, including fees associated with music courses/applied music (private lessons).  Degree-seeking Holt students who register as auditors in Holt will be charged a nominal matriculation fee per course audited as determined by the program Dean and Provost in consultation with the President’s Cabinet. Degree-seeking students from other programs of the College (e.g., CLA or Crummer) may audit courses on a space-available basis at no cost under the guidelines for cross-enrollment articulated in the College catalog and/or handbook.  Students not originally enrolled as auditors who wish to change their status to that of auditor must do so in writing before the last published date to withdraw without penalty; they will not receive a tuition discount or refund. Audit course registrations may not be converted to academic credit registrations in any program of the College after the end of official schedule change (add-drop) period for the term of enrollment.   INTERNATIONAL AND OFF-CAMPUS STUDY Rollins Approved Programs are offered on a semester basis in Australia; Brazil; China; the United Kingdom; France; Greece; Germany; Italy; Japan; Morocco; Spain and more!  Rollins also offers two approved domestic semester programs. All of the approved semester programs are offered in cooperation with institutions and organizations overseas and in the United States and they have been carefully reviewed, selected and developed with the Rollins mission and Rollins students in mind.   While participating in Rollins Approved Semester programs, students pay a flat fee equivalent to standard Rollins CLA tuition, room and board, and in most cases can transfer financial aid and scholarships directly to the study abroad program costs. In addition, students can take between 12 and 18 credits, depending on the program, and may be able to fulfill major, minor or general education requirements. There are also Approved Summer programs offered in Costa Rica, Ireland, Germany, France, and Spain. These programs are 4-7 weeks and focus on cultural immersion through language study, homestays with local families, and internships.  A number of two to four credit hour short-term study abroad programs, called Field Studies, are offered during the winter, spring, and summer breaks, typically lasting between one and three weeks. Field Studies present a wonderful opportunity to study and travel 40  internationally with Rollins students and faculty without having to go abroad for a full semester. Holt undergraduate and graduate students participating on CLA field study courses pay the same price as CLA students and are eligible for grant support through International Programs and Hamilton Holt.  The cost of a Holt course with a field study is standard Holt tuition for the relevant number of credits plus a program fee to cover the trip costs.  Though Field Study locations change year-to-year, past programs have travelled to Costa Rica, Rwanda, Cuba, India, England, Vietnam, Germany, Nepal, China, Croatia, and the Netherlands.   International travel grants are available, on a competitive basis, to Holt School students participating in Rollins Approved Programs and Field Studies offered through the International Programs Office, approved independent study and internship courses, and approved travel courses offered through other accredited institutions. Students must be currently enrolled in a degree program and be in good academic and social standing. Funding is limited, so students are advised to apply as early as possible in the academic year. Additional information is available at the Office of International Programs website at www.rollins.edu/international-programs/programs/index.html.   The Office of International Programs is the starting point for any student considering off-campus study. Students are encouraged to visit the International Programs website www.rollins.edu/international-programs/programs/index.html. To apply for a program, complete the RIPA (Rollins International Programs Application), located within FoxLink.    41  ACADEMIC POLICIES  THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR The academic calendar consists of a 15-week fall and spring term, one 12-week and two six-week summer terms. Students may select from traditional courses, intensive courses, independent study, and international or off-campus study courses conducted by Rollins faculty members. These off-campus studies require supplemental funds.  THE CREDIT SYSTEM AND COURSE SCHEDULING FORMAT Academic credit at Rollins is awarded in terms of semester hours.   The standard Holt School course is defined as four semester hours, which normally includes 150 minutes of in-class instruction per week. In addition, Rollins faculty expect students to spend considerable time outside of class each week working on course-related activities. It is appropriate for faculty to assign such work as part of the course requirements. The work that occurs outside of and in preparation for class is essential for the learning that occurs in class. Students should expect to spend at least three hours out of class for every hour in class. The value of four credit hours results from work expected of enrolled students both inside and outside of the classroom. The value of a four credit-hour course results from work expected of enrolled students both inside and outside of the classroom. Rollins’ faculty require that students average approximately three hours of outside work for every hour of scheduled class time.  Classes are generally scheduled Monday through Thursday and on weekends. A class typically meets once per week from 4:00 – 6:30 p.m. or from 6:45 – 9:15 p.m. Hours vary for the weekend, intensive, blended, low residency, distance, and summer classes.  Some classes involve laboratories and are offered for more semester hours. Other classes that normally meet for fewer hours during a semester are offered for less academic credit.  In addition, the Holt School offers blended learning options. Blended learning is the replacement of a portion of in-class face-to-face-instruction with learning beyond the classroom, often, but not always, through the application of technology to enhance student learning outcomes.  Courses must be approved to be taught in a blended format; and faculty teaching blended learning courses in the Hamilton Holt School are required to complete a training program.   COURSE LOAD  Fall and Spring Terms Three courses (12 semester hours) are considered to be a full-time course load. A 3.0 grade point average and the written permission of the advisor and director of student services are required for a course overload (17 – 20 semester hours). Students who have incomplete grades from previous semesters are not eligible for approval of a course overload.    42  Summer and Intensive Terms A full-time course load during the 12-week or the two six-week summer terms is twelve (12) semester hours. A 3.0 grade point average (GPA) and the written permission of the advisor and director of student services are required for a course overload (13 – 16 semester hours). Students who have incomplete grades from previous semesters are not eligible for approval of a course overload.  Although the Holt School makes recommendations regarding student course loads, some forms of financial aid are awarded contingent upon student enrollment in a specified number of hours. It is the student’s responsibility to know and abide by course load requirements.  Class Attendance Holt School students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. Each instructor publishes a course absence policy related to the goals and format of the course. At the instructor’s discretion, a student’s grade may be lowered as a penalty for absences.   Students are expected to ascertain the absence policy for each course and to arrange with the instructor to make up any work missed, if allowed by faculty policy. Students who must be absent from the course for an extended period of time should contact the instructor and a Holt School advisor; however, arranging make-up work is always the student’s responsibility. Some assignments, by their very nature, cannot be made up in another setting at another time.  All students must register for courses and are not permitted to attend classes for which they are not registered.   Published Prerequisites Some courses require completion of previous courses prior to registration. These prerequisite courses are published in each term schedule. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that prerequisite requirements have been satisfied prior to registration. Instructors may require unprepared students to withdraw from courses.   Withdrawal from a Course Students may drop/add online during the first week of the term without "W" notation on their transcript. After the drop/add period, students must file an official withdrawal request by completing a registration change form or emailing their advisor from their Rollins email account. Withdrawal forms may be obtained from the Holt School Office or online at www.rollins.edu/evening/documents/forms/DropAdd.pdf. Student withdrawals are automatically updated on the faculty member’s class roster in FoxLink.  Hardship Withdrawal  Exceptions due to extreme circumstances beyond the control of the student (e.g. death in the immediate family or job relocation that can be substantiated in writing by an employer) may be considered on a rare basis. In such cases, students should submit an appeal to the Holt Student Appeals Committee (www.rollins.edu/evening/documents/forms/holt-appeal.html) requesting to be withdrawn without academic penalty from course(s) attempted during the term. Typically, no refund is provided for hardship withdrawals. 43   A student on compassionate leave who wishes to return may do so by initiating a written request for reinstatement to the Holt Student Appeals Committee. Requests for reinstatement are due no less than three (3) weeks prior to the start of classes.   LEAVE OF ABSENCE Medical Leave For students who are temporarily unable to continue their studies due to medical or psychological issues.  Medical Leave is a category of non-academic leave. While on leave the student is not considered to be currently enrolled in the College, but is considered to be in good standing with the College.  The Dean of Student Affairs grants a medical leave of absence to a student. Because a medical leave is sometimes needed to cope with sudden emergencies, a student may request a medical leave at any time during the semester. The medical leave must, however, be approved/granted prior to the end of classes for the academic semester in order to take effect for that semester.  The length of the medical leave depends on the nature and severity of the health concern. It is the concern of the Office of Health Services and the Office of Counseling and Psychological Services that the leave be long enough to allow a student to regain the health and energy required to manage a full-time academic load in a residential environment. In the case of physical medical leaves, the length of the leave is determined by the length of time needed to ameliorate the physical ailment. In contrast, due to the nature of psychological medical leaves, a student often requires at least one (1) additional semester for treatment and stabilization of the condition.  To take a medical leave, a student may speak with either the Dean of Student Affairs, someone in Health Services, or Counseling and Psychological Services. Before a leave is granted, a student must consult with either the Director of Health Services or the Director of Counseling and Psychological Services to determine whether or not the condition can be successfully managed. Requests for a medical leave require thorough and credible documentation by an appropriate health care provider. These professional staff will then make a recommendation to the Dean of Student Affairs as to whether the leave is warranted and create a written plan for what needs to be accomplished during the leave. When students are placed on medical leave, all grades for the semester are noted as 'W' withdrawn. Students found responsible for violations of the College's Honor Code will receive any grades that are a part of Honor Council sanctions.  Student athletes should consult with the Director of Athletics or the compliance officer to determine if a medical leave will impact their NCAA eligibility.  International students should consult with the Director of International Student and Scholar Services regarding the effect of a medical leave on their immigration status.  44  Students receiving financial aid (grants, loans, and/or scholarships) should consult with the Office of Financial Aid before requesting a medical leave to determine the impact on their financial aid when they return.  Students on any type of leave are not eligible to enroll in the student insurance plan. Eligibility requirements of the plan stipulate that the student must be a full-time undergraduate College of Liberal Arts student taking a minimum of 12 credit hours and must actively attend classes for at least the first 31 days after the date for which coverage is purchased. These requirements are not established by Rollins College, but by the student insurance company and are standard across most if not all student insurance plans.  If students have other considerations, such as, Honors Degree Program status or course requirements for a major, they should consult with academic departments and advisors.  Students on medical leave are not automatically reinstated to Rollins College. The student will be asked to provide documentation and a written recommendation from an appropriate health care provider to the Dean of Student Affairs confirming the student has completed all treatment recommendations and that the student's health will support a successful return to full-time academic work on a residential campus. The Dean will present this information to the Reinstatement Committee for consideration of and planning for the student's return. Both student and parent must review and agree to the requirements outlined on the Contract for Success before reinstatement. No academic credit earned during a medical leave will be transferable back to the College.  All written documents for requests regarding a return from medical leave must be received by June 1 for fall semester and November 1 for spring semester.  If students are not prepared to return to the campus in the semester following 12 months of medical leave, they must request in writing an extension of the medical leave. This request should be submitted to the Dean of Student Affairs and should include specific information about the student's need for more time away.  The College may require a student to take a medical leave of absence if, in the judgment of the Dean of Student Affairs and the professional staff of the Division, the student: (a) poses a threat to the lives or safety of himself/herself or other members of the Rollins community; (b) has a medical or psychological problem which cannot be properly treated in the College setting; or (c) has evidenced a medical condition or behavior that seriously interferes with the student's ability to function and/or seriously interferes with the educational pursuits of other members of the Rollins community.  Students will not be granted more than two (2) medical leaves, each of one (1) year duration, for a total of not more than two (2) years.  [Note: In making the decision to require a student to take a medical leave, the Dean of Student Affairs must act out of concern for the student and his or her rights, concern for the other students, and concern for the College as a whole. The Dean will have to consider whether the College is able to provide the level of care and guidance needed, whether there is a likelihood that the student will pose a threat to himself/herself or others, and/or to what 45  extent the student seriously interferes with the rights of the others in the community to carry on their educational pursuits.]  For both voluntary and required leaves, the policy on refunds as posted by the Bursar will apply.  Readmission Requirements for Medical Leave  If a student must leave Rollins for medical reasons, he or she must take sufficient time away to adequately address the issues that necessitated the leave. Students who depart the College after the tenth week of classes in any semester may not return until after the expiration of both the semester during which leave was taken and the next full fall or spring semester, i.e., a student who takes a medical leave in December, if readmitted on petition, may not return until the fall of the following school year.  During this absence, the College expects the student to undergo professional health-care treatment as the primary method of resolving the problem. Failure to seek ongoing treatment of a kind appropriate to the health problems will raise serious doubt as to the student's readiness to resume student status. In such a case, the College may withhold admission until such time that appropriate treatment has been received.  A student on medical leave who wishes to return, must initiate a request for readmission by writing a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs detailing what has been accomplished during the absence. The student must also provide supporting documentation from a healthcare professional that addresses the following: the specific diagnosis that precipitated the need for care; the treatment plan; gains that were made as a result of the treatment; the readiness of the students to return to Rollins and the potential impact of the intellectual, physical, and personal demands of being a full-time residential student; any special conditions under which the student should be readmitted; and a recommended treatment plan to support the student's transition back to campus. To facilitate the decision for readmission, the student must grant permission for the off campus healthcare provider to consult with the appropriate professional at Rollins, i.e., the Director of Counseling and Psychological Services or the Director of Health Services. Requests for readmission and the supporting documentation are due no less than three (3) weeks prior to the first day of classes for the fall and spring semesters.  The information gathered is reviewed by a committee comprised of the Dean of Student Affairs, the Director of Counseling and Psychological Services, the Director of Health Services, and the Director of Residential Life. When a student is permitted to return, special conditions or requirements may be outlined, and upon return, the student is expected adhere to the prescribed conditions or requirements. Failure to do so may result in the student's dismissal from the College. The decision to readmit a student from a health leave of absence is a provisional judgment which may be reversed if a student fails to be a responsible member of the Rollins community.  HAMILTON HOLT SCHOOL STUDENT APPEALS COMMITTEE The Student Appeals Committee of the Hamilton Holt School meets approximately once a month to review student academic appeals related to policy and procedures. The committee 46  is composed of Holt School staff, including the dean. Student appeals must be submitted in writing by the 15th of the month to be considered at the next meeting. Appeals are accepted online only at www.rollins.edu/evening/documents/forms/holt-appeal.html. Appeals should detail the circumstances or the issue(s), clearly state the student’s request, and substantiating documentation on official letterhead as appropriate (e.g., physician statements, employer verifications, etc.). By submitting an appeal, the student understands the Committee reserves the right to discuss the appeal with academic or administrative personnel as deemed appropriate and necessary for fair consideration. Decisions by the Committee are final. Students will be informed in writing as to the outcome of their appeal.  REPEATED COURSE Students may repeat courses regardless of the grades earned; however, students will only earn credit hours for the course one time. In most cases, repeated courses will not be covered by financial aid. All grades will be calculated in the GPA, and all courses and grades will be part of the official academic transcript.  CREDIT/NO-CREDIT OPTION The credit/no-credit option is used for certain preparatory courses and internships and to allow students to learn without the pressure of working toward a specific grade. Some courses will be graded on a credit/no-credit basis only. Students electing to take a graded course on a credit/no-credit basis must notify the Holt School in writing no later than two weeks after the beginning of the fall or spring terms, and one week after the beginning of the summer term. The grade of credit will not be included in the GPA but will be given academic credit. A student may not subsequently receive a grade for a course elected to be taken credit/no-credit. To receive a credit, a student must earn at least a “C-” in the course. Courses in the major/minor field and courses used to fulfill general education requirements may not be taken credit/no-credit unless an exception has been approved and all students in the course are graded on that basis.   Generally, no more than one course per term may be taken on a credit/no-credit basis, and a maximum of four such courses (the equivalent of 16 semester hours) will count for graduation. Music majors/minors are exempt from this limitation based upon the requirements of their program. All other exemptions must be requested and approved in writing.  ONE-TIME LATE CREDIT/NO-CREDIT DECLARATION Students may also exercise a one-time option of late credit/no-credit. In this option, students are permitted to declare a class late credit/no credit before the final exam period for the term in which they are enrolled. This option is available for one course, and for one time only during a student’s career at Rollins. A student may not subsequently receive a grade for a course elected to be taken credit/no credit.  CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS Second Year (Sophomore)   30 semester hours Third Year (Junior)   60 semester hours Fourth Year (Senior) 100 semester hours  47  PERMISSION TO TAKE COURSES IN ANOTHER PROGRAM Holt School students who are degree seeking may request permission from their advisors to take a specific course in another program conducted by the College under the following conditions:  1. Only one course per year after being a Holt School student for at least one year. The Director of Student Services in exceptional cases may waive this rule. 2. A maximum of five Holt School students per day course will be permitted in any non-cross-listed course. 3. A student must be concurrently enrolled in Holt School courses in order to take a course in the College of Liberal Arts, unless special permission is obtained from the Director of Student Services and Registrar. If a student subsequently withdraws from all Holt School courses, he or she must also withdraw from the College of Liberal Arts course.  Courses taken in another program to complete a student’s requirements will be charged at the Holt School rate. This policy does not apply to cross-listed courses that are open to all students at the tuition of the division in which they are enrolled. (Cross-listed courses are designated with an “X” suffix in the section number.)   Students with senior ranking and with a 3.3 or better cumulative GPA may enroll for one Master of Liberal Studies elective course each semester provided that they maintain a “B” or better in each attempted course. Graduate tuition fees will be applied. Course will not count toward the major or general education requirement.  Students from other Rollins programs taking Holt School courses for completion of general education or major requirements should obtain written approval from their program prior to registration for Holt School courses. Consult a program coordinator for further details. Students from other Rollins programs must have a 2.0 institutional GPA and be in good academic standing to participate in Holt School courses.  GRADES A student’s work in a completed course is evaluated and recorded by letters based upon the following principles:  Grade A is reserved for work that is exceptional in quality and that shows keen insight, understanding, and initiative.  Grade B is given for work that is consistently superior and that shows interest, effort, or originality.  Grade C is a respectable grade; a “C” average (2.00) is required for matriculation and for graduation. It reflects consistent daily preparation and completion in a satisfactory manner of all work required in the course.  Grade D is the lowest passing grade. It is below the average necessary for meeting graduation requirements and ordinarily is not accepted for transfer by other institutions.  Grade F is failing. 48   The letter grades are assigned quality points as follows:    Quality   Quality Grade  Points  Grade  Points  A    4.00 D-  .67 A-    3.67 F  0 B+    3.33 HF  0 Honors Failure B     3.00 WF  0 Withdrew Failing B-    2.67 I  Incomplete C+    2.33 R  Deferred C    2.00 W  Withdrew Passing C-     1.67 NC  0 No Credit  D+  1.33  CR  0 Credit  D  1.00    INCOMPLETE WORK The grade “I” is assigned temporarily if the work is incomplete at the end of the course because of circumstances beyond the control of the student. It is the responsibility of the student to complete and submit a Contract for an Incomplete Grade www.rollins.edu/evening/documents/forms/IncompleteGradeContract.pdf prior to the conclusion of the course. The contract specifies the work that is to be done and the deadline for submission (up to 60 days from the last published date of the term). Instructors may, in exceptional circumstances, grant an extension of up to 60 additional days. Incompletes that are unresolved or unreported at the end of the deadline will automatically change to “F.” Only the Registrar and the Holt Student Appeals Committee, with the approval of the instructor, may change a grade to “I” after formal grades have been received. Such a change would be approved only in the most exceptional of circumstances.  Faculty may not assign a grade of 'I' without the Contract for an Incomplete Grade, nor may a faculty member not assign a grade, a de facto Incomplete. Faculty who fail to submit a grade for a student by the deadline set by the College will be penalized at the discretion of the Dean.  GRADE APPEAL PROCESS Students wishing to appeal a grade will first consult with their instructor. If the student is dissatisfied with the results of that consultation and wishes to pursue the matter further, the student will meet with the chair of the department, who in turn must inform the instructor of the substance of the student’s appeal. The department chair acts as a mediator to attempt to resolve any disagreements and consults with the instructor about the grading process. Only the course instructor has the authority to change the grade. (Should the instructor be the chair of the department, a tenured member of the department will be selected by the department to serve as mediator? If this is not possible, then the Holt School Dean or Registrar will serve in this capacity.)  49  Perceived or actual differences in grading policies or standards between instructors that are not a violation of College policies are not a basis for further appeal. Further appeals beyond the chair of the department will be allowed only when the student can furnish evidence that the final grade was affected by the student’s opinion or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards, bias based upon matters unrelated to academic standards, or the failure of the instructor to follow his or her own stated policies or College policies.  If these conditions are met, the student may proceed with the appeal to the Student Appeals Committee by submitting a Student Appeals Form within 90 days of completion of the course. The Student Appeals form may be found online at www.rollins.edu/evening/documents/forms/holt-appeal.html. The Registrar on behalf of the Student Appeals Committee will request from the department chair a written account of the mediation process described above and its results, if any. The Registrar may also request any other appropriate documentation. The Registrar prepares all documents related to the case for submission to the Student Appeals Committee. The Student Appeals Committee will review all documents and make additional inquiries if necessary before reaching a decision. After such review, the decision of the committee is final.  DEAN’S AND PRESIDENT’S LISTS Students taking two or more graded courses through the Holt School who achieve a 3.50 – 3.74 average with no incomplete or reserved grades for any given semester will be placed on the Dean’s List if their cumulative GPA is 2.0 or higher. Students meeting the same criteria with a semester GPA of 3.75 or above will be placed on the President’s List. Dean’s and President’s List recognition is noted on the student’s transcript. Upon remoal of an incomplete or deferred grade, students who meet the requirments are added to the lists.  GRADUATION There are three graduation dates per academic year (August 31, December 31, and the date of commencement in May). All graduates receiving the Bachelor of Arts degree within an academic year are invited and encouraged to participate in the annual May commencement. Participation in the annual commencement is limited to those students completing all degree requirements as of May.   Petition to Graduate All graduating students are required to submit a Petition to Graduate one year prior to their last term. The Petition will be reviewed by an academic advisor to ensure all degree requirements are satisfied by graduation. Each student will be charged a graduation fee $60. Diplomas are not issued for students who do have a Petition to Graduate on file.   Graduation with Distinction Students completing the final 70 semester hours of degree requirements in residence (institutional hours) at Rollins College may qualify for graduation with honors provided that the appropriate cumulative GPA is achieved.     50  Honors are as follows:  3.50 – 3.69  Cum Laude  3.70 – 3.89  Magna Cum Laude  3.90 – 4.00  Summa Cum Laude  A student’s transcript will bear the appropriate honors designation, and it will be announced at Commencement.  Appeal to Participate in Commencement  A student may appeal to participate in the ceremony without all completing all graduation requirements when the following conditions are met: 1) The student has an overall GPA of 2.0 and a 2.0 GPA in the major and minor both at the time of petition and at the time of Commencement; and 2) The student presents a viable plan, including documentation of course availability, consisting of no more than one course (4-6) semester hours. The deadline to request to participate in commencement and be included in the commencement program is due April 15th. Appeals received and approved after April 15th  will not be included in the commencement program.Forms are available online at www.rollins.edu/evening/documents/forms/holt-appeal.html. Decisions are made by the Hamilton Holt School Appeals Committee.  College honors, honors in the major field, nor any other College awards to graduating students will be neither recorded in programs, ascribed to student academic records, nor announced during ceremonies for any student who has not completed all graduation requirements at the time of Commencement. The student’s graduation date noted on the diploma will reflect a date after the degree requirrments have been met. ACADEMIC PROBATION AND DISMISSAL  Satisfactory Academic Progress  Hamilton Holt School students are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 to remain in good academic standing and demonstrate progress toward accomplishment of academic goals.  Academic Warning  All students will be reviewed after their first semester in the Hamilton Holt School. Students with a GPA below 2.0 will be placed on academic warning and will be academically dismissed after two semesters if the GPA remains below 2.0.   Academic Probation Students who have attempted three or more semesters at Rollins College and have a cumulative GPA of below 2.0 will be placed on academic probation.   Dismissal 1. A student who has been placed on academic probation must raise his or her cumulative GPA to 2.0 or be eligible for dismissal from the College. The probationary student must attain this average by the end of the third consecutive 51  regular term after being placed on probation (regular terms are fall, spring, and summer); or by the end of his or her fifth course after being placed on probation—whichever comes first. (Note: Students receiving Federal Veterans’ aid must attain a 2.0 cumulative GPA by the end of the second consecutive regular term after being placed on probation or the VA will be notified of unsatisfactory progress so the VA can terminate benefits.)  2. A probationary student becomes eligible for dismissal if in any term he or she fails to show progress toward achieving a 2.0 by failing to maintain at least a 2.0 term-GPA during that term.  3. Students dismissed from the Holt School or any other College program are dismissed from all programs of the College.  4. Students who are academically dismissed have 10 days to appeal the decision in writing.  Academically dismissed students may apply for readmission after one calendar year has elapsed. Dismissed students are strongly encouraged to complete at least one year of acceptable coursework (in most cases, B or better grades) at another accredited institution of higher education prior to requesting readmission to the Holt School. They should discuss this option with their Holt School academic adviser to ensure that appropriate courses are completed. Readmission decisions are made by Hamilton Holt School Student Appeals Committee.    52  ACADEMIC CONDUCT  ACADEMIC HONOR CODE  The Philosophy of the Academic Honor Code Integrity and honor are central to the Rollins College mission to educate its students for responsible citizenship and ethical leadership. Rollins College requires adherence to a code of behavior that is essential for building an academic community committed to excellence and scholarship with integrity and honor. Students, faculty, staff, and administration share the responsibility for building and sustaining this community.  Each student matriculating into Rollins College must become familiar with the Academic Honor System. The College requires that students be able and willing to accept the rights and responsibilities of honorable conduct, both as a matter of personal integrity and as a commitment to the values to which the College community commits itself. It is the responsibility of instructors to set clear guidelines for authorized and unauthorized aid in their courses. It is the responsibility of students to honor those guidelines and to obtain additional clarification if and when questions arise about possible violations of the Honor Code.  The Honor Pledge and Reaffirmation Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor—honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility—particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:  The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully, and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others.   This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement: “On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.” Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.  53  Definitions of Academic Honor Code Violations Students are expected to conduct themselves with complete honesty in all academic work and campus activities. Violations of the Academic Honor Code include, but are not limited to the following:  1. PLAGIARISM. Offering the words, facts, or ideas of another person as your own in any academic exercise. 2. CHEATING. Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in an academic exercise. This includes sharing knowledge of previously administered or current tests. The keeping of tests, papers, and other assignments belonging to former students is prohibited. Use of external assistance (e.g., books, notes, calculators, conversations with others) in completing an “in class” or “take home” examination, unless specifically authorized by the instructor, is prohibited. 3. UNAUTHORIZED COLLABORATION. Collaboration, without specific authorization by the instructor, on homework assignments, lab reports, exam preparations, research projects, take home exams, essays, or other work for which you will receive academic credit. 4. SUBMISSION OF WORK PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COURSE. Turning in the same work, in whole or in part, to two or more instructors, without the consent of the instructors in both courses. 5. FABRICATION. Misrepresenting, mishandling, or falsifying information in an academic exercise. For example, creating false information for a bibliography, inventing data for a laboratory assignment, or representing a quotation from a secondary source (such as a book review or a textbook) as if it were a primary source. 6. FACILITATING ACADEMIC DISHONESTY. Helping another student commit an act of academic dishonesty. 7. VIOLATION OF TESTING CONDITIONS. Looking at other students’ answers, allowing other students to look at your test, and working past allotted time are just a few examples where test conditions may be considered to be violated. 8. LYING. Lying is the making of a statement that one knows to be false with the intent to deceive. It includes actions such as (a) lying to faculty, administrators, or staff; (b) falsifying any College document or record by mutilation, addition, deletion, or forgery; or (c) lying to a member of the Honor Council or judicial affairs officer. 9. FAILURE TO REPORT AN HONOR CODE VIOLATION. Failure to report occurs when a student has knowledge of or is witness to an act in violation of the Academic Honor Code and does not report it within five class days.   Reporting a Violation Because academic integrity is fundamental to the pursuit of knowledge and truth and is the heart of the academic life of Rollins College, it is the responsibility of all members of the College community to practice it and to report apparent violations. All students, faculty, and staff are required to report violations in writing to the Academic Honor Council for disposition. Referrals will be made through the Director of Student Services at the Holt School office.  54  1. If a faculty member has reason to believe that a violation of the Academic Honor Code has occurred, he/she may have an initial meeting with the student to determine if a violation has occurred. If the faculty member believes that a violation has occurred, he/she is required to report it. This initial meeting is to clarify if a violation has occurred and not to determine if a known violation is to be reported.  2. If a student has reason to believe that a violation of academic integrity has occurred, he/she is required to report it to the Academic Honor Council. The student that has witnessed a violation can, but is not required to, encourage the student suspected of the violation to self-report. If the student refuses to self-report, then the student that witnessed the violation must report it to the Academic Honor Council. 3. Staff members that believe they have witnessed a violation must refer the case to the Honor Council for disposition.   Complaints must be made in writing and filed with the Hamilton Holt School Director of Student Services. These complaints are then forwarded to the Academic Honor Council. Allegations must be submitted in writing within 10 days of the discovery of the alleged violation. Complaints against graduating seniors must be submitted by the date senior grades are due to allow time for an investigation before graduation. The complaint should indicate all relevant details, including names of witnesses and must be signed. Submissions may also be made online.  For additional information, please visit the Holt Academic Honor Code website: www.rollins.edu/evening/about/academic-honor-code.html.  COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND RESPONSIBILITY The Office of Community Standards & Responsibility strives for a fair and just community by promoting student responsibility, accountability, and ethical decision making. Community Standards & Responsibility seek to facilitate individual awareness and assist students in actively engaging as responsible members of their various communities. The Code of Community Standards is a document that explains Rollins College policy and procedure. It is meant to educate, inform, and assist students as they approach good decision-making. The Code of Community Standards is published annually on the Rollins Community Standards & Responsibility website at www.rollins.edu/community-standards-responsibility/.   Sexual Misconduct and Harassment As a recipient of Federal funds, the College is required to comply with Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities. Sexual misconduct and harassment, as defined in this policy, is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. Rollins is committed to providing programs, activities and an educational environment free from sex discrimination. The Sexual Misconduct and Harassment policy is published on the Rollins web site www.rollins.edu/sexual-misconduct/index.html.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY The College’s policy on intellectual property can be found in the Rollins College Faculty Handbook located on the website of the Human Resources Office at www.rollins.edu/hr/policies/docs/general-policies/010000.pdf. This policy is meant to 55  encourage and support faculty, staff, and student research; to protect the rights and interests of College constituents as well as the College itself; and to provide College constituents with information that will guide understanding of intellectual property and its application at Rollins College. All faculty (full-time and adjunct), staff, student employees, and students, as well as non-employees who participate or intend to participate in teaching and/or research or scholarship projects at Rollins College are bound by this policy.   Rollins College is committed to complying with all applicable laws regarding copyright and other forms of intellectual property. Furthermore, this policy shall not be interpreted to limit the College’s ability to meet its obligations for deliverables under any contract, grant, or other arrangement with third parties, including sponsored research agreements, license agreements, and the like.   Questions of ownership or other matters pertaining to materials covered by this policy shall be resolved by the Provost (or his or her designee) in consultation with others, as appropriate. In the event that resolution of such matters becomes controversial, the Provost (or his/her designee) will convene an Intellectual Property Committee as described in Section B, Patents.  TRANSCRIPTS In compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) as amended, transcripts cannot be issued without student written or electronic consent; therefore, the Office of Student Records requires that all official requests for transcripts be made by electronic authentication via the Credentials, Inc., (TranscriptsPlus) ordering system. Phone requests are not accepted.  Requesting Transcripts All transcripts must be requested online through the Credentials, Inc. (TranscriptsPlus) ordering system where Credentials, Inc.

The Act is as follows:  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students." 56   Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.  Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.  Parents or eligible students have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by [Rollins College] to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington,  Expository Writing Assumes that writing is a primary way to understand, organize, and give meaning to experience, and is thus an integral part of a liberal arts curriculum.

ACCELERATED PROGRAMS  3/2 Accelerated Management Program The Rollins College 3/2 Accelerated Management Program (AMP) combines a four-year Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree and a two-year Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree into a five-year program. The first three years of the combined program are completed in Rollins' Hamilton Holt School; the remaining two years are completed in Rollins' Crummer Graduate School of Business in the Early Advantage MBA (EAMBA) program. Successful students earn their BA and their EAMBA in five rather than six years. Learn more about the Rollins MBA programs at www.rollins.edu/business. Program Requirements Students participating in the 3/2 Accelerated Management Program (AMP) must adhere to specific academic and experiential requirements during their three years in the 14  Hamilton Holt School, and acceptance into the EAMBA program at the conclusion of the third year is conditional upon the satisfactory completion of these requirements:   Term grade point average of 3.2 or better while participating in the program, and a cumulative grade point average of 3.2 or better by the end of the third year.   Attend all scheduled AMP seminars during the first three years.   Complete at least one internship by the end of the third year.   Complete all general education curriculum, major, and minor (if declared) requirements by the end of the third year.   At least 109 earned semester hours by the end of the third year.   Complete graduation petition in spring term of third year.   A score of at least 600 on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) by the end of the fall term of the third year.   Submit an application to the Crummer EAMBA Program including an interview process. Admission is very selective and is based on a combination of rigor of academic program, academic performance, and standardized test scores.   Annual Review The 3/2 Accelerated Management advisor reviews students' records each semester to monitor program compliance. Students who fail to adhere to the stated requirements are eligible for dismissal from the 3/2 program but would continue in their undergraduate program toward the completion of their Bachelor of Arts degree. Students can also withdraw from the 3/2 program at any time.  Admission Requirements Interested students have two opportunities to apply for admission to the 3/2 Accelerated Management Program—while still in high school or at the completion of their first semester at Rollins (25 credit hours or less). Students still in high school should contact Admissions at 407-646-2232 for more information.   Advanced Standing Credit Students may receive advanced standing by several means. This includes but is not limited to credit for Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and dual enrollment courses. Please contact the Holt School Office for additional information.  Advanced Placement (AP) Students are awarded four (4) semester hours of credit for each AP examination on which they earn a score of four (4) or five (5). Students who present scores of four (4) or higher on the AP English Language and Composition examination or the AP English Literature and Composition examination are exempt from satisfying the College's Writing general education curriculum requirement. Students who present scores of four (4) or five (5) on the AP Calculus AB, Calculus BC, or Statistics examinations are exempt from satisfying the College's Quantitative Reasoning general education curriculum requirement.     15  International Baccalaureate (IB) Credit for IB course work is granted for students with an IB diploma, on a course by course basis. Students with an IB Diploma and a score of thirty (30) or better will be awarded one year (thirty-two [32] semester hours) of credit. Students without the Diploma, or with the Diploma and a score of less than thirty (30), will be awarded eight (8) semester hours for each higher-level score of five (5) or better and four (4) semester hours for each score of four (4) or better (on a higher or subsidiary level), to a maximum of twenty-four (24) semester hours. General education credit will be awarded as appropriate, to be determined by suitable bodies. Advanced placement will be awarded for major courses, subject to departmental approval. Students who present both IB and AP work in the same subject area will not be awarded double credit.   Other Examinations Grades of 'A' through 'C' on most British GSE A-level exams earn two course credits, eight (8) semester hours, per examination.  Transfer Credit Transfer students must meet all general education curriculum and major requirements to earn a Rollins College degree. The Hamilton Holt School reviews and evaluates courses taken at other institutions, determines courses/credit to be accepted, and prepares a Transfer Course Evaluation. The evaluation lists all courses accepted and any general education requirements those courses fulfill.   In the evaluation of transfer credit, four (4) semester hours equals one Rollins course. Transfer credit is awarded for coursework taken at regionally-accredited (Middle States, North Central, New England, Northwest, Southern, and Western Association) institutions, or the equivalent international institution. The major department makes decisions regarding fulfillment of major requirements through transfer credit. Transfer credit is not awarded for courses with a grade below “C-.” All transfer courses must be officially letter-graded by the originating institution, with the exception of internships which may be graded Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit. No more than the equivalent of sixty-four (64) semester hours of lower-level transfer credit are accepted. Students with sixty (60) semester hours of credit enter Rollins College with junior standing, but may need additional credits to fulfill the degree requirements. All official transcripts must be received prior to registering for the second semester. A registration hold will be placed on the student’s record until the required transcript is received.  For additional policies related to degree completion, please see Residency requirement.  Rollins College participates in an articulation agreement between the Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida (ICUF) and the Division of Florida Colleges. Through this participation, students who enter Rollins with a completed Associate of Arts (AA) degree from a Florida state college matriculate with junior standing and are usually able to transfer a total of sixty (60) semester hours, provided that they meet the same standards and program requirements as native Rollins students.  16  As part of the College's participation in the ICUF Articulation Agreement, students with the A.A. degree from a Florida state is considered to have met general education requirements.   A student’s previous grade-point-average (GPA) does not carry forward; a Rollins GPA is determined only on the basis of courses completed at Rollins.  Military Credit Credit is given for USAFI or DANTES courses and some military specialty schools.

Requirements for the Major (12) Core Courses:   Humanities: Ancient   Humanities: Ancient Western Civilization has its inception in the ancient world. We will study the art, architecture, philosophy and literature of classical Greece, seeing how they differed and developed from 135  previous cultures, how they were transformed in Roman civilization, and what impact they have made on the modern world.   "
HUM 304," Humanities: Medieval and Renaissance   Humanities: Medieval and Renaissance The close of ancient Roman civilization corresponds to the rise of Christian culture in Western Europe. This time, which we call the beginning of the Middle Ages, saw the Christian Church, with its changing theological positions, become the sole arbiter of style, techniques, and subject in the arts and literature. This aesthetic dynasty began to diminish in the late Middle Ages until classicism and humanism re-emerged in the Western civilization during the Italian Renaissance. In this course students will investigate the development of Medieval theology and Renaissance humanism to determine how this changing relationship between mankind and its god influenced Western creativity. Prerequisite: "
HUM 305," Humanities: Classicism and Romanticism   Humanities: Classicism and Romanticism Between 1650 and 1850 two conflicting modes of thought influenced the humanities. Prior to 1790 the classical tradition predominated, while after 1790 the romantic came to prominence, yet neither succeeded in overwhelming the other. This course explores the impact of these two traditions on the history of the period 1650-1850, especially on art, music, literature, and philosophy. First, we will explore the underlying philosophy of these two traditions and their various means of expression. We will then observe the impact of classicism on the enlightenment and the factors which created a shift to romanticism in post-revolutionary Europe.   "

The student will collect the material to demonstrate the growth of his or her intellectual skills and an understanding of the interdisciplinary relationships of the disciplines within the Humanities major. The portfolio will be examined by the program director at the conclusion of the student’s undergraduate years to determine if the student can demonstrate an ability to develop an interdisciplinary synthesis of the materials presented in the Humanities program. Submission of the portfolio is required prior to graduation. Students will be provided with a detailed description of the portfolio when they declare a Humanities major.  Final Project Each student must complete a research project in connection with the last required core course in which he or she enrolls during the student’s senior year. This project will be in lieu of other major writing assignments or research papers for the course. The project will consist of an extensive research paper that will incorporate material from the course and at least one other non-core course taken for the Humanities major. The project must integrate material from various disciplines. A student must inform the Holt School advisor at the time of registration that this course is the last needed for graduation. At the time, the student will be given guidelines for the final project. The student must notify the core-82  course instructor at the first class meeting of the student’s intention to complete this requirement. Additionally, the student must meet with the director of the Humanities major to make certain that the proposed project fulfills the requirement of the major. Students who have completed the core requirements at another institution or who are unable to enroll in the final core course during the senior year must arrange to complete the project requirement through an independent study supervised by one of the full-time Rollins faculty teaching a core course. This independent study would be in addition to the other courses required for the major.  Because the final interdisciplinary project for the Humanities major requires an extensive amount of research, reflection, and writing, some students may find it difficult to complete the project during the summer semester. A student whose last core course is offered during the summer semester may have the option therefore of completing the final project as an independent study during the fall or spring semester of the senior year. The requirements for independent study would be the same as for students who have completed the core requirements at another institution or who are unable to enroll in the final course during the senior year. This independent study would represent a thirteenth course in the major and could not be used to substitute for other requirements of the program.  Requirements for the Minor (8) Students minoring in Humanities will take the four core humanities courses plus one in each of the areas specified above. Students completing the minor in Humanities must fulfill the same requirement for the portfolio and final project as majors.    83  INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (Major, Minor)  The growing international interdependence among nations makes a significant impact on the daily lives of U.S. residents, which means it is more important than ever that global citizens be well informed about the cultural, political, economic, and business institutions of other countries.
