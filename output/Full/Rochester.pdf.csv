The Primary Writing Requirement is the College’s first step in drawing students into our community of researchers and writers. Typically, the Primary Writing Requirement is satisfied by passing Reasoning and Writing in the College (, , , , Reasoning and Writing in the College, or . The substitute course may not also be used to fulfill the Upper-Level Writing Requirement. Transfer students who have com-pleted a  equivalent at another institution and received a “B” or better may petition to use this course to satisfy the Primary Writing Requirement.

Our distinguished faculty shares a commitment to excellence in teaching and working closely with students to develop historical literacy, criti-cal thinking, writing, and research skills. We use cutting-edge meth-ods to connect the present with the past and to consider human experience across time and space. Because an understanding of the past is crucial to a wide array of political, economic, literary, artistic, anthropological, and humanistic studies, taking history courses can also benefit students majoring in these disciplines.  The department offers programs of study leading to the BA degree, the BA degree with honors and (on the graduate level) master’s and doctorate degrees. We also offer a minor in history. Non-majors are welcome in almost all history courses and typically become enthusiastic, successful participants. The history concentration is valuable not only for those intent on becoming professional historians but also for those interested in pursuing careers in law, politics, secondary school teaching, museum studies, historic preservation, and communications, among many other fields. The department also offers 15 clusters for non-majors to satisfy the social science divisional requirement in the Rochester Curriculum. These clusters consist of carefully selected sets of courses and include both geographical (e.g., American History) and topical (e.g., History of Science, Technology, and Medicine) groupings. Students who wish to substitute a course in a cluster can consult the department’s director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Laura Smoller (laura.smoller@rochester.edu).  The department offers a wide range of undergraduate courses encompassing social, economic, cultural, intellectual, political, and digital approaches to historical problems and periods. Most 100- and 200-level courses in the department are accessible to students with little background knowledge in history. In addition, the faculty offers 300-level seminars and courses designed for majors and students interested in exploring more specialized historical topics (200-level courses designated with a “W” and all 300W courses meet the college’s upper-level writing requirement). Each student concentrating in history will have a faculty advisor. The choice of that advisor will ideally match a student’s particular historical interests and will be made in consultation with the director of Un-dergraduate Studies. This advisor will help prospective majors plan their programs. In addition, advisors serve as a resource for selecting courses, making changes to a major program, alerting students to special opportunities in the major (research opportunities, honors, internships, etc.), and offering advice on further study and work after graduation. The first step in declaring a history major is to con-sult with a faculty advisor. For the most current information about the history department and the faculty as well as requirements for a history major or minor, please visit our website, www.sas.rochester.edu/his/. You can also follow us on Facebook @UofRHistory Department or on Twitter @urhistorydept.Advice to First-Year StudentsThe department recommends that incoming first-year students enroll in one or more of the 100-level or 200-level regional or topi-cal courses prior to taking  or elective  or electiveCourses (Mechanical engineering courses available to first-year students) or cluster course, Reasoning and Writing in the College, or .

Section topics have ranged from “Adolescence: War or Peace” to “Searching for Whales: Myth, Science, and Ecological Sustainability” and cover a range of subjects and disciplines. The course provides instruction and practice in clear and effective writing and in constructing cogent and compelling arguments as students draft and revise numerous papers of different forms and lengths. Students consider the roles of audience and purpose in shaping the organization, style, and argu-mentative strategies of their own papers while they learn to become critical readers of their writing through peer critiques and revision and editing workshops.

We do not tell you which subjects to study—that choice is fully yours. Here you may safely explore courses of interest and not worry about having enough time to complete your academic program. This is true whether you select a major with 10 required courses or 20. To see how true this is, consider what might be pos-sible if you decide on one of the most time-consuming programs, a BS major in the biological sciences: you’ll complete “Reasoning and Writing in the College” and, as required by the major, a maximum of 11 biology courses, two semesters of calculus, four semesters of chemistry, two semesters of physics, and one course in a field related to biology, for a total of 21 courses. This leaves 11 courses for explo-ration, some of which will lead to fulfilling clusters. Many of you will choose majors with fewer requirements, leaving plenty of time for a cluster of particular interest to grow into a minor or second major. Beginning on page 12 of this handbook, you’ll find advice from each department that will help you select courses that match your interests and skill levels. Your choices will depend on several fac-tors, including your initial ideas about possible majors, your com-fort with exploring unknown subjects (give it a try!), departmental placement recommendations, and course availability (although this is not typically a problem). Here are some opportunities to consider as you read through this handbook and jot down courses you might take:Small, interactive courses, which allow you to work closely with faculty and meet other students with similar interests. We strongly recommend taking at least one small course your first semester.  Sequence.  (Spring) distribute the work of , students must earn a grade of “C” or higher.

CAS 170,") during the fall or spring semester of the first year. The class is limited in size to create an interactive and personalized experience. The innovative curriculum is designed to assist students in their transition to college through the study of American culture and values and successful study practices. Read-ings and short assignments are supplemented by on- and off-campus field trips, guest speakers, group activities, and discussion of current issues. The course carries two credits and may be combined with four additional full-credit courses.Learning across the DivisionsA great deal of the College’s innovative teaching and research takes place outside the confines of traditional departments, divisions, or even schools. As the list of interdisciplinary majors on page 4 shows, students can study new fields that have developed at the crossroads of existing disciplines (see also the list of approved minors on page 100). Cutting-edge work in public health–area studies, digital media studies, business, and other domains requires students to have in-depth knowledge in a blend of science, humanities, and social sci-ences fields. Sometimes students will take courses from multiple de-partments in the construction of their major; other times, the work they do in individual courses will represent a variety of disciplines.Many of the college’s newest majors are interdisciplinary. In digital media studies, for example, they pursue work in computer science, art, optics, and film and media studies. Majors in American studies take courses in the humanities and social sciences in depart-ments such as art history, English, history, and political science. East Asian studies majors work in language, anthropology, literature, and history, whereas audio music engineering requires students to study electrical and computer engineering, math and physics, music theory, and computer science.In addition, many individual courses take advantage of an interdisciplinary format. In some, students learn how to program computers while studying media history and theory; in others, they study musicianship and the art and science of sound recording.Academic HonestyAs first-year students, you are joining a university community com-mitted to the pursuit of excellence in learning, teaching, creativity, and research. Academic honesty is the cornerstone of that academic excellence, as it creates the necessary conditions of mutual trust and open communication that make intellectual inquiry and growth possible. The AS&E Academic Honesty Policy recognizes our shared obligation to promote academic honesty, establishes high standards of academic conduct, and requires each student to meet those standards.IN SUMMARY, you will complete for your degree:• a major with an average grade of C or better;• a divisional cluster in each of the two divisions outside the area of the major with an average grade of C or better  (although you may substitute a second major or a minor for a cluster in either or both of these two divisions);• the primary writing requirement (normally "

CHM 131," and most introductory (101) language courses are offered only in the fall semester.Academic Advising during Your First Year: During the summer prior to your arrival on campus, you will be assigned to an under-graduate advisor. Undergraduate advisors are faculty and staff who assist students in developing a preliminary academic plan, encour-age exploration of the Rochester Curriculum, introduce students to academic opportunities, and help students build relationships with other campus offices and programs. Undergraduate advisors help you navigate your college lives; they serve as guides as you begin your college journey; and they assist you in making good academic decisions. Undergraduate advisors recognize that many students arrive at college somewhat uncertain about their academic futures. They also understand that many other students arrive at college feeling very certain about their plans for their first year. Both of these scenarios are typical, and both are completely OK!  You can expect to meet with your undergraduate advisor several times during Orientation and once classes are under way, it is likely that you will meet several times each semester during your first year. Your undergraduate advisor is the person to speak with when you have questions about choosing classes and clusters, getting involved on campus, interacting with your professors and teaching assistants, Academic honesty means acting with truthfulness and sincerity in carrying out all aspects of our individual and collaborative work, maintaining ownership over our work, and acknowledging our debt to the work of others. Students should complete their work through their own honest efforts and expect and encourage honesty among their peers. Students can learn more about the academic honesty policy and test their self-knowledge with quizzes on the academic honesty website, www.rochester.edu/college/honesty/index.html.Introducing the Humanities CenterThe Humanities Center offers a home for any student interested in exploring the human experience across time and place. Located on the second floor of Rush Rhees Library, the newly constructed center welcomes not only undergraduates in humanities disciplines but also students in any major who are looking for new perspectives, new knowledge, and new interconnections. The center has room for studying, teaching, performing, and socializing as well as for col-laborating on all types of projects, including those that use digital technologies for humanistic inquiry.Undergraduates are welcome in center programs. These include a number of extracurricular workshops such as the Thursday Writers Lounge, the Classics Reading Group, and the monthly reading group on “Science, Technology, and Culture”; frequent public talks on topics ranging from gun violence to modern China; four lectures a year by distinguished scholars who address a common theme; student-led open-mic nights; and lunches with alumni who have excelled in careers related to their humanities background. The center offers information on Meliora Seminars for first-year students and supports undergraduate research. Join the community of the Humanities Center for great conversation in an environment that fosters great ideas!

List the courses you’ll need to take during your first year.)Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Exams: AP and IB award criteria, as you may have noticed, appear with the  departmental information. Students are notified of credit by the College Center for Advising Services. Those wishing to discuss either AP or IB credit should contact that office. If you have taken any AP or IB courses, please list the subject and grade that you received on each exam  (if known). Then, look up and record the placement information below.AP or IB Exam Score Rochester Placement(Note: The records of students with AP credit that is contingent upon the completion of a Rochester course are reviewed each summer  so that credit may be awarded appropriately.)Courses I am interested in:and academic support services such as tutoring. As your guide to college life at Rochester, your undergraduate advisor will refer you to a faculty member in a program or department for detailed information about your prospective major. If you have a specific question about an academic policy (e.g., whether you might be able to take an additional course in an upcoming semester), your under-graduate advisor will recommend that you meet with a professional advisor in the College Center for Advising Services. Many other advising resources exist as well, including peer advisors, advisors in the Gwen M. Greene Center for Career Education and Connec-tions, and study skills consultants, to name just a few examples.  At Rochester you will have an entire community of advisors.Academic Advising during Your Second Year (and Beyond): Upon official declaration of a major, usually at the end of the sopho-more year, you will be assigned a major advisor. Students intending to major in engineering can expect to stay with the same advisor assigned to them in their first year. Major advisors (typically faculty members) provide critical guidance in helping students understand course content and classroom expectations, identify opportunities for research and career development, and gain a deeper appreciation of their chosen academic discipline.  To make the most of your intellectual journey at Rochester, we encourage you to continue to build relationships with peers, staff, and faculty throughout your undergraduate years. For some stu-dents, the undergraduate advisor will continue to be an important source of information and support until graduation. Other stu-dents will find that the relationships they develop with faculty and staff later in their college career will be more frequently accessed sources of information. In both cases, it is important to recognize that Rochester has a variety of resources to support your academic journey; by seeking out conversations with others, you will enrich your own experience and develop a supportive and influential community of advisors.Connecting Courses and Careers: As you decide which courses to take, consider the connections these courses have to your interests and professional goals. Whether you are exploring career options  or have one in mind or need to fulfill prerequisite courses, your aca-demics will play a key role in the development of the knowledge and skills needed for your future. See page 94 for more information on connecting coursework and careers and how the Gwen M. Greene Center for Career Education and Connections can assist you in your exploration. Course Placement MethodsBiologyWhich section is right for you? or equivalent)• require laboratory attendance every other week (lab included in 4-credit course; see instructions for lab sign-up in online registration course description)• require workshop attendance (see instructions for workshop sign-up in online registration course description).FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[8College-level transfer credit: For the sake of coherence and uni-formity of instruction, the College prefers that its entering first-year students take all their courses, basic and advanced, from its own faculty as much as possible. With the exception of CEEB Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate work, the College does not recognize nor grant college credit for secondary school coursework or for courses taught in a secondary school by the secondary school’s own faculty for college credit.Credit may be granted to entering students for prior coursework taught on the campus of an accredited college or university and completed with a grade of “C” or higher. Upon receipt of the official transcript, the coursework will be evaluated to determine if it is equivalent in level and/or content to coursework at the University of Rochester. Please note that transfer credit for a writing course does not, in itself, satisfy the primary writing requirement; see Course Placement Methods, Primary Writing Requirement and Placement, page 9.

At Rochester, Meliora Seminars are small, selective courses for first-year students that  allow study of fascinating questions about being human in a  complex world: What is the nature of democracy? How do we communicate with one another? What is love? What is justice? How have artists and filmmakers addressed the problem of climate change? The goal is to create a collaborative and rich intellectual experience for students beginning their academic careers Rochester. The seminars are designed for first-year students and do not presume prior experience in the field.Each Meliora Seminar is unique, but common features include•  explicit attention to the relevance of course material to contempo-rary social issues•  community engagement through on- or off-campus dialogue with individuals or groups working on issues addressed in the seminars•  reading and discussion in small classes of 12–15 studentsMeliora Seminars count as regular, graded 4-credit courses and can be used in clusters, minors, and majors. In collaboration with the College’s Writing, Speaking and Argument program, the seminars are also preapproved as acceptable alternatives for students who peti-tion out of the  Theory I.

CLA 167M,"/ Democracy: Past and Present. (Instructor: Nick Gresens) What would “a government of the people, by the people, for the people” really look like? Is the right to vote sufficient to make a society democratic? Is majority rule any better than tyranny? Can people be trusted to rule themselves? In this course, we examine the first democracy—that of ancient Athens. We trace the historical development of democracy and explore the social factors and big ideas that shaped it into the form of government that almost every society in the world now looks to as a model. You learn about the various institutions that allowed Athenian society to function and discover what the Athenians thought about their great experiment, even if they thought it was a very bad idea. We also observe and dis-cuss some of our own government institutions so that we can better understand our system of government, both in what it shares with ancient Athens and how it differs. Who Owns the Past? (Meliora Seminar). As the recent destruction of the archaeological site of Palmyra in Syria and the removal of Confederate statues in New Orleans show, historical objects, monuments, and sites are not relegated to the past; instead, they are the building blocks of modern identities and politics. This course examines current issues concerning the ownership, protec-tion, and presentation of cultural heritage, including particularly archaeological and historical objects, monuments, and sites. The course begins with introductory information about archaeology, museum studies, and cultural heritage law. We then consider such questions as: Who decides what cultural heritage is significant? Who should determine how archaeological and historical sites are presented to the public? Should private individuals be allowed to purchase objects of historical or archaeological significance? What moral and ethical responsibilities do museums have? Who owns cultural objects taken in the context of warfare? This course requires an application.For more information, go to rochester.edu/college/aths/.UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS23]ART AND ART HISTORY“. . . in denying artists their rightful place in the public consciousness, we are in fact negating the most creative part of ourselves individually and collectively and in so doing are also damning our future to one without experimentation and the vision needed to give it meaning.”—Carol Becker (1997) “The Artist As Public Intellectual”Department OverviewThe Department of Art and Art History is dedicated to liberal education in the creation and historical study of the visual arts. Our offerings combine theory and practice and deploy interdisciplin-ary historical and conceptual frameworks across a wide range of interpretative techniques and forms. Undergraduate majors, minors, and concentrations in art history, visual studies, and studio art are available.  Through our undergraduate degree program in studio arts, students explore form, space, and function using traditional media and new technologies. Studio students may take courses in a variety of media, including painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography, and video.  Art history and visual studies students pursue courses in history and theory across visual media. In art history, students study the history of painting, sculpture, architecture, and other art forms from antiquity to the present covering a wide range of traditions and geographical regions across the world.   Students may undertake internships in Rochester’s diverse and rich cultural institutions. The department also offers the unique Art New York residential program in New York City.Studio Arts ProgramThe studio arts program of the Department of Art and Art His-tory focuses on the production, exhibition, and analysis of art. The facilities in Sage Art Center provide access to all the materials, supportive resources, faculty, and staff necessary for a rich studio experience. Our program is focused on contemporary approaches to art production and strives to produce technically adept students with an understanding of art’s place in the world. Our program of study invites, accommodates, and engages individuals with little or no previous art experience. It also provides a rich environment for thoroughly intensive study.  Studio art majors are vital participants in the activities of the department and the art community in general. Majors are expected to establish a presence at Sage Art Center that promotes an environ-ment conducive to rich, creative art production. By the senior year majors should be seen as valuable resources for the students in all introductory-level courses. While our introductory-level courses provide a foundation built on more prevalent art media—such as photography, painting, sculpture, video, collage, and drawing—the advanced-level courses make available the experimental and interdis-ciplinary approaches often used in contemporary art production.  Off-campus study opportunities are available for majors and non-majors alike. The Art New York program provides students with the opportunity to live and learn in New York City. A semester of internships and course work in this culturally rich environment is structured for any individual who wishes to enhance his or her knowledge of the world of contemporary art and culture with first-hand experience.  Study abroad is encouraged for majors and non-majors during a fall or spring semester in the University’s European Arts Internship program. In Europe, there are opportunities to work in institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Museum of Lon-don, and internships can be arranged in various locations, including Paris, Brussels, Rome, Bonn, and Madrid.Art History and Visual StudiesArt history and visual culture studies are areas of study in which the information and methodologies of many fields come together. The disciplines of art history/visual culture involve the analysis of works of art in many contexts—understanding form and why and how we make use of it. It is also the investigation of its historical contexts and modes of production. These inquiries include economic, social, and gender issues; problems of patronage and taste; and questions of exchange, reception, conservation, and restoration. Art historical studies draw upon adjunct areas of study such as cultural and intel-lectual history, psychology, literary criticism, religion, philosophy, sociology, archaeology, and the history of science. The history of art and visual culture studies are ideal for students who wish to acquire a general cultural understanding of global culture, to develop ana-lytical and writing skills, and to sharpen critical sensibilities.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsAt Sage Art Center, our 100-level courses provide a foundation for art media such as photography, painting, sculpture, video, and drawing, our 200-level courses make available the experimental and interdisciplinary approaches often utilized in contemporary art production. Advanced studio courses focus on interdisciplinarity, allowing students to expand their artistic expression to incorporate other interests and disciplines. Because studio class size is limited, first-year students should contact the department to enroll in courses.  Courses in art history are designed to give students an under-standing and appreciation of works of art, individually, in relation to each other, and in their social and historical contexts. Introductory courses cover broad historical periods and serve to introduce the methods and problems of art history. They are useful to both first-year and upper-class students who want a general overview. FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[24 Sophomores, juniors, and seniors, as well as first-year students who have had a course in art history or some other relevant prepara-tion, may begin taking art history courses at the 200 level, as well as the 100 level. The 200-level courses offer similar introductions but in much more defined areas. These are useful cognate courses for those students studying a specific period or culture in another discipline and are also the building blocks for any major or minor within the department. Seminars are indicated by the 300 level and are open to advanced students from other disciplines as well as to art history majors.International Baccalaureate (IB)Visual Arts—Students who receive a higher-level exam score of 6 or 7 are awarded up to four credits in studio arts upon completion of a 100-level course with a “B” or better.Advanced Placement (AP)If students receive a score of 4 or 5 on the Art History AP exam, credit is awarded after consultation with the department. Four advanced placement credit hours (with a score of 4 or 5) can be granted if a “B” or higher is earned in any 100-level studio course.ClustersStudents whose major is in the social sciences or natural sciences and engineering divisions are invited to pursue a cluster in art and art history. A brochure of our clusters is available in the departmental office. All studio and art history courses are included in at least one cluster. Be sure to check with the department directly.Courses Art HistoryFor course updates, go to www.rochester.edu/college/aah/courses/ah.html.Studio Art(A supplies fee of $50 is charged for each course.)For course updates, go to www.rochester.edu/college/aah/courses/sa.html.For more information, go to sas.rochester.edu/aah/.AUDIO AND MUSIC ENGINEERING“Imagine. Explore. Create.”Information about the MajorThe audio and music engineering (AME) major combines studies in engineering and applied sciences with music and audio production to give students a technically rigorous, design-based education in the field of audio, music, and sonic engineering. The curriculum is built on a foundation of basic math and science and integrates elements of music, audio content production, acoustics, fundamental engineer-ing science, signal processing hardware and software, electronics, and software engineering. Through a series of design and project courses integrated with their other coursework, students build a project portfolio throughout their studies capped by a senior design project. The bachelor of science in AME (BS AME) is offered.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsThe major requires completion of courses and portfolio projects in five subject areas: recording arts and sound design, acoustics, audio electronics, signal processing, and software design. The curricu-lum provides a broad education in the basics of audio and music engineering as well as in-depth studies and design experiences. Once completing the baccalaureate degree, our graduates are prepared to enter the field or pursue further study at the graduate level. Entering students with an interest in pursuing the AME program are assigned faculty advisors to help with academic program planning through-out their four years of studies.Typical First-Year ProgramFall Semester Spring Semester Who Owns the Past? As the recent destruction of the archaeological site of Palmyra in Syria and the removal of Confederate statues in New Orleans show, historical objects, monuments, and sites are not relegated to the past; instead, they are the building blocks of modern identities and politics.

The term “democracy” may be easy to de-fine, but it is much harder to determine what democracy looks like and how it is even able to function. In this course, we examine the first democracy—that of ancient Athens—which ran from roughly the end of the sixth century (with the reforms of Cleisthenes) to the second half of the fourth century (with the subjugation of the Greek mainland to the Macedonians). We explore the historical and social factors that helped it come into being, the various institutions that made Athenian society function democratically, and what the Athe-nians thought about their great experiment. Through this explora-tion, we—perhaps—come to better understand our modern world and our own system of government, which does not shy away from embracing the term—if not necessarily all the ideals of—democracy."

LIN 167M," Ecolinguistics: Language and Move-ment. (Instructors: Anne Wilcox, Solveiga Armoskaite) This new course is a combined investigation of linguistics and movement. In the context of sustainable living, the course examines how verbal and nonverbal expression manifest and shape overall well-being. A different theme will be addressed each year. The themes for this year are Knowledge and Expertise. The course addresses questions such as: What aspects of language create credibility? What does it mean to know something physically? How does movement lead to knowl-edge? How is expertise evident in language or in movement? What role does verbal and nonverbal language play in epistemology? This course is cross-listed in order to bring students interested in dance or linguistics together to deepen their study of human expression through added perspectives of the mutually fascinating subject of language."
EHU 167M," Climate Futures. (Instructor: Leila Nadir) Glacier ruins, extreme weather, rising sea levels, an ice age, and no polar bears. As artists, writers, filmmakers, and journalists work to make the often-imperceptible transformations wrought by climate change visible to the public, they deploy imagery, narratives, frames, and aesthetic strategies. Through studies of literature, film, art, and pop culture, this course examines visions of a future shaped by climate change. Topics include philosophical approaches to the Anthropo-cene (a new geologic era proposed by scientists), strategies deployed by documentary and Hollywood filmmakers, and new works of “climate fiction.” A central concern of this course is the relationship between science and the humanities in understanding the environ-ment. What are the roles of memory and imagination in the struggle to deal with the warming of Earth? Can the humanities save our planet? If climate change is unstoppable, how do we imagine what comes next?Spring 2019 Climate Futures. (Meliora Seminar) This course examines visions of the future produced by climate change through studies of literature, film, art, and pop culture. Topics include philosophical approaches to the Anthropocene (a new geologic era proposed by scientists), strategies deployed by documentary and Hollywood film, and writing from a new literary genre called “climate fiction.” A central concern of this course is the relationship between science and the humanities in understanding the environ-ment.

ENG 167M," The Outlaw Robin Hood: Resistance, Violence, and Social Change in Popular Culture. (Instructor: Tom Hahn) Draw-ing on resources from numerous disciplines, we examine questions about what drives or even justifies acting against or outside the law? In what ways does official culture bring the outlaw into being? Why and how do mainline popular culture and commercial entertain-ment celebrate defiance of the law? We examine the central issue of whether the outlaw hero enlarges the possibility of social change and reform or whether such fantasies impede change and actually affirm the status quo. Secondary readings include contemporary politi-cal and social theory as well as historical and literary criticism that address specific assigned texts. We inevitably address these concerns MELIORA SEMINARSFIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[14from our own current perspective, exploring the cult of the outlaw over the last half millennium and in post-Trump America. A crucial feature of the course is opportunities for hands-on interaction with actual artifacts that recorded and enshrined Robin Hood’s celebrity from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries: chap books, ballad collec-tions, boys’ and girls’ weeklies, sensational series, “serious” children’s literature, plays and pantomimes, musicals, and, more recently, young adult fantasy and literary fiction."
REL 167M," Love and Justice. (Instructor: Josh Dubler) Speak-ing in the tradition of Martin Luther King, activist-scholar Cornel West likes to say that “justice is what love looks like in public.” It feels encouraging to see love and justice as complementary facets of the same ethical impulse, but does this claim check out? If “all is fair in love and war,” then love would appear to sometimes lend itself to more brutal outcomes, and if “justice is blind,” then whatever love might animate justice must necessarily be tempered by more dispassionate forces. In intimate dialogue with touch-stones of Western philosophy, literature, and cinema, this seminar critically explores the nature of love, the nature of justice, and the tangled relationship between them.How to ApplyIt is necessary to apply and submit a few sentences (maximum 200 words) describing your interest in the course in order to be selected.

As part of the College, the institute has a broad mandate in undergraduate education, advanced research, and scholarly exchange within the University community and beyond; it is the University’s focal point for African and African-American studies, a scholarly field that speaks uniquely to the issues of diversity, diaspora, citizen-ship, race, and identity that continue to be among the most impor-tant faced by our nation and our world.  The undergraduate concentration in African and African-American studies (AAS) provides an interdisciplinary program of studies that includes a variety of disciplinary approaches to the study of people of African descent in the Atlantic world, including the United States, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, and the Afri-can continent. Courses are cross-listed in anthropology, economics, English, history, modern languages and cultures, political science, religion and classics, art history, women’s studies, dance, and chemi-cal engineering.

AAS 122," History of Jazz. This study of jazz as an American musical art form is structured around the lives and music of jazz musicians across a range of instrumental, vocal, and ensemble genres. Less a strictly chronological approach, this course focuses first on jazz titans, those individuals and musical groups distinguished by their seminal and permanent influences, either with long tenures such as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, or Coleman Hawkins or with shorter but intense careers, such as Charlie Parker. Integrated with the jazz titans is consideration of the music of other important jazz musicians whose contributions are essential to helping shape and inform the vast jazz landscape of the 20th century. Blues, FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[16ragtime, swing, bebop, cool, progressive, and free jazz are landmark terms that help define that landscape. The influence of jazz on composers in European “classical” traditions also is considered. And, finally, study of the musical history is enhanced by considerations from sociological, linguistic, and philosophical perspectives.

AAS 280," Madness and Post-Colonial Literature. This course explores inscriptions of madness in post-colonial African and Caribbean texts. Beyond the obvious and visible signs of what is generally termed “madness” (from the pathological to the political or cultural), we ask ourselves if the postcolonial arena cannot be interpreted as a pervasive manifestation of madness, that is to say, of something fundamentally “alien, foreign” to the Known, to the imperial destructuring order, and to the disarticulated colonial and post-independent communities. By bringing together texts from different and diverse cultural and intellectual areas such as France, Guadeloupe, and Africa, we seek to confront the various “scriptures.” Issues of witch-hunt, of disintegration of Juletane, the Antillean women in West Africa, from Foucault’s normative panopticism to Fanon’s discussion of the black experience, the postcolonial situa-tion, articulated or silenced, will be the focus of this course.

The linguistic and social lives of deaf people have provided us with unique and valuable ways of exploring the vast potential for human language and culture.”—Padden and HumphriesInside Deaf Culture (2005)Information about the DepartmentAmerican Sign Language (ASL) is the native language of many Deaf Americans. It is a natural language that is at the core of a cultural and literary tradition. As a distinctive language, the study of ASL raises many important scientific questions about the true nature of all human languages.  The ASL program offers a major and a minor in ASL, with courses in its literature and historical tradition as well as in the linguistics and psycholinguistics of signed and spoken languages. The BA de-gree in ASL provides an excellent educational foundation for diverse careers or for graduate study in a wide range of fields, including linguistic research, medicine, counseling, government administra-tion, community service, deaf education, and interpreting.Rochester’s large Deaf community offers students many oppor-tunities to learn and use ASL outside of the classroom.

The University of Rochester’s optics department, called the Institute of Optics, is one of the world’s leading centers for teaching and research in this dynamic field and has been for quite some time—it awarded the nation’s first BS degree in optics in 1932. Although very few high school students are aware of optics as a distinct discipline, the world’s need for optics experts is always growing. The birth of the laser in the early 1960s is only the most famous of the many advances in optics that continue to change our world, including fiber-optic communications, holog-raphy, laser surgery, digital cameras, handheld displays, virtual reality environments, quantum computing, and energy-efficient lighting. Optics has become one of the technological pillars of modern society. Optical techniques also contribute much to modern science, figuring prominently in a number of recent Nobel prizes.  A degree from the Institute of Optics is a symbol of quality and distinction recognized throughout the world. The institute’s optics/optical engineering curriculum (BS degrees are offered in both) pro-vides the depth and breadth needed to prepare for a variety of career options. The required coursework includes classes in geometrical optics, interference and diffraction, advanced mathematical methods, electromagnetic theory, aberrations and testing, optical sources and detectors, and quantum theory as well as multiple laboratory classes. Students supplement their required coursework with technical elec-tives to tailor the major to their specific interests. Senior year includes a yearlong capstone experience, either a senior thesis topic (typically research in a professor’s group) or a team-based design project includ-ing a customer and a faculty advisor.  The Hopkins Center for Optics Design and Engineering, located within the department and intended expressly for undergraduates, houses state-of-the-art tools for the design, fabrication, polishing, and testing of optical elements, giving our students unusually direct access to cutting-edge technology and industry-standard software. Many students also get involved as underclassmen in the world-class faculty research programs that are a distinctive part of the institute’s culture. In addition, research opportunities are available for optics undergraduates at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE).  The LLE features some of the most advanced lasers in the world, such as the Omega EP, which is capable of picosecond operations  (www.lle.rochester.edu/).Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsA student entering optical science and engineering as a first-year student typically takes a basic science course, mathematics, a writing or cluster course, and Introduction to Optics or another intro-ductory engineering course.

This approach, drawing on faculty members in departments such as English, art and art history, political science, classics, religion, music, anthropology, philosophy, history, and film and media studies, allows for especially rich explorations of such topics as the arts in American society; race, class, gender, ethnicity, and religion as aspects of American identity; and ideas and institu-tions that have shaped the United States, past and present. The major enables students to range freely across disciplinary boundaries while developing an area of focus. Students also consider the role of the American nation in a global context. Students may also minor in American studies.Program Advice for First-Year StudentsFirst-year students should be aware that American studies is a very flexible major, allowing students to count toward its requirements virtually all of the courses in the College that deal with the United States. The courses fit into three tracks: the Arts in American Culture, Identity and the American Nation, and American Thought and Institutions. In many of the participating disciplines, first-year students need not be limited to 100-level courses; students should check with departmental advisors and individual instructors or con-sult the program director to find out if a particular 200-level course is appropriate for them.

ANT 257," Chinese Society after Mao. This course adopts an anthropological approach toward understanding the dramatic socio-cultural transformations that have followed in the wake of China’s post-Mao economic reforms. What happens when a society officially committed to economic and gender equality witnesses the rise of stark social divisions? We examine such issues as the creation of a market economy, the rise of new social classes, rural to urban migration, changing ideologies of gender and sexu-ality, new attitudes toward education and work, transformations in family life, religious revival and conversion, and the influences of global popular culture and mass consumption. Throughout our discussions we consider the implications of these changes for China’s political, social, and economic futures.Core Courses These courses comprise the theoretical foundations of anthropology, and each is usually offered once per academic year.

By it we can readily measure an important part of a people’s progress.”—F. D. Roosevelt, October 18, 1931Information about the ProgramThis innovative multidisciplinary program studies the establish-ment and evolution of technological, architectural, and engineering practices and their relationship to the ancient and preindustrial societies and cultures, which technology and engineering helped create and sustain. Assuming a global perspective, the program integrates material from several disciplines in engineering and the natural sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. Students learn to apply engineering, archaeological, architectural, and histori-cal methodologies to explore the creation of artifacts, buildings, and infrastructural systems within and across societies and cultures from the first millennium BC to the 18th century. A prominent feature of the program is optional undergraduate research under the aegis of both the University of Rochester and prestigious foreign academic institutions to address issues of interpretation, conservation, and restoration of the world’s cultural heritage.Program Advice for First-Year StudentsThis program is designed for undergraduate students interested in the humanities (archaeology, architecture, art history, classics, his-tory) with a desire for critical insight into the material culture and technology of preindustrial societies; in mathematics or natural sci-ences with a desire to study the impact of technology on ancient and preindustrial cultures; or in an interdisciplinary engineering field emphasizing technology, design, materials, structures, and architec-ture in the context of historical monuments. Students may pursue Track A, a course-based path requiring 11 courses, or Track B, a research-based path comprising nine courses plus an 8-credit senior project (subject to faculty approval). The major offers pathways in (1) engineering, (2) archaeology and architecture, (3) history, and (4) science, technology, and society. Foundation courses provide basic competencies in engineering structural analysis, archaeology, and architectural history common to all pathways. Depending on FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[22course selection, the major may be designed to satisfy any of the three divisions of the College: Humanities, Social Sciences, or Natu-ral Sciences/Engineering as well as to prepare students for graduate studies in archaeology, architecture, civil or mechanical engineering, art history, classics, or history. This is not a professional program in engineering or in architecture and does not prepare graduates for licensure in either of those professional areas.Courses Fall Semester Foundation Courses"

ATH 222," Cities and Urbanism in Pre-Columbian Mesoamer-ica and Andes. While many of us may or may not live in cities today, their presence as central places for administrative, judicial, and social purposes is undeniable. Both the historical and archaeo-logical record demonstrate the city is not a new phenomenon, but scholars debate over what actually constitutes a city, especially in the pre-Hispanic Americas. To this end, we read key texts about cities and urbanism that help us better understand this debate. We also discuss how recent anthropological approaches to studying cities have helped archaeologists better understand pre-Hispanic urbanism and city life. Core Courses"

And by this, in an especial manner, we acquire wisdom and knowledge.”—Hippocrates“On the Sacred Disease” (fourth century B.C.)Information about the DepartmentMembers of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences study how we see and hear; move, learn, and remember; reason, pro-duce, and understand spoken and signed languages; and how these remarkable capabilities depend upon the workings of the brain. We also study how these abilities develop, and how the brain matures to become able to organize such complex behavior. In order to understand these complex mental functions, we study not only the behaviors themselves but also the neural and computational pro-cesses that underlie them. Brain and cognitive sciences is an inher-ently interdisciplinary field that applies behavioral, neuroscientific, and computational methods to create new knowledge about the mind and brain. Teaching and research in our department reflect this interdisciplinary focus and span a large domain that touches on behavioral, neural, and computational sciences.  The BA and BS programs in the Department of Brain and Cog-nitive Sciences offer rigorous but accessible natural science concen-trations for students interested in the brain and how it enables us to behave the way we do. The programs have two aims: 1) to provide sound intellectual training that will benefit students in a wide range of career paths; and 2) to provide basic disciplinary qualification for students contemplating graduate or professional training in the be-havioral and neural sciences. The curricula provide excellent routes to learn the logic and methods of scientific inquiry and to learn how to reason critically; they also provide unique opportunities to engage in research that is at the frontiers of our current knowledge.  The BA curriculum consists of two foundation courses; three core courses built on these foundations; a statistics course; a labora-tory methods course; four upper-level electives organized around a theme chosen by each student; and a senior seminar. The BS curricu-lum includes all of the requirements for the BA degree in BCS and also incorporates foundational and advanced work in allied fields, including biology, computer science, math, music theory, and lin-guistics. The Honors Program consists of an independent research project leading to a senior thesis, which is presented in the Honors Seminar. For students majoring in other fields, the department offers a minor and a number of clusters (see below) that allow students to study inherently interesting questions such as: How do we recognize sounds and learn our native language? How do we read a book, rec-ognize a face, or reach for a pencil? How do we remember what hap-pened yesterday or during our childhood? How do these remarkable abilities develop? How does the brain become organized to perform tasks that thus far exceed the capacity of modern computers?ClustersClusters are either broad—covering the basics in all parts of the dis-cipline—or deep—focusing on a particular subpart of the domain.

That his place in the esteem of his fellows and of the world will keep pace with his growing capacity and widening achieve-ment is as certain as that effect will follow cause.”—Robert MooreInformation about the DepartmentChemical engineers apply their fundamental knowledge of the chemical and physical sciences to the solution of engineering prob-lems that are of interest to society. They find employment in various modern industries, including microelectronics processing, biotech-nology, and chemical manufacturing facilities. They may also use their engineering backgrounds as a starting point for a wide variety of other occupations, including law and medicine. For example, chemical engineers often enter the field of patent law, where their technical background can be put to useful effect, and their train-ing in the chemical and physical sciences is invaluable for pursuing careers in medicine and/or biomedical research.  The bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering prepares graduates for immediately useful and rewarding industrial positions. Currently about 50 to 60 percent of chemical engineering graduates follow this route. The others elect to obtain professional training in an allied field such as law or business or choose to go on to a doctor-ate degree before embarking upon industrial research or academic employment. An increasing number of students are choosing to remain at the University for a fifth year of study, either to broaden their education through the University’s Take Five Scholars program or to earn an MS degree. Even those who enter the workforce upon graduation eventually continue their education. Most acquire fur-ther training at the master of science level on a part-time basis, often through an employer-sponsored tuition benefits program.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsChemical engineers need a strong foundation in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Moreover, because the solutions to society’s prob-lems frequently involve questions that transcend technical consid-erations, the curriculum includes a balance of humanities and social science courses as well. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS31] Courses in chemical engineering are coordinated with separate chemical engineering laboratory courses in the junior and senior years. In these lab courses, students explore fundamental concepts learned in lectures and gain experience in problem deﬁnition and experiment design in a project format. All laboratories make extensive use of microcomputers for data acquisition and analysis, complementing their use for computation in other courses.  The department provides new students with a better under-standing of what chemical engineers do by organizing several informal meetings throughout the school year in conjunction with the student chapter of the American Institute of Chemical Engi-neers (AIChE). Further information is available from the chemical engineering faculty advisors. Faculty advisors generally remain with assigned students during their entire undergraduate career and should be consulted for advice about programs and courses.Typical First-Year ProgramFall Semester  Spring Semester; .International Baccalaureate (IB)Economics—Students who receive a higher-level exam score of 4 are placed into .

I thank on my knees him who directed my early education for having in my possession this rich source of delight.”—Thomas JeffersonThe ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome have influenced all successive western societies, leaving a legacy that includes ideas about democracy, empire, myth, society, race, gender, and philoso-phy. At the University of Rochester, the study of ancient Greece and Rome is not merely a matter of antiquarian interest; rather, our courses enable students to explore the past in ways that allow them to understand the present and imagine the future. Students study the foundational texts and significant artifacts of the western world in order to understand them on their own terms and in their ancient contexts as well as to develop a deeper awareness of the ways in which classical antiquity has shaped and continues to influence contemporary society.Students can approach the study of the ancient world in a range of ways; some students focus on the history, culture, and archaeol-ogy of Greece and Rome, while others concentrate on the study of languages and literature; and, of course, many students do both. Therefore, in addition to developing a solid foundation in Greek and Latin language, students may select from courses in ancient drama, mythology, and poetry as well as from courses that focus on ancient Greek and Roman religion, philosophy, and culture. The department also offers courses on more specific topics such as the ancient city; Greek and Roman ideas about race and ethnicity; issues related to gender, sexuality, and family life; specific mythologi-cal or historical figures such as Hercules or Alexander the Great; and even on ancient techniques of engineering.  The classics program offers several study abroad courses, led by Rochester faculty, in which students can participate (one does not need to be a classics major to participate in these programs):• Archaeological Dig in Italy (summer): Every summer, the  classics department runs an archaeological dig in Italy in which students not only learn about ancient Roman history and   material culture but also develop their skills in field methods of    archaeology.• Epigraphy in Rome (spring break): The department also offers a   spring break program in which students study Latin inscriptions   and graffiti in Rome.• Sacred Spaces in Greece (winter break): The department offers  a course, Sacred Spaces in Greece, that culminates with a two- week trip to Greece so that students can visit sites they have   studied and present their research on location.In addition to the major concentration in classics, the depart-ment offers minors in classical civilization, Greek, and Latin. Recent graduates of the department have an excellent record of admission to graduate school as well as to medical school or law school. The clas-sics program is housed in the Department of Religion and Classics.Advice for First-Year StudentsFor students who want to focus on the study of the history, culture, and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, we suggest that you be-gin with the 100-level course that is of interest to you. For students who want to begin with the study of Greek and Latin language, Greek 101 and Latin 101 assume no previous knowledge and are intended for students with little to no experience of the language. Students who are considering entering the sequence at a higher level than 101 in Greek or Latin are strongly encouraged to consult with Professor Nicholas Gresens (nicholas.gresens@rochester.edu) as soon as possible. Students are not permitted to register for or receive credit for a language course if they have already achieved proficiency at the level of that course.Advanced Placement (AP)A score of 4 or 5 on the Latin examination will earn credit for "

The two great traditions studied in this intro-ductory course—classical and Biblical—have been pondered by generations of writers and artists for thousands of years. A great deal of literary history is the story of intricately rewriting and adapting the core texts of these traditions; it has been said that the European philosophical tradition is a series of footnotes to Plato. While doing justice to any one of these authors or traditions in a single semester would be a challenge, the goal of this class is to read as much as possible of the classical and scriptural tradition in the short time we have, giving you a solid introduction to some of the key stories and ideas that have generated so much thought, conflict, and human creativity over the past two dozen centuries.

In a world of ubiquitous computing and constant digital connectivity, digital lit-eracy and the ability to effectively communicate with and design for digital media users are valuable, marketable skills. This major blends theoretical and historical understandings of past and present medias with hands-on uses of emerging technologies, programming, and software. The ability to create digital media has become both more pervasive and increasingly inexpensive, but the number of rigorously trained digital media designers and producers falls woefully short of industry needs. This major is designed to supply this demand and prepare students to succeed in one of the biggest professional growth fields around today.   A distinctive component of the major is the capstone project in which all students in the major collaborate on the design and pro-duction of a form of digital media of their choosing beginning in the spring of their junior year and continuing throughout their senior year. Much of the work in the digital media studies major takes place in Rettner Hall, a brand-new facility designed to house the program and featuring cutting-edge computers, software, and technologies.  To date, 95 percent of digital media studies graduates have gone on to graduate school (Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, University of Michigan) or professional work, many with digitally relevant firms such as Google, IBM, Spotify, Netflix, Disney, and Atlantic Media.Program Advice for First-Year StudentsStudents interested in digital media studies are strongly urged to begin core DMS coursework with "
DMS 101,",  Introduction to Digital Media Studies. In this class we critically think about the creation, production, distribution, consumption, and reception of digital media. Readings and class discussions focus on the theory, history, and practice of digital media and its application in the humanities, social sciences, and our world. Students produce individual research in the form of written responses, as well as collaborative digital projects. The course’s goals are to prepare students to thoughtfully critique our digital world, create scholarly digital projects, and understand the multifaceted importance of media in today’s society.

Through finding creative solutions to problems posed by instructors, students manipulate photographs, edit a short video, design graphics, make and modify a 3D model, and create a small interactive videogame environment. The course culminates with students designing digital portfolios of the work they create in this course. (Fall and Spring)"
DMS 104,". These core courses are offered in both fall and spring semesters and do not need to be taken consecutively. Since these courses prepare students for the variety of upper-level courses that make up the major, students are encouraged to complete this core FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[40coursework before the end of their sophomore year. Because the major is flexibly designed, however, students can begin taking pro-duction courses while they are working on core courses. Thus, in the spring semester a student might take  in conjunction with a course on digital art, for example, or one on machines and con-sciousness. In the sophomore year, students continue the core and production courses, begin advanced-level media history and theory work, and may enroll in the required Digital Applications course.CoursesCore Courses Design in the Digital Age. Designing digital products and services requires a process of “interaction design,” which is a wholly new discipline that moves beyond previous fads of simply making digital things that look like physical world objects. Since there is no known formula for creating great UI/UX we explore the need to consider interactivity as a design process, moving from initial ethnographic research through ideation and design and the many steps that lead to final delivery and presentation. Mastery of this process prepares DMS students to undertake their senior capstone project as well as effectively develop other creative and entrepreneurial ideas/ventures.

But so few have imagination that there are ten thousand fiddlers to one composer.”—Charles F. KetteringInformation for Interested StudentsAt its core, engineering is about deconstructing a problem, designing a solution, and tinkering with your solution until you have reached a desired outcome. Students taking courses at the Hajim School are challenged to nurture their ingenuity and become technologically savvy problem solvers and graduate well prepared for advanced stud-ies as well as professional employment.  In her 2016 investiture remarks, Dean Wendi Heinzelman asserted, “I believe that all educated citizens in the 21st century, re-gardless of major or intended career, need to have an understanding of technology, of data analysis, system design, and computer systems. . . . I am also a strong believer in the benefits of cross-disciplinary thinking. The disciplines outside of engineering, in particular the humanities and social sciences, have a lot to teach us about critical discourse.” Although she was talking about her vision for the Hajim School, she could have just as easily been talking about the benefits of a bachelor of arts degree in engineering science, which provides students with a multidisciplinary major that emphasizes understand-ing and application of engineering and scientific and mathematical principles. Students majoring in engineering science achieve depth and breadth in the field and are able to function across disciplines as a result of the clusters they complete in both the humanities and social sciences divisions of the Rochester Curriculum.Advice for First-Year StudentsOur introductory courses, EAS 10x, are accessible to engineering majors and non-majors alike. These courses focus on the fun side of engineering, from building bridges to making more-energy-efficient devices. While completion of at least one EAS 10x course is re-quired for most majors in the Hajim School, the engineering science major offers considerable flexibility and permits students to develop individual plans of study to meet their own educational goals.  In addition to taking core courses in mathematics, physics, chem-istry, and computer science, students study thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, optics, mechanics, signals, and circuits. Their curriculum is rounded out with four upper-level Hajim School courses of their choosing, and one cluster in each of the humanities and social sci-ences divisions of the Rochester Curriculum. Careers in patent law, technical writing, science consulting, and technical sales as well as science and engineering education are possible career outcomes.Typical First-Year ProgramFall Semester  Spring Semester Introduction of Computing Systems.

We have richly varied offerings in creative writing, in the study of film and other media, and in journalism, rhetoric, and theater. Our classes encourage exploratory thinking and con-versation, always aiming to increase the students’ knowledge, their skills in reading and critical analysis, and their strengths as writers. The department offers opportunities for independent research and internships within both the University and the Rochester commu-nity, and we maintain close connections with other undergraduate programs in comparative literature, film studies, women’s studies, African and African-American studies, theater, and literary transla-tion studies. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS47] Students wishing to major in English can choose from four distinct tracks: British and American Literature; Creative Writ-ing; Theater; and Language, Media, and Communication. Double majoring in English and in another discipline—astronomy or philosophy, political science or music—is common for our students. Many combinations are possible. The English Honors Program of-fers students the chance to write an extended honors thesis—critical or creative—in their senior year. We also offer minors in four areas: English literature, creative writing, journalism, and theater, as well as a diversity of clusters for students seeking to fulfill the cluster requirement in the humanities. Students with questions about any of these programs or possibilities should contact the department’s director of undergraduate studies.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsThe English courses listed below are intended to introduce students to the study of literature, language, film, theater, and creative writ-ing. They will allow students to discover the many ways of approach-ing imaginative works. Classes such as "
ENG 112,", 113, 114, and 115 provide broad surveys of English and American literature—and their historical backgrounds—and are especially useful to those students considering the major in English literature or creative writ-ing. Two of these classes are in fact required for these tracks in the major, and they can also be counted for requirements in the Theater and Language, Media, and Communication tracks.    It’s important to note, however, that neither these nor any of the 100-level classes we offer are in any way prerequisites for upper-level courses. First-year-students should be aware that, in fact, the depart-ment has no hard and fast rules that prohibit them from taking most English courses at the 200 level, except for 200-level creative writing courses. If an upper-level course on, say, Shakespeare, the Victorian novel, modern poetry, post-Colonial literature, or contemporary film looks interesting, you should consider enrolling—although you might want to check with the professor if you have any questions about your preparedness.   For any additional questions about English courses or about the English majors, minors, and clusters, students should contact the director of Undergraduate Studies in English.Advanced Placement (AP)Students who have received a score of 4 or 5 on the AP exam in English Literature will be awarded 4 elective credits of English (not for use toward an English major) upon earning a “B” grade or better in an English literature course.International Baccalaureate (IB)English—Students who receive a higher-level exam score of 6 or better are awarded 4 hours of elective English credit (not for the major) after completion of an English literature course with a grade of C or better.

Global environmental change is too elusive to grasp yet too profound to ignore.”—Mitchell TomashowInformation about the ProgramEnvironmental humanities is the study of ecological issues with hu-manities methodologies of interpretation, critique, historiography, and creative inquiry. At the University of Rochester, the Environ-mental Humanities Program offers courses in English, art history, studio art, history, philosophy, film and media studies, digital media studies, and more.  Courses in environmental humanities teach students how to investigate the roles of culture, history, and imagination in shap-ing our understandings of ecological issues and to interrogate how environmental problems and solutions have been narrated, defined, identified, and framed. Questions that animate the University of Rochester’s environmental humanities courses include: What is na-ture? What is as an environmental fact? How are facts experienced? How does history inform our understanding of contemporary envi-ronmental issues? How can we theorize modernity and moderniza-tion from an environmental perspective? How can writers, artists, and philosophers help us think through the roles of race, class, sexuality, and social justice in environmental issues? What does it mean to be an inhabitant of the new geologic era of the Anthropo-cene? How have the sciences defined how ecological crises, such as climate change, are perceived? A goal of the environmental humani-ties program is to emphasize the imagination’s role in understanding alternative, marginalized environmental perspectives and in develop-ing new possibilities and practices that have not yet been articulated.Program Advice for First-Year StudentsCourses offered by the environmental humanities program and suggested for first-year students are listed below.

A guiding question raised by the artworks is how to create a meaningful connection to the planet in a time of so much injustice, destabilization, delocalization, mobility, and flux. Close attention is paid to how literature can help us elucidate historical erasures of environmental relationships in modern times, such as experiences of racial oppression, ecotourism, exoticism, trauma and war, exile, and alienation, among others.

It plays a key role in shaping the lives of individuals as well as societies and cultures as a whole. Religion has been and can be a source of peace and compassion or an impetus for division and war. Students of religion learn to employ a variety of theoretical methods and interpretive approaches in order to understand religion in the diverse forms it has taken in different cultures and historical periods. The concentration in religion focuses on the study of the world’s major religions through analyses of their histories, texts, rituals, institutions, and practices that are embedded in complex cultures, societies, and political systems. Students can also take courses in which some aspect of religion, such as ritual, pilgrimage, mysticism, or myth, is studied thematically and comparatively.  Additionally, the department offers a wide range of courses that explore the many ways in which religious ideas and practices inter-sect with other aspects of human culture and society. For example, the department offers courses that examine the intersection of reli-gion and different genres of music such as hip-hop or blues. Other courses explore the ways in which religion has influenced the law and shaped societal understandings of guilt and punishment. Still others focus the ways in which different religious traditions have shaped human understandings of the nature of the body and the self and have informed everyday bodily practices related to eating, dress-ing, and sexuality. Finally, in other courses, students grapple with the ways in which religions have provided the framework for under-standing fundamental and perennial questions about the meaning of life, how to understand evil and suffering in the world, and what do we mean by “the good.”  Students have considerable independence in shaping and struc-turing their major so that they can focus on those areas of the study of religion that are of greatest interest to them while also developing UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS87]a strong foundation in the study of religion generally and a mastery of the methods and theories used by scholars to understand religion in all its fascinating complexity.  Students in the Department of Religion and Classics are encour-aged to do independent research, both in their classes and during the summer. Over the past 10 years, many students in the depart-ment have presented their research at the University of Rochester Research Exposition as well as at national conferences and have been awarded significant prizes in recognition of their work. Recent graduates of the program in religion have an excellent record of admission to top-tier graduate schools as well as to medical schools and law schools.  The program in religion is housed in the Department of Religion and Classics, which also offers a major in Classics as well as minors in Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Classics, Latin, and Greek.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsWe want students to take courses that interest them, and, thus, there are no prerequisite courses that first-year students need to take in the religion concentration before moving on to a course that fits their interests. First-year students, however, are encouraged to begin with a 100-level course. Many students initially take a course in religion in order to fulfill their cluster requirement in the humani-ties and then go on to declare a minor or major in religion or in classics. First-year students are encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies, Anne Merideth (anne.merideth@rochester.edu), with any questions.CoursesAll the courses listed below may be used as part of a major, minor, or cluster in the humanities.

Some of them are talking, others silent. You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners. Like ourselves; and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave.”—PlatoThe RepublicInformation about the ProgramThe film and media studies (FMS) program offers an interdepart-mental concentration leading to a bachelor of arts degree. The FMS program offers students an opportunity to explore motion pictures, television, and digital media as art forms and cultural phenomena. The major and minor consist of specific courses offered by partici-pating departments and provide opportunities for screening and analysis of centrally important films and videos in the history of cinema from the FMS Special Collection.  Many students go on to film or television school, pursing gradu-ate work in production, direction, screenwriting, cinematography, editing, acting and/or other creative aspects of media. Others choose to pursue graduate study of media history, theory, and criti-cism in master’s or doctoral programs. Media law and business also present exciting opportunities for postgraduate study. The major can also lead to careers in print and media journalism, arts and museum management, film preservation and curating, library science, and multimedia work.  The FMS program enjoys a close relationship with the George Eastman Museum. All University students have free access to the museum and library with a student ID. Important film screenings and special events are offered several nights a week at the Dryden and Curtis Theatres at a discounted cost to students. The remarkable archival resources of the museum are also available to students for course work and special projects.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsStudents should take one of the two introductory core courses—"

AnthonyMotions for coeducation presented to  state teachers’ convention (1857)Susan B. Anthony Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s StudiesWomen’s studies focuses on the experiences of diverse groups of women and changing cultural gender issues as well as economic, political, and psychological relations between women and men. Because gender and women’s studies asks questions about women, sexuality, and gender that no single academic department is able to answer, the program encourages an interdisciplinary approach. The program also offers an exciting range of internships in the commu-nity through which students may earn course credits.  The program offers an undergraduate major and minor, an honors program, and clusters in the humanities and social sci-ences. Students have the opportunity to work with faculty from the humanities, sciences, and social sciences who are appointed in the College, the Eastman School of Music, the Margaret Warner Gradu-ate School of Education and Human Development, the School of Nursing, and the School of Medicine and Dentistry.  The College opened the program in women’s studies in 1982 to address curricular and scholarly issues important for understanding the role of women in contemporary society. The Susan B. Anthony Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies is named to honor Susan B. Anthony, the 19th-century suffragist who led a successful campaign to have women admitted to the University of Rochester in 1900. The institute draws on Anthony’s goals and ideals and preserves her rich historical connections with the city of Rochester.  In addition to the undergraduate curricular program, the insti-tute also sponsors graduate certificates, graduate fellowships, regular faculty research seminars, public lecture series, conferences, and opportunities for students to meet with visiting scholars.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsStudents interested in pursuing a major in gender, sexuality, and women’s studies (GSW) are encouraged to start with "

GEOMECHANICS“Can one think that because we are engineers, beauty does not preoccupy us or that we do not try to build beautiful, as well as solid and long-lasting, structures? Aren’t the genuine functions of strength always in keeping with unwritten conditions of harmony?”—Gustave EiffelInformation about the ProgramA four-year geomechanics program is offered jointly with the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences and the Depart-ment of Mechanical Engineering for students interested in the application of the field of mechanics to problems associated with the atmosphere; rivers, lakes, and oceans; and the solid earth. Students following this program should be well equipped for employment or graduate work in a variety of fields, including geophysics, hydrology, structural geology and rock mechanics, civil engineering, oceanog-raphy, meteorology, environmental sciences, engineering geology, limnology, geothermal and petroleum exploration and production, and coastal and marine geology.  The geomechanics degree is awarded by the College in either the School of Arts & Sciences or in the Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences—the choice is made by the student. If the student chooses the School of Arts & Sciences, his or her major advisor will be in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences; if the degree is to be granted through the Hajim School, the major advisor will be in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In each case, the student will also have a minor advisor in the other department.FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[54Advice for First-Year StudentsThe geomechanics curriculum is built around basic mathematics, physics, chemistry, earth and environmental sciences, and engineer-ing courses.

HIS 200,", Gateway to History. History 200 introduces students to the practice of history. Each section focuses on a specific topic offered by a professor specializing in this subject (for example, the Eastern Front in World War II or pirates of the Caribbean). The registrar’s course schedule (CDCS) lists the topic for each section. History majors are encouraged to complete History 200 in their first or second year, so prospective majors should consider taking this class early. However, History 200 is not a prerequisite for other 100- or 200-level history courses. Most of our introductory courses provide an excellent entry into a number of departmental clusters as well (see course list and applicable clusters below).  As a discipline, history covers different cultures, multiple eras, and various approaches to a wide array of subjects. Consequently, UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS55]history majors are required to take a diverse selection of courses covering time periods before and after 1800 and at least three differ-ent geographical areas of the world. Introductory courses meet this distribution requirement, as do more advanced courses. Majors also choose a five-course topical geographical area.  Students who choose to double-major in history and another discipline or program in the humanities or the social sciences may, with the permission of the director of Undergraduate Studies, use one or two courses from the other major toward the fulfillment of the history major; double majors must, however, meet the geograph-ical and chronological distribution requirements and the upper-level writing requirement with history courses.  Students with doubts about whether a given course is right for them are urged to discuss their selections with the course’s instructor or their academic advisor. The director of Undergraduate Studies also welcomes visits from prospective students during office hours or by appointment. Other faculty are also available during their on-call advising hours.

Every view of the world that becomes extinct, every culture that disappears, diminishes a possibility of life.”—Octavio Paz“He who does not know foreign languages does not know anything about his own.”—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe“A different language is a different vision of life.”—Federico FelliniInformation about the DepartmentInternational and multicultural by definition, the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures offers courses in many of the world’s major languages, literatures, and cultures and in comparative literature and theory. Students studying in MLC—as the department is commonly known around campus—acquire practical skills (proficiency in a foreign language, analytical reading and writing skills, the ability to think globally) and engage in intellectual inquiry into the culture, literature, art, and cinema of countries in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Students can major in French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, or comparative literature. Students interested in Chinese or Italian may create an interdepartmental concentration through the Multidisciplinary Studies Center. MLC also offers elementary and intermediate levels of Portuguese and elementary through advanced levels of Korean.  All MLC majors and minors (except Japanese) begin counting courses toward the major with 151, the third semester of study, following 101–102. A major in a modern language field entails the study of a national culture, literary traditions and innovations, and, of course, language. Students with an interest in a modern culture or language can also choose to minor in any of the above fields, including Italian and Chinese. There are also several possibilities for interdisciplinary work in other languages and cultures: Russian studies (a major and a minor), Latin American studies (a minor), and certificates in Asian studies, literary translation studies (LTS), and Polish and Central European studies.  Students with an interest in national literatures and cultures will find courses taught in English under the comparative literature (CLT) rubric (for example, "

As Jewish civilization developed across a variety of geographical and cultural areas of the world and over thousands of years, the program’s course offerings reflect the complex, many-faceted, and heterogeneous dimensions of the Jewish experience with classes on the Hebrew Bible; ancient, medieval, and modern Jewish history; the Holocaust; Gender Studies; American Judaism; modern Jewish literatures; and classical and Modern Hebrew. As an interdisciplin-ary program, Jewish studies brings together faculty from different departments whose interests are diverse and cross-cultural and favor a variety of approaches to the study of Jewish life and culture. Stu-dents of all backgrounds are welcome to take Jewish studies courses and participate in the program.  The undergraduate program in Jewish studies is housed in the Department of Religion and Classics and is an integral part of the Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Rochester, which pro-motes research, scholarship, and education in Judaism and Judaica.  Currently, the program offers a minor in Jewish studies and a minor in Hebrew. There are three clusters: one in Jewish studies, one in Judaism, and one in Hebrew language and literature. Addition-ally, courses in Jewish studies count toward a variety of clusters in other programs, such as modern languages and cultures, history, and international relations.Hebrew Language InstructionThe Hebrew program at Rochester consists of four sequential  semester-long courses in Modern Hebrew from beginner through lower-intermediate level and one advanced class focusing on the language of media and literature.

The minor in legal studies is an interdisciplinary program of study that gives students the opportunity to examine law from a variety of per-spectives. The study of law is a humanistic enterprise and, while the minor should be useful for those who may be thinking of attending law school, it should not be considered a program in preprofessional training.  The goals of the minor are to educate students in certain broadly relevant analytical skills, to introduce students to what it means to study a social phenomenon from a variety of perspectives, to help students obtain a better understanding of law and the multiple func-tions it plays in a variety of societies, to encourage writing and the development of writing skills, and to stimulate greater interaction among faculty interested in law and society.Program Advice for First-Year StudentsSince many of the courses in the program are upper-level courses in the departments involved, first-year students who are interested in the minor may wish to begin by taking appropriate introductory courses in some of the relevant departments. Most legal studies mi-nors do not declare the minor until their sophomore or junior year. Students of any year who are interested in the legal studies minor are encouraged to consult a legal studies minor advisor.UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS59]ClustersThere are two clusters in legal studies, one in the humanities division and one in the social sciences division.Courses. Credit for  with a grade of B+ or better.International Baccalaureate (IB) Foreign Language IB higher-level 5: Students are placed into 152 and are awarded credit for 151 after completion of 152 with a grade of B or better.*IB higher-level 6: Students are placed into 200 and are awarded credit for 151 and 152 upon completion of 200 with a grade of B or better.*IB higher-level 7: Students are placed into 200 and awarded credit for 151 and 152 upon completion.*MLC Clusters Completion of a cluster of three courses in MLC fulfills the hu-manities requirement for graduation. In addition, Russian stud-ies offers several humanities and one social sciences cluster. Each language program in the department offers clusters at the beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels, as well as others based on specific topics or themes, so any course you choose in MLC will fit into one or more clusters. Comparative literature and the national language programs offer clusters focusing on literary studies, cultural theory, and interdisciplinary topics. A few examples are Comparative Cultural Studies, Studies in Francophone Cultures, Italian Studies on Location, Germany before Nazism, Japanese Popular Culture, Russian Literature and Culture, and Literature and Identity in Hispanic Societies. Some of these are interdepartmental and include MLC courses plus offerings in history; art and art history; music; anthropology; film and media studies; and gender, sexuality, and women’s studies. A couple examples are Introduction to European Studies and Continental Philosophy.Special Opportunities: Study AbroadMLC strongly encourages students to take advantage of the many op-portunities for study abroad in a variety of places around the world. There are opportunities to take classes abroad or to do internships related to one’s interests, and many if not all of the courses taken abroad can count toward MLC majors and minors. Returning study abroad students consider the time spent in another country as one of the most exciting and challenging experiences of their undergraduate education. The College sponsors several University of Rochester pro-grams and is affiliated with others, such as the Paris Film Program; the IES programs in Salamanca, Granada, Barcelona, and Madrid; in Paris and Nantes; the St. Petersburg CIEE program; and the IES programs at several universities in China and Japan. MLC also offers a one-semester, interdisciplinary program in Italian studies in Arezzo, Italy. This program is directed by College faculty and administered through the Center for Education Abroad.  MLC-sponsored summer programs take students to France, Ger-many, Italy, Korea, Russia, and (in even-numbered years) a Spanish-speaking country. You do not have to major in a modern language in order to participate in these programs, but it is important to plan in advance with an MLC advisor in your field of interest. Advisors in each of the language programs help students pick the study abroad offerings best suited to their interests and language abilities. MLC also sponsors a yearlong exchange program with the University of Cologne and the University of Rennes. University of Rochester financial aid is transferable for many study abroad and internship opportunities. Through MLC, students taking courses in the depart-ment may also apply for a Mildred R. Burton Undergraduate Travel/Research Fellowship. Each year, many students are awarded fellow-ships to use toward our study abroad programs.CoursesThe Department of Modern Languages and Cultures currently offers introductory through advanced courses in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish, as well as introducto-ry and intermediate courses in Korean and Portuguese. This enables students to begin a new language or continue in a familiar one begin-ning with their first semester. Other courses, such as those listed here, provide more-advanced studies of other literatures and cultures.Spring courses have yet to be determined. The following courses are taught in English and have no prerequisites:___________*For Spanish and French, a grade of B+ or better is required.UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS67]This course looks at German poems, plays, and novellas from various historical periods and within the context of several techniques of interpretation.

To that end, the College music department offers a balanced curriculum that addresses performance (through private studio instruction and ensemble participation), theoretical and historical investigation, and experiential learning about the musical process.  The study of the musical experience, often broadly called “musicology,” encompasses many diverse fields of inquiry, including theory and analysis of musical languages, styles, and works; histori-cal and critical discourse about repertories, genres, and periods; composition and improvisation; musical perception; music educa-tion; performance practices; cultural contexts and reception.Department ContactsFirst-year student advisor: Professor Matthew BaileyShea,  matt.baileyshea@rochester.eduAdministrative questions: Elaine Stroh, estroh@ur.rochester.eduEnsemble and studio lessons: Jimmy Warlick, jwarlick@ur.rochester.eduDepartmental Advice for First-Year StudentsEvery student at the University of Rochester should take at least one music course during his or her four years here. Music department courses accommodate a wide range of interests for students with no background in music to those interested in making music their livelihood. We strongly encourage students considering a major in music to take music theory during their first year. See “Courses” for a list of classes open to first-year students.  Students interested in registering for a music theory course should take the theory placement assessment administered (one time only) during Orientation. Although no RSVP is required, more information about the placement assessment can be obtained by contacting Jimmy Warlick in the music department or check-ing the music department website. This brief assessment is held in Dewey Hall during first-year student orientation week.  Students who read music and perform at an intermediate level can audition for applied music lessons by visiting www.esm. rochester.edu/lessons and signing up for an audition prior to the first week of classes. Note to brass musicians—unlike other instrumen-tal areas, the brass auditions include musical excerpts to be prepared in advance. Please contact the performance program manager in the music department to obtain PDF files of the required excerpts.The BA with a Major in MusicThe College’s Bachelor of Arts degree in music addresses students who can meet both the intellectual and musical challenges of a rigorous program that emphasizes the broad experience of a liberally educated person. The concentration comprises a balanced program of academic courses, private instruction, and ensemble experience that fosters understanding of musical languages, historical develop-ments, and compositional styles while encouraging excellence in performance.   Students may choose from among eight individual “tracks” of study with the core curriculum in music theory and history, in-cluded in all tracks, providing the common foundation for advanced study of specialized subfields in music (musicology, theory, conduct-ing, management, performance, composition, music education, etc.) both as emphases in the final years of undergraduate education and at the graduate or professional level. Majors wishing to pursue something other than the basic track can choose an alternative track in composition, conducting music history/theory, music in world cultures, musical theater, performance, and popular music/jazz.    Any student interested in a 3-2 program in ethnomusicology should contact Professor  Jennifer Kyker. Students interested in the BA/MA combined program with certification in music education should contact Christopher Azzara at the Eastman School of Music during Orientation or soon afterward. Both options are offered in conjunction with the Eastman School.  Although the major in music is a demanding one, students often also explore, beyond the introductory level, one or more non-music disciplines. Some students pursue a double major. Such flexibility al-lows students to combine pre-law or pre-medicine preparation with a major or minor in music.  First-year students who plan to major in music should take the theory placement assessment to determine appropriate placement in the theory curriculum. Prospective majors should also audition for  applied music lessons and an ensemble.Advanced Placement (AP)Students who have taken the Advanced Placement examination in Music Theory and earned a score of 4 or 5 can receive advanced placement credit for the course "

PHL 110," Introductory Logic. Logic is the study of valid forms of argument. This course is an introduction to symbolic logic, a modern theory of logic that involves the construction of an artificial symbolic language within which the logical forms of sentences can be expressed and the validity of arguments can be proven. Students learn two logical systems: sentence logic and predicate logic. In ad-dition to translating English arguments into symbolic form and con-structing interpretations to demonstrate the invalidity of arguments, students also learn how to prove that an argument is valid using a set of rigorously defined implication rules for each logical system.

Contemporary linguistics is the study of the formal aspects of lan-guage structure—what it is that we know when we know a language. For the most part, linguistic knowledge is tacit. We learn language; we are not taught it. Uncovering the structure of language is the work of formal linguistics.  The Department of Linguistics offers courses in the major areas of theoretical linguistics: phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. In addition, we offer a number of 100-level courses in linguistics that focus on how language interacts with aspects of culture and society.  Linguistics courses offer students a unique combination of humanistic and scientific concerns and tend to draw interested stu-dents from a broad range of disciplines in the sciences and humani-ties, from biology and cognitive sciences to art and visual studies. The commonality is a deep intellectual curiosity about human languages.  Students find that linguistics gives them experience in approach-ing and analyzing complex empirical data in a systematic way, a skill useful in a variety of careers. Our graduates enter fields such as teaching, law, linguistics, speech pathology, and research, among others.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsThe 200-level courses are the courses of the major and minor and require  Introductory Logic. Symbolic logic through first-order quantification theory. Skill in deductive inference is developed through construction of proofs and other methods of a rigorously defined artificial language.

LIN 104," Language and Culture. This course investigates the rela-tionship between language and culture at the interface of linguistics and anthropology. It examines the ways in which language reflects the perception of the world, ways of life, and beliefs of its speak-ers; creates rituals and maintains social ties; and is used by people of different ages, genders, social classes, and ethnicities. We discuss hypotheses that try to explain the nature of the relationship between language and culture and then turn to a wide variety of topics that are relevant for both linguists and anthropologists. These include, for instance, kinship systems and language, language of perception (e.g., colors, spatial relations), culture and language change/language variation, writing systems, and intercultural communication. Part of cluster S1LIN006."
LIN 105," Language and Advertising. The course examines the use advertisers make of language in selling their products and how it affects our perceptions of the product and ourselves. The emphasis in the course is on learning about the structure of language and how we can use it as a guide to observing and understanding the effective-ness of commercial messages.

LIN 162," Modern African-American English. This course looks at the varieties of English used primarily by and among African Americans. We first explore and discuss the linguistic features (lexicon and grammar) of African American Vernacular English (AAVE)—also called African American English. We also investigate the ways in which AAVE is being utilized in popular culture. Ad-ditionally, we look at AAVE’s connection to African languages and creoles. Finally, this course looks at the issues connected to AAVE and attitudes toward this variety and its effects on teachers’ expecta-tions and students’ progress as well as on linguistic profiling and dis-crimination in employment and housing. Part of cluster S1LIN006."
LIN 220," Introduction to Grammatical Systems. This introduc-tory course examines the grammatical structure of sentences from the standpoint of transformational grammar. The course develops the basic techniques of syntactic analysis in order to develop a work-ing grammar of (a fragment of) English. No syntax background is assumed. This course is intended for majors and nonmajors alike. In addition to the lecture, students need to register for a peer-led workshop. Prerequisite: "
LIN 224," Introduction to Computational Linguistics. This course covers foundational concepts in computational linguistics and is designed for students with a strong background in formal linguistic methods but little or no programming experience. Major focus is placed on deploying techniques used in computational lin-guistics to advance linguistic theory as well as developing students’ ability to implement these techniques. Topics include basic object-oriented programming in Python, basic formal language theory, probability theory and information theory, finite state phonological and morphological analysis, generative and discriminative models for shallow syntactic and semantic parsing, and bottom-up, top-down and mixed algorithms for syntactic and semantic parsing. Prerequisite: "

But the education must contain much besides book-learning in order to be really good”—Theodore Roosevelt (“Citizenship in a Republic,” April 23, 1910)Information about the DepartmentThe mechanical engineering curriculum provides a balance of courses in the humanities and social sciences, physics, applied mathematics, and engineering principles and design. Since modern engineering is increasingly reliant on computers for things such as computation, data storage and retrieval, visualization of complex engineering problems, laboratory instrumentation, and presentation of project results, we have included computer work throughout the curriculum. Emphasis is placed on the underlying fundamentals in the required engineering coursework, enabling graduates to adapt throughout their careers to rapid advances in science and technol-ogy. Training in the design process is increasingly emphasized in the later years of the program. The capstone senior design sequence often features real design problems drawn from local industry. Design examples include wind turbines for third-world installa-tion, automotive fuel valves, large optomechanical mirrors for solar power, automotive frames and suspensions, 3D printing of optics, heat transfer in organic farms, sustainable industrial refrigeration, and injection molding machines.  The overall educational objective of our program is to develop effective practitioners in mechanical engineering and associated fields. Our graduates will confidently apply knowledge in the basic UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS63]sciences, mathematics, engineering analysis, computation, experi-mentation, and design to address emerging and evolving engineering challenges. They will contribute to the advancement of their chosen field while remaining mindful of the ethical, safety, and social impli-cations of their work. They will be able to communicate effectively and work in multidisciplinary teams and will be well equipped for leadership roles in industry, academia, and government.  In keeping with the continuously evolving nature of mechani-cal engineering, we expect that our alumni will engage actively in lifelong learning and professional development activities, and that many of them, inspired by research experiences as undergraduates, will continue their education in advanced degree programs.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsMechanical engineering requires a solid foundation in mathemat-ics, physics, and chemistry. This is built during the first two years of the program while students also take a first set of core mechanical engineering courses. In the second two years of the program, stu-dents take an increased number of mechanical engineering specialty courses, including many with an open-ended design component. To provide the breadth of knowledge required to address modern engineering questions, this science and engineering focus is also balanced in the curriculum by a selection of humanities and social science courses. Many undergraduates in the department assist faculty members in research projects during the academic year and the summer.  Recent projects involving undergraduates include experiments in controlled nuclear fusion using high-power lasers, fuel cells, engi-neering coolants and lubricants, micro fluids, MicroElectro–Me-chanical Systems (MEMS) and Micro–Optical Electro–Mechanical Systems (MOEMS), precision engineering and instrumentation, precision grinding tools, CNC machining, optical manufacturing, experimental observation of collective phenomena in fluids, edge strength testing of screens for smart devices, structural mechanics of historical structures, bubble dynamics, and the design of an auto-matic transmission for a bicycle. Many of our students interact with local companies like Harris, Xerox, Wegmans, General Motors, Bausch and Lomb, OptiPro, and Gleason Works. This often occurs through company sponsorship of a project in one of the design or laboratory courses. Our “Industry Practicum” program provides part-time work during the academic year and full-time employment during the summer for selected students. Major University facilities such as the Laboratory for Laser Energetics and Strong Memorial Hospital are also sources for design and internship opportunities. We encourage our students to study abroad, typically for one semester in the junior year. Study abroad credits transfer to the un-dergraduate major in mechanical engineering, and instruction can be in English. Examples of study abroad sites, among many others, are Australia, Spain, England, Botswana, New Zealand, and Israel.Typical First-Year ProgramFall Semester  Spring Semester"

This period comprises distinct thematic continuities understood to be post-classical and pre-Enlightenment, and the program is intended to be multidisci-plinary.  The medieval and early modern studies minor requires six courses, one of which must be Classical and Scriptural Backgrounds. At least three of the six courses should be at the 200 level or above. A maximum of four courses may be taken from any one academic department, and at least four of the six courses for the minor need to be in either the humanities or social sciences division.Courses"
AH 101," Introduction to Art and Visual Culture. (Humanities) This course is designed to introduce the student to aspects of the history of Western painting, sculpture, and architecture from the Renaissance through the present. We examine the various schools and movements in their historical contexts while paying particular attention to the histories that bear upon them, such as the influence of the classical past, religion, gender, political power, and the rise of the artist. The course, therefore, attempts two goals: one, to familiar-ize students with the principal monuments of the Western tradition from about 1400 onward, that is, the paintings, sculptures, build-ings, and artifacts that form the substance of this narrative; two, to develop visual literacy, that is, the ability not only to identify but also to discuss artworks in a way that develops critical competence and an understanding of how the Western tradition of art has come about.

CLT 255A," Great Russian Writers). Courses in comparative literature and cultural theory examine the politics, philosophy, history, and general cultural context of works of art, cinema, theater, popular culture, and literature. CLT courses encourage interdisciplinary work, especially with African and African-American studies; art history; film and media studies; gender, sexuality, and women’s studies; history; Jewish studies; and religion and classics. The major and minor in comparative literature offer an opportunity to compare and contrast theories of literature and culture in a global context. MLC welcomes students with primary interests in fields other than literature, whose diverse backgrounds and viewpoints enrich our exploration of interdisciplinary and cross-cultural studies.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsThe study of languages and cultures opens minds and attitudes and enables people to break down boundaries in daily life, business, science, and the arts. In MLC, you can begin study of a modern language, continue work in a language you have studied elsewhere, or pursue advanced studies in the literatures and cultures of the world. The department also encourages you to make use of the diversity of its offerings to enhance your studies in other fields. Language advisors can help you design a program of study in language, literature, and culture that fits your particular interests. If you major in the sciences, history, political science, anthropology, or other social sciences or any of the College’s humanities programs, MLC has courses that enhance your program of study and distinguish you as speakers of other languages.  The fall semester is the best time to begin or to continue with the study of a language and culture, as all the national programs in the  department offer elementary and intermediate courses at the start of the year. Students with no previous experience in a particular language may enter any 101 course; placement is necessary for all other language courses and levels. The 101 and 102 undergraduate courses constitute the first year of language study. Courses numbered 151–153 are at the intermediate or second-year level. Courses at the 200 level require placement as well.FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[66For Students with Previous Language Training The College Board Subject Test Advanced Placement scores or International Baccalaureate rankings assist departmental advisors in finding the right course level for you.

CLT 242," The Films of Pier Paolo Pasolini. Pier Paolo Pasolini is one of Italy’s major 20th-century artists and intellectuals. He worked as a poet, novelist, filmmaker, playwright, essayist, and painter and created scandal with his radical critique of Italy’s modernization and rising consumer culture in the 1960s. As a director, he made some of the most challenging and controversial films in cinema history. This course gives students a solid under-standing of his major films by examining how each work addresses Italy’s transformation from a premodern, agrarian, and artisanal culture to a modern, capitalist one. Films include Accattone, Mamma Roma, The Hawks and the Sparrows, Theorem, The Decameron and Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. To provide students with a founda-tion in Pasolini’s thinking and in film analysis, discussions focus on both thematic and formal issues, such as Marxist politics, Catholi-cism, homoeroticism, sexuality, violence, and his pastiche style.

Readings (in translation) include myths and legends, su-pernatural poetry, religious or religion-inflected texts, popular ghost stories, and works of fiction. In class, we discuss common motifs and significance associated with these supernatural encounters, including but not limited to humanity’s relationship to the natural world and metaphysical or existential questions about life, death, and the uni-verse; at the same time, we consider the often-blurry lines between “history,” “myth,” and “fiction” and the significance such designa-tions have for scholarly interpretations.

We also discuss how censorship affects educational institutions, the media, forms of popular entertainment, and the Internet. We explore the logistics of controlling material that is considered unsuit-able for public consumption and the role of technological develop-ment in this process. Assignments focus primarily on the analysis of texts and objects via short, carefully crafted argumentative essays. Students will rewrite their essays after they receive feedback. (Fall)"

Is it okay to kill someone if doing so would bring about good? If there is no God, is everything allowed? When—if ever—can innocent people be held responsible for the crimes others commit? These are the questions at the heart of Fy-odor Dostoevsky’s novels. The problems of social justice, crime and punishment, and the existence of God constitute a thread that runs throughout his career, from his debut novel Poor Folk to his fictional memoir of his time in a Siberian prison camp (Letters from the House of the Dead), to his two major murder mysteries, Crime and Punish-ment and Brothers Karamazov. We follow these themes closely as we unpack the writer’s life and works through close readings of his texts.

Let no such man be trusted.”—William ShakespeareInformation about the DepartmentStudents from all disciplines may participate in the pleasures of musical study and performance to acquire a deeper understanding of the many ways music reflects values of various cultures, influences lives, and enriches human existence. The Department of Music in the College offers courses of study leading to the BA degree with a major, a minor, and seven clusters in music. Numerous varied courses address non-majors who wish to study music on an introductory, interdisciplinary, or aesthetic basis. Degree programs, course offer-ings, and performance opportunities in music are diverse and invite choice and flexibility. Courses offered at the Eastman School of Music, normally open to any student presenting the proper prereq-uisites, augment the range and depth of musical experiences and courses available to students in the College.  Full-time, matriculated undergraduate students who perform at an intermediate level and pass an entrance audition may take applied music lessons at Eastman. See Departmental Advice for First-Year Students, below, about applying and auditioning for lessons; interested students should visit www.esm.rochester.edu/lessons and sign up for an audition, preferably before August 15.

And indeed, we might also with reason call it an art, for it is both a composite of perceptions...and is not useless to life.—Aristides QuintilianusOn Music (late third century A.D.)Information about the ProgramThe music and sound program is a group of undergraduate curricu-lar initiatives that grew out of a collaboration between faculty in the University’s arts, sciences, and engineering disciplines and the East-man School of Music. Music, science, and engineering play pivotal roles in the University of Rochester and in the broader Rochester community. The music and sound program provides opportunities for interdisciplinary study in these areas.  The music and sound program includes two minors and four clusters that explore and unite the topics of music theory and music processing; language structure and processing; the auditory system that processes both music and language; and cognition, the larger set of abilities of perception, memory, and learning that permit humans to appreciate and learn music and language. The core undergradu-ate course in music and sound is "
BCS 260," Music and the Mind. This course is a requirement for all minors and clusters. While one semester of music theory is a prerequisite for all students before tak-ing , students who are already taking music theory as part of a major or minor in music can take advantage of several clusters “designed for musicians.” These clusters encourage the student to pursue an additional course in language, linguistics, or cognition to round out their experiences, rather than simply overlapping with their knowledge of music theory.Advice for First-Year StudentsStudents interested in a cluster or minor in music and sound should consider completing one or more of the following during their first year: , Music and the Mind.Clusters and MinorsFour clusters are available within the discipline of music and sound: Music and Linguistics for Musicians (S1MAS001) fulfills the social science divisional requirement; Music Cognition (N1MAS002), Mu-sic Cognition for Musicians (N1MAS001), and Music and Language for Musicians (N1MAS003) each fulfill the natural science divisional requirement. Details of these clusters can be found on the Cluster Search Engine or music and sound website.

Rochester students completing the BS in optics in recent years have chosen to pursue graduate studies in optics, physics, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering; to accept positions as optical engineers in the thriving regional and international optics  industry; to work in engineering sales; and to enter business  programs to pursue an MBA. Medicine and law also offer significant opportunities for someone with a background in optics. Optical  instrumentation and techniques are increasingly important in medical research and medical practice, so a medical doctor (or an MD/PhD) with a BS in optics is uniquely educated to become a key participant in these emerging areas.

Examples of study abroad program sites for optics include Australia, Israel, Sweden, Spain, and New Zealand.For more information, go to hajim.rochester.edu/optics/.PHILOSOPHY“Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions . . . but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination, and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation.”—Bertrand RussellInformation about the Department/ Advice for First-Year StudentsPhilosophy addresses a wide range of questions in areas such as:•  Metaphysics and Epistemology (What is the fundamental na-ture of reality, and what is our place in it? What can we know, and how can we get that knowledge?)FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[78Courses"
PHL 101,", two core courses in the history of philosophy, one course in logic, and an undergraduate major seminar. Many philosophy majors are double majors. Concentrators wishing to emphasize a particular subfield of interest may make use of optional guidelines for ways of satisfying the major that emphasize either Law and Ethics, History of Philosophy, or Logic and the Philosophy of Science. Majors who qualify may participate in the philosophy Honors program. (For more information about requirements and guidelines, see sas.roches-ter.edu/phl/undergraduate/major.html.)  The Department of Philosophy also offers four different minors: the general Philosophy Minor (PH); Ethics Minor in Philosophy (PH-E); History of Philosophy Minor (PH-H); and Philosophy of Science Minor (PH-S). There are also six clusters in philoso-phy: Ethics and Values (H1PHL001); History of Philosophy (H1PHL002); Knowledge, Mind, and Nature (H1PHL003); Philosophy and Law (H1PHL004); Philosophy and Teaching Internship (H1PHL005); and Logic (N1PHL001). All except the logic cluster are in the humanities; the logic cluster is in the natural sciences. Many introductory courses may be used as the first course in a cluster. For more information on our minors (each of which requires only five courses, meeting various conditions) and clusters, see sas.rochester.edu/phl/undergraduate/minor.html.  Many philosophy majors go on to law school, where they find the analytic and critical skills emphasized in philosophy most useful. Others go on to medical school, business school, graduate school in other fields, or various professions. Some go on to do graduate work in philosophy. All students who wish to take a philosophy course, including those students who plan to major or minor in philosophy, should begin with any of the introductory courses listed below.International Baccalaureate (IB)Philosophy—Students who receive a higher-level exam score of 5 or better are awarded credit for .

PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY“The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.”—Albert EinsteinInformation about the Department The Department of Physics and Astronomy is dedicated to provid-ing an environment that gives flexibility and customized study plans in which all undergraduate students have the resources they need to succeed. The research interests of the department are very broad, covering condensed-matter physics, nuclear and particle physics, biological physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, quantum optics, atomic and molecular physics, astrophysics, and infrared astronomy. Research colloquia and seminars are offered every week during the academic year and are open to undergraduates.  We offer special programs for undergraduate students, such as the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), the Rochester Symposium for Undergraduate Physics Students (RSPS), and the Teaching Internship Program. In addition, the department supports a students’ section of the American Institute of Physics, serving the interests of undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduate students are encouraged to engage in research activities at research laboratories on and off campus. There are opportunities for learning data analysis using the excellent computer facilities of the depart-ment. More information is available in the Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Handbook available from our undergraduate office (Room 211 Bausch & Lomb Hall) and on our website at www.pas.rochester.edu.General AdviceThe Department of Physics and Astronomy offers programs leading to the BA or BS in physics; the BA or BS in physics and astronomy; minors in either physics or astronomy; and certificates in biological physics, medical physics, or biological and medical physics.  The BA program in physics is designed for those students interested in physics in conjunction with another area of human endeavor (law, environmental sciences, energy policy, medicine, business, engineering, education, etc.). It lends itself to a double major with other departments.  The BS program in physics provides a thorough preparation for graduate work in physics or astrophysics and is appropriate for stu-dents with career interests in teaching and research.

For that reason, students are encouraged to consider a cluster or a class from the humanities and/or social sciences. Students should meet with an advisor to discuss their options. NOTEWORTHY EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS99]e5 PROGRAMThe University of Rochester defines entrepreneurship as the “trans-formation of an idea into an enterprise that generates value”—intel-lectual, social, cultural, or economic. More than just a discrete set of business skills or practices, entrepreneurship is a way of thinking and approaching problems. The e5 Program provides selected students with the opportunity to devote one or two semesters, tuition-free, in their fifth year to the study and practice of entrepreneurship and experiential learning. Students may propose to participate in intern-ships, special projects, business plan development, research into various facets of entrepreneurship, or analysis of how culture and public policy influence entrepreneurial activity. Applications may be submitted once students have been accepted into a major and up to the fall semester of the senior year.CERTIFICATE AND CITATION  PROGRAMSCertificate programs are taken in conjunction with, not in place of, majors. They are meant to supplement a student’s chosen area of study and to formalize into a coherent whole, courses taken outside the area of the major. Specific requirements for each program are listed in the Undergraduate Bulletin.College certificate programs administered through the Multidisci-plinary Studies Center (MSC) are:•  Actuarial Studies: 7 courses and 2.5 GPA required. Must also demonstrate computer proficiency.•  Literary Translation: 7 courses. Students must earn a minimum grade of C in all certificate components. A maximum of 3 courses may be transferred from other schools; these courses must have prior approval of the faculty advisor.•  Mathematical Modeling in Political Science and Economics: 9–10 courses and 2.0 GPA required.Note that courses used toward these certificates may not be taken on the S/F option. Completion of one of these certificates appears as a notation on the transcript. Information concerning these certificates is available from the Multidisciplinary Studies Center in Lattimore 203, and details are on its website at rochester.edu/college/msc/.Other certificate programs available to students are•  Stage Management (administered by the Department of English)•  Biophysics (administered through the Department of Physics and Astronomy)—under review by the New York State Education Department•  Medphysics (administered through the Department of Physics and Astronomy)—under review by the New York State Educa-tion DepartmentEDUCATION ABROADStudents majoring in all academic disciplines may go abroad. By the time of graduation, about one third of University of Rochester undergraduates have had an international education experience. Most students study abroad in their junior year or in the first semes-ter of their senior year, although a number of programs are open to sophomores. Education abroad during the summer is also an option. The University offers more than 75 programs in more than 40 coun-tries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and New Zealand. In addition to study abroad, there are internship, research, and service learning opportunities overseas. There’s something for everyone!  University of Rochester students interested in education abroad experiences have an expanded selection of opportunities in exchange programs. Exchange programs offer students the option of directly enrolling for a semester or year of study at select partner institu-tions. Direct enrollment provides undergraduates the opportunity to explore and study abroad in a more independent, self-directed way by integrating fully into the campus community as a full-time student. Consult with an education abroad advisor about exchange opportunities in Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and more. Students who participate in an exchange program are eligible to receive a $2,000 grant.  It’s never too early to start exploring your options. The best way to find out more is to attend an education abroad general informa-tion meeting and to meet with an education abroad peer advisor. Schedules are available on our website: www.rochester.edu/abroad. Students majoring in science and engineering are especially encour-aged to begin exploring their options during their first year.  University of Rochester financial aid and scholarships apply to-ward University of Rochester semester programs. Advisors will also direct students to other education abroad scholarships. With careful planning, any student can go abroad!  The Center for Education Abroad (CEA) is located in Dewey Hall, room 2-161. Feel free to call (585) 275-7532, or email abroad@rochester.edu. The CEA staff looks forward to meeting you to help you plan your experience abroad.TAKE FIVE SCHOLARS PROGRAMThe Take Five Scholars Program, unique to the University of Rochester, provides free tuition for an additional year or semester of study designed to enrich a student’s curriculum. Students admitted to the Take Five program pursue a sustained and coherent inter-disciplinary topic of intellectual interest. The program offers an opportunity to learn for the joy of learning alone: Take Five courses may not be used to complete Rochester Curriculum requirements or requirements for major or to prepare for graduate school. Students may submit an application—once they’ve been admitted into a major—until the fall semester of their senior year. Some sample program titles include “Media and Its Effect on Gender Roles and Perceptions,” “Chinese Sign Language Comparison and Analysis,” and “The Intricate Puzzle of the Mind.” Since its inception in 1986, more than 1,100 undergraduate students from the River Campus and the Eastman School of Music have become Take Five Scholars. There is currently no limit to the number of students accepted into the program, and new students are admitted each semester.[100FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOKalso many awards that students can apply for directly; the Fellow-ships Office aids students in pursuing both.  These competitive fellowship programs provide financial rewards as well as career-related opportunities based on academic merit, in addition to other selection factors, including distinctive achieve-ments in research, campus involvement, leadership, community ser-vice, and civic engagement. A few programs also consider financial need status. Some fellowships can be used only in the United States, but there are also programs for international experiences. Some of these programs provide funds to support undergraduate-level study and research, while others support advanced study and professional opportunities after the completion of a bachelor’s degree. The Fellowships Office maintains information on and advises students applying for a selected group of high-profile awards. (We are not experts on every competitive award.) Becoming aware of these op-portunities in the first year at the University of Rochester can better position students to present competitive applications in the future, which may be as early as the spring semester. Rochester students have been consistently successful in many of these competitions, and you, too, can join the list of winners.  The Fellowships Office invites students with outstanding academic and extracurricular records to apply for appropriate fel-lowships and scholarships based on the individual student’s profile and goals; our professional staff mentor candidates throughout the application process. Applications often need to be started several months in advance of national deadlines. Students interested in learning more about these awards and the application process may attend an information session, visit the fellowships website at www.rochester.edu/college/studentfellowships, or stop by the Fellowships Office in 4-209B Dewey Hall. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter at /URFellowships. After reviewing published informational materials, students are encouraged to take the next step of visiting the office  to discuss specific awards in light of their academic interests and aspirations.  Maybe there’s a Critical Language Scholarship, Goldwater, Ful-bright, or Rhodes in your future. Your first year is the perfect time to begin preparing for these potentially life-changing opportunities.SENIOR SCHOLARS RESEARCH PROGRAMThe Senior Scholars Program permits selected seniors to devote at least half of the entire final year to a single capstone project that can range from a piece of scholarly research to a work of artistic creativ-ity. Senior Scholar projects are marked by intellectual engagement and coherence and by educational soundness and continuity. The projects may include coursework in addition to "

If men were angels, no government would be necessary.”—James MadisonThe Federalist No. 51Information about the DepartmentPolitical science is the attempt to discover, describe, and explain how politics manifests itself in the world. Our subject matter emerges from numerous contexts, including U.S. local, state, and national politics; the politics of other nations; and international relations. It also arises from more abstract, philosophical concerns. We attempt to create knowledge by the development and use of rigorous theory and the drive to generalize and by rigorous empirical testing through sophisticated, theory-relevant statistical and qualitative methods.  In Rochester’s Department of Political Science, we teach stu-dents how to understand real-world politics and give them the tools to think, question, and act. Our graduates pursue an array of careers, including teaching, medicine, and research, but most graduates find that political science gives them a background that is especially useful for careers in law, government, policy analysis, business, or journalism.  The department offers majors, minors, and clusters in political science and in international relations. The department’s website contains detailed information on undergraduate advising, course of-ferings, distribution requirements, upper-level writing requirements, internships, and departmental honors. We also have faculty advisors available to answer questions nearly every weekday morning and afternoon during the academic year. Names and office hours of advi-sors are on the department website. Students may find our website at www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/.Departmental Advice for First-Year StudentsThe department offers a number of introductory courses at the 100 level that are especially suited for first-year students. These courses are described briefly below. "

In addition to two 75-minute lectures each week, one workshop each week and one three-hour laboratory every other week are required. Laboratory and workshop registration is done at the same time as course registration.  Electricity and Magnetism (Mas-tery/Self-paced) covers the same material as "
AST 106," Cosmic Origins of Life. A review of the evidence for habitats and the building blocks of life in extraterrestrial space, the possibilities for the development of life elsewhere, and the light that these ideas cast on the origins of life on Earth. We also discuss the future of civilizations like ours, the possibilities of travel to other habitable planets, and communication between advanced cultures spread widely through space. The material we discuss is drawn very widely from astronomy, physics, geology, chemistry, and biology, presented with a minimum of mathematical complexity. Prerequi-sites: none. (Fall or Spring)"
AST 142," Elementary Astrophysics. Application of the physics and math techniques learned in the introductory course sequences to the study of celestial objects outside the solar system. We discuss stars and their formation from interstellar matter, the structure of galaxies and their distribution in the universe, and the origins and large-scale structure of the universe: all topics that are devel-oped much further in the "

PSC 200," (Data Analysis I) is also appro-priate for first-year students. We strongly recommend that students interested in political science take at least two of these courses (IR/) in their first year. Many other 200-level courses are open to first-year students and may be suitable for students who have performed very well on an AP exam in American politics or comparative government, or who have an excellent background in high school courses in history and government and a strong interest in political science or international relations. However, even these students generally take 100-level courses or  (Data Analysis I), at least in their first semester of college. First-year students who have questions about any particular course should speak either to a departmental advisor or directly to the course instructor at the beginning of the semester.  We strongly recommend that students interested in international relations take two of the courses in the field in the first year. Options include  (Data Analysis I). Students might also look for other courses, including 100-level courses that count toward one of the specialized tracks and 200-level courses open to first-year students. Students are also advised to begin or continue courses in a foreign language. Not only does this help meet the requirements, but it also allows the student to consider opportunities for study abroad that require proficiency in a language other than English.Advanced Placement (AP) Political ScienceStudents who received a score of 4 or 5 on the AP exam in either American or Comparative Government will be granted 4 credits in political science. Students who received a score of 4 or 5 on both AP exams are not eligible for additional credit.Advanced Placement (AP) International RelationsStudents who received a score of 4 or 5 on the AP exam in Ameri-can or Comparative Government or a score of 5 in U.S., European, or World History will be granted credit for one course toward the international relations major. Students who received a score of 4 or 5 on multiple AP exams are not eligible for additional credit.Courses Data Analysis I. Data analysis has become a key part of many fields, including politics, business, law, and public policy. This course covers the fundamentals of data analysis, giving students the necessary statistical skills to understand and critically analyze contemporary political, legal, and policy puzzles. Lectures focus on the theory and practice of quantitative analysis, and weekly lab ses-sions guide students through the particulars of statistical software. No prior knowledge of statistics or data analysis is required.

Instruction is offered through-out this broad spectrum of behavior and mental life issues, treating both the natural science and social science aspects of psychology. Coursework includes theoretical and empirical emphases, as well as the application of psychology to the “helping professions.” Student experiences may range from lecture courses, many with small recita-tions, to individual laboratory, practicum, and internship situations. Individual programs, including a major, minors, an honors program, and several clusters, may be tailored to provide excellent background for postgraduate work in psychology, medicine, education, busi-ness, social work, counseling, and other related social and natural sciences, as well as entry into various occupations, particularly those involving delivery of human services.  Students planning to pursue graduate studies in psychology are advised to seek general breadth and focused depth in their knowledge of psychology as well as a working familiarity with research skills.Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB)"
PSC 101,",  (Introduction to Comparative Politics),  Introduction to Comparative Politics. Why do democracies emerge, and what explains their vibrancy (or lack thereof?) What causes ethnic conflict? Why do revolutions occur? Why does it matter what rules democracies use for elections? This course introduces students to comparative politics and the study of these important domestic political institutions, processes, and out-comes across and within countries. Cases are drawn from different countries and historical periods to give students a grounding in the method of comparative analysis. (Fall)"

Positive political theory is a line of thought that starts with the premise that politics amounts to nothing more or less than a process through which we choose between the competing values, wants, or interests of different persons. It asks whether widely held aspirations regard-ing how such conflicts are resolved are actually possible to realize and, if so, how. In this class you learn and practice the basic tech-niques that positive political theorists use to explore this simple but powerful view of politics. (Spring)"

Everett KoopInformation about the ProgramThe study of public health provides a rich intellectual framework for the multidisciplinary study of society’s most challenging problems. The program is designed to help students develop the many different skills that are needed to understand and respond to health chal-lenges that arise in local, regional, and global populations.  The program offers both BA and BS degrees. The program offers BA degrees in bioethics; in epidemiology; in health policy; and in health, behavior, and society. The BS is intended for students who want to specialize in environmental health. The program also offers four minors and six clusters. (Students may choose to major, minor, or complete a cluster within the program, but they may not do more than one).Program Advice for First-Year StudentsThe study of public health integrates a wide range of disciplines: it requires, for example, the ability to use and understand statistics, to understand how human and environmental factors contribute to hu-man exposure to environmental toxins and pathogens, to empathize with people from different backgrounds and cultures, to understand social institutions that structure health care, and to analyze complex ethical situations. For that reason, all of the public health programs require a set of core competencies in a variety of disciplines, and each of the majors incorporates courses from many different depart-ments to support its intellectual goals. Indeed, the majors fall into different divisions of the College: epidemiology; health policy; and health, behavior, and society (and their associated minors) are in the social sciences division; bioethics (and its minor) is in the humani-ties; and environmental health is in the natural sciences. We also offer clusters in natural sciences (Epidemiology and Statistics), social sciences (Introduction to Public Health; Health, Environment, and Sustainability; Health Policy; Medicine in Context), and humani-ties (Bioethics). A public health–related major or minor is an ideal way to ex-plore an interest in the health professions of medicine, dentistry, and nursing. To integrate fully an interest in public health with admis-sions requirements for professional schools, students are strongly encouraged to meet with a health professions advisor in the Gwen M. Greene Career and Internship Center.  All the public health majors require the same core of five courses, so those courses are an excellent place to explore the majors: "
PH 101,",  Introduction to Public Health I. This is a broad survey course designed to introduce beginning students to public health history, concepts, and contemporary issues locally, nationally, and globally. The course is divided into four sections: What is Public Health (history and definitions); Public Health Disparities (health and wealth; social justice; who gets sick/who stays healthy); Issues in Public Health (lead poisoning; tobacco; obesity; emergency; clean water/air; injury; health systems/reform); and Global Health Issues (globalization and development; maternal and child health). (Fall and Spring). (Spring)"
PH 102,",  Introduction to Public Health II. This is a broad survey course designed to introduce beginning students to four core areas in public health: biostatistics, health policy and management, envi-ronmental health science, and social and behavioral sciences. Each of these areas is addressed by experts in the field. Prerequisite: "
PH 103,",  Concepts of Epidemiology. This course provides begin-ning students with the fundamental concepts needed to understand health-related information and health policy. The course introduces students to the history of epidemiology and the basic methodologi-cal principles used to describe disease occurrence in populations and identify causes of disease. These concepts are subsequently discussed in the context of health policy, outbreak investigations, and epide-miological specialties. (Fall), "
PHL 225," or 228. Many of these courses are also required to complete a minor or clus-ter. But students can also learn about the basic themes of the majors in the other courses listed below.Courses Ethical Decisions in Medicine. Medicine produces some of the most troubling ethical questions that our society faces. We are now confronted with extremely premature infants, elderly people incapacitated by Alzheimer’s disease, and others who have sunk into permanent vegetative states. We can diagnose horrible dis-FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[86eases with genetic testing, we have myriad options of reproduction if the old-fashioned way is not possible, and we have the option to replace the failing organs and even to enhance our mental and physi-cal abilities. Behind all these issues are deep questions about social justice in the allocation of resources of health care. In this class, we examine some of these ethical controversies both in lectures and in small groups, in which students have more opportunity to present their own views and explore those of others. Students enroll in one of three discussion sections as well as the lecture. Prerequisite: one previous course in philosophy or permission of instructor. (Spring)"
PH 116," Introduction to the U.S. Health System. This course examines the organization, financing, and functioning of the United States health care system. It also explores historical perspectives and the insights of international comparisons. Topics include the eco-nomics of the U.S. health system, access to care, health policy and politics, and disability and disability politics. (Fall)"
PH 201," Environmental Health. This course covers the basic prin-ciples used to evaluate the potential human health risk of exposure to environmental contaminants in air, water, and food. Prerequisites: "
PHL 228," Public Health Ethics. Most health care ethics focus on the individual decisions about health care, but many ethical questions have implications for society at large. The demands that individual health decisions make on the system may create collec-tive problems, and conversely, the needs of society may limit the freedoms that individuals think they should have. Public health ethics, then, lie at the intersection of medicine, political philosophy, and public policy. This course examines the values of health, social needs, and freedom through a systematic examination of situations in which these conflicts arise. Three papers, weekly responses, class participation. Prerequisite: one previous course in philosophy or permission of the instructor. (Fall)"

REL 125," Religion, Race, and Ethnicity in America. A method-ological inquiry into ethnicity, race, and religion as constituents of personal and communal identity. The course emphasizes the implica-tions of these categories for a religiously pluralistic society such as the United States. Topics include American immigration history, race relations, and the process of Americanization. How do Ameri-cans achieve “whiteness”? What is the difference between “ethnic” and “racial”? How are these differences gendered? How does religion factor into these questions? Twentieth and 21st-century shifts in American religions."
REL 145," Judaism in America. Explores the development of American Judaism through the interplay of religion, ethnicity, politics, and culture."
REL 147," Women in Judaism. In this course we examine ap-proaches to the body and gender as described and manifested in Jewish texts, rituals, and communal practice from the biblical period to the present. We look at interpretations of the body and its effect on the status of women in particular in the Bible and Talmud, pay-ing close attention to the historical and cultural contexts of these interpretations. There is a strong focus on modern reevaluations of gender and the body and how such revaluations have transformed what it means to be “Jewish.” Topics include rites of passage, images of women in the Bible, and feminist theology as well as theories and depictions of the “Jewish body.”"

Moreover, the shortage of informed expertise transcends our borders. The House of Lords’ scathing 2014 report attacked the UK’s demolition of its Russian expertise and that Britain has sleepwalked through the crisis leading to the invasion of Ukraine. French analysts tell a similar story in France.”—“Countering Putin begins with knowing what his regime is  saying” article in The Hill (American political newspaper  published in Washington, D.C.)Information about the ProgramRussian studies is an interdepartmental program in the College that incorporates the perspectives of several disciplines and the linguistic, historical, and cultural background needed to understand Russia’s past, to analyze its present, and to make responsible assessments about its future.  The three departments providing the core faculty for this program are modern languages and cultures, history, and political science, but a concentration may include courses in, or cross-listed with, international relations, religion and classics, Judaic studies, Polish and Central European studies, film studies, women’s studies, comparative literature, and economics. The Russian studies cur-riculum, like Russia itself, is an evolving work in progress, with new courses added and old ones revised to reflect new knowledge in this area and changing opportunities for graduates.  A Russian studies major or minor can be designated as belong-ing either to the humanities or social sciences, depending on the student’s course choices. Students with a strong interest in Russian studies have done second majors in history, political science, inter-national relations, and other fields. Russia has a history and culture that go back more than a millennium, while its democracy and market economy are relatively new. The Russian Studies Program prepares students not only to know about this area but also to work in Russia or to prepare for future graduate study and careers in the field.Program Advice for First-Year StudentsAlmost any course in our curriculum that interests you is a good place to get started, whether it is language, literature, current events, history, art history, or an introductory course in international poli-tics. All Russian studies courses are open to first-semester first-year students.ClustersThe program offers two humanities clusters: 1) Introduction to Rus-sian Culture and Civilization, and 2) Russian Studies. There is also a Russian Studies Cluster in the Social Sciences—Great Experiments: Identities and Cultures in Transition. Additional Russian clusters are offered through the Department of Modern Languages and Cul-tures and the Department of History.

The course surveys Russian film from the beginnings to the present. The course investigates the major role that cinema played in shaping the national and political identity of the Soviet Union and looks at what was artistically interesting and popular about these films, some of whose directors, like Eisenstein and Tarkovsky, are among the world’s most influential filmmakers. In English."
RST 222," Russian Drama. An introduction to the Russian theater in its cultural and political context, with close readings of plays from the late 18th century to the late 20th century. The early comic masterpieces of Griboedov and Gogol held up a mirror to social problems and gave birth to plays on social themes by Ostrovsky and Tolstoy in the late 19th century. The plays of Anton Chekhov at the turn of the century both anticipated and highly influenced the developments of modern theater in the decades to follow, both in Russia and abroad. We conclude by examining theater in the Soviet period in plays by Kharms, Bulgakov, and others. In English."

Statistical techniques are also widely used in biological, educational, genetic, psychological, and other sciences. Refined statistical proce-dures are extensively employed in economics for studying education needs, predicting economic growth, forecasting industrial produc-tion and employment rates, studying stock market fluctuations, and assessing the environment, health care, and social welfare. A number of political and social studies routinely employ a variety of statistical procedures.  The program in statistics offers a wide variety of courses for a major or minor in statistics, a joint major in mathematics/statistics, and the prerequisites for majors in other departments. Some of these courses are also required for the certificates in actuarial and manage-ment studies and for three clusters within statistics.

To me, writing is more gratifying than balancing a chemical equation, more expressive than musical composition, and more difficult than calculus.”—Ian StanleyPsychology Major, Class of 2012Information about the ProgramThe Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program (WSAP), in con-cert with faculty across the College, builds a strong community of undergraduate and graduate writers, speakers, and researchers. Writ-ing, speaking, and argument enable us to discover, develop, test, and communicate our ideas. Effective communication—including criti-cal thinking, problem solving, organization of ideas, and clarity and power of expression—is of enormous importance in both academic and professional settings. Through communication, we see the truth, utility, or beauty of what we know and make our knowledge have an impact on the world at large. WSAP leads the effort to familiarize students with key principles and strategies for becoming successful communicators across different modes and contexts and fosters a culture of open, honest, and critical communication.  WSAP is home to the Primary Writing Requirement (PWR); the undergraduate English for Academic Purposes Program (EAPP); a range of undergraduate writing courses related to writing, speaking, argument, and tutoring; and the Writing and Speaking Center, where students can find tutoring services. WSAP offers two minors that introduce students to the different disciplinary practices around writing, speaking, and argument. The minor also provides a flexible writing curriculum to complement students’ academic and professional interests. To begin to explore the breadth of writing studies, the program offers clusters that focus on language, digital and multimodal composition, writing theory and practice, and com-munity engagement.Primary Writing Requirement and Placement InformationAll students at the University of Rochester, whether incoming first-year students or transfers, must satisfy the Primary Writing Require-ment.

WRT 250," Modern English Grammar. This course is a comprehensive review of the grammar of modern standard English. The course is of interest to those who wish to sharpen their language skills or to know more about the workings of the English language whether for practical, cognitive, or creative ends. Drawing on work in mostly pretheoretical, descriptive linguistics, this course reveals the mechanics of standard English structure with occasional detours into the finesse of usage across registers (dialect to slang). Students learn to develop the ability to see patterns in grammar as well as its structural possibilities and limits. Assignments regularly involve reflection on form, usage, and speaker judgments. Through a final project, students investigate some aspect of an English variety avail-able to them. Throughout, students work with their data samples of English to explore how speaker choices lead to particular grammati-cal structures or yield ungrammaticality. Background in linguistics or grammar not needed.  (Fall)"
WRT 251," The Rhetorical Sentence. Drawing on work in linguis-tics and rhetorical grammar (e.g., Halliday, Biber, Kolln, Hyland), this course investigates the sentence—its structure, its potential, and FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOK[94its limits in creating meaning. Students learn about the form and function of “the sentence” and its parts, develop the ability to see patterns and possibilities within and across sentences, and create and analyze sentences of wildly different shapes. Assignments regularly involve meaningful play with sentences. Through a final project, stu-dents investigate some aspect of the sentence in extended discourse or discuss how knowledge of the sentence might be meaningfully integrated into a writing curriculum. This course is ideal for those interested in writing, writing education, or editing. Background in linguistics or grammar is not necessary. Open to undergraduates and graduate students. (Fall and Spring)"
WRT 252," Principles and Practices of Copyediting. While the term “copyediting” may be associated with journalism or literary fiction, in fact it is a vital component of the publication of almost any textual materials—from scholarly and popular publishing in arts and sciences to corporate and technical communications. So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the informa-tion age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we address both the principles and prac-tices of copyediting. Students learn the principles that guide copy editors and then put these principles into use in a workshop setting, practicing copyediting in a variety of contexts, including digital communications. Prerequisite: PWR satisfied. (Spring)"
WRT 261," Writing in a Digital World. The purpose of writing in a digital world is to engage with a broader community around a topic of interest and contribute to public knowledge. In this course, students are invited to dig deeply into a question of interest, write for a public audience, and use the Internet as an archive of informa-tion waiting to be discovered, analyzed, and written about. Students can draw on pre-existing research interests from their majors or develop a line of inquiry stemming from class discussions, writing, and research. In order to gain experience writing to a range of read-ers, students engage in a writing process informed by peer review, self-assessment, and revision. Shorter writing assignments help stu-dents develop and refine ideas as they transform texts for different audiences. The final research project is multimodal, published for a public audience, and should demonstrate ability to think criti-cally about a topic and effectively communicate that knowledge to a range of readers. Prerequisite: PWR satisfied. (Spring)"
WRT 262," Reading and Writing about Research in the  Social, Natural, and Applied Sciences. Drawing on the con-cepts of discourse community and rhetorical genre analysis (e.g., Ba-zerman, Berkenhotter and Huckin, Swales), this course investigates ways of understanding the choices writers make when communicat-ing about the sciences, with the goal of better understanding how to read and write as an “insider” in your chosen discipline. You develop a technical vocabulary and set of skills that allow you to identify and describe recurring patterns and describe writer choices within those patterns. Using these tools, you investigate how writers convey meaning in different disciplinary situations and why they make the writing choices that they do in order to convey meaning. Through a final research project of your choice, you practice using what you have learned to communicate the results of your own research.  Prerequisite: PWR satisfied. (Spring)"

WRT 263," Translation: Interpreting and Adapting. This writing studies course counts toward the Citation in Community-Engaged Scholarship. Interdisciplinary and team problem solving oriented by design, the course investigates a range of potentially high-stakes translation cases involving textual, audiovi-sual, and multimodal renditions of a source work into a target work. These may include translating an ad or museum label; subtitling a TED Talk or foreign-language stage production; dubbing in anime or games; recasting research procedure in video; or mediated inter-preting as in ethnographic studies, business meetings, or medical settings. Course readings and informal translations support students in learning how a given situation affects the choices and strategies that translators use to maintain the viability of their work. Based on their earlier informal exercises and interests, students work in teams and with our community partners in the 19th Ward to create final projects that provide meaningful extensions of course learning to real-world issues.

WRT 265," Writing Across Disciplines: Argument and  Evidence. In this course, students examine three central ques-tions: what is argument, what is evidence, and what is unique about different forms of disciplinary inquiry. The purpose of this course is to examine how argument is enacted in different contexts and how that affects our understanding of evidence. We begin by looking at traditional philosophical conceptions of argument and use this understanding as a basis for comparison of how arguments are devel-oped and supported in different academic disciplines. We also think about how argument is manifested in different divisions of academic inquiry such as the humanities and social sciences. For instance, we might ask if history falls within the humanities or social sciences and why, or how the digitization of the humanities is affecting humanis-tic conceptions of argument and evidence. Students are encouraged to investigate writing from several disciplinary perspectives of their choice as a means to investigate these questions. (Fall)Writing and Speaking Center ServicesThe Writing and Speaking Center offers a wide variety of writing and speaking support services for undergraduate students of all levels and in all disciplines. Our office is staffed by graduate-student Writing Consultants and undergraduate Writing and Speaking Fel-lows from the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural and applied sciences. Our tutors provide individualized feedback and assistance on all types of academic writing and speaking. We invite students to use our services during any stage of the writing process, from brainstorming ideas to polishing a final draft.

Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores are considered.  The Simon MS program may be suitable for individuals with focused career goals who desire a graduate business degree with only one additional year of study. Simon offers MS degree options in finance, marketing analytics, business analytics, and accountancy.

Education is growth. Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.”—John DeweyAdvice for First-Year StudentsThe Warner School is a graduate school for students with passion, commitment, and drive who aspire to improve the human condition as leaders in education, broadly conceived as supporting learning and development in a variety of contexts and across the life course. Warner prepares teachers, counselors, K–12 and higher-education administrators, helping professionals, policy analysts, educational policymakers, program evaluators, scholars, researchers, and con-sultants to enter our nation’s most challenging arena and become a powerful force for positive change and social justice.  The Warner School offers master’s and doctoral degree programs that may be of interest to undergraduates considering graduate work in education and human development. Students are encour-aged to take courses in these programs as undergraduates, both to explore the interesting intellectual and career opportunities available in education and to possibly get a jump start on graduate work. Many undergraduates apply to the school’s programs in their senior year. In addition to the core programs in teaching and curriculum, counseling, human development, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), higher education, K–12 school leadership, education policy, online teaching, and program evaluation, Warner has an interdisciplinary program in health professions education that is offered in collabora-tion with the University of Rochester School of Nursing and School GRADUATE PROGRAMS95]FIRST-YEAR ACADEMIC HANDBOOKof Medicine and Dentistry. There is also a new certificate as well as a master’s program for undergraduates interested in teaching English abroad.  The programs tackle enduring challenges in education and hu-man development with fresh, nontraditional approaches. Warner School students think deeply about the many ways that teaching, learning, and development shape lives and societies. By combining research and practice, we work to improve schools and institutions and to make communities more just.  While the University does not offer a bachelor’s program in education, undergraduates interested in education, counseling, and human development—and the many issues related to schools, socialization, learning, leadership, community mental health, and change—are encouraged to take courses at the Warner School. Is-sues such as relations among race, gender, language, ethnicity, class, disability, sexuality, and schooling; uses of technology as teaching and learning tools; interdisciplinary research and its application to human learning and development; community mental health counseling; ties among economic, social, and educational practices and policies; community-based engaged scholarship; entrepreneur-ship and innovation involving education; and other matters of significance to contemporary society may be studied at the Warner School.  Undergraduates are encouraged to explore Warner School courses offered in teaching and curriculum, higher education, edu-cational policy, counseling, human development, online teaching, entrepreneurship, and health professions education. Such courses may complement undergraduate programs in the College and/or of-fer undergraduates the opportunity to explore new intellectual areas and career opportunities in the health, human services, and educa-tion professions. It may even be possible to begin studies for specific careers at the Warner School as an undergraduate. Starting teacher education coursework as an undergraduate provides students with the opportunity to explore and better understand the teaching profession and can allow for the completion of a master’s degree and New York State Teaching Certification in only one additional year of postgraduate study. Students are also encouraged to explore the new certificate program to teach English abroad.  The Warner School offers a number of scholarship opportuni-ties, including time-limited 50 percent guaranteed scholarships for programs leading to New York State teaching certifications for quali-fied University of Rochester undergraduates who are interested in pursuing graduate study at the Warner School. For a complete listing of scholarship opportunities, visit www.warner.rochester.edu/ admissions/scholarships.  In 2015, the New York State Legislature approved a law that stip-ulates applicants to teacher preparation programs that lead to initial teacher certification or educational leadership programs that lead to the school building leadership (SBL) or school district leadership (SDL) certification must submit official scores of a graduate school entrance examination. To be in compliance with this new New York State regulation, the Warner School requires official results from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Miller Analogies Test (MAT). The Warner School is now an official testing center for the MAT, providing students and the surrounding community a place to take the nationally standardized exam in Rochester.  Students who are interested in a career in education and human development are encouraged to meet with a Warner School admis-sions counselor to learn more about programs and opportunities for coursework as an undergraduate. The Office of Admissions offers day and evening appointments for student counseling and school tours. The Warner School is housed in LeChase Hall, located on the historic Wilson Quadrangle between Todd Union and Wilson Commons on the River Campus.For more information, go to warner.rochester.edu.[96NOTEWORTHY EDUCATIONAL OPTIONSGWEN M.
