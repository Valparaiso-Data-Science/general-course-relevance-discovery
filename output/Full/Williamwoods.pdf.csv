10 Mission and Vision Mission An independent voice in higher education, William Woods University distinguishes itself as a student-centered and professions-oriented university committed to the values of ethics, self-liberation, and lifelong education of students in the world community.  Beliefs Responsiveness to student needs is paramount for success for both the students we serve and the institution's viability.   An academic environment demonstrates and promotes creative, intellectual inquiry.   Positive relationships among students, faculty, and staff enhance the learning experience.   Education is inclusive and student-centered.   The institution has a responsibility to demonstrate and promote ethical behavior.   Total development of the individual prepares the individual for a constantly changing world.   The culture of our university and communities is conducive to the positive development of relationships among students, faculty, and staff.   A quality educational environment directly impacts outstanding student achievement.  Recognition William Woods University enjoys the best of both worlds when it comes to reputation - attracting students, faculty and partners nationally for signature programs, while making a significant impact locally and statewide in fields such as business and education.  History: Roots of Compassion, Future of Growth Our Beginnings  Our educational mission began more than 140 years ago in the aftermath of the Civil War in the year 1870. The Christian Church of Missouri, as a work of compassion, founded a school for girls who had been orphaned by the conflict. The Female Orphan School of the Christian Church of Missouri, as it was called, eventually moved to Fulton, our present home, and grew to include other young women in addition to war orphans.  Finances were always a challenge for this labor of love. In 1900, the school was saved from insolvency by a successful Missouri entrepreneur named Dr. William Stone Woods. Together with his wife, Dr. Woods wrote a check that redeemed the school's entire debt. In gratitude, the University has borne his name ever since.   Deeply Held Values  We became a college officially in 1914. Our focus for the next fifty years was on training teachers, a profession built on compassion and the personal commitment to help others grow - values that we have held onto since the beginning. You can still see these values, stronger than ever, at work among faculty and students today. Our Education graduates continue to be outstanding teachers and leaders in the Missouri school system and beyond.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 11 As we grew, we broadened our focus to encompass more of the liberal arts and other elements of higher education. Highlights along the way include the growth of an internationally recognized equestrian program, which offered the nation's first baccalaureate in equestrian science in 1972. We entered intercollegiate sports in 1974, with teams in basketball, softball, track, tennis and swimming.   From College to University  1990 marked a significant milestone: the election of our first female president, Dr. Jahnae H. Barnett. Dr. Barnett's charter was to secure a 21st-century future for William Woods.  Within two years we began offering a wide variety of graduate-level degree programs, geared toward the working adult. We went coed. And we changed the name from William Woods College to William Woods University. With generous support from alumni, foundations and other benefactors, our campus, our programs, and our student body began to look like the William Woods University of today.

Academic Advising The Director of Academic Advisement is a central source of information in all areas of academic programs and policies. The academic ; is available to meet with students who desire assistance in selecting a major or minor. ; Students undecided about a major or minor can receive help in selecting courses and exploring multiple programs of study. All new students are assigned a faculty advisor when they begin their academic coursework. Each faculty advisor assists students in setting goals, making knowledgeable career decisions, selecting a class schedule, and interpreting academic policy. Each student is advised according to University, divisional, and departmental requirements. The student's academic achievements and professional interests are also considered. The ultimate responsibility for complying with University regulations and for meeting degree requirements rests with the student.   Advising First Semester Undergraduate Students   All first semester freshmen are required to take "
WWU 101," Connections. The only exception are Honors students who enroll in , or students who are 23 or older when they enter the university. This course is designed to help students be academically successful, make connections with peers, staff and faculty, and develop life skills necessary for transition into the university experience. Topics relevant to academic success such as time management, test taking, and using the University catalog will be covered. Students may request to be reassigned to a faculty advisor William Woods University Academic Catalog 15 in the academic division of their major following their first semester. These changes of advisors are processed by the Director of Academic Advisement. Academic Dismissal Academic Dismissal is an action initiated by the Vice President of Academic Affairs, which revokes eligibility for continued enrollment in courses or programs conducted under the auspices of the University. Students who have been subjected to Academic Dismissal must apply for readmission to the University. Readmission is infrequently allowed in instances involving Academic Dismissal. Academic Expectations Students entering William Woods University should be prepared for a considerable amount of work outside the classroom. These requirements differ from class to class from discipline to discipline, but most instructors expect two hours of out-of-class work for each course credit hour. All instructors expect their students to be prepared for class. Academic Grievance Students should be protected from prejudice and capriciousness in matters of academic policy and practice. They are entitled to a reasonable explanation of their performance in relation to the standards of a program or a course. Initial inquiries in academic matters should be directed to the course instructor. Appeals should be addressed to the appropriate School Director or Program Manager. If the inquiry with the instructor and the appeal is not satisfactory, the student may file a formal grievance according to the guidelines listed under Grade Appeal. Academic Honor Code William Woods University strives to protect its academic programs by ensuring honesty and integrity by all students in their academic pursuits. Students seeking a quality education are called to act in an academically honorable manner. To do so compels them to engage in certain behaviors and reject others. Being honorable involves behaving ethically and making moral choices consistent with an individual’s conscience. William Woods University depends on the personal integrity of each member of our community to help create and foster an environment that celebrates and embraces acting for the greater good of society. Students’ work and conduct should reflect their decision to act honorably. When students engage in academically dishonest or dishonorable behavior, they diminish the quality of the education they receive, distort the results of assignments, and negatively affect the reputation of their classmates and the University as a whole. When students are found to have engaged in an academically dishonest or dishonorable manner by a faculty member, fellow student, or staff member, they will face repercussions. All instances of academically dishonest behavior will be dealt with per the Academic Integrity Policy and recorded by the University in the student’s record. To this end, it is incumbent on each student to act in an honorable manner about his or her education at William Woods University. ; Academic Integrity/Honesty William Woods University, founded on the principle of honesty, has long endeavored to maintain an atmosphere of academic integrity. In all academic work, it is important that the ideas and contributions of others be appropriately acknowledged, and that work that is presented as original is, in fact, original. ; Ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at William Woods University is a responsibility shared by the entire campus community. Students are expected to adhere to the highest William Woods University Academic Catalog 16 standards of honesty in their behavior. The following are examples of dishonest behavior and violations of the principle of academic integrity. These are examples and do not exhaust all conduct that could constitute violations of this academic integrity policy. Students are expected to refrain from:  1. Plagiarism. You commit plagiarism by taking someone else’s ideas, works, or other types of work product and presenting them as your own. You can avoid plagiarism by using proper methods of documentation and acknowledgement.  2. Self-Plagiarism. You commit self-plagiarism by submitting the same work for more than one assignment or course without explicitly obtaining permission from all instructors. You also commit self-plagiarism by taking your own ideas, works, or other types of work products previously presented without including proper methods of documentation and acknowledgement.  3. Cheating. You must not receive or provide any unauthorized assistance during an examination. During an examination, you may use only materials authorized by the instructor. Cheating also includes attempting to gain an unfair advantage concerning academic work, including but not limited to:  a. Unauthorized use of material, equipment and technology such as a calculator, advanced calculator, cellular/mobile phone or other electronic device, tablet, lap-top or the like. b. Unauthorized removal of material from a University room or service area or defacing such material.  c. Leaving the test area/room without permission from the instructor or proctor.  4. Collaboration. Engaging in any academic work that is the product of joint effort, either inside or outside the classroom, not authorized by the instructor.  5. Fabrication. You commit fabrication when you present as fact, those things that are untrue, intentionally false or are fabricated with no supporting information or data. It is dishonest to fabricate or falsify data in laboratory experiments, research papers, reports, or other circumstances; fabricate source material in a bibliography or “Works Cited”/”References” list; or provide false information on a résumé or other document in connection with academic efforts.  6. Engaging in other forms of deceit or dishonesty. Do not request, or have others request on your behalf, any academic benefit, including an extension of time, a better grade, or a recommendation from an instructor when the request is based on false information or deception. 7. Do not engage in any other form of academic misconduct not covered here. If you are ever in doubt, ask your instructor for guidance. Owing to the diversity of programs across the University, faculty retain the latitude to make their own determinations as to the severity of any act of academic dishonesty they may encounter.  Faculty Responsibility  Faculty are required to report incidents of student academic dishonesty so that the incident may be handled in a consistent, fair manner, and so that substantiated charges of misconduct may be noted in the student’s record. Faculty procedures for filing a complaint based on a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy  William Woods University Academic Catalog 17 1. When a faculty member suspects that a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy has occurred, they should gather all relevant documentation required to substantiate the incident. Such documentation may include:  a. Original document such as the term paper, homework assignment, exam, etc. where the alleged violation of the Academic Integrity Policy occurred.  b. Copies of notes, cheat sheets, similar papers, Turnitin reports, web sources or any other available sources that substantiate incidents in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.  c. First-hand observation. If the faculty member observes an act in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, they should prepare a letter of record describing the action they observed, when they observed the action and where the action was observed.  d. Admission of a violation. If a faculty member receives an admission from a student, they should prepare a record of the conversation.  2. The faculty member, in case of an appeal or board hearing, should maintain all documentation pertaining to the incident to include a timeline of events.  3. The faculty member should inform the student that a violation of this policy has occurred, what that violation is and what action the faculty member will take.  4. The sanction for violation of the Academic Integrity Policy shall be determined by the severity of the violation. The faculty member has the discretion to determine the following sanctions:  a. For a first occurrence in violation of this policy, a faculty member may:  i. Provide a written or verbal warning to the student.  i. ii. Require the student to re-do the assignment.  ii. Provide reduced credit for the assignment.  iii. Provide a failing grade for the assignment.  iv. Other such remedy as deemed appropriate by the faculty member.  b. For a first occurrence that is considered severe or a second occurrence in violation of this policy, a faculty member will provide a failing grade for the course.  5. Regardless of the action taken by a faculty member, they are required to complete and submit an Academic Integrity Violation Form, available through Owlnet, which describes the incident and actions taken.  6. If an allegation is determined to be valid, a copy of that determination shall be retained with the student’s official academic records. If a suspension or expulsion occurs, that shall be recorded on the student’s transcript.  7. If an allegation is determined to be valid, sponsors of student organizations, coaches of athletic teams and committees who manage honors scholarships and performance awards will be notified so they can determine any internal sanction based upon their organizational guidelines.   Student / Staff Responsibility  If a student or member of the University staff observes others violating this policy, he/she is strongly encouraged to report the misconduct for further investigation. Student and staff procedures for filing a complaint based on a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy Any member of the University community may file a complaint alleging a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 18 1. Any complaint will be in writing and will provide sufficient information for a review of the alleged violation.  2. The written complaint will be submitted to the School Director, Academic Dean or their appointed designee within ten (10) calendar days of the discovery of the alleged violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.  3. If submitted directly to the Academic Dean, the Academic Dean will forward the complaint to the appropriate School Director or appointed designee for review.  4. The School Director or their appointed designee will review the allegation and if it appears credible, they will inform the accused student and the related faculty member that further investigation is warranted.  5. The School Director or their appointed designee will promptly investigate the allegations.  If the allegations are considered valid, the School Director or appointed designee will recommend that the Academic Dean refer the incident to the Student Academic Honesty Board or the Academic Honesty Board for final disposition. Academic Progress - Undergraduate Students Faculty will provide periodic feedback concerning academic progress through coursework, assignments, and examinations. Students are expected to monitor their progress in each course by noting their performance on assignments and examinations. Students are encouraged to discuss their progress in each course with their instructors and their academic advisors, particularly when deficiencies are apparent. The University has established the Care and Action for students team (CARE) as a method to intervene and help support students facing challenges in making successful academic progress. Students are responsible for informing parents or guardians about their academic progress. The official procedure to notify students of academic progress is the semester grade report. If a student fails to make adequate academic progress, the Academic Success Coordinator may assign them a CARE advisor to monitor academic progress. Adaptation of Regulations to Varying Formats University degree programs employ a variety of instructional delivery systems, formats, and schedules. These variations, commonly described as non-traditional delivery formats, are attributable to the University's commitment to maintaining programs, which effectively accommodate students whose life, and professional circumstances preclude participation in a traditional format.   When maintaining non-traditional delivery formats intended to serve non-traditional students, the University maintains a rigorous proactive commitment to ensuring that its undergraduate programs are conducted, without regard to delivery format or student circumstances, in a manner thoroughly consistent with standards commonly acknowledged within the American higher education community as appropriate or mandatory for undergraduate and graduate education.   The regulations stated herein are broadly stated, but are applicable to all students of the University without regard to the specific delivery format employed by the program in which they are enrolled. Questions, which arise regarding the applicability of specific regulations to specific delivery formats and programs, may be addressed to the Academic Dean or Director.  The Dean/Directors are charged with responsibility for interpreting regulations to enable their consistent application in all programs conducted under the auspices of the University William Woods University Academic Catalog 19 Alcohol and Drug Policies and Programs In support of the educational mission of William Woods University, alcohol and drug policies and programs have been put in place to create a safe environment that supports the academic and social success of all students. For more information, students are advised to review the information at this link: https://www.williamwoods.edu/student_life/undergraduate_student_experience/campus_safety/Alcohol%20and%20Drug%20Policies%20and%20Programs.pdf Applicability of Degree Requirements The degree and continuation requirements in effect at the time of declaration remain in effect as long as the student maintains sustained (uninterrupted) enrollment. (see policy for Student Enrollment) ; If study is interrupted for any reason, including academic suspension, the student when resuming study may be subject to any or all of the new requirements instituted since initial enrollment. The Academic Dean determines the applicability of new requirements at the time the student resumes study. Application for Graduation Students are required to apply for graduation during the fall or spring registration period before their LAST semester of coursework. This application will prompt the registrar to review the graduation worksheet for missing requirements as well as check for overall hours and GPA. From this review, if students are determined to be “short” in hours or program requirements, they have time to adjust their final course schedule during the add/drop period. Students who fail to apply for graduation cannot expect a program audit, inclusion in the commencement program, or participation in graduation ceremony.   Cohort Candidates will be reviewed the semester prior to the final semester on the cohort calendar. Students who will not be completing the program as scheduled on the cohort calendar will need to submit an application for graduation.   Students who apply for graduation and who complete all degree requirements will be contacted regarding diplomas, academic regalia, and commencement. The graduation fee is added to the student's accounts receivable statement approximately one month prior to conferral date. Diplomas and official transcripts will not be released until this fee is paid.   Diplomas will be ordered with the information confirmed by the student. Should the student wish to have a name changed after the diplomas have been ordered, it will be at the expense of the student.  Application for Readmission Any student who has withdrawn, departed without withdrawal, or have been subjected to academic dismissal may submit an application for readmission. Readmission may be permitted, but the conditions of readmission may vary appreciably depending upon the manner in which the student left the institution.   Successful applicants for readmission who were on academic probation when they withdrew will be re-admitted on probation. This will be a conditional acceptance.   Students who are readmitted will follow all academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission. William Woods University Academic Catalog 20 Assessment of Prior Learning The University recognizes that knowledge may be systematically acquired in a variety of ways that do not involve or entail a formal classroom or instructional setting. The University also acknowledges that knowledge so acquired may relate directly or specifically to curriculum and degree requirements.   The award of prior learning hours earned through the petition process may not exceed 36 credit hours for a baccalaureate, 15 credit hours for an associate degree, or 9 hours for a graduate degree.   Credit for prior learning may be acknowledged in instances in which a substantive relationship can be documented between knowledge gained experientially and the various realms of instruction represented in the curriculum of the University. Attendance Policy Traditional Seated Classroom Courses   Programs of instruction at William Woods University require regular attendance and active student participation in classes, laboratories, and applied instruction. In support of this, all classes will have an attendance policy, as described by the faculty member in the course syllabus.   Students attending University-sanctioned events are not to be counted as unexcused; however, students are expected to notify instructors in advance and make up all work within the time period specified by the instructor. For all absences, it is the student's responsibility to meet with the instructor and make up any work missed.   Online Courses   The online model of instruction requires active student participation for successful completion of the course/program. All work will be due on the original due date (unless prior arrangements have been made with the facilitator) along with any make-up assignments given by the facilitator.   Students who do not communicate with instructors via class discussions, chat rooms, or emails for one week during the course will be required to complete make-up work as assigned by the instructor. Student course grades will be reduced by one letter grade for each subsequent week they do not participate.  Auditing Auditing a class may occur only in special circumstances. Studio classes, laboratory courses, field experiences and internships, clinicals, riding classes, practicums, activity courses, and graduate level courses may not be audited. The availability of space is established on the last day on which add/drop decisions may be made by regular students of the University (typically five days from the start of instruction). Students who wish to audit a class should complete a non-degree seeking application.  Application should be made through the Office of Enrollment Services.  The tuition for auditing a class is $50 per credit hour. Any special course fees are also applicable.  Students may audit only one class per semester and may not change their auditing status after the class has started.  Students who wish to audit a class may register on a space-available basis and are subject to registration policies and deadlines for add/drop, etc. William Woods University Academic Catalog 21 Books and Instructional Materials Students are responsible for obtaining correct books and materials for each course as listed in the course syllabus before the first class meeting. Book information is available through eCampus and published simultaneous with the course schedule. Information regarding ordering books from eCampus is provided to students when commencing their programs of study. However, students are not obligated to use eCampus as a book source and may, if they choose, obtain their books from another provider.  Changes in Policies, Procedures, and Programs The policies, procedures, and programs in the current University Catalog supersede the previous policies, procedures and programs. The University retains the right to change policies, procedures, and programs, without prior notification and to promulgate such changes in its most current University Catalog.   Changes are effective as of the date of publication unless another effective date is specified at the time of publication such changes are immediately applicable to all students of the University admitted subsequent to the date of publication and immediately to all other students if the change is a clarification, elaboration, restatement, or issuance of an existing regulation or policy of the University. Clinical Experiences Students will be admitted to clinical experiences at the discretion of individual programs and schools. Schools may require students to comply with all academic and professional conduct requirements as determined by the program of study.  Clinical experiences, whether or not required for completion of a degree program, are a privilege, not a right.     Each school, which provides for a clinical experience shall have the authority to deny or terminate a student's participation in the clinical experience for failure to maintain or achieve the academic requirements, and/or failure to adhere to the required professional conduct.  Conduct The University is a community of scholars in which the ideals of freedom of inquiry and freedom of the individual are sustained. However, the exercise and preservation of these freedoms requires respect for the right of all in the community to enjoy them to the same extent. It is clear that in a community of learning, willful disruption of the educational process, destruction of property, and interference with the orderly process of the University or with the rights of other members of the University cannot be tolerated. Students enrolling in the University assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution.   Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions falls into the following categories:  Obstruction or disruption of teaching disruption to the educational, administrative, and other activities of the University, including its public service functions on or off campus.   Physical abuse or other conduct, which threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person.   Disruptive or disorderly conduct or lewd, indecent, or obscene conduct.   Failure to comply with directions of University officials acting in the performance of their duties.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 22  Harassment and abuse, directed toward individuals or groups, which may include at least the following forms: the use or threat of physical violence, coercion, intimidation, and verbal harassment and abuse.  The jurisdiction of William Woods University shall be limited to conduct that occurs on the William Woods University premises or at University-sponsored or University-supervised functions. However, nothing restrains the administration of William Woods University from taking appropriate action, including but not limited to the imposition of sanctions against students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Students are responsible not only for their conduct, but also for the conduct of any guest, they bring on campus.

If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.  Further information on policies and procedures can be found at http://www.williamwoods.edu/current_students/registrar/educational_rights.html William Woods University Academic Catalog 26  Grade Appeal Students who believe a grade has been assigned in error or who wish to have the grade reviewed must first submit their concerns in writing to the instructor within 20 days of the end of the course.  The instructor shall then have 15 days in which to reply in writing.  (If no response, the student goes to the next step).  If a mathematical recording or other technical error is discovered, the instructor may recommend an appropriate grade change to the Registrar.  This should be completed within 30 days after the end of the semester.  If the grade is still in dispute, the second step is for the student to discuss the grade with the appropriate school director or program manager (or go directly to step 3 if the chair or manager is the instructor).  This discussion must take place within 7 days of the response from the instructor.  If, after meeting with the school director or program manager, the student still disputes his/her grade, step three is for a written appeal to be submitted to the Academic Dean.  The appeal be submitted within 7 days of the discussion with the school director or program manager and must allege:  1. That a computational, recording, or other technical error has been made but not acknowledged by the instructor or  2. That the grade has been assigned in an arbitrary, capricious, or vindictive manner or in a manner intended to inappropriately manipulate or control the student.   No other grounds for appeal exist.  The appeal should include copies of all correspondence between the student and the instructor regarding the grade plus any other supporting documents.  A copy of the appeal will be submitted to the instructor.  If the Academic Dean determines that sufficient evidence exists for a review, a subcommittee of the Academic Council will undertake a review within 20 days.  The findings of the Academic Council subcommittee are shaped as recommendations to the instructor and are shared with the Dean.  The Academic Dean has the final decision on a grade appeal.   Grade Changes Once grades have been submitted to the University Registrar, they may be changed for one of three reasons:  1. to change an incomplete to a letter grade,  2. to correct a mathematical or clerical error, or  3. to accommodate a change resulting from an appeal. Graduation/Commencement    Undergraduate Programs   Students are required to apply for graduation during registration period before their last semester of coursework. This Petition for Graduation will prompt the Office of the Registrar to check total hours and minimum grade point average. It will also initiate the completion of the graduation checklist by the student's academic advisor. From this review, if a student is determined to be short any requirements, there will be time to make a schedule adjustment during the add/drop period of the student's final William Woods University Academic Catalog 27 semester. Students who fail to apply  for graduation cannot expect a program audit, inclusion in the commencement program, or participation in the graduation ceremony.   Students who apply for graduation and who complete all degree requirements will be contacted in matters relating to diplomas, academic regalia, and commencement. The graduation fee is billed at the time of their final registration.   Diplomas will be ordered with the information confirmed by the student. Should the student wish to have a name change after diplomas have been ordered, it will be at the expense of the student.   Policy for “walking short”   Students may petition to “walk short” if they are within six hours of their requirements and they register to complete the missing requirement at WWU before the end of August. (IE: A student who walks short in Spring must complete requirements prior to the August conferral date, or their conferral date will be pushed back.) They must petition the Academic Dean via a student form in OwlNet and provide their plans for completing the missing hours. If approved, they may participate in the ceremony.   If a student needs confirmation of degree completion before official conferral for any reason, the University will provide a letter stating that the student has completed all requirements for the degree. Upon request, the Office of the Registrar will provide letters of completion indicating that students have completed all graduation requirements, but their degree will not be conferred until the next graduation date. Degrees are conferred in Spring, Summer and Fall only.   Graduate Programs   All recipients of degrees awarded by the University are encouraged to participate in Commencement.   Graduate students who will have their degrees conferred in Summer may participate in the Spring commencement ceremony previous to degree conferral and complete the graduation materials online before March 1st to ensure participation.   Graduate students who will have their degrees conferred in Fall may participate in the Spring commencement ceremony following the Fall degree conferral. Fall graduates must complete the graduation materials online as notification of intent to participate in the Spring ceremony prior to March 1st.   Ed.D Candidates   Candidates may participate in the commencement ceremony immediately following the date of the successful defense of their dissertation. Candidates must complete the graduation materials online prior to March 1st. Grievance Policy Students have the right to request a review of academic and non-academic policies, programs, or incidents that are of a grievous nature and do not pertain to any other specific University policy. Issues involving sexual harassment and grades are dealt with through separate policies.   A grievance report (see criteria below) should be submitted to the Academic Dean if it is within one week of the reported incident. An initial effort will be made, within one week, to resolve the issue William Woods University Academic Catalog 28 through dialogue and mutual consent. If this process does not provide for satisfactory resolution, a grievance committee will be formed and the matter will be forwarded to it.   Within one week of receipt, the grievance committee will review the issues outlined and will determine whether there is sufficient cause to warrant a committee hearing.

Fax: 312.263.7462 info@hlccommission.org Incomplete Grade The Incomplete grade may be issued only in special circumstances, defined as circumstances beyond the student’s control, which, toward the end of the course, prevent the student from finishing a small portion of the work required to complete the course within the established course schedule. The Incomplete is never granted for purposes of convenience or to enable the submission of long overdue work.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 29   The Incomplete grade carries no quality points and does not figure into the grade point average.    The obligation to remove an incomplete grade rests exclusively with the student. The student must complete all work within four (4) weeks of the last class session in which the Incomplete was recorded. An Incomplete grade that is not removed by the deadline will be converted to the grade indicated on the Incomplete Coursework Form turned in by the instructor to the Office of the Registrar.   In extraordinary circumstances, those in which it can be unequivocally demonstrated physical or mental incapacity prevent the student from removing the Incomplete within the four-week period, the Academic Dean may extend the period in which the obligation might be satisfied for another three weeks or subsequent to determining that incapacity will prevent the student from satisfying the obligation within such a period, the Academic Dean may authorize a Withdrawal from the course. The determination to extend or to authorize Withdrawal must be made only if formally requested by the student or an authorized representative of the student. The obligation to seek such actions rests exclusively with the student. Instructional Support The University offers tutorial support in writing skills, mathematics, and other academic areas.

The University is authorized under Federal Law to enroll non-immigrant alien students. International students must meet the same requirements and follow the same admissions procedures employed for U.S. nationals, except that they must, unless English is their first language, demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the English language to benefit from their program of study. This policy is more fully articulated at the link: http://www.williamwoods.edu/current_students/registrar/international_students/english_proficiency.html  Foreign students applying to study in graduate programs at William Woods University may be admitted as independent international students or under the specific auspices of a formal agreement.    Finances   International students must submit a certified letter of support from their bank, a sponsor, their family, or another source showing that they have adequate financial resources to provide for their education and living expenses.   Since application materials come from several sources, the entire application cannot be submitted at once. Thus, prospective students are encouraged to coordinate the submission of materials so that #1 above (a completed William Woods University Admission Application Form) arrives at the University first.   William Woods University will acknowledge receipt of the admission application form by email which will provide a quick link to a list of graduate programs and their admission requirements. An admission counselor will be in contact with the applicant to answer any questions and assist in the admission process. The application and other materials may be mailed to The Office of Admissions William Woods University One University Avenue Fulton, "
WWU 102," in place of "
EDU 790,"/791  Students enrolled in  and/or "
EDU 791," must remain continuously enrolled and current on tuition payments until either their degree is conferred of the five-year time limit has passed. Any student who is dropped for non-payment will need to retake any coursework and/or Comprehensive Exams deemed necessary by the School of Education in order to continue their program. The continuing student will then be assigned a dissertation supervisor who may or may not be the one with whom the student was working previously.   Student Outcomes Assessment The University is committed to helping students achieve academic success and to improving academic programs and instruction. The University annually assesses each major program and regularly assesses all general education areas. Entering and exiting students are also assessed.  The feedback from this assessment program helps faculty to actively manage the curriculum and the instructional process.    Most of the academic majors include a capstone course which focuses on the integration and application of prior general education and major program learning. Time Limitations on Degree Completion University undergraduate programs emphasize preparing skilled, systematic, and informed practitioners who can employ contemporary methods, techniques, and technologies and systematically assess emerging methods, techniques, and technologies. Undergraduate students are expected to complete William Woods University Academic Catalog 35 their degree programs within five years of the onset of study. Students continuing beyond five years may be required to repeat previously completed course work or to complete coursework not required at the time of their initial admission. Students are cautioned that, ordinarily, the applicability of undergraduate coursework to graduate degrees awarded by the University expires five years after completion.   Waivers of the time limitations for degree completion may be made by the Academic Dean.   Doctoral students must complete all degree requirements five years from the date of successful passage of the comprehensive exam.    Waivers of the Five-Year Rule may be made by the Academic Dean upon the recommendation of the appropriate school director. Any request must be made PRIOR to the end of the five years. Waivers relate only to the currency and applicability of work completed. Transcripts/Requesting a transcript A transcript is a comprehensive record of the student's academic history including but not limited to courses, final grades and cumulative grade point average. Official paper transcripts bear the University seal and are sent directly from Office of Records to the receiving institution or agency. Transcripts sent electronically through the secure electronic delivery are considered official records. The words “Issued to Students” will appear on transcripts sent directly to the student.   Transcript requests are submitted electronically through Transcripts on Demand by SCRIP-SAFE. Telephone and email requests are not accepted.

Transfer Credit Undergraduate Programs   William Woods students who wish to take a course at another college or university must obtain approval from the registrar to assure that the course is eligible for transfer and fits within their academic program.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 36  The delivery system or format is not considered by the University in the evaluation of coursework from other institutions for possible transfer credit.   Credits are accepted at full semester value provided that the transferring institution is accredited by an agency recognized by the USDE (U.S. Department of Education) and CHEA (Council for Higher Education Accreditation). Courses that are comparable to William Woods University offerings are accepted in transfer. Courses accepted in transfer must have a final grade earned of "D" or above.   The maximum credit hours accepted by the university by transfer, examination, and/or portfolio may not exceed 90 credits, no more than 70 of which may be  taken at a junior/community college.    Courses completed at a junior/community college are unlikely to transfer as upper level (300/400) coursework.   To earn a degree from William Woods University, a student must earn a minimum of 30 credit hours at William Woods University. Transfer credit is not accepted as part of a student's last 30 hours.   Students transferring credits are not required to repeat courses unless specifically stated in WWU course prerequisites or major requirements. (ie, repeat of a course in which a D was earned in an education program requirement).   An official transcript must be sent to the registrar's office at William Woods University before any transfer course can be accepted into the student's program of study. Official transcripts certifying coursework must be received in the registrar's office prior to the student's final semester (15 credits). The Registrar is the official person to grant transfer credit any questions should be addressed to the Registrar.   You may check our Transfer Equivalency page to see how your credits might transfer. (Please contact us if you cannot find the school/course for which you are seeking an equivalency.)   Graduate Transfer Credit   Ordinarily no more than nine hours completed elsewhere will be accepted as applicable to graduate degrees granted by the University. Additionally, only graduate work with grades of A or B may be accepted as applicable toward University graduate degrees.   Only graduate work completed at another institution before initial admission to graduate study may be considered for transfer, except in instances in which admitted current graduate students secure prior approval from their program director before taking a graduate course at another institution. Credits received for the completion of graduate work not previously approved by the program director will not be considered for acceptance.   Only graduate work completed at graduate level institutions accredited by an agency recognized by the USDE (U.S. Department of Education) and CHEA (Council for Higher Education Accreditation), may be accepted as applicable to University graduate programs.   The program director, with the assistance of the university registrar or assistant registrar, determines the acceptability of credit granted by other graduate level institutions.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 37  Ordinarily graduate work completed at other institutions must have been completed within three calendar years of anticipated initial enrollment to be considered for applicability to University graduate degrees.   Transfer credit is not granted for the capstone course in any graduate degree program.  William Woods University is a participant of the Missouri Reverse Transfer  If you transferred from or will transfer from a 2-year Missouri institution, please read more about the  Missouri Reverse Transfer program.  Tutorial Course The tutorial course is designed to offer degree-seeking juniors, senior, and graduate students the opportunity to take a course listed in the current William Woods University catalog, but out of the regularly scheduled sequence. A tutorial course will be considered for approval after all other options, such as course substitution, have been considered. A tutorial is not designed to allow a student to forego a regularly scheduled class, and may not be used to meet William Woods University's general education requirements, but is available as a last resort.  Courses approved for a tutorial must meet one of these criteria   The course is not offered on a regular rotation   The course will not be taught in the following semester  The course is needed by a student in their final semester with conflicting courses.   The following policies apply:   A student who has previously dropped a course may not petition to take that same course as a tutorial.   Students must register for tutorial courses during regular registrations and must be processed on official forms available under student forms in OwlNet and must be approved by the Academic Dean.   Schools and departments are not obliged to provide tutorials upon a student's request.   A student is allowed to take no more than 6 credit hours of tutorial coursework.   Tutorial courses are subject to the usual tuition charges and to an additional fee per credit hour.   Tutorials are not available to students who are participating in degree completion programs  Undergraduate Admission to graduate programs Undergraduates may not enroll for graduate credit. Undergraduates may apply for certain programs allowing several graduate courses taken during the junior or senior year for undergraduate credit. Upon completion of the baccalaureate degree and enrollment in the William Woods University graduate program, these courses are eligible for graduate credit. Undergraduate Admission to graduate programs Undergraduates may not enroll for graduate credit. Undergraduates may apply for certain programs allowing several graduate courses taken during the junior or senior year for undergraduate credit. Upon completion of the baccalaureate degree and enrollment in the William Woods University graduate program, these courses are eligible for graduate credit. William Woods University Academic Catalog 38 Withdrawal From A Course Students who wish to withdraw from a course must submit the official schedule change form available on OwlNet under student forms.   A grade of "W" will be entered. W grades do not count in the student's semester or cumulative GPA. The withdrawal is not official until the paperwork is processed through the Office of the Registrar. A student who simply stops going to class or who fails to submit the request according to the deadline will receive a letter grade based upon the entire semester/ term's work.   The scheduled deadline to withdraw from a 16 week semester long course is approximately 10 weeks into the course. Comparably, students in eight week courses will have through the end of the 5th calendar week of the course to withdraw with a W grade. Students who are enrolled in the course on or after the term start date will be charged full or a prorated tuition, if the request to withdraw is submitted after the first business week of the term (4:30pm Friday).  Students who are enrolled in a three week summer course on or after the term start date will be charged full tuition, if the request to withdraw is submitted after the second day of the term (4:30pm Friday).  Failure to attend/participate does not exempt tuition/fee charges.  Withdrawal From William Woods University Students who wish to withdraw from William Woods University must complete the formal withdrawal process by completing the form online via Owlnet. Students may withdraw from the University during the first 11 weeks of the semester exact dates are shown in the online academic calendar. A grade of W will be entered for all current courses. W grades do not count into the student’s semester or cumulative GPA.   Students who have withdrawn from the University must apply for readmission to resume study. If program or degree requirements have been changed since the student’s initial enrollment, the student may be required to satisfy the current requirements upon readmission.   Students who are forced to withdraw due to medical reasons, may, with proper documentation and a letter of readmission, register with their class of current students upon returning to WWU within one year of withdrawal. They may also continue under the catalog requirements under which they began their studies at the University.   Departure without Withdrawal  Final grades are issued in each course for each enrolled student who has not withdrawn from the course. Students who terminate attendance without formally withdrawing from a course are assigned a grade of F. The consequence of a failing grade issued as a consequence of Departure Without Withdrawal is Academic Dismissal. Students who depart from a program without formally withdrawing effectively terminate their affiliation with the University. Such students  may subsequently reapply for admission.  The nature of their departure may be considered as a factor in the readmission decision. If program or degree requirements have been changed since the student's initial enrollment, the student will be required to satisfy all new requirements upon readmission.   Non-Registered Student Departure: Students not registered for classes by the end of first week of classes will automatically be withdrawn from the University.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 39  Registered Non-Attendance Student Departure: Students who have not attended any of their registered class during the first two weeks of the semester will automatically be withdrawn from their courses and the University as a non-returning student.   Registered Attending Student Departure: Students who have attended some of their registered classes will be considered an attending student for the semester. These students who terminate attendance without formally withdrawing from a course or courses by the deadline are assigned the grade that they earned, which will be calculated into their GPA.   Non-returning Part-time Students: Part-time students and MMACU students will automatically be withdrawn after one semester of non- attendance.   Medical Withdrawal   William Woods University cares about the physical and mental health of its students. The University recognizes that at times a student may experience such extreme physical or psychological conditions that the ability to function successfully or safely in the role of a student is significantly impaired. Students are encouraged to prioritize their health and safety and take steps toward recovery, even if academic progress must be delayed.   Students are encouraged to request a medical withdrawal when they believe their physical or mental health is preventing them from successfully engaging in and completing coursework when safety is in question or when the demands of university life are interfering with the ability to recover or adjust to a significant physical or mental health challenge. This can occur anytime throughout the semester however, it may be more difficult to gain approval for medical withdrawal during the final three weeks of the session or semester.   Students interested in considering or pursuing a medical withdrawal are encouraged to discuss this option with the Dean of Student Life (venita.mitchell@williamwoods.edu). In most cases, students will need to provide documentation from their licensed provider that indicates that due to a specific mental or physical health condition(s), the student is impaired such that they are unable to function successfully or safely in the role of a student.   In the interest of gaining a better understanding of the student’s need for a medical withdrawal, the University may require appropriate documentation and/or request for the student to sign appropriate release forms allowing designated WWU staff to consult with the evaluating and/or treating clinician(s) supporting the student.   Once appropriate documentation has been provided and decisions have been made regarding a student’s status, the Dean of Student Life will notify the registrar’s office of the need for a medical withdrawal and/or ability to successfully return. The student will then complete the on-line withdrawal form found on Owlnet. For all approved medical withdrawals, the student receives a W (withdrawal) on their academic transcript, or is completely dropped from classes, without any notation on the transcript of having left for medical reasons. Thus, a medical withdrawal will not affect the student’s grade point average.   Refunds for medical withdrawals shall follow the University withdrawal calculation process found in the on the website which may result in no refund.   William Woods University Academic Catalog 40  Medical Readmit Process   In addition to completing the University readmit process, the majority of students granted a medical withdrawal must also complete the following procedures before being allowed to return to the University. These steps are designed to ensure that a health emergency no longer exists and a treatment plan for continuing good health and safety is in place:   ·      The student must be assessed by an appropriate outside professional whose opinions will be advisory to the University. The professional, who is selected by the student, must be a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist if evaluating mental health concerns, and must be a licensed physician if the evaluation is regarding other medical concerns. Further, all providers must be unrelated to the student and must have specialty/credentials appropriate for the condition of concern.   ·       Documentation of the assessment (conducted within 15-30 days of re-entry) and documentation of required treatment completion must be provided to the Dean of Student Life two weeks prior to the beginning of classes for the applicable session or semester.   ·      To make an accurate assessment, before conducting the evaluation it may be necessary that the provider be given information relating to the precipitating events that led to the leave. This typically would involve the student signing a release allowing the University to share information regarding relevant incidents or concerns and, if applicable, recent hospital records. The outside mental health or medical professional, with the student’s written permission, must provide an assessment of current functioning of the student and provide written recommendations regarding:   the student’s readiness to return to the demands of university life   the student’s readiness to live in on-campus residential housing, if applicable   ongoing treatment or testing needs, if any and   any conditions or restrictions that the University should impose.   ·       After the evaluation results and treatment documentation have been provided, the Dean of Student Life, or designee, will communicate with the student to discuss the documentation and the student’s perception regarding readiness to return and any on-going needs. Additionally, consideration will be given to how the recommendations fit with the demands of university life.   ·      If a student was required to complete specific treatment, the student must provide documentation regarding the completion of this requirement.   ·      The University reserves the right to require the student to comply with a treatment plan recommended by the outside professional and/or the University health care/mental health professional as a condition of returning. Review and monitoring of the student’s required treatment plan may be assigned to a University designee assigned by the Dean of Student Life.   ·      If a student was living on campus prior to the withdrawal, approval for return to the University usually includes approval to return to housing.      William Woods University Academic Catalog 41 Undergraduate Policies Undergraduate Admission Process Traditional Programs:   Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible after they have completed their junior year of high school. Students will be notified of an admissions decision shortly after all application materials are received.   Students requesting to transfer to William Woods University may do so if the student is in good academic standing at another accredited college or university. An official transcript from every institution attended is required. Applicants are asked to submit official high school transcripts with ACT or SAT results for class placement only.   Students must apply on line.   To be considered for admission to study at William Woods, students must submit the documents listed below:   ·A completed admissions application form, and   ·Official high school transcript(s)   ·SAT or ACT scores   ·Transfer students should send college transcripts from each institution attended, as well as official high school transcripts.          Please note: letters of recommendation and interviews are not required for admission.  Online Degree Programs:   To be considered for admission to Regular or Special Standing, a prospective student must submit a complete application for admission. A complete application for admission consists of the following:   ·         A completed Admissions Application form, and   ·         Official transcripts from all high schools (and GED, if applicable) and undergraduate institutions the student attended.   Levels of Admission   Students admitted to undergraduate study at William Woods University are admitted in one of four classifications.    Regular: A student who has satisfied all requirements and prerequisites for admission to the College degree completion program.   Provisional: Student who has not satisfied all requirements and  prerequisites for admission to the College degree completion program but who the enrollment comittee feels has the potential to be sucessful.  Provisional admits are given two semsters of attendance to attain good academis standing.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 42  Conditional:  Student who has not satisfied all requirements and  prerequisites for admission to the College degree completion program but who the enrollment committee feels has the potential to be successful.  Conditional admits are given on semester of attendance to attain good academic standing.   Special: A student who holds a baccalaureate or graduate degree from a regionally accredited institution and who intends to enroll for a specific course or courses or, a student otherwise qualified for admission who intends to enroll for a course with no intention of completing a degree or, a student intending to qualify for Regular standing who has yet to complete the application process but who documents prior baccalaureate work and qualifying grade point average from a regionally accredited institution.  International applicants seeking admission to William Woods should review the policy below: www.williamwoods.edu/admissions/international [CB1] Admitted regular, provisional or conditional.  Not sure where the special came from.  It can stay but need reg, provisional and conditional. Academic Warning/Probation/Suspension - Undergraduate Students Warning   Any student who fails to earn at least a 2.00 grade point average for the semester will receive notice of academic warning. Academic warning is an official notice that the work for that semester was below the 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA required for graduation.   Probation   A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.00 will be placed on academic probation.   Suspension   If probationary status continues for more than one semester or if the GPA for a semester falls significantly below the corresponding GPA of 2.00, the student will be subject to academic suspension.   Suspensions, unlike Academic Dismissals, carry enabling provisions which, at the student’s initiative, allow the suspension to be formally reconsidered and imply the possibility of the resumption of study. A suspended student may not apply for readmission to the University for at least one academic year.   Should the GPA of a suspended student who has been authorized to resume study fall below 2.00, this will result in Academic Dismissal rather than Academic Suspension. Declaration of Major/Minor for Undergraduate Students Students indicate an intended major/minor at the time of their initial enrollment. The declaration must be complete with the office of the Registrart.  That major MAY be undecided but must be declared. Thereafter, a change of major/minor is processed through the Office of the Registrar. Students must declare a major (other than undecided) prior to their registration as a junior.   Double Major/Minor Policy  William Woods University Academic Catalog 43  Any student interested in pursuing a second major simultaneously should declare a primary major and a secondary major with the Registrar's office. If the two majors are under different degrees the student will have to declare the degree of the primary major.  Degree Candidacy Undergraduate Students Students whose progress has brought them within 15 credit hours of degree program completion are formally accorded status as Degree Candidates. The designation is useful in describing student status to employers, prospective employers, certification and licensing agencies, and prospective graduate and professional programs . The status indicates simply that the award of the degree is imminent.   Candidacy status also indicates that the Office of the Registrar is conducting the appropriate final reviews to enable a formal recommendation to the Academic Dean that the appropriate degree be recommended to the President and Trustees of the University for issuance at a specific time and place.   Admission to candidacy does not imply the degree will be awarded. It implies only that the student has the capacity and capability to successfully and satisfactorily complete the final 15 hours of instruction and is expected to do so.   Students terminating enrollment within 15 hours of degree completion cease, at the time of termination, to be Degree Candidates. Developmental Courses Courses with a course number below 100 are developmental courses designed to prepare students for college-level course work. Students are placed in these classes based upon their English and math sub-scores on the ACT or the verbal and math sub-scores on the SAT.  The Academic Dean may designate an alternative instrument to be used for placement if the student's ACT or SAT scores are more than the five years old. Students placed in these courses are required to take them. Successful completion of these courses is a strong indicator that students are prepared for college coursework: therefore, dropping these courses is not an option.   Developmental courses carry an institutional credit value and will count towards the student’s full time status. Developmental course grades are included in calculation of the grade point average. Hours do not count as degree credit towards the minimum hour requirement for the Associate or Bachelor’s degrees. Documentation of Undergraduate Work at Other Institutions Official transcripts of student work by each institution granting credit are the only documentation accepted by the University. Transcripts issued by one institution which include or note coursework completed at another institution and applicable to its programs are relevant only for the coursework completed at the issuing institution. As part of the application process for a degree or certificate program, students must submit official transcripts from all institutions attended. Faxed transcripts and transcripts issued directly to students are not accepted. Dual Enrollment Through dual enrollment, select high school juniors and seniors have the opportunity to complete college-level courses on the William Woods campus. Admission into this program is restricted to high school junior and senior level students with a 19 composite ACT score or a 3.00 minimum high school GPA, as well as a counselor recommendation. Enrollment is limited on a space available basis, and William Woods University Academic Catalog 44 excludes courses for which necessary prerequisites have not been met. Those interested in dual enrollment should make arrangements with the appropriate secondary school officials and, in consultation with them, identify a course for study. Tuition for the dual enrollment program is $75 per credit hour.  If the Dual Enrollment course is on line there will be an on line fee of $125 PER COURSE in addition to the credit hour charge. Finals Schedule/Alternative Schedule During the final week of the semester, classes meet according to the alternative schedule that is available on the Office of the Registrar’s webpage. Print copies are also available in the Office of the Registrar. The alternative schedule provides a format for comprehensive assessment of learning and for other instructional activities. The week of the alternative schedule is a required portion of the instructional time that comprises the full semester.  Faculty and students are required to meet during this scheduled period.  General Requirements for Undergraduate Degree In order to receive a bachelor’s degree, students must complete at least 122 credit hours, at least 42 of which must be at the three hundred level or above. In addition, all general education requirements must be met. A year of the same  foreign language and a minor are required for students earning a Bachelor of Arts.   The final authority in determining the fulfillment of undergraduate requirements for Associate of Arts and Bachelor degrees offered by the University is the Office of the Registrar.   Baccalaureate degrees at William Woods University require an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.00 on at least 122 semester hours of credit, a minimum of 42 upper division (junior/senior) semester hours, and completion of all requirements of the major and minor, if applicable.   Coursework transferred from a two year/junior college will not be transferred as upper level.  Grading Standard for Under Graduate Programs Undergraduate schools may choose either a standard grade scale or an expanded grade scale. No other scales may be used. The scale must be adopted or not adopted by school and must be clearly state in the course syllabus.

Requests for independent studies must be processed on the appropriate student form in OwlNet and must be approved by the Academic Dean. Internships in Undergraduate Programs Internships provide the opportunity to relate work activity to educational objectives. Internships of varying design and length are available to students from many academic majors. Such internships provide a practical learning experience as a supplement to classroom instruction.  The internship is also a way to test a career choice or to get a foot in the door for a potential job offer.    Students interested in completing an internship must meet the criteria required by their major program and have approval of the faculty member supervising the internship, and the school director. Students interested in registering for internships need to plan early in order to secure an appropriate work situation and gain approval.  Mid-Missouri Associated Colleges and Universities (MMACU) Exchange Enrollment in Undergraduate Program An agreement among five member institutions of the Mid-Missouri Associated Colleges and Universities (MMACU) permits students from William Woods University to enroll in courses offered at the University of Missouri-Columbia, Stephens College, Lincoln University, and Westminster College.     The enrollment exchange allows students to take advantage of specialized offerings at MMACU institutions. To qualify for the exchange, a student must be enrolled full time.  Students are restricted to regular courses. Special workshops, online courses, and correspondence courses are not included in the exchange.    Requests for MMACU exchange enrollment must be signed by the faculty advisor and approved by the Office of the Registrar. Credit and the grades are tabulated in the student's cumulative grade average.  Registration guidelines, policies, and restrictions are available from the Office of the Registrar.    Borrowing privileges at MMACU member libraries are also available to WWU students. Students must obtain a letter of introduction from the Dulany Library circulation desk before visiting an MMACU Library. Pre-Law Coursework as Part of Undergraduate Programs Students interested in a law career should plan their undergraduate curriculum to receive a broad liberal education. According to law school reports, there is no single major that is the ideal preparation for law school. Students are advised to select courses which sharpen their analytical and critical thinking abilities. Law schools prefer students who can think, read and write well, and have some understanding of what shapes human experience. The University offers a Political/Legal Studies major that provides a strong interdisciplinary liberal arts-based, law-related curriculum. This major is appropriate as preparation for law school or other advanced legal study. However, other academic majors are also appropriate as preparation for a law career. A faculty member is designated as pre-law advisor, providing counsel about coursework and about entry into law school. Quality Points and GPA in Undergraduate Programs The academic grade point average (GPA) is determines by multiplying the quality points assigned to each letter grade (see grade scales) by the credit hours for each course.  The resulting total quality points William Woods University Academic Catalog 47 divided by the credit hours attempted produces the GPA.  The grades of F carries no quality points but the hours attempted are calculated into the student’s GPA. Grades of I, CR, W, WP, and WF do not carry quality points and are not counted as hours attempted when calculating GPA.    Transfer Credit is not included in GPA calculation.   The university requires a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above for program continuation and to be awarded a degree.   For Semester Undergraduate students (those on campus) GPA will be calculated at the end of Spring and Fall semesters for purposes of determining Academic Warning, Probation and Suspension.   For Accelerated Undergraduate students (those in an on line program) GPA will be calculated at the end of Spring, Summer, and Fall semesters for purposes of determining Academic Warning, Probation and Suspension.

However, the requirements for total credit hours, and grade point average or 2.0 or better may not be waived.      William Woods University Academic Catalog 51 Graduate Policies Academic Warning/Probation/Suspension - Graduate Students   Warning:   Any student who earns a grade of C in any course will receive notice of academic warning.    Probation:   A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.00 will be placed on academic probation.   Suspension:   Students whose performance fails to meet program or University academic standards may be suspended.  A suspended student may not apply for readmission to the University for at least one academic year.   Should the student receive a second suspension, the student will be dismissed .  Change in Graduate Degree Program Students admitted to one graduate degree program of the University may not change to another graduate degree program of the University without first applying for admission to that program and satisfying all admission requirements for that program. Concurrent Enrollment in Other Graduate Programs The University cannot effectively limit or prevent the concurrent enrollment of its graduate students at other graduate-level institutions. Graduate credit granted by other institutions under such circumstances may not be applied to University graduate program requirements unless prior approval for enrollment is received from the Registrar. Credits received for the completion of graduate work not previously approved by the Registrar will not be considered for acceptance. Graduate work completed at other institutions during periods of academic suspension will not be considered for acceptance.   If credits awarded during concurrent enrollment are to be employed by the student to satisfy prerequisites for University graduate programs, prior approval to ensure satisfaction of prerequisites requirements must be obtained from the University Registrar . Degree Candidacy Graduate Students The Master Degree   William Woods University confers the Master of Business Administration (MBA), the Master of Education (MED) in Athletic Administration, Elementary or Secondary Administration, Curriculum and Instruction, Equestrian Education, and Teaching and Technology.   The MBA and MED degrees are designed for students who have successfully completed an academic program at the baccalaureate level and who desire to continue study at a higher level. The degree generally requires a higher level of responsibility and independence from the student.  This is reflected in course projects, research in the field, working with teams, individual projects, and the successful completion of capstone presentations and field experiences. The degree requires a high level of understanding of the theoretical foundation of the discipline, a specificity of focus on a specific area of William Woods University Academic Catalog 52 knowledge, as well as the ability to apply theory to practice.  The degree also demands a high level of critical thinking and evaluation skills.   The Education Specialist Degree   William Woods University offers the Education Specialist degree (Ed.S.). The Ed.S. is a master plus thirty hour program that builds upon the skills developed in the MED degree. The degree is designed for advanced leadership training for those who desire to become leaders for change in the classroom or in the administration of a school district. In general, this degree has all of the expectations of the Master Degree with more emphasis on critical problem solving in a K-12 setting.  In addition, the degree requires a deeper understanding of the legal and ethical issues facing K-12 education. This program meets state and national standards.  The Doctorate of Educational Leadership   At William Woods University, the degree Doctor of Educational Leadership is awarded to students who have successfully completed all requirements for the degree. In general, the doctorate level of study requires the student to research the latest theories in educational leadership, determine how those theories apply to current leadership issues, and contribute to the field of educational leadership. The doctorate requires independent research, application, and design. The dissertation process requires independent motivation, the ability to evaluate the literature related to the area of research, and complete a dissertation that is successfully defended before a committee of graduate faculty.  Upon successful passage of the comprehensive exam for the Ed.D., the student is considered a candidate for the degree and is entitled to use the ABD designation (All But Dissertation). Doctoral Student Continuous Enrollment Doctoral students are required to maintain continuous enrollment at William Woods University.  Students must be registered from the time they begin the program until they successfully defend their dissertation. If a student withdraws from the University or fails to enroll each semester, they will be charged a EdD Continuous Enrollment fee upon their return. This includes students who are dropped for non payment.  This fee will equal the cost of one credit hour, with fees, for every semester they have not been enrolled. It should be noted that students are still required to complete their dissertation within five years of successfully completing the Comprehensive Exam.    Only after the EdD continuous entrollment fee is paid will the student be reassigned a dissertation supervisor who may or may not be the one with whom the student was working previously. General Requirement for Graduate Degree The final authority in determining fulfillment of graduation requirements for graduate degrees offered by the University is the Office of the Registrar. Grading Standard for Graduate Programs Graduate students are expected to perform at a consistently high level, to demonstrate substantial mastery of required tasks, and to exhibit the capacity for flexibility and adaptiveness in applying concepts and skills to the definition and solution of new, non-routine, and highly complex programs. Demonstration of these attributes in graduate course work is acknowledged through the award of a grade of B or higher.  William Woods University Academic Catalog 53   Grade Point Averages are used in determining suitability for continued study or for degree conferred. The Graduate College requires a graduate grade point average of 3.00 for program continuation and for degree conferral. The Graduate  College awards the following grades: A, B, C, and F   A grade of C in any graduate course results in a letter warning the student that no more than three credit hours of C work may be applied toward degree credit hour requirements and that a cumulative 3.0 GPA is required for degree conferral .    A second grade of C requires that the course be repeated as a condition of continuance, and the student is placed on Academic Probation until the second C is retaken with a B or higher grade.  If the student does not receive a B or higher grade or the student received a subsequent C or lower grade, the student will be suspended for one calendar year and must complete and Application of Readmission. Graduate Admission    U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents wishing to be considered for admission to Regular or Provisional Standing must submit a completed application online for admission to a specific graduate program.

A prospective student must submit a completed Graduate Admission Application ;Form and an official transcript showing the William Woods University Academic Catalog 54 appropriate degree to be eligible for course(s) desired. Graduate Special students should work with the Graduate Advisor to schedule/register for desired course(s). Inclement Weather Policy for Graduate Programs Every reasonable effort should be made to have class when it is safe to do so. With sites located throughout the state, it is impossible to develop a weather policy that will work in all areas at all times. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the faculty facilitator and class representative to determine if weather conditions are widespread and severe enough to warrant cancellation.    Classes that are cancelled due to inclement weather will be required to be rescheduled.    If weather conditions warrant cancellation of a class at a specific site, the established communication chain for the relevant group(s) will be activated. Second Graduate Degree William Woods University does, under specified circumstances and conditions, admit students to study for a second Master or Specialist degree. A second Master or Specialist degree, in addition to other requirements, requires the possession of a completed Master/Specialist degree prior to admission and no less than 21 credit hours of academic work subsequent to the award of the first degree.    The University does not permit, under any circumstances or conditions, simultaneous study for two graduate degrees. Students who pursue two MED/EDS majors simultaneously would be considered a double major under pursuit of one degree. A double major does not constitute a double degree or a second degree.   William Woods University Academic Catalog 55 Undergraduate Degree Programs B.S.N.

Practicum experiences are provided in educational, medical, vocational and other settings. The program also provides for interaction with students at the Missouri School for the Deaf, the local deaf community, and deaf instructors and tutors in a state-of-the-art interpreting lab.  Students must earn a grade of ‘C’ or better to continue on in their sequence of majors courses. If a student does not receive a grade of ‘C’ or better, they will be invited to repeat the course. The curriculum is designed for classes to layer information and skill, thus lack of skill development in a prerequisite course will not lead to success in future work. For example: If a student receives a ‘C’ in Interpreting II they may go on to Interpreting III. If a student receives a ‘D’ in Interpreting II, they will be invited to repeat the course until they earn a grade of ‘C’ or better.

A committee made up of the director of the School of Social Sciences and one faculty member from each of the discipline areas in which the student has chosen to study will guide the student through developing the Interdisciplinary Studies major. This committee will also oversee the student’s progression through the degree program. The chair of the student’s Interdisciplinary Advisory Committee will also serve as the student’s academic advisor. An William Woods University Academic Catalog 137 Interdisciplinary Studies major under the Bachelor of Arts degree consists of coursework from two discipline areas along with a minor in another area and foreign language course requirements. PROCESS FOR DESIGNING AN INTERDISCIPLINARY MAJOR  Students interested in designing an Interdisciplinary major must:   1. Contact the director of the School of Social Sciences, and then--with the director’s help--decide on the combination of programs involved and on pursuit of a BA or BS degree.    2. Collaborate with his / her faculty advisor to solicit a faculty member from each discipline area to serve on the Interdisciplinary Advisory Committee.    3. Design a degree program that includes the following components:   a. Bachelor of Arts Degree:  i. Between 30-36 hours of coursework in two different areas  ii. A minor from the list of current offered minors  iii. Foreign language courses (if not already fulfilled  iv. An independent study capstone course that requires a thesis or project for the purpose of synthesizing the program    or    b. Bachelor of Science Degree:  i. Between 60-70 hours of coursework in 2-3 different discipline areas with a minimum of 20 hours in each area.  ii. An independent study capstone course that requires a thesis or project for the purpose of synthesizing the program.    4. Develop a set of program objectives and a list of attendant courses.    5. Develop assessments for program objectives.    6. Obtain the Academic Dean’s signed approval for proposed major.    7. Set a schedule for regular semester meetings with advisory committee to report on progress in the major.    8. Develop a plan for Student Performance Review Day activities.    9. Develop a plan to present during Senior Showcase. Additional Guidelines:    The minimum GPA required to set up an Interdisciplinary Major is 3.0, unless one of the majors involved has a higher GPA requirement, in which case that GPA becomes the minimum standard.     Students must have completed three semesters of college level coursework prior to proposing an Interdisciplinary Studies major.     Student must fulfill all prerequisites for selected courses.     Each Interdisciplinary Studies Major program of study must be approved a minimum of 3 semesters prior to expected graduation date of involved student.      Each Interdisciplinary Studies program of study must include a minimum number of upper level (300-400) courses equal to or greater than the course requirements required by any one of the component majors.     Students must give Registrar a copy of proposed major course outline for senior audit record keeping. William Woods University Academic Catalog 138 Core Credits: 0.00 Course Code Course Description Credit Hours Required / Elective  Design a degree program that includes the following components:    Interdisciplinary Studies BA option - 30 Credits (minimum)    Interdisciplinary Studies BS option - 60 Credits (minimum)    Between 60-70 hours of coursework in 2-3 different discipline areas with a minimum of 20 hours in each area    Between 30-36 hours of coursework in two different areas    An independent study capstone course that requires a thesis or project for the purpose of synthesizing the program - 3 Credits   ATR  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective BIO  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective BUS  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective CHM  300 Independent Study 4.00 Elective CMJ  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective EDU  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective EQA  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective EQS  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective EXS  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective GEO  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective HIS  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective ITP  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective MAT  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective MIS  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective William Woods University Academic Catalog 139 PED  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective PHL  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective PLS  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective PSY  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective SCA  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective SMG  300 Independnet Study 3.00 Elective SPA  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective SWK  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective THA  300 Independent Study 3.00 Elective  Independent Study        ITP Studies in ASL-English BS ITP Studies in ASL-English - 39 Credits The demand for qualified ASL-English interpreters is traditionally high and is increasing yearly. The National Interpreter Education Center has documented a nationwide shortage of qualified interpreters. Since 2008, anyone wishing to sit for the National Interpreter Certification (NIC) must have completed a two-year degree. Now, under new National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) rules (July 2012), a four-year degree is required for anyone wishing to become nationally certified. A number of states are now discussing similar plans for state certification. The Bachelor of Science degree in interpretation studies in ASL/English will prepare students to effectively communicate and interpret between American Sign Language and English. The curriculum strongly emphasizes the sociological, historical, cross-cultural and educational approach to teaching and learning about the Deaf community and American Sign Language through the classroom, experiential learning events, and interactions. The program will prepare students to sit for national certification and to fill the increasing demand for skilled, qualified interpreters. The Bachelor of Science degree in interpretation studies in ASL/English is an 11-course, 36-credit- hour degree-completion program designed for students who have completed a two-year degree in ASL interpreting or course equivalencies as determined by program faculty. Applicants who hold current National Interpreter Certification may have the entrance language proficiency exam waived and apply for Credential Learning credit. All students must complete a total of 122 hours for graduation, including transfer credit, general education, ASL/Interpreting and electives. Admission Requirements  William Woods University Academic Catalog 140 Language proficiency - Applicants will be assessed by full-time campus faculty for ASL fluency through an online assessment. The established proficiency benchmark must be met for entrance to the program. This assessment will be waived for applicants holding current NIC certification. College/university experience - Students must have completed a two-year degree in ASL interpreting or course equivalencies as determined by program faculty prior to entry to the program. GPA requirements - Students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.50 or higher to start program courses.

The Bachelor in Social Work (B.S.W.) is recognized by employers and graduate schools. Students seeking the Master in Social Work (M.S.W.) are given credit for their undergraduate work toward their M.S.W. degree by most graduate schools. Social Work Program Mission A student-centered, multifaceted BSW program grounded in the liberal arts and generalist foundation, that prepares competent beginning level social work professionals to enhance human and community well-being, work with diverse and vulnerable populations, increase access to resources and advocate for social and economic justice within all systemic levels of social work intervention. In addition to academic foundation preparation, the William Woods University Social Work Program strongly believes that parallel engagement is paramount to student development. As such, the program utilizes active observations, interactions and service learning opportunities with service delivery systems, the clients they serve and the communities in which they live. Through faculty mentored hands-on learning opportunities and the 500 hour senior field practicum, students are able to master the core competencies by demonstrating the knowledge, values and skills of the profession’s practice behaviors. The core belief held by the WWU Social Work Program is as follows:  *All human beings have intrinsic worth and dignity and deserve access to resources they need for safety and self-determination *The uniqueness and individuality of each person is a strength. William Woods University Academic Catalog 166 *Social workers demonstrate respect for and acceptance of the unique characteristics of diverse populations. *Social Workers are responsible for ethical conduct, competent practice and for life-long learning Social Work Program Goals: 1.

The bulk of the class will be daily and bi-weekly problems to solve, instructor demonstrations, power point lectures, and critiques. Students will also be required to read and discuss various handouts before each problem. The fundamental approaches to art production and design basics will be explored in 7 art problems throughout the course. Specific limitations will be given for each problem that will both restrict and allow students the freedom to explore creative, unified solutions while gaining a deep understanding of the specific element explored and its relationships to the design principles. Each of the first six problems will focus on one of the 6 art elements. The final problem includes a research assignment and power point presentation of an artist that has inspired the culmination piece that includes all of the elements of design. Throughout the course, students will work in a variety of mediums while exploring different approaches to form. Students will learn how to assess their work and work of others as they gain an understanding of the elements and principles of design, intent and aesthetic. A sketchbook will be kept to explore ideas, record terminology and insights from handouts and presentations, as well as historical figures and styles discovered throughout the semester. A final written assessment reflecting an understanding of process, design and a historical reference will accompany the 7th culmination project for TK20 assessment.

It is the result of the consequences of an individual’s decisions, and the study of history involves analyzing the reasons behind these choices. People are influenced by not only their own beliefs, but also by their society. Despite the vast differences of time and space, common themes continue to emerge throughout the world. This course will trace recurrent historical themes of culture, religion, war, economics, and government. Students will follow the development of the world from the dawn of man into the Renaissance. Topics in this course will include ancient Egypt, classical Greece and Rome, the dynasties of China, the Crusades and the Middle Ages. By using a global focus to examine diverse cultures and societies, students will learn that though history may not repeat itself, it certainly rhymes.

They were all dependent on horses. Want to learn about how horses have altered history on virtually every continent? Well then…giddy up. This course will tell the story of the horse in the World from prehistory to the modern era. Looking at the dual development of horses and humans, and focusing on important events and themes from the cavalry to racing to the Pony Express, this course will seek to uncover how the horse has shaped human history and culture throughout the World. This course is not a history of the horse breeds, nor is it just a class for equestrians—it is for anyone who seeks to learn more about how history has been shaped by two different species interactions.

Originally traveling from Siberia, numerous groups of Native Americans established diverse cultures and William Woods University Academic Catalog 278 civilizations across two continents. This course will trace the history of Native America from the migration of Paleoindians across Beringia to the modern day, dealing with issues ranging from pre-Columbian society, European encounters, disease, government removal policies, and the creation of reservations. Students will study religion, culture, warfare, etc. from the perspective of the Natives of North and South America. Special attention will be placed on the indigenous people of the Great Plains. Credits: 3.00 HIS  216                           From Slavery to Freedom to Civil Rights: The African American Experience                                                                               Until the passage of the thirteenth amendment, the inherent hypocrisy of the Declaration of Independence’s phrase “all men are created equal” and the sin of slavery haunted the nation. But freedom did not end the struggle. This course will trace the history of African Americans from their ancestral origins in Africa into the colonial era and through the modern day—exploring issues of race, culture, enslavement, freedom, rights, and discrimination. It will examine the condition of African American slaves and anti-slavery/pro-slavery politics and economics, and ultimately follow the experience of enslaved and free African Americans into the Civil War and Reconstruction, before transitioning to the quest for equal citizenship in the Civil Rights Movement and the modern day. Students will focus on figures including: Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jesse Jackson, and the Obamas.

Starting with eastern Native American life, the mystery of Roanoke, and the legend of Pocahontas and John Smith this course follows the development of colonial America from the pre-Columbian era through exploration and settlement to the end of the French and Indian War. The class will illustrate how the British North American colonies functioned under a monarchy and were forged by a combination of cultures, beliefs, and interactions. Students will be introduced to specific topics and figures such as: King Philip’s War, the Salem Witchcraft Trials, the Mayflower Compact, Bacon’s Rebellion, religion (including Puritanism, the Mathers, and Jonathan Edwards), trade, slavery, etc. Credits: 3.00 HIS  224                           History of War - H                                                                                                                                     Countless generations have gone to war, and the world has been dramatically shaped on and off the battlefield. How and why were these wars fought? What resulted? This class is centered on the choices these generations made and their consequences on society. The old adage declares, “All’s fair in love and war,” but throughout history, there has been debate over how wars are fought and the behavior of officers and soldiers. Are all wartime actions justified? Is victory the ultimate goal, or is the manner in which the war was fought equally as important? This course will examine the tactics and ethics of war and society from a civilian and military perspective. This course will frame an inquiry into how civilian ethical codes (such as honor, virtue, morality, and humanity) shape military policy, and how ideological thought alters the conduct of a war from the ancient world to the modern battlefield.

Although often viewed in a more modern context, the quest for women’s rights in America has existed since the nation’s founding. This course will follow the lives of American women from pre-contact Native society through the modern day. It will explore a variety of themes connected to gender, race, and status by observing the lives of women within diverse societies. In doing so, students will learn to view the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s and 70s against the foundations of the nineteenth and early twentieth century suffragists and the Revolutionary-era Daughters of Liberty and Republican Womanhood. From the witches of Salem to Susan B. Anthony to Gloria Steinem, this course overall aims to tell the story of women in America.

But who tells our story? Who determines our history? Today, journalists, rather than historians, write most of the popular biographies. So is biography also history? Or is it something else? This course will follow the intersection of the individual story with that of society, asking several fundamental questions: Does history change if we view it from the perspective of one person? Is the individual representative of society? Why do people make certain choices? What is gained through using a narrow lens to view wider events? Focusing on rotating individuals, this course will explore a historical period though the eyes of a single person. Students will read multiple accounts of the life of one person, and write their own narrative on a selected person during a limited timeframe.

It focuses on the importance of the space and place in American history by exploring the physical landscapes of large cities, small towns, rural communities, and sprawling suburbs; the development of regions like the South, the Industrial Belt, the Sunbelt, and the West; and the role of human products like farms, factories, railroads, houses, main streets, chain restaurants, and Wal-Marts.  Throughout, it traces how these built environments both shaped and were shaped by individuals and communities, culture, politics, and the economy.

The British army has fired at American colonists in Lexington and Concord; do you join the Patriots or keep your oath of loyalty to the King? Civil War has broken out and your home state has succeeded from the Union, but you are an officer in the US Army. Do you join the Confederacy? It’s August 1945, you’re Harry Truman and Japan won’t surrender. Do you drop the atomic bomb? History is full of turning points where the decisions of one person or a group of people have shaped the future. This course will explore these historical turning points and seek to understand why people made certain choices. Students will be asked to evaluate the mindset, ethics, and ideologies of historical individuals in order to evaluate decisions and consequences—ultimately asking the question “What would I do?” Credits: 3.00 HIS  324                           American Revolution                                                                                                                                    The American Revolution is perhaps the single most important event in the history of the United States. This class will examine the ideological and intellectual framework that made this revolution possible. The war will be examined not only as a military conflict, but also an event with tangible political, social, economic, racial, and gendered applications. Using primary and secondary sources, this class will be centered on understanding the American mindset from the French and Indian War through the War of 1812. It will analyze how thought influenced action in America ranging from the war to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Credits: 3.00 HIS  332                           Civil War                                                                                                                                              Throughout the American Revolution, patriots had cast British tyranny as reducing them to slavery. The Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution reaffirmed liberty to its citizens, but the inherent hypocrisy of the phrase “all men are created equal” when cast against Revolutionary ideology and the institution of slavery continued to haunt the nation. This course will trace the coming of the Civil War from early republican and antebellum debates on slavery to Manifest Destiny and through Southern secession. It will then examine how the Civil War represented differing definitions over the Revolutionary conception of liberty.

Credits: 3.00 HIS  338                           The Atlantic World: Exploration, Colonization, and GLobalization                                                                                       For centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was a barrier. This formidable body of water represented a vast unknown. The discovery of the New World challenged many of the conceptions held by the Old World. The discovery of the Americas forced Europeans to re-evaluate both themselves and their understanding of the world intellectually, religiously, and geographically. Within a short time, the Atlantic Ocean became a bridge not a barrier. The Atlantic connected four continents (Europe, Africa, North America, South America) in a network of trade, communication, language, culture, and migration. From the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries, the flow of goods, people, and ideas developed and shaped these coastal lands. Yet the Atlantic represented much more than simply an avenue for maritime trade.  It was an entity that affected the daily life of much of the known world. This course will investigate topics ranging from the Enlightenment, exploration, empire, monarchy, slavery, piracy, revolutions, and seek to answer how far was the reach of the Atlantic?

On March 5, 1946 in Fulton, MO, less than a mile from the William Woods’ campus, Churchill created a lasting metaphor to describe the mounting crisis between the Soviet Union and the West that would come to dominate the globe for nearly the next half century. Not even a year after the Allied victory in World War II, the world was to be drawn into conflict again—a shadow war fought on both sides with ideology and fear. The Cold War was waged between Marxism and communism against democracy and capitalism. This course will explore the period from 1945-1991 from a global viewpoint, highlighting the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Covering topics ranging from James Bond to the Berlin Wall, students will explore the ways in which the struggle between communism and democracy influenced daily life, foreign policy, and global conflict. Credits: 3.00 HIS  342                           Public History                                                                                                                                         Do you want to work in a museum, at a historical site, in a library or archive, or maybe as a historian for an organization, or even a documentary filmmaker? Then this course is for you! But what is public history? Public history simply is presenting history for a general audience, not academics. Learn the practical skills necessary to be able to work as a public historian in a variety of occupations from tour guide to preservationist. In this course students will study the basic elements of public history, cultivate archival and manuscript research skills, and create displays and digital projects.  This upper division course will involve individual research and group collaboration to create an exhibit, performance, or digital project (website, documentary film, etc.) focused on a selected historical event, person, or theme. Students will be required to travel to historical sites, libraries, archives, museums, etc. The subject of the project will change whenever the course is offered, so students are welcome to enroll multiple times. Credits: 3.00 HIS  353                           World War II                                                                                                                                           The Great War had been fought as “the war to end all wars,” and twenty years later British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain still promised “peace in our time.” But just six years later, nearly 80 million people were dead. Sparked by the rise of dictatorships, World War II was a clash of nations that represented a global conflict on a scale never before imagined. Exploring the perspectives of both the Allied and Axis powers, students will learn how the clash of ideologies and beliefs resulted in conquest, genocide, and, ultimately, liberation. Although traditionally understood as occurring from 1939–1945, this course will start from the war’s origins—beginning with the end of World War I through the rise of the Nazi Party to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Far from just a military history of war in Europe and the Pacific, this course will examine topics including: the Holocaust, ideologies (democracy, communism, fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, etc.), the A-bomb, world leaders (FDR, Truman, Churchill, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, etc.), politics, propaganda, crime, the home front, and many more. Concluding with the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Trials and the start of the Cold War, the class will also examine the war’s legacy and aftermath.

Among the issues are: abortion, physician-assisted suicide, the death penalty, privacy, pornography and censorship, social justice and affirmative action, gender issues, genetic engineering, cloning, and reproductive technology, environmental ethics and treatment of animals.  The principal focus of the course will be on a careful study and critical examination of arguments and the application of those arguments to current events, issues in research specific to the disciplines William Woods University Academic Catalog 318 and practice issues in Sociology and Social Work.  The design of the course is to familiarize you with the tools needed to make more and ethical decisions that go across both disciplines.  Sociology is a discipline that looks at society as a group and involves social ethics, legal ethics, environmental ethics, gender ethics, family ethics, bioethics, racism and sexism issues as well as personal and practical ethics.  We will answer the questions of, what are our moral obligations to others?  How can moral disagreements be rationally settled?  What rights must a just society accord its citizens?  What constitutes a valid excuse for wrong-doing?
