SFALL 2018,"12 NEW COURSES14 COURSE SCHEDULE21 COURSES AT NYU GLOBAL SITES22 FIRST-YEAR PROGRAM   All students who enter Gallatin with fewer than 32 units are required to take three courses: a First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, which introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School, and a two-semester writing sequence (First-Year Writng Seminar and First-Year Research Seminar), which helps students develop their writing skills and prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses.   34 INTERDISCIPLINARY SEMINARS  The core component of the undergraduate curriculum, interdisciplinary seminars focus on major issues or themes in—and across—the humanities and arts, social sciences, and sciences.  Through these seminars, students encounter a range of important historical periods and fields, and develop a global component to their studies.  These courses are relatively small (22 students) and they emphasize class discussion and thoughtful writing assignments.  Gallatin students are required to complete 16 units in interdisciplinary seminars.58 PRACTICUMS  These hands-on courses emphasize a practical approach to a particular industry or field of expertise.  60 ADVANCED WRITING COURSES  In a workshop format with no more than 15 students, the advanced writing courses engage students in a wide variety of writing exercises and offer an opportunity to share work with fellow students and a practicing professional writer/teacher.  Some of the courses focus on particular forms of writing—fiction, poetry, comedy, the personal narrative, the critical essay—while others encompass several forms and focus instead on a particular theme, such as writing about politics, writing about the arts, and writing about one’s ancestry.65 ARTS WORKSHOPS  Gallatin offers a large variety of arts workshops in music, dance, theatre, and the visual arts.  These workshops are taught by successful New York City artists, performers, and writers; they are designed for both beginning and advanced students.  The arts workshops all employ an “artist/scholar” model that involves giving students experiential training in the practice of particular art forms as well as providing opportunities for critical reflection about the artistic process, aesthetic theory, and the sociology of art. 74 INDIVIDUALIZED PROJECTS  Gallatin offers students an opportunity to pursue their interests through a variety of alternatives outside the traditional classroom: independent study, tutorials, internships, and private lessons.76 GRADUATE ELECTIVES  Graduate electives are available in a variety of fields, including arts, creative writing, and social theory and methods.  These courses are open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor.  78 FACULTY83 LIBERAL ARTS AND HISTORICAL & CULTURAL  REQUIREMENTS4    SummerINTERDISCIPLINARY SEMINARSIDSEM-"

Our emphasis, indeed, is on using these texts to understand our lives and world now. We explore classic texts in relation to con-temporary life’s dilemmas of consumerism and spiritual-ism, individual rights and community rights, vocation and career, God and the afterlife, rebellion and escape from freedom. Readings may include Aeschylus’ The Oresteia, Sappho’s Poems, Plato’s Republic, Lucretius’ On the Nature of the Universe, Ovid’s Metamorphoses or Cicero’s On the Laws, Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales or Cervantes’s Don Quixote.Engaged Research IDSEM-"

As such, it may not always meet reigning scientific or schol-arly standards, and is prone to criticisms of bias or particular-ism. At the same time, it has the potential be more salient and meaningful to community members and to advocates of social change. In this class, we will explore these tensions around community-based research, addressing questions like: Do its potentials outweigh its limits? And what are the best ways to determine community need and to conduct this kind of research as a response to that need? Much of the course time, however, will be dedicated to carrying out proj-ects based with three community-based groups in the New York City area. By the middle of the semester, the course will have moved entirely out of the classroom and participants should be willing to travel to different locations in the city.How Human?

Two months later, physicist Stephen Hawking said AI could be the “worst event in the history of our civilization.” What do we make of these proclamations: is this pragmatism, or doom-and-gloom? What do our concerns about robots say about our own humanity? What does it mean to consider post-humanity when the definition of the “human” is unclear? In this course, we examine the changing boundaries between arti-ficial and real bodies through readings in studies of science and technology, feminist theories of embodiment, studies of race and ethnicity, posthumanism, futurism, and science fic-tion. Topics include the machine/human boundary, potential machine futures, and the ethics of our technological present (and future). Students will also experiment with their own cyborg identity through the creation of a piece of wearable technology or an interactive object.INTENSIVE: MAY 21 - JUNE 7Summer Classical Theater Intensive: Shakespeare in Performance ARTS- How Human?

Each class session will be divided into workshops, which will focus on such topics as: voice and speech, stage combat, clown, working with verse, physical metaphor, writing and adapting songs for Shakespearean performance, and ensemble games. The sec-ond half of the class sessions will involve collective rehearsal of the Shakespeare play. This intensive will be appropriate for all students interested in the performance of Shakespeare, and attention will be paid to providing opportunities for those most interested in directing or designing as well as act-ing. All students will participate in all activities, but the focus of each student can include a diversity of roles.    2018 7session i: may 21 - july 1 INTENSIVE: MAY 21 - JUNE 1Photojournalism Lab: The Ties That Bind PRACT-"

What if you could use images to give crucial voice to people and ideas that need to be seen and heard? In this Photojournalism Lab, students will become trained visual documentarians. This lab teaches the process of creating visual journalism, from conception of a photo project idea, through execution of the final product, to how to profession-ally pitch that product for distribution. The thematic focus of this workshop is “The Ties That Bind,” which is intentionally broad to give students freedom to interpret and explore that concept. In the midst of an enormous city, what connects people? Some connections are forced; others are natural. Are there divisions event amidst connection? What does connection entail? When does division outweigh? Who are the people, organizations or environments affected by these questions? And importantly, how can these stories be told in pictures? In this two-week intensive workshop, students learn necessary skills from Professor Walsh and renowned photojournalist Ron Haviv, both of whom lead photo cri-tiques and teach essential techniques for editing one’s visual journalism. Skills taught include how to write and promote a project proposal for professional publication; developing a better eye and better camera skills for taking stronger pictures; how to think like an editor and edit down to the essential photos; and developing a personal project that has resonance with larger social matters. The culminating photo projects might focus on topics such as family, immigrant com-munities, marginalized groups, humanitarian organizations, religion, and gender (in)equality, among others. Ultimately, each student produces a powerful photo essay on a mean-ingful topic. This course will appeal to students interested in photojournalism, journalism, documentary photography, social justice, sociology, and urban studies.PARIS:  MAY 28 - JUNE 16Black in the City of Light, Paris TRAVL-"

The course will also analyze the ways in which this knowledge has been applied in medicine, law, economics, government policy, and religion. Some of the topics we will look at include the following: mind-body dual-ism, neuron theory, psychoanalysis and biology, brain imag-ing, the molecular and plastic brain, and psychotropic drugs. interdisciplinary seminars46    FallThe course takes a primarily historical approach to this topic, but work from other academic disciplines that engage with related questions will also be addressed.

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the professor to supervise an indepen-dent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writ-ing. Independent studies are graded courses, the details of which are formulated by the student and his or her instruc-tor; these specifics are described in th e Independent Study proposal and submitted to the Dean’s Office for approval. The student and instructor meet regularly throughout the semester to discuss the readings, the research, and the student’s work. Credit is determined by the amount of work entailed in the study and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Generally, independent studies, like other courses, are 2 to 4 units.

In contemporary art and media worlds, it seems as if every-one who makes choices about what to present to the public is called a curator. But what exactly is the work of curat-ing? How do curators refine their capacities for judgment, storytelling, and display? How are these forms of expertise learned, and in what ways do they intersect with other forms of cultural production? Balancing critical and applied perspectives, this course investigates curatorial work as a site of cultural practice, a sphere of action and knowledge—above all, the “eye” or sense of critical taste—that is learned and performed in multiple contexts of display. Connecting curation to its etymological roots in “cure” and “care,” this course will also consider curating as a remedial practice that has changed over time in relation to globalized networks of the art market, professionalization, and the phenomenon of interdisciplinary seminars50    Fallcelebrity curators. Students will investigate curatorial intent and outcomes based on exhibition catalogs, reviews, and other forms of documentation. Students will also explore contemporary practices of curating within and beyond the space of the gallery through their own curatorial projects.

How do cities shape nature, and vice versa? Where do—and where should—city-dwellers get their food? “Concrete jungles” (as opposed to “real” ones) often seem to be purely human-built, unnatural places where things are made and consumed, not grown. But the place of nature in cities, and our relationship to it, has long been contested. When we look at food in relationship to urban centers, we end up seeing far beyond the questions of what we eat and where we get it. The proper place of nature in cities is at the heart of many contemporary debates over urban policy, including food and agriculture, land use, disaster policy, and immunization. In this class, we will think historically and critically about these debates both in the past and in contemporary cities, focusing on North America, especially New York. Readings will include William Cronon, Ted Steinberg, Catherine McNeur, Katherine Leonard Turner, and others.Kings and Kingship in the Ancient Near EastIDSEM- 2-4 UN    t.b.a.

It is certainly true that some of the most important political, philosophical, literary and artistic works of African American culture arise from an encounter with the City of Light, but contained within these works is not "racelessness" but a pronounced sense and articulation of what it means to be a Black American. From the written works of Harlem Renaissance writers Langston Hughes, Claude McKay and Countee Cullen that fomented the Negritude movement, to the performances of Josephine Baker, to the art of Henry Ossawa Tanner and Beauford Delaney, to the music of jazz musicians Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Bill Coleman, to the political philosophies and writings of W.E.B. Dubois and James Baldwin, Paris's influence on the creation of African American culture has been profound. Less noted is the degree to which the African American presence in Paris influ-enced international art and political thought, from the use of African cubism among European artists to the shaping of the philosophies of thinkers like Sarte, Camus and de Beauvoir. We will focus on Paris as a site of exchange—as an intersec-tion through which pass influential ideas, forms and actions. We will consider the degree to which the encounter with Paris paradoxically made African American writers and artists more aware of and intent upon defining and articulating their Americanness, and finding in it a foundation for increased political activism and shaping of a Pan-African sensibility and community. This class will examine the literature, art, food, geographies, and politics of African American expatriates in Paris, paying particular attention to the ways that the view from another shore shaped political thought and activism arising from a deepened awareness of national and interna-tional identity that Paris inspired. 8    SummerBERLIN: JUNE 2 - JUNE 30Berlin: Capital of Modernity TRAVL-"

Permission required. For more information and to apply, please visit Gallatin's website.Some of the most thrilling, momentous, and terrible events of the 1900s occurred in Berlin, which present tales of warn-ing and inspiration to the present century. This four-week interdisciplinary seminar tracks these major events and trac-es change through the study of primary materials (literature, film, art, buildings, music, political discourse) and secondary readings drawn from a range of disciplines including history, sociology, philosophy, and critical theory. Berlin's streets, buildings, memorials, and cultural monuments offer caution-ary tales about the folly of nationalist ambition; inspiring sagas of intellectual and physical courage; cold testimonials of crime and retribution; lyrical ballads of brutal honesty; personal records of hope and despair. From one perspective, all of these narratives are episodes in an epic whose grand and central scene is World War II; this is the point of view to be adopted in this course. Students will take in many of the sights and sounds of old and contemporary Berlin but will focus on the involvement of twentieth-century, Berlin-based politicians, activists, artists, architects, bohemians, writers, and intellectuals with the causes, experience, and consequences of World War II. Our period of study begins just before the outbreak of World War I and ends during the astonishing building boom of the post-Wall 1990s and early 2000s. Classes, taught in English, will meet four days a week. Survival German language courses will be offered daily. Group site visits will occur throughout the week and on weekends but students will be given ample opportunity to explore Berlin and develop individual projects. Field trips will encompass the rich resources of the city's museums, neighborhoods, historical sites, memorials, and cultural monuments.

For more information and to apply, please visit Gallatin's website.This travel course examines urban development in the post-colonial global South through the lens of cities in Senegal, West Africa. Like elsewhere across the global South, Senegal is rapidly becoming urban. This process implies a host of important transformations and challenges for development, the environment, and the socio-political lives of city dwell-ers. Owing to the country’s particular development trajec-tory, long history of urbanization, and important legacy as one of Africa’s strongest democracies, Senegal provides an especially fascinating place to examine these dynamics and grapple with their implications for urban processes all over the globe. Rejecting the language of crisis, chaos, and excep-tion that is so often used to characterize urbanization in the global South, the course provides theoretically and experi-entially informed perspectives on the way postcolonial cities work as well as the challenges that remain. Though we will draw on readings from across the global South, the course will focus on the dynamic intersections of development, environment, and social movements in Senegal in light of the country’s particular history, geography, culture, and politics. Specifically, the course will be based in Senegal’s capital city, Dakar, but will include overnight trips to the other important Senegalese cities of Saint Louis (the colonial capital of French West Africa) and Touba (the holy city of Senegal's Islamic Mouride Brotherhood) to compare the form and function of these alternative urban development trajectories. Through a combination of course readings, classroom lectures, tours, and field visits, we will explore the legacies of colonialism and unpack a number of key contemporary debates and challenges faced by urban planners and city residents. Within Dakar, day trips will include Gorée Island, the municipal garbage dump, a traditional fishing village, and a hip hop community center. The class will meet daily and field visits will occur throughout the week and on weekends. Through the lectures and field trips, we will be exposed to multiple challenges and approaches to development from a broad variety of actors, including municipal governments, NGOs, and grassroots community-based organizations.session i: may 21 - july 1 2018 9session ii: july 2 - august 12  The Consumerist Gaze IDSEM-"

More specifically, we seek to understand the role of commodity images in shaping consumer practices and politics, ways of thinking and seeing, and notions of belong-ing and difference. In the contemporary moment, that which is gazed upon takes any number of avenues from promises for a better self, environment, or world to images of racial-ized, exoticized, gendered, sexualized, classed, and ‘othered’ bodies and ways of being. While we will consider the origins of ‘the gaze’ as a theoretical approach, the consumerist variety acts as an especially useful framework by employing an interdisciplinary lens that utilizes cultural theory, visual culture, critical geography, business and advertising eth-ics, and political economy. Possible case studies and topics include: the United Colors of Benetton “Sentenced to Death” campaign, TOMS Shoes’ visualization of ethics in its model of poverty alleviation and examples of ‘poverty-porn,’ the ‘pink-ing’ of breast cancer awareness products, and commodity-activism. Possible readings include Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Jean Baudrillard, Laura Mulvey, Anne McClintock, Teju Cole, Sut Jhally, Roland Barthes, and Walter Benjamin.INTENSIVE: JULY 2 - JULY 20¡Revoluci�n!

From Zapata to "Ché" to Chávez, the region's modern history is a tale of one movement promising epic change to the next, each more dramatic than the last and collec-tively giving rise to an image of Latin America as a cradle of firebrand leaders and riotous masses leaving in their wake endless cycles of unrest. But to look deeper into this history is to find a world of complexity, of peoples pursuing radical change but also gradual reform, at times taking up ballots and at times taking up arms, at times in the factory and at times on the farm, at times from the left and at times from the right. All of it "revolución," yes, but what kind? And through what means? And for what ends? And at what cost? This course traces the evolution of revolution in twentieth century Latin America, from the final collapse of Spanish colonialism in 1898 to the rise of chavismo in 1998, and finally considers the impact of this history on Latin America today. Authors may include, among others, Mariano Azuela, Eva Perón, Gustavo Gutierrez, Subcomandante Marcos, and Raul Zibechi.Magazine Dreams: Conceiving, Designing, and Producing a 21st-Century Publication ARTS-"

Many have celebrated the expansion of digital technologies as a means to dismantle hegemonic power structures, expanding the sites of knowl-edge production to traditionally marginalized communities and empowering people across grassroots networks. But what does it mean to live in a world so completely mediated by unknown and invisible agents of information? How does this technology construct, illuminate, and obfuscate mean-ing and identity? Is seeing the code behind the simulacra an act of subversion?. In this class, theory and fiction serve as a framework for analyzing online journalism (including the fake news phenomenon and trending tweets), digital art, social media and activism, and augmented reality and games. Alongside this analysis, we will participate in the act of tech-nological meaning making, producing mini digital prototypes and developing the basic skills necessary to become critical authors within this world. Students will have the opportunity to compose digital stories, create data visualizations, curate digital archives, and build interactive AR projects. No prior skills or digital know-how is necessary, just a willingness to try new things. Readings will include Marshall McLuhan, N.

Auden, in his elegy for W.B. Yeats, may proclaim that poetry “makes nothing happen,” but he quickly asserts that “It survives/ In the valley of its saying.” Williams and Auden are two modern poets grappling with the questions that poets and scholars across disciplines have long debated about the place and purposes of poetry. In this course, we will study the domain of lyric poetry and poetics and the kinds of thinking that happen in poems. We may begin with some classical texts that seek to articulate the poetic realm, and then turn to studying poetic forms and conventions. What do we mean when we say that a text is poetic? What is the relation between form and meaning in poems? Why do poets choose the forms they do, and how might these forms and structures express feelings and ideas difficult (or impossible) to express otherwise? Most impor-tantly, what kinds of knowledge does lyric poetry entail? Readings will include a wide range of poems written in English and poems in translation, as well as secondary mate-rials that extend the conversations into the relation between poetry and the other arts, poetry and philosophy, and poetry and politics.(Un)relatable FIRST-"

It began to be used to deem a person, situation, or work of art “that…with which one can identify or empathize.” “Relatability,” in turn, could then indicate the degree to which a work of art or a circumstance could be approached or, more simply, liked. This semester, we will take a harder look at the political, philosophical, and rhetorical circum-stances that determine what counts as “relatable” or not. However ordinary the term might seem, the assessment of what or who is “relatable” has prompted fierce criticism: it has been denounced as “empty,” “a critique killer,” and “self-involved.” To understand why and how this term might court controversy, we will examine texts across disciplinary, national, and historical fields that help us form a geneal-ogy of sympathy and its kin: empathy, pity, the more recent “relatable.” We will ask how moral philosophy has handled the question of fellow-feeling; how psychoanalysis under-stands the operations of identification and narcissism; how alternative genealogies of sympathy in Stoic, neoplatonic Islamic, and early modern European philosophies of “natural sympathies” might change how we understand the operation of “relation”; how (and when and why) literary form might undermine “relatability”; and how the determination of the relatable emerges as a question of politics.American Paranoia: Community and the Fear of "Others" FIRST-"

Yet, how do we represent money? What structures of imagi-nation and cultural memory get mobilized whenever we think about currency? Often the desire to describe money, to visualize this opaque medium, gives rise to fantastic, grotesque, and surreal forms. This course will explore the theme of money—and with it, of debt, counterfeit currency, gambling, lottery, austerity, commodity fetishism, as well as relationship between the circulation of capital, desire, and gender—in literature and film. Our exploration of fic-tions that sustain and critique capitalist advancement will begin with the study of the nineteenth-century realist prose, arguably theliterature of capitalist modernity. The works of the nineteenth-century realists like Balzac, Dostoyevsky, and Tolstoy are preoccupied with money as something that first-year writing seminars32    Fallunderlies all social relations. Karl Marx, another nineteenth-century figure, is the most famous critic of capitalism and its fictions, which imprison real bodies. The course will also draw on materials from the twentieth and twenty-first centu-ries: from the cinematic adaptations of Friedrich Dürrenmatt by a Senegalese film director Djibril Diop Mambéty to con-temporary Greek literature of austerity. The authors and filmmakers we will deal with in this course include Honoré de Balzac, Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Herman Melville, Charlote Perkins Gillman, Edith Wharton, Christina Stead, Robert Bresson, Djibril Diop Mambeti, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, David Graeber, Christos Ikonomou, and others.Langston Hughes’s Travels and Translations FIRST-"

Hughes’s work as a translator was at times subject to pointed critiques by his contemporaries and eclipsed by translations deemed better or more defini-tive. The fate of these works perhaps underscores the asser-tion, set forth in the introduction to a collection of Hughes’s translations, that Hughes’s “concept of translation was not as developed as his need to practice the activity.” In this course we will nuance the above assertion and explore Hughes’s contributions to both the concept and practice of translation by reading his French, Spanish and Russian translations in conjunction with his autobiography, I Wonder as I Wander (1956), in which he details his travels in the 1930s. This dual focus on travels and translations aims to link Hughes’s tendency to wander (from to Cuba, Haiti, the Soviet Union, Paris, Spain and East Asia) and to wonder (about the social, political, spiritual and musical connections between the dif-ferent peoples he encounters) to his need to translate, and thus share, the work of authors he admired along the way. Primary readings for this course—Nicolás Guillén’s Cuba Libre (1948), Jacques Roumain’s Gouverneurs de la Rosée (1945) and Masters of the Dew (1947), and Federico Garcia Lorca’s Romancero Gitano (1928) and Gypsy Ballads (1951), plus poems by Louis Aragon, Leon-Gontran Damas and Vladimir Mayakovsky—deepen our awareness that Hughes chose to translate authors with whom he cultivated lifelong friendships or felt deep kinship based on their shared aes-thetic sensibilities, political commitments, and passion for popular musics such as jazz, flamenco and son.first-year writing seminars2018 33TRANSFER STUDENTS ONLY Permission required.

Co-taught by over 20 Gallatin faculty, each week we will attend to how different fields of study construct knowledge; we will try to better understand how we may unpack the racial grammar, sometimes visible often latent, that shapes and constricts disciplinary knowledge, and how particular assumptions and perspectives get authorized and amplified within the university’s walls. How might we situate different ways of knowing in relation to historical and contemporary maps of power and privilege, local and/or global? How might the dominant intellectual traditions in your area of concen-tration be challenged by foregrounding legacies of colonial-ism and/or slavery? How would feminist, queer, Marxist critique help us probe these questions further? And what will you have to unlearn in asking these questions? What new lines of inquiry, responsibility and solidarity might be open for you? The class will expose students to a rich body of literature that vividly challenges the racial unconscious of a broad variety of disciplines (anthropology, law, philosophy, history, literature, music etc.), and of course of the university experience itself. We will draw on texts that directly chal-lenge the dominant traditions, as well as texts that have been shaped by subordinated traditions. Readings include scholars such as W.E.B.

Much academic study of television has focused on its social impact and ideological content, and in this seminar we will engage that work. Television can't be fully comprehended, however, without considering how the stories of television are told. Our working hypoth-esis is that form organizes the meanings and generates the emotions that audiences take away from stories, and so it's worthwhile to consider television as text. What genres are emerging today, and how are they connected, if at all, to classic network forms such as the sitcom and the cop show? How have dramatic, film, and literary forms shaped television storytelling, and how do we measure the impact of technological innovation and the commercial conventions unique to television? Assigned readings include writers on the problem of narrative form and content such as Aristotle, Stanley Cavell, and Roland Barthes, as well as writers on television, including Theodor Adorno, Jason Mittell, Linda Williams, John Sconce, Jane Feuer, Emily Nussbaum, Clive James, and various internet recappers. We will focus on examples of American network genres such as the situation comedy, nighttime soap, and police shows and new "cable classics" (probably episodes of The Sopranos, The Wire, and Mad Men, and Game of Thrones).

Our task is to assess what "fascism" and "populism" were historically, and what "fascist" and "populist," as adjectives, signify in discussions about racial nationalism and hostility to elites now. In both regards, central questions in political theory guide us in analyzing each movement, and its after-lives and appropriations: First, how do we think about the relationship between capitalist crisis, mass mobilization, and (demo-cratic) politics? Second, what is the relation between racial formation, nation-defining, and democratic politics? Third, how does narrative or genre (e.g. what Richard Hofstadter called “the paranoid style”) intersect with political mobili-zation? Fourth, what is inherited and what is new in white nationalism now and in protests against it? Having studied populism and fascism, we can assess recent media and scholarly claims that the “alt right” or white nationalism are “populist” or “fascist.” Our goal is not to fix a taxonomy but to assess consequential "speech-acts." For how we “name” (conceptualize and narrate) political events determines how we engage them, and thereby, what they end up meaning for the future we are making by that engagement. We also want to consider if the democratic meanings of populism can be salvaged or whether democratic possibilities require a radically different language. Authors may include: Richard Hofstadter, Lawrence Goodwyn, Michael Rogin, Karl Polanyi, Hannah Arendt, Klaus Theweleit, William Connolly, Virginia Woolf, Sinclair Lewis, Phillip Roth.

Some call for trials. Others call for truth. For the survivors and families of massive killings and forced disappearances, of rape and torture, and for communities subjected to long-term dispossession of their land, culture and identity, the idea of justice often takes the form of repa-rations. This course will ask students to reflect on the moral and philosophical issues around reparations and the practi-cal challenges in their implementation. There are challenges involving resources and feasibility. There are dilemmas, real or imagined, over moral responsibility and historical truth. In the global South, these dilemmas have emerged in the on-going transitions from colonialism, war, and dictatorship. Even in the global North, demands for reparations for slavery or for the treatment of indigenous people and persons of color are caught in some of these questions. This course will bring together political science, history, art and culture, law, medicine, forensic investigations and economics, and the experiences of specific countries involving reparations and tackle how questions of justice and memory can or cannot be answered through reparations. Readings may include Carranza, de Greiff, Coates, Rubio-Marin, Magarrell and case studies involving Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Peru), Africa (South Africa, Sierra Leone and Kenya), the Middle East and North Africa (Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq) and Asia (the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Nepal and Cambodia) and the United States and Canada.Race and Photography IDSEM- Can Past Be Repaired?IDSEM- Can Past Be Repaired?IDSEM-"

The episodes, which focus on Europe and the U.S., range from the trial of Galileo before the Roman Inquisition in the 17th-century and the investigation into mesmerism in 18th-century Paris, in which Benjamin Franklin served as one of the commissioners, to several trials involving evolution theory, the trial of earth scientists following a devastating earthquake in Italy, and the recent U.S. Supreme Court case over patenting the breast cancer gene. Each episode will bring out a different facet of science and its relationship to the legal matters at hand, and each requires some understanding of the social, cultural, and political context, which will be supplied through readings, informal lectures, and class discussion. Recurring themes include the relationship between scientific and legal reason-ing, the place of authority in science and the state,the uses of evidence in science and law, and the role of scientific expert witnesses in courts of law.

There are times when controversies in the art world spill over into public discourse, as they have recently in Dana Schutz’s racially charged use of the image of Emmet Till in her work at the Whitney Biennial and as they did in the 1999 exhibition ‘Sensation,’ which raised questions about the use of city funding and the inclusion of Chris Offili’s depiction of the Virgin Mary. These high-profile examples raise the ques-tion: In a context that values pushing boundaries, how do we think about what defines ‘too far’? This question is tied up in complicated notions of value that include not only the artistic, but also the political, the social, the economic and commercial, the historical, and even the spiritual. In this class, we explore the ways that these issues are embedded within and addressed by contemporary exhibition spaces. In the rarefied context of the art world, how do considerations like the artist’s past work, the potential controversies of a piece, or the political climate influence exhibition choices? How does the exhibit space itself—whether the Met or a interdisciplinary seminars54    Fallpop-up in Brooklyn—impact the ways that art is received? In a forest of potential readings and meanings, how do we, as audience, critic, and consumer, make sense of what we encounter? Through readings and visits to exhibitions, we will work toward a collective and personal language with which to engage the variety of possibilities implied within works and their display. Readings may include Ngai, Jameson, Diderot, Baudelaire, Steyerl, Ranciere.Women’s and Feminist Literature in the Contemporary Middle East IDSEM- Pleasures & PerilsIDSEM-"

This course provides a window into this rich and largely neglected branch of world literature. Students will encounter the breadth and creativity of con-temporary Middle Eastern women’s writing by reading a range of twentieth– and twenty-first–century novels, short stories, memoirs, and poetry, and by viewing films that are from or about Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt. How do Middle Eastern women authors address women’s oppression —both social and physical—and enunciate issues such as the tension between tradition and modernity, sexuality, identity and class from a female perspective? What literary traditions and models do they draw on? How different are those texts written in English or French for a global audience, as opposed to those written in Persian or Arabic? What are the effects of reading them in translation? Authors will include Simin Daneshvar, Zoya Pirzad, Marjane Satrapi, Azar Nafisi, Hanan al-Shaykh, Alia Mamdouh and Nawal El Saadawi.Ugly Feelings: Affect Theory in Contemporary Art and Literature IDSEM- Women’s & Feminist LitIDSEM- Women’s & Feminist LitIDSEM-"

In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will look at the ways in which contemporary art and literature have depicted, dissemi-nated, and disassembled feelings, particularly the sort of complicated, unwieldy, troubling affects one might deem “ugly.” We will begin with Sianne Ngai’s eponymous work on the subject of “ugly feelings,” then go on to consider a variety of such emotions, including anger, fear, shame, humiliation, and happiness (which we will consider as potentially “ugly”). As we investigate how contemporary visual art and literary works tackle negative emotional states, we will pay particu-lar attention to the effects of social and cultural positioning on affect and interrogate the capacity of art to be produc-tive in helping us process our ugly feelings. We will also ask how aesthetic choices impact our understanding of our own ugly feelings and the ugly feelings of others. Readings my include work by Maggie Nelson, Wayne Koestenbaum, David Foster Wallace, Don DeLillo, Sheila Heti, Elena Ferrante, J.M. Coetzee, Sylvia Plath, Claudia Rankine, and Frederick Seidel. We will also consider works by artists like Tracy Emin, Hannah Wilke, Diane Arbus, Francis Bacon, and Kara Walker.Society and State in the Ottoman Empire IDSEM- Ugly FeelingsIDSEM-"

Who were the Turkish-speaking Muslims who made up the governing elite of this empire? Where did they come from? How did they negotiate the social, religious, racial, economic, linguistic, and gendered differences among their population? What kinds of sources tell us these things? What has shaped our image of the sultan, and is it accurate? What was this empire like and who were the Ottomans? We cannot hope to cover the whole of Ottoman history or the breadth of the empire in a single semester, but this course will introduce the Ottoman Empire, addressing these questions by looking at different aspects of its history, government, society, and culture. We will read primary sources that reflect Ottoman court life, imperial ceremonies, the empire’s legal and eco-nomic governance, and slavery, and that attest to the various experiences of its diverse populations; we will also look at imperial dedications and civic projects.interdisciplinary seminars2018 55Of Violence and the U.S. Empire: Militarization, Colonialism and Unruliness IDSEM- Society and StateIDSEM- Society and StateGLOBAL CULTURESIDSEM- Society and StateIDSEM-"

In the 2016 fiscal year, for example, about half of the discretionary spending by the U.S. federal government went to the Department of Defense. The figure follows a historical trend suggestive not only of the centrality of the Armed Forces in U.S. nationalist imaginings and capitalist undertakings, but also of the dif-ficulty of civil society in envisioning non-militarized ways of existence. Such difficulty has a history and consequences. Their unveiling necessitates a reckoning with the workings of settler colonialism and the U.S. Empire. This course will focus on the tense and complex ways through which the U.S. has organized itself to produce violence and legitimate its use. It will specifically interrogate what militarization can mean and how it is linked to colonialism. It will further explore unruly calls for a different world in which human relations are not mediated by (raw) violence and in which liberation, security and humanitarianism are not militarized. The course may build upon the work of Catherine Lutz, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, David Vine, Cynthia Enloe, Katherine McCaffrey, Robert Rabin, Suzuyo Takazato and others.interdisciplinary seminarsFeminist Writing as Social Activism: Perspectives from the Neocolonial World IDSEM- Of ViolenceIDSEM- Of ViolenceIDSEM-"

In this seminar, we will study the multiplicity of ways in which women writers’ bear witness to historical upheavals around them and how they articulate a challenge to oppressive insti-tutions of power through their works. Navigating a variety of genres and texts, students will learn how writing in/about the neocolonial world (sometimes also referred to as “global south” or “ third world”) by women of colour is both cultural and political critique. Simultaneously intimate (born out of first-person experience) and radical (shared with the urgency to change the world as it exists), writing by women of the neocolonial world steps outside the normative boundaries of literature and creativity and becomes a revolutionary politi-cal force. The instructor will also use, as a springboard to the course, her own genre-bending work that deals with caste, gender and the national question in India. Other readings and discussions will focus on gendered aspects of violence, the immigrant condition, religious and socially-sanctioned oppression, struggle against colonial occupation, LGBTQ rights and critiques of imperialist feminism. Students will study key critical texts (The Bridge Called My Back, Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism) along with writ-ers like Bama, Kamala Das, Assia Djebar, Xiaolu Guo, Valeria Luiselli, Trinh T.

First Class: Sept. 4; Last Class: Oct. 23.Recent studies of television viewing have moved from under-standing the experience as a passive one to understanding it as more active and “participatory.” At the same time, the rise of social media, fan conventions and platforms, and new forms of distribution and dissemination have trans-formed various “fandoms” from marginal often-dismissed subcultures into a creative, influential and mainstream demographic. All of these factors have radically changed the relationship between creator, producer, text, and perceiver and have destabilized our ideas of the role and authority of the author or showrunner, the canonicity and ontology of the text, and the stability of narrative. In this course we will ana-lyze how fans of television shows respond to and influence content, how they interact with and create content across various mediums, and their role in the promotion of pro-grams. We will examine the interactions of fans to television shows and transmedia content from the early fandoms of the original Star Trek to the more recent multifaceted fandoms of Stranger Things and Game of Thrones, as well as debates over gender, race, fan labor, and politics. How do we distin-guish between fan, critic, and scholar? How are fandoms integrated into individual and group identity? How does fan culture differentiate between “fanboys” and “fangirls”? What role does fan content—parody, fan fiction, fan art, fan games—play in regards to the original “canonical” content?

Millions of young fans grew up listening to, reading, and viewing the adven-tures of Harry and his friends, and many of them came of age along with the characters. In more recent years, books, museum shows, amusement parks, popular music, and the-ater have continued the stories and the popularity among fans of all ages. This course will study the influence the sto-ries have had and continues to have, specifically their impact on the way fans interact with ideas and topics such as mental health, education, post-colonialism, child labor, feminism, race, political resistance, animal rights, fake news, religion, sexuality, and technology. We will analyze reading practices, fan fiction, debates over canonicity and censorship, and ritu-als of cosplay. How has the character of Hermione impacted ideas of women in higher education? Does “Dumbledore’s Army” offer a useful model of resistance? How do various fan fiction “shipping” strategies subvert the heteronormativity of the novels? Is Hogwarts a progressive or conservative model of education? The class will assume complete familiarity with both the books and the films. Our reading will include short sections of the novels along with secondary sources, documents, pod casts, criticism and fiction produced by fans, scholars, and journalists.

Alice goes down the rabbit hole. How can [an] author make these events seem not only uncannily plausible, but even expectable—the sud-den eruption of some carefully encrypted logic operating beneath our conscious awareness? How do we ground the fantastic in enough realism to sustain the reader’s suspen-sion of disbelief? Tzvetan Todorov defines the fantastic as a "subgenre of literary works characterized by the ambiguous presentation of supernatural forces." Donald Antrim, on the other hand, regards the fantastic not as a genre, but as a con-dition shared between author and reader: “a potential state” in which “everything is vivid, yet nothing is clearly defined,” where “the fantastical and the real are equally questionable, equally challenged by one another.” This class will explore the fantastic as the strangest and most explicit demonstra-tion of what literary technique can achieve in any genre. We will focus on various kinds of world-making, from magical realms to dystopias to refracted versions of “realism.” Special attention will be devoted to how writers use altered states of consciousness like trauma, intoxication, and psychosis to cre-ate a hallucinatory space between the supernatural and the deeply improbable. Readings will also span a wide spectrum of cultures and historical periods, from canonical works like Frankenstein to Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities to contempo-rary novels like Ben Okri’s The Famished Road, Joy Williams’ The Changeling, and Donald Antrim’s The Hundred Brothers.

How does or should that change when the culture is largely mis– or underrepresented—or if it is not their own? How do current events and the pressures of commercial success influence these decisions?

Over the course of the semester, the filmmakers will expand and clarify their vision and the cinematic language of their work. Alongside these creative challenges, we also consider the logistical issues that filmmakers face, including financing, scheduling, insurance, and outreach strategies to get the film into the world. To this end, the coursework culminates in both a completed short film to be screened at the semester’s end and an exhibition model, which can be a festival, part of a proof of concept for a larger work, a pilot episode of a series, or other innovative ideas. Throughout the semester, visiting speakers will demystify the festival world, distribu-tion, financing and other elements of the process. Students are encouraged, but not required to bring scripts and story ideas developed in other classes so as to be able to further deepen the work of producing the film. The course is open to all levels and will especially focus on the collaborative aspects of the filmmaking process. For those with a less developed idea or less experience, the focus will be on the formulating of a story and its final realization on screen.Architectural Design and Drawing ARTS-"

We will interrelate the subjects of noise, silence, and the city, ranging from important moments in the history of noise abatement in New York City to the philosophy and work of composers such as John Cage. New York City’s diverse popu-lation strongly affects and produces its unique soundscape; how does this particular city reflect its inhabitants? There will be off-site field trips to events such as the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, as well as visits to sited works such as arts workshops2018 73Max Neuhaus’s Times Square. We will consider how sound is often explicitly designed to affect and influence us in places such as retail environments. How do our attempts to medi-ate sound with devices like headphones affect our listening? Students will engage the ideas of writers such as Stuart Hall, Jacques Attali, Luigi Russolo, John Cage, Emily Thompson, R. Murray Schaefer, and Shuhei Hosokawa, as well as works by Christina Kubisch, Susan Phillipz, and Pauline Oliveros. There will be three short production assignments, some of which will be made for specific sites in the city as a way of investi-gating the interplay between public spaces and listening.

First Class: Sept. 4; Last Class: Oct. 23.Humor often functions like a Trojan Horse, bypassing the guardians of the status quo and drawing laughter before it’s clear exactly what’s happened. What’s smuggled in under the guise of a joke may often be very serious, and funny and frivolous are far from being the same thing. This course focuses on humor in visual arts practice and starts by analyzing the many flavors of funny: satire, irony, slapstick, abjection, deadpan, and plays with language (puns, double entendre). What happens in the realm of the visual, when there isn’t the presence of a performing body to deliver the joke? Insightful and incendiary critiques have often been delivered through the complex strategies of humor, and we will consider both historical and recent examples. Humor and transgression often keep close company and what we repress often erupts through the societal bounds of taste and decorum. Humor can be provocative but also malicious; this course requires that students clearly respect each other’s boundaries. Historical examples will include Archimboldo, José Guadalupe Posada, and Marcel Duchamp; contempo-rary artists will include Sarah Lucas, Kara Walker, Maurizio Cattelan, Fischli and Weiss, Kate Gilmore, David Shrigley, Bruce Nauman, Hennessey Youngman, and Sally O’Reilly. There will be opportunity for direct conversation with some of artists whose work we are studying. Students may work in a variety of different media, which could change from project to project.

This class is about how writers have used imaginative literature to examine those complexities. How have such writers defined “nature”? What relationships do they con-struct between human beings and the natural world? How are conceptions of nature, the human, and their interaction inflected by cultural assumptions and concerns, including ones about race, gender, and imperialism? Who possesses knowledge about nature? What constitutes such knowledge? We’ll address these questions while reading literary works by Amitav Ghosh, Barbara Kingsolver, Zakes Mda, and others; we’ll put these texts into dialogue with work on ecology and environmental history by Rachel Carson, Bill Cronon, and Rob Nixon; and we'll consider how nature shapes even New York City, the quintessential urban environment. Our readings will be supplemented by field trips and lectures that may com-plicate our ideas about nature by revealing how it shapes even New York City, the quintessential urban environment.

As urban dwellers, we are constitutive parts of a vast and complex cultural ecosystem—and the global microcosm that is our city, New York City, reverberates with music that expresses the fullness and diversity of the lives of its inhabitants. Our way of understanding music making in this context, as well as the industry and cultural imperatives behind this music making, is through the city’s various music institutions. We will explore a cultural history of the city that highlights waves of migration, the establishment and destabilization of indus-try, institution building, ethnic enclaves, cultural diffusion, stylistic evolution, and locality. What are the music cultures that surround us, near NYU and beyond? How might musi-cal performance and patronage give us insight into the role of arts and creative expression in the city and in the lives of its inhabitants? What can we learn about the relationship between music, the arts, and the social world?

Using a wide range of empirical and theoretical materials, we problematize what is too often considered settled: what constitutes race. We challenge the prevail-ing assumption that race is a biological fact and investigate race as a social construct--one that has changed over time, and varies across societies. A major goal of the course is to understand the mechanisms through which racial domina-tion is (re)produced. We ask questions like: How do systems of racial classification stem from and facilitate patterns of prejudice, discrimination, and segregation? How do those patterns relate to racial violence and even genocide? Why do some societies sanction interracial sex and/or marriage and not others? We read selections from sociology, anthropol-ogy, history and literature on ethnoracial division in the US, Western Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.

How does a work of literature change as you learn more about its historical context or the history of its own production? This is a class on reading and perspective meant to cultivate our skills as students of literature or other kinds of texts. In the first half of the semester, we will approach lyric poems, short stories and novels (Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, Shelley’s Frankenstein, and the Arabian Nights), as worlds unto themselves, taking seriously the texts’ internal logic while probing their pecu-liarities, ambiguities, and paradoxes. We will attend to how poetry fuses intellectual, emotional and aesthetic concerns while developing a shared vocabulary in order to better understand and describe the ways poets utilize wordplay, figurative expression (such as metaphor, synesthesia, and synecdoche), and sonic devices (like rhyme and rhythm) as they transform ordinary language into art. For fiction, we will consider how stories are narrated, their arrangement of time and space, their experiments with point of view, and the ways in which they instantiate character. In the second half of the semester, our perspective will broaden as we look at two case studies.

In literature, Nabokov was faced with charges of obscenity. In photography, Mapplethorpe challenged the role of the visual arts as innocent representation. In film, Riefenstahl blurred the line between art and propaganda by directing for Hitler while Pasolini directed what still remains one of the most shocking films in cinematic history. Through critical writing focused on specific case studies we will inves-tigate such key questions as: Could there be a great work of art that is morally flawed? What is the relationship, if any, between aesthetic and moral values? What, after all, are aesthetic and moral values? Three shorter essays and a longer literary-critical paper are required. Texts may include selections from Plato, David Hume, Vladimir Nabokov, as well as contemporary writers such as Arthur Danto, Berys Gaut, Kendall Walton, and Michael Tanner.Writers on Writing FIRST-"

In this course, students will learn to write the academic essay while reading and analyzing essays, let-ters, interviews, videos, poetry, and fiction about writers and writing. Why do writers write? Where do they get their inspi-ration? Their preparation? Where do they find their models and mentors? What are their various methods? Why do writ-ers not write? What are the responsibilities of the writer? Can writing be dangerous? Can success have its perils? Some possible answers (and further questions) may come from George Orwell, Joan Didion, Toni Morrison, Rainer Maria Rilke, Gustave Flaubert, Haruki Murakami, Edwidge Danticat, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Yiyun Li, Jhumpa Lahiri, James Joyce, Zadie Smith, David Foster Wallace, George Saunders, Lorrie Moore, and Alice Munro. We may attend a reading and a writer or editor may visit.Wilderness and Civilization FIRST-"
UG 357," Wilderness and Civilization Libby Mon, Wed 11:00-12:15 p. 27FIRST- 4 UN Mon, Wed 11:00-12:15 Andrew LibbyIn this seminar we will study a sampling of texts from various fields that deal with the tension between wilderness and civilization and the identities it enables. We will consider how the concept of wilderness sometimes doubles for that of nature in shaping a dynamic identity we call “civilized.” Our studies will draw on insights from biology, ecology, anthro-pology, postcolonial studies, political theory, and literature. We will also engage in experiential learning to ground our studies in practice. We will attempt to respond to such ques-tions as: If wilderness is nature without humans, why are we so irresistibly drawn to it? What function does wilderness serve in our civilized lives? How has it become necessary to our imaginative, spiritual, and political lives? What does an investigation of “wilderness,” “nature,” and “civilization” allow us to express about the world we inhabit? What are the limits of these concepts—what possibilities do they disallow? We will examine these concepts in terms of how they work to create identity for humans, what ways of life they offer, what they obscure. And we’ll look closely at related concepts that structure our sense of ourselves, sometimes without our being wholly conscious of it: What does it mean to be natural, or live a natural lifestyle? Should social organizations follow nature, be “organic,” or go in a different direction? How natural is sex? gender? class? race and ethnicity? How does what we consider “natural” and “unnatural” affect the lifestyle options available to us? Our goal in this seminar is to think through these and related issues and to develop lan-guage that enables us to imagine viable alternative futures.Collage: From Art to Life and Back FIRST-"
UG 361," Collage: From Art to Life and Back Vydrin Mon, Wed 2:00-3:15 p. 27FIRST- 4 UN Mon, Wed 2:00-3:15 Eugene VydrinThis writing seminar will explore the implications of making the new from the ready-made, of constructing one’s own from what was—and remains—somebody else's. Collage aims at reintegrating art and life, so we will examine collage works that comment on existing society, critique its values and forms of representation and demand their revision. By selecting heterogeneous elements from remote areas of cul-ture, high and low, and juxtaposing them on a single plane, collage disrupts conventional associations and traditional narratives, collapses oppositions, scrambles classifications, and levels hierarchies. What new meanings do the fragments and quotations acquire from these radical juxtapositions, and how does their assemblage contest the mythologies of the culture from which they were taken? The class will consist of several case studies in visual and verbal collage placed first-year writing seminars28    Fallin relation to a set of political and aesthetic ideas, which we will derive from a series of theoretical texts. Theorists may include Roland Barthes, Viktor Shklovsky, John Berger, Marjorie Perloff, Rosalind Krauss, Dawn Ades, Peter Bürger, and Dick Hebdige. Collages may include visual artworks by Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, Hannah Höch, Romare Bearden, and Robert Rauschenberg, as well as poetry by T. S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, and Susan Howe.Frankenstein and Revisions FIRST-"
UG 395," Frankenstein and Revisions DeWitt Tue, Thu 11:00-12:15 p. 28FIRST- 4 UN Tue, Thu 11:00-12:15 Anne DeWittMary Shelley’s Frankenstein is not only one of the earliest and most famous works of science fiction, it’s also a story that has been retold many times over. This course focuses on Shelley’s novel and on the novels and films it has inspired: we may consider H. G. Wells’s novel The Island of Doctor Moreau and James Whale’s films Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein. How do later authors and filmmakers retell Shelley’s story? What appeals to them in her novel? What elements of Frankenstein do they retain, what do they alter, and why? Exploring these questions, we will examine how authors from Shelley onwards use the Frankenstein story to engage with contemporary scientific developments; these may include Darwin's theories of human descent, twentieth-century ideas about eugenics, and recent concepts in arti-ficial intelligence. Our thematic focus on revision parallels the writing practices we will develop in the course: just as a novel or film may creatively rewrite and respond to an ear-lier story or scientific idea, so is the academic paper a kind of creative rewriting of and response to another text; just as radical revision enables the novelist or filmmaker to create an original work, so does revising and rewriting one’s own drafts enable the student writer to make an original argu-ment. The course’s assignments aim to help students develop a productive writing practice through short exercises as well as drafts and revisions of three formal papers.Abundance: Thinking, Writing, and Creating In The Age of Plenty FIRST-"

We have some 100,000 words of text pass through our eyes and ears each day (that’s ¼ of War and Peace). We live with an abundance of informa-tion, choices, opportunities, products, texts, and images. Even the city we live in is bursting at the seams. But what is abundance and how do we navigate it ethically, socially, and artistically? This course investigates the history and chang-ing shape of ideas about abundance, from sonnet writing in the Renaissance to twitter feeds today, from Augmented Reality poems and the Digital Humanities to consumerism, overcrowding, and artistic repurposing. Writers we will consider include Kenneth Goldsmith, David Foster Wallace, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Marjorie Perloff, and Walter Benjamin. Photography projects will include Penelope Umbrico’s Flickr Sunsets, Brandon Stanton’s Humans of New York, and Walker Evans’s Many Were Called; Music by Glenn Gould, Sonic Youth, and Jay-Z; Films by Richard Linklater, Sarah Polly, and Bela Tarr. As we examine these materials we will also con-sider the changing shape of the traditional college essay and how to navigate abundance in our own writing. Students will write three short papers and a final critical essay.Musical Subcultures FIRST-"

In this first-year writing seminar, we’ll consider the best ways for music journalists to define and reveal these communities on the page. What exactly defines a subculture, musical or otherwise? What happens when certain sounds are co-opted by the main-stream? As writers, how do we look past preexisting arche-types and our own presumptions regarding certain move-ments and their fans? Do we keep an objective distance or fully submit ourselves to the experience, participating as we document? Students will explore, study, infiltrate, and report on several musical subcultures—web-based or otherwise—of their choosing, submitting four 1,500-2,000 word essays. Readings will include Chuck Klosterman, Joan Didion, John Jeremiah Sullivan, Sara Marcus, Laina Dawes, Kent Russell, and more.Disability Arts & Culture FIRST-"

In this course, we will understand writing as a form of access and we will use many forms of disability art (visual, aural, performative, digital) to develop key modes of textual expression (personal, descriptive, analytical, critical). Over the course of the semester, students will construct rigorous, complicated ideas about disability through a series of essays that will serve as the training ground for critical writing skills. We will consider the work of Judith Scott, Sins Invalid, Kinetic Light, Park McArthur, the Deaf Poets Society, as well as many theoretical and scholarly texts.The Politics of Home: Gender, Race, Class and Kinship FIRST-"
UG 420," The Politics of Home Kennedy Tue, Thu 9:30-10:45 p. 29FIRST- 4 UN Tue, Thu 9:30-10:45 Rosanne KennedyThe premise of this seminar is that the “home” is not prepo-litical or apolitical, in opposition to the public domain, but inextricably linked to the political. Indeed meanings of home saturate—sometimes explicitly, sometimes obliquely—our public discourse and debates. Gender, race, class, and sexu-ality are publically policed and reproduced with reference to normative familial relations and (private) property. Yet domestic spaces and intimate lives can often serve as spaces of relief, refuge, and even political opposition. The home, depending on where one finds oneself situated, can mean wildly different things: prison or refuge, the banal or the aspi-rational. In this course we will read critiques and adulations of the domestic in multiple genres (theoretical, literary, pop-ular) alongside contemporary activist projects and artworks that willfully put the domestic on public display through the use of traditional women’s work (knitting, embroidery, sew-ing). We will ask how different domestic spaces and intimate relations are imagined in opposition (or conjunction) with dominant models. Readings will include Charlotte Gilman Perkins, Betty Friedan, Toni Morrison, bell hooks, Kathleen Stewart, Ann Cvetkovich, David Eng, Juana Maria Rodriguez, and Foucault and artworks by Annette Messager, Marianne Jørgensen, and the Gees Bend Quilters.The History of Orientalism and the Politics of Its Legacy FIRST-"

From the time of Alexander the Great to Marco Polo to Napoleon and Lawrence of Arabia, European scholars, linguists, writers, art-ists, and explorers have depicted the “Orient” as sometimes sophisticated, exotic, mysterious, barbaric, dangerous, or debauched. In doing so, they constructed both a disciplinary field called “Orientalism” as well as a powerful narrative of civilization that pitted “East” against “West.” Using a flexible historical approach, this seminar will explore intellectual and cultural encounters between Europe and the "Orient" from Antiquity to the present. Our main text and guide in this course will be Edward Said’s seminal 1978 book Orientalism. We will also read selections from the field broadly defined as “postcolonialism, which called for a more complex under-standing of how gender, class, power, race, and nationalism shaped the construction and reproduction of knowledge. How do imperialism and knowledge production intersect? Can they be disentangled? Do Orientalist constructs still shape our own understandings of “East” and “West,” and our own production of knowledge, still to this day? In answer-ing these questions, we will engage various texts, including primary sources, non-fiction, literature, and theory. Through these readings, class discussions, and weekly writing exercis-es leading to formal essays, we will explore and write about complex issues of identity, race, exile, multiculturalism, and religious fundamentalism. Readings may also include William Jones, J. S. Mill, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Rudyard Kipling, E. M. Forster, Franz Fanon, Timothy Mitchell, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Gayatri Spivak and Nadia Abu El-Haj.Bedtime Writing: The Literature of Sleep FIRST-"

As the supposed one-third of life we spend unconscious continues to shrink, Caliban’s lament feels more familiar than ever. But current obsessions with the health and productivity conse-quences of our collective sleep debt obscure a much longer tradition of cultural engagement with sleep, one that not only makes space for slumber as more than mere refueling, but also posits a special relationship between writers and sleep. This course aims to recover that secret affinity and plunder its “riches” by studying literary representations of sleep. Expect encounters with sleepwalkers, insomniacs, oneironauts, and other creatures of the night as we ask how sleep—or lack of it—factors in to literary practices. Readings will include fiction (Dickens, Collins, Chekhov, Carver), poetry (Spenser, Coleridge, Tennyson, Thomson), history (Burgess, Dorhn-van Rossum, Ekirch, Moss), philosophy (Schwenger, Turcke, Wortham), psychology (Freud), the sociopolitics of sleep (Derickson, Williams, Wolf-Meyer), and contemporary memoirs of sleeplessness (Butler, Greene).first-year writing seminars30    FallWork, Freedom and Social Change FIRST-"

What counts as work? What can workers do today to maintain and build power? This course explores these three thematic questions through an exploration of the history of workers and their organizations in American history after emancipation. We will explore the history and meaning of class and work and the relationship of work to the state through reading, discussion, and film. We will pay special attention to the ways in which these understandings of class are shaped by gender. Readings include David von Drehle, Bethany Moreton, Selma James, and Wendy Brown.What is Science Fiction? FIRST-"

Is fiction a form of knowledge, and if so how is it different from the sort of knowledge arrived at in the sciences? What is the role of the thought experiment in scientific inquiry? Are artworks thought experiments? The course will explore such questions through a focus on science-fiction as a genre, broadly construed. In addition to reflection on what is meant by "genre," we will consider how science and the scientist are represented in works of fiction, the literature and phi-losophy of artificial intelligence, and the idea of time travel. Students write 3-4 essays making claims and using evidence from works on the syllabus, with emphasis on writing clear prose in support of an original argument. Authors and film-makers may include H.G. Wells , Philip K. Dick, Ursula Le Guin, William Gibson, Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Lucretius, Sigmund Freud, Stanely Kubrick, Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Delaney, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Italo Calvino, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Alan Turing, Jonathan Lethem, Ridley Scott and George Lucas. Throughout the semester we will also consult Verlyn Klinkenborg’s Several Short Sentences About Writing as a style guide, with the aim of writing graceful, persuasive essays.Fictions on the Record: Journalism, Literature, and Their Claims to Truth FIRST-"

But journalistic texts are rarely granted the same transcendence. How, then, can journalism be read as literature? This seminar examines the relationship between journalism and literature in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. Coursework is cen-tered on the following questions: what claims to truth are at work in narrative fiction versus journalistic storytelling? Are certain kinds of fictional and nonfictional accounts better positioned than others to take up political, aesthetic, and philosophical concerns? How have literature and journalism historically interacted with, and reacted to, each other? For the final paper, students will produce a critical analysis of a nonfiction text, incorporating scholarly sources. Shorter writ-ing assignments will encourage students to experiment with the narrative styles we encounter, and to reflect critically on how their own writing constructs its particular claims to truth. Readings may include excerpts from the work of: Joan Didion, Ellen Willis, John McPhee, Gabriel García Márquez, Joe Sacco, Elias Khoury, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Rodolfo Walsh, Truman Capote, Oliver Sacks, Francisco Goldman, Elena Poniatowska, and Óscar Martínez.Welcome to the Desert of the Real: Text, Image, Film FIRST-"

What is the relationship between language and reality? How do different genres and media represent the world around us? How do visual and linguistic representations mediate our understanding of the “true” and the “real?” We will begin the course by examin-ing key philosophical works by Plato and Karl Marx. We will then discuss how writers associated with disparate aesthetic movements such as realism, surrealism, and magical real-ism claimed to present and define reality. We will probe deeply into the category of everyday life to explore questions relating to race, gender, and the experience of modern life. Lastly, we will consider the force of the photographic image and assess its relationship to evidence, truth, and reality. Here, our primary texts will include works of photography and commercial advertisements. This is a writing intensive seminar that will help you discover your critical voice as an academic writer. Students will explore all aspects of the writing process through semi-weekly assignments designed to facilitate engagement with course readings and develop critical writing skills.first-year writing seminars2018 31Pilgrimage, Road Stories and Travel Narratives from the Past to the Present FIRST-"
UG 432," Pilgrimage, Road Stories and Travel Narratives  Lee Mon, Wed 2:00-3:15 p. 31FIRST- 4 UN Mon, Wed 2:00-3:15 Michelle LeeTravel writing is a fascinating and diverse genre that has pro-liferated from antiquity to the twenty-first century. It appeals to many people for a variety of reasons: it introduces us to new people and places; it often features vivid and appeal-ing prose; it offers insight into the way people make sense of their real-life experiences; and it inspires us to daydream about our own travels. In this course, we will study travel writing by discussing each text’s authorial personae, context, narrative structure as well as intended audiences, and evalu-ate the writing through the lens of some potent critiques of travel writing and tourism. Sources of study include European Romantic travel writing by canonical writers such as Gerard Nerval and Gustave Flaubert, Jamaica Kincaid’s A Small Place, travel photography by Maxime Du Camp and excerpts from  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s novel Americanah. Throughout the course, we will consider the following questions: Who is telling these road stories? Why? At what type of audience are these stories directed? How can we tell? What are we meant to learn about the people, places, and journeys they describe? How do these texts invite us to make sense of the world? How do the authors shape meaning through their use of language? What anxieties, desires, and visions of selfhood do they project?Science/Fiction FIRST-"

The course will revolve around two main themes. First, we will examine scientific inaccuracy for the sake of entertainment—how works of science fiction and sensationalist online news sites manipulate scientific facts to leave a more spectacular impression. Second, we will look at the portrayal of physics to the general public in works of popular science—how writers balance the intricacies of expounding advanced and often mathematically based subject matter with the simplicity and clarity necessary for general comprehension. Together, we will investigate wheth-er missing information can sometimes serve as a better educational tool than the full story. How much information is necessary for understanding? Must we always sacrifice accuracy in the name of accessibility? And what is at stake when we do? By reading, analyzing, and discussing a range of sources with different goals and audiences, we will learn how to express technical ideas selectively, succinctly, and engagingly in writing.Literary Transformations from Ovid to the Present FIRST-"
UG 434," Literary Transformations from Ovid to the Present Squitieri Tue, Thu 2:00-3:15 p. 31FIRST- 4 UN Tue, Thu 2:00-3:15 Christina SquitieriFrom the first century CE when the Roman poet Ovid wrote his Metamorphoses, writers have been fascinated with the idea of transformation. From the most mythic creation sto-ries to gender transformation and fluidity to the way authors “transform” an experience into literature, “transformation” has proven to be an enduring and flexible theme across the literary world. Beginning with selections from Ovid, this course will chart transformation across poetry, prose, and drama. Readings may include Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the anonymous Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, John Lyly’s pas-toral drama Gallathea, Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, sections from T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, and Anne Carson’s Autobiography of Red, as well as some theories on the construction of identity and its malleability. What does it mean to become someone or something else, especially when “becoming” that person is beyond your control? What writing techniques do authors use to express the way trans-formation effects relationships, character growth, and the world around them? How are previous stories “transformed” through rewriting, and how does the writing process “trans-form” history? As a course devoted to writing and the writing process, this class will explore these texts by thinking criti-cally about how and for what purpose authors use “transfor-mation” in their writing while focusing on transforming our own writing along the way.Money and Literature, Capital Fictions FIRST-"

Stories of coming home document the urgency with which we attempt to remember the past in the aftermath of trauma and invest specific places, or “sites of memory,” with the power of recall. Our class will investigate the linkages between identity and place as they are imagined in the aftermath of historical trauma in film, literature, and theory as well as practices including reparations and genealogy. The ways in which con-temporary narratives treat the theme of coming home across boundaries of time and space and the role this idea plays in the construction of ethnic, racial, and national identities will serve as the impetus for frequent exploratory writing, formal essays, and a research paper. Readings will include selections from trauma theory, memory studies, fiction, and memoir by Svetlana Boym, Andreas Huyssen, Nadine Fresco, Phil Klay, Toni Morrison, Louise Erdrich, and Jonathan Safran Foer, among others.Popular Religion and Popular Culture in North America FIRST-"

In this course, we study and write about ways in which film, television, advertising, music, sports, politics, and the news media present, negoti-ate, and affect religious issues, and, conversely, how religion changes popular culture. We “read” primary texts of popu-lar religion and popular culture, such as television shows, exercise classes, music videos, baseball and video games, as well as theoretical works by Peter Williams, Kate McCarthy, Eric Mazur, Susan Mizruchi, and Richard Santana. Students are encouraged to explore topics of their own interests, and assignments include reaction papers, various essay forms, and a final research projects.La Mode: Fashioning Modernity FIRST-"

To what extent do changing fashions not only reflect but also factor in the formation and transforma-tion of cultures? Students in this course will develop their understanding of and capacity to engage in interdisciplin-ary research through the study of a tradition of writing on fashion that dates back to the early nineteenth century, and that encompasses journalism, aesthetics, sociology, psycho-analysis, political economy, and philosophy. Over the course of the semester students will be introduced to a wide range of authors, texts, intellectual traditions, and theoretical approaches to the study of fashion, as well as to contempo-rary issues bearing on the clothed body in both Western and non-Western contexts. In addition to encouraging students to think critically about the place and function of fashion in modern life, the course assignments aim help them to develop the ability to address complex questions with both clarity and substance, to craft well-constructed and compel-ling arguments, and to recognize and assess the different methods employed and types of claim advanced by scholars working in various disciplines. Readings will include texts by Honoré de Balzac, Roland Barthes, Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Caroline Evans, Kennedy Fraser, Anne Hollander, Joan Wallach Scott, and Thorstein Veblen, among others.transfer student research seminars34    FallSOPHOMORES ONLYDiscourses of Love: Antiquity to the RenaissanceIDSEM-"

Through a study of philosophy, poetry, drama, religion, art, and music we will endeavor to discourse on the meaning of this profound emotion. However, in order to understand the place of love within the lives of humans in the west, we need to look at love in its historic, cultural, social, and politi-cal contexts from Sappho and Plato to Shakespeare, while also considering non-Western influences. We want to con-sider Love's multiple roles with regard to desire, seduction, betrothal, marriage, manners, morals, political power, and the pursuit of wisdom, as well as its role in class, gender, and race. Possible readings could include Plato’s Symposium, the poetry of Sappho, the stories of Marie de France, selections from Dante, the Italian comic play, The Deceived, as well as plays of Shakespeare.Art in Critical Theory IDSEM- Discourses of LoveIDSEM- Discourses of LoveIDSEM- Discourses of LoveIDSEM-"

Theory and critique are not only expected from so-called “serious artists”, both are also being produced and consumed at rapid rates by students, established artists, historians, critics, etc. This course will begin with a brief look at the foundations of criti-cal theory, and move onto the primary aim of studying the development of critical theory in the field of art. Emphasis will be placed on addressing what it means to be “critical” and how critical theory has been used in the writings and artworks by artists such as Yvonne Rainer, Hans Haake, Mary Kelly, Thomas Lawson, Dan Graham, and Andrea Fraser. These artists have integrated writing/theorizing with creating artworks, and continue to do so with persistence and rigor. In addition to investigating the emergence and impact of critical theory in the field of Art, students will be challenged to make theory into action: to theorize.SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS ONLYFinance for Social Theorists IDSEM- Art in Critical TheoryIDSEM-"

For instance, the effects of the financial crisis continue to be felt today and have a significant bearing upon us all. This seminar aims to provide students with conceptual, interpretive and analytical tools to understand finance. The approach is interdisciplinary and interpretive, drawing upon political theory, economics, psychology, basic statistics, financial theory and accounting. For example, we use the subprime crisis to explore core concepts associated with credit, banking, business ethics, monetary policy and macro economics. We reference key ideas from classic texts and also take up contemporary debates in finance. The aim is to help students become more literate and numerate as economic and social agents.

The tension between free expression and social control has shadowed the Great American Conversation since the birth of this country. The constitutional ideal that our government "shall make no law" abridging free speech has given way, in fact, to laws that limit discussion, ostensibly for the public good. Likewise, new media technologies advance our ability to access and exchange ideas and information, but raise new questions as to the limits of such dialogue. This course, then, addresses the delicate balance between free speech and democracy, guided by seminal readings from Milton, Locke, Meikeljohn, among others, as well as important Supreme Court decisions that have critically shaped First Amendment rights in regard to hate speech, pornography, corporate control of mass media, the student press and the rights of journalists. The course also takes a case-study approach to issues related to free speech in wartime and political crisis, a tension made evident in recent debates over privacy rights and national security. With this foundation, we ask: Are there any forms of free speech that should be restricted? If so, which? And, who should decide?The Darwinian Revolution IDSEM- Free Speech & DemocracyIDSEM-"

This interdisciplinary seminar explores children and child-hood in the United States from two vantage points—those of public policy makers and of parents. In what ways does public policy shape children’s lives? What historical trends influence the ways that people parent? What happens when parents disagree with laws or conventions regarding how to parent? The first half of the course examines common conceptualizations of the child figure historically and today. While all children possess some universal characteristics that transcend time, place and personal circumstance, we can also understand the contemporary child figure to be a social construction, with “childhood” as we know it emerg-ing as a coherent life stage only in the past few centuries. Public policy—laws about healthcare, education and labor, in particular—have both shaped and responded to these con-ceptualizations of childhood. The second half of the course examines children as members of families. Just as we can understand the symbolic child figure as a social construction, interdisciplinary seminars38    Fallso we will see that race, class, gender and sexual orientation are key factors influencing the lived experiences of actual children and their parents. Additionally, we will examine how the proscribed “best methods” of child-rearing seem to change continuously—parents who consult various “experts” often receive contradictory advice. Works we may engage include Guggenheim's What's Wrong with Children's Rights?, Lareau's Unequal Childhoods, Postman’s Disappearance of Childhood, and the photography of Sally Mann. By the end of the course, we should have deeper understandings of child-hood as a social construction, of the debates surrounding some of the issues that society currently deems relevant to children, and of differing child-rearing practices that parents employ.Alchemy and the Transformation of Self IDSEM- Cultural Politics ChildhoodIDSEM-"

We explore the etymology of the word‘transformation’ and ask ourselves why humans have invoked the ecstasies and agonies of the process to explore the breadth and depth of the human psyche as it moves toward greater degrees of consciousness of self and world. We answer these questions by tracing the ancient science of alchemical transformation from its roots in the Stone Age, through the Eastern spiritual practices of China and India, into the embalming practices of ancient Egypt and the astrological symbol system of the Greeks, culminating in the work of C.G. Jung who discovered the ancient art of alchemy as the philosophical antecedent and language to his own transformational psychology, and so introducing the ancient art into the post modern world. The course culminates in The Alchemy Project where students will have the opportunity to experience transformation in thier own lives. Readings include: Eliade’s The Forge and the Crucible; Edward Edinger’s Anatomy of the Psyche; Stan Marlan’s Black Sun; Edinger’s Mystery of the Coniunctio; selections from The Alchemy Reader and Splendor Solis; and readings from the Buddha, Freud, Jung and Hillman.Mad Science/Mad Pride IDSEM- Alchemy & TransformationIDSEM-"

The pragmatists are concerned with action in the world, to address “the problems of men and women.” They construct a philosophy for understanding and guiding that action. That philosophy values imaginative vision and exploratory experimentation. It looks forward to the new rather than dwelling on explain-ing, justifying, or condemning what exists. Pragmatism, like classical political theory, is concerned with politics as a way of achieving a good society, in which people can lead good lives. It does not view politics narrowly in terms only of elec-tions and governments. Reading pragmatism as philosophy, in the first half of the course we will consider ethics, theory of knowledge, theory of science and social science, and put these in the service of democratic theory. Through the lens of the “Dewey-Lippmann controversy” we will consider the capacity of citizens for informed responsible participation. In the second half of the course we will consider demo-cratic experiments: economic democracy, civic journalism, progressive education, participatory action research, and conflict resolution.

Ancient to modern writers have been fascinated with the power of art, and for each, ideas about art are con-nected to those about language and society. Our reading of Ion and Gorgias will look at Plato's ideas on art, rhetoric (oratory), and power before his Republic. Phaedrus, written later, develops Plato's ideas about the relation of the intel-lect, the emotions, and the appetites. Diderot's Rameau's Nephew revisits some of Plato's themes from the perspec-tive of the eighteenth century and the changing world of the Enlightenment. Finally, we will explore dialogue form in the twentieth century through Virginia Woolf's novel Between the Acts and Tom Stoppard's play Arcadia.

Literary works from ancient tragedy to the modern novel thematize guilt in various ways. Freud places it at the center of his practice and his theory of mind. While law seems reliant mainly upon a formal attribution of guilt in order to determine who gets punished and to what degree, we might also suggest it relies upon “guilty subjects” for its operation. With all of these different deployments of the concept, we might agree it is a central one, yet how to define it remains a substantial ques-tion. Is the prominence of guilt in modern Western culture a vestige of a now-lost religious world? Is it, as Nietzsche suggests, an effect of “the most profound change man ever experienced when he finally found himself enclosed within the wall of society and of peace?” Freud seems to concur when he argues that guilt must be understood as a kind of internal self-division where aggressivity is turned against the self. Is guilt a pointless self-punishment, meant to discipline us? Or does it continue to have an important relation to the ethical? Readings may include Freud, Nietzsche, Foucault, Slavoj Zizek, Toni Morrison, Ursula LeGuin, W.G.

Jamaica Kincaid once said, “I now consider anger as a badge of honor. [It is] the first step to claiming yourself.” Anger, rather than Betty Friedan’s “problem that has no name,” has haunted the life of many women whose negotiations of the meaning of gender, race and sexuality are marked by the violence of colonial-imperial encounters. Accordingly, this course examines the following questions: How have colonial-imperial encounters shaped the imagination of gender, race and sexuality? How have women built feminist solidarities amidst, or perhaps based on, the shared experience of violence and anger? In turn, how has the imagination of gender, race and sexuality redefined the histories of colonies and empires? To pursue these questions, course readings include literary and other scholarly texts engaging feminist and postcolonial theory. Readings range from Kincaid’s The Autobiography of My Mother and Rigoberta Menchú’s I, Rigoberta Menchu: An Indian Woman in Guatemala to other texts by scholars like Uma Narayan, Patricia Mohammed, Vandana Shiva, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Ann Stoler.Reading the Faces of Ancient Cultures IDSEM- Feminism, EmpireIDSEM- Feminism, EmpireIDSEM-"

We begin by linking modern ethnographic writing to early travel nar-ratives, to missionary accounts, and to colonial reports serving evolving imperial formations. We then examine the consolidation of an "ethnographic" perspective in the emerging discipline of anthropology, as well as more recent critiques of this genre. Our own method is reading classic and contemporary ethnographic works. These reveal ongo-ing tensions between the scientific and the literary; between abstract "theory" and ethnographic "practice;" and between the claim to truth-telling and the power and limits linked to the positioning of the author. In response to these ten-sions we also trace the textual experimentation that mixes ethnography, poetry, memoir, and travel writing, fiction, and film. Our goal is to develop a self-reflective ethnographic 2018 41interdisciplinary seminarsimagination, open to the possibilities and difficulties in cross-cultural understanding, as we consider the complexities in encounter and contact, looking and describing, representing and translating.

Increasingly, global economic shifts have made it possible for some developing countries to engage in patterns of consumption similar to those in the West, such that one quarter of humanity now belongs to the “global consumer class.” At the same time, however, nearly three billion people struggle to survive on less than $2 a day. This course takes an international and interdisciplinary approach to examine consumption in dif-ferent societies, and we do so by asking several central questions: What are the key determinants of patterns of consumption, and how are they changed or reshaped over time? In turn, how do patterns of consumption shape class formation, racial inequality, identity, aesthetic sensibility, and international boundaries? How do practices of consumption inform the ways in which people understand their values and individuality, imagine success and failure, or conceive happiness? By reading widely in sociology, anthropology, and history we will develop a framework for analyzing the ethical, environmental and social justice implications of consumer-ism. Readings include case studies from the US, China, India, Europe and Africa Some likely authors include: Keynes, Marx, Marcuse, Benjamin, Mary Douglas, Bill McKibben; Arlie Hochschild, Lizabeth Cohen.Domesticating the Wild in Children's LiteratureIDSEM-"

From Little Red Ridinghood to Peter and the Wolf to Charlotte’s Web, the border between the child and the wild is a rite of passage marking the trans-formation of the child into an adult, and is the site of a child’s most fundamental education about how to be human. Works of children’s literature agree that literature can be used to explicitly structure the relationship between children and the wild, and construct subjectivities by nurturing a deeper awareness of what that relationship should be. Yet, what, exactly, is the wild in children’s literature? Representations of the wild reflect adult ideas about children—do they have a privileged relationship to nature, and innate understanding of the connection between humans and the world around them? Or are they wild things themselves, in need of tem-plates for human/humane behavior toward other beings? Representations of the wild are also informed by ideology, shaped by societal ideas about race and gender, domination and subjection, power and privilege. In this course we will be thinking and writing about the surprising ways that children's texts imagine the wild as a charged cultural, political and racialized space, and how these texts imagine and construct subjectivities based on these relations of power.

As a signifying system in its own right, fashion contributes to the semiotics of popular forms. It can also operate as a means of authentication (especially in period films and TV) or reveal a variety of ways in which media plays with space and time, purposeful or not. Besides evoking specific temporalities and narrative tone, fashion plays an important role in the construction of gender, both in terms of representation and address. This course will examine the his-tory of the intersection of the fashion and media industries from the free distribution of film-related dress patterns in movie theaters of the 1910s to the current trend for make-over TV, networks like the Style network, the increasing proliferation of fashion blogs and the construction of spe-cifically feminine video games.

All its parts are connected to one another, and goods, people, culture, and information can move from one place to another, seemingly without barriers. Yet how new is this phenomenon? Scholars have pointed to the middle of the sixteenth century as the moment when the economy became global, and the age of exploration and colonization began to connect many parts of the world to each other in a complex network that included cooperation, piracy, and slavery. This course will explore the emergence of a global consciousness in the early modern period. Our primary questions include: to what extent did people in this century begin to imagine and experience the world globally (that is, as an entity whose regions were interdependent rather than separate)? Does the change in understanding of the world vary by region, by class, ethnicity, gender, or religion? How did globalization influence cultural devel-opments? What influence did global encounters have on European identities—for example on ideas about, and expe-riences of, gender, sexuality, class religion, and citizenship? Was the global economy seen as cooperative or competi-tive? To answer these questions, we will consider how the attempts to create, and the struggle to understand, this global world produced new narratives and forms of interdis-ciplinary thinking. In order to see how the issues surrounding globalization as we understand them today have a long and complex history, we will also study works that put the past in present in conversation with each other. We will investigate a wide variety of primary works, such as travel narratives, plays, poems, early forms of ethnography, films, engravings, and globes, as well as secondary works by literary scholars, anthropologists, and historians of labor, the economy, and science. While the focus is on the “European” and emerg-ing “American” perspective, we will also read several works that challenge the Eurocentric view of globalization that was emerging and still dominates much of contemporary dis-course of globalization.Politics, Writing and the Nobel Prize in Latin America IDSEM- Becoming "Global"IDSEM- Becoming "Global"IDSEM-"

Together, they give us a chance to consider some of the major literary and political movements in Latin America lead-ing up to the present. Through novels and autobiography, Asturias and Menchú explore very different aspects of the indigenous struggle in Guatemala; the poetry of Mistral and Neruda reveals the successive influences of surrealism, com-munism, and feminism, up to the eve of the Pinochet coup in Chile; the novels of García Márquez in Colombia and Vargas Llosa in Peru embody tensions between realism and magical realism; and Paz, in Mexico, in his poetry and essays, repre-sents a country that has been a literary cornerstone of Latin America. We will look at these authors in the context of the history, politics, and anthropology of their respective coun-tries, and conclude by considering a few authors who did not get the prize but were equally deserving,such as Jorge Luis Borges and Roberto Bolaño.What is Critique?

What is theory’s relationship to praxis and to politics, and what kind of theory or practice is critique? The seminar begins with a consideration of the uneasy place of critique in the western philosophical tradition. We will read Kant, Marx, Foucault, Asad, Mahmood and Moten among interdisciplinary seminars44    Fallothers, in order to establish a sense of how critique emerges as a mode of radical questioning, an art of unsettling self-evident answers and interfering with established relations of power. We will consider what the practice of critique entails, and what it means to suggest, as these authors do, that critique interrogates the historically specific relationships between power, truth and the subject. Together we will ask after the conditions of what can and cannot be thought or said, and how these conditions tend to shape our formation as political subjects.

The art and science of conservation biology brings together leading thinking from biology, economics, anthro-pology, psychology, literature, art, and communications to conserve the diversity of life found on our planet. The field-work of the physical and biological sciences provides the foundation from which our work as conservation biologists proceeds. However, the applied work of the social sciences, education, business, humanities and arts then serve as the tools we need to manage ourselves and create a relationship with nature that is mutually supportive. In this class we will discover how biologists, business leaders, financial institu-tions, entrepreneurs, social scientists, and artists all play an integral role in creating and delivering practical conservation solutions. We will begin with an exploration of our own rela-tionship to the natural world. We then examine what biologi-cal diversity is, the principal threats to biological systems, and specific actions that are being taken to reverse these threats and protect life on earth. We also explore the premise that “managing” the ecology of the planet really requires us to manage ourselves, and the human cultures we have created. Students will be required to research and share their lessons learned around a selected conservation biology topic, and complete a practical project that demonstrates how each of us can make a difference in strengthening our relationship to nature. At the course conclusion students from all disciplines should see a role for themselves in the conservation work that is an essential focus for this century. Course research will include Sodhi and Erlich’s Conservation Biology for All, Gary Snyder’s The Practice of the Wild, and selected readings from a wide variety of peer reviewed science journals and popular publications.Good Design: Objects, Bodies, Buildings, CitiesIDSEM- Bridging Culture & NatureIDSEM-"

Although we engage the designed environment every day, non-special-ists have few ways to make sense of the myriad decisions that come together to form things and places. Through a combi-nation of reading, drawing, writing, and model-making, this course asks students to examine the complex intersections between analyzing existing designs and creating new work. One central question is whether design principles that oper-ate at a small scale, say the scale of a hand-held object, are also appropriate at a larger scale, like the scale of human habitation. The course uses scale as a lens through which to engage this question, as readings and projects consider the design of something you can hold (such as a tool), the design of something that can hold the body (such as cloth-ing or furniture), and something that can be inhabited (such interdisciplinary seminars2018 45as a dwelling).

While some argue that art is autonomous from ethics, others insist that ethics is a necessary component of art and of one’s aesthetic judgment of the work. This course explores the various positions that have been taken in this debate and raises several key questions: Can art be morally enlightening and, if so, how? If a work of art is morally better, does that make it better as art? Is morally deficient art to be shunned, or even censored? Do subjects of artworks have rights as to how they are represented? Do artists have duties as artists and duties as human beings, and if so, to whom? How much tension is there between the demands of art and the demands of life? These questions will be examined through the lens of painting (Rembrandt, Picasso), cinema (Pasolini, Reed, Griffith), photography (Mann, Mapplethorpe) and literature (Nabokov) with readings drawn from Hume, Plato, Tolstoy, Wilde, Nussbaum, Danto, as well as other con-temporary philosophers, artists, and critics.Minds and Bodies: A History of NeuroscienceIDSEM- Art and EthicsIDSEM-"

In 1903, at the dawn of the commercial music industry, sociologist W. E. B. DuBois famously proclaimed that the foremost problem in twentieth century American society is “the problem of the color line.” Du Bois’s prescience sets the stage for this course’s exploration of racial identity in recorded, commercially available music. We will examine how racial performance has intermingled with music con-sumption in the United States since blackface minstrelsy in the 1830s. Our goal is to understand how deeply embedded race—both ascribed and claimed—is in American music cul-ture, reverberating throughout the last century in debates on artists’ authenticity, propriety, and popularity. This course is organized chronologically; each week is devoted to a par-ticular era and its corresponding musical genres leading up to the present. With the rising importance of visual media since the mid-20th century, a historically informed understanding of the confluences of race and ethnicity in American music culture through music media and technologies will offer an enhanced understanding of the past and our contemporary, internet-driven musical landscape.What is Post-structuralism?

In this course, we'll investi-gate some of the thinkers associated with post-structuralism and discover, perhaps, that all of these designators apply. Post-structuralism emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is associated with writers as diverse and complicated as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and Julia Kristeva. We might say that post-struc-turalism is what happens when structuralist thought collides with aspects of the "Continental" tradition in philosophy. If the central claim of  structuralism is that all systems of meaning are structured along the lines of language, post-structuralist thought interrogates that claim. But rather than rejecting it outright, post-structuralist thinkers attend to the ways in which systems of meaning tend to instability, contingency, opening up gaps and silences, leaving echoes and traces. In the first part of this course, we'll focus on some of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophers who influenced the post-structuralist turn: Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Blanchot. In the second part of the course, we'll read some works of major post-structuralist thinkers. Finally, in the third part of the course, we'll spend some time looking at the impact of this general tendency in thought and the way in which it has influenced contemporary writers in politi-cal theory, gender studies and media studies.

We begin by reviewing classical and contemporary formulations of what democracy is, for what can be called liberal, delib-erative, communitarian, and agonistic approaches entail very definitions of democracy, contrasting senses of its dangers and possibilities, as well as divergent visions of citizenship and public life, political culture and modernity. Then we con-sider these approaches in relation to the issue of difference: how do they explain and address the persistence of racialized and gendered forms of inequality in regimes committed to formal and legal equality? Why are formally democratic soci-eties typically characterized by intense struggle over issues of identity and difference, not only race, gender, and sexuality, but also immigration? Our seminar concludes by explor-ing the relation between democratic regimes and empire, state violence, and national security: how does "democracy" become the name for a regime engaged in permanent war, torture, surveillance of citizens, and suspension of civil liber-ties?interdisciplinary seminars2018 47Justice, Tragedy and Philosophy: Politics in Ancient Greece IDSEM- Democracy & DifferenceIDSEM-"

In each instance we ask how photography shapes what becomes visible or legible as violence, and what kinds of suffering—and what modes of resistance—move different spectators affectively, ethically, and politically. The seminar will rely on key theoretical works on photography as well as more recent critical interventions that help us reckon the use of surveillance and its neoliberal logics (Cole, Farocki, Steyerl, Weizman). How might the ubiquity of cameras inure or blind us to photography’s work?

Yet, it is more unusual to study Proust as a poet, or for his impact on modern poetry. In this course, therefore, we begin our study of the presentation and importance of the senses in modern poetry with Proust (via portions of In Search of Lost Time). Proust will then serve as prelude to our examination of the various ways that modern poets respond to, follow, and reach beyond him in their use and portrayal of the senses (and, by extension, time and memory).

Attention will be paid to histories and legacies of colonialism alongside novel forms of gov-ernance and claims to the city. Though focused primarily on cities in the global South, the class is intended to probe how these cities reconfigure conventional understandings of being a citizen in the city (anywhere), and will also examine the global South within the ‘North’.

These ideas became crucially important throughout Europe, influenced in part by their trade within the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East, and form the basis of contemporary attitudes on style, manners, and fashion. This class will explore these key ideas through the perspective of their impact on gender, status, power, identity, and the position of the other. We will read primary texts from the Renaissance about self-fashioning, good manners, and dress in Europe and non-European coun-tries, literary texts that give us dramatic representations of the importance of decorous behavior and style as well as visual representations of attire from the period.

Starting from a shared interest in the body by artists and filmmakers in the 1970s and 1980s, our thematic survey extends from prehis-tory to the present, while focusing on marginalized artistic periods such as the medieval and baroque. What meanings have been attributed to body horror and how have they changed? What purposes has horror served, especially in dis-enfranchising women; sexual, racial, and ethnic minorities; the disabled and physically different? Readings draw on phi-losophy, sociology, anthropology, sociology, psychoanalysis, and literature as well as art history and cinema studies. These theories will help us to understand contemporary artworks (by artists such as Robert Gober, Paul McCarthy, Kiki Smith, Kara Walker) and films (by Tod Browning, David Cronenberg, Stuart Gordon, Ridley Scott, and others).Social Theory and Curatorial Practice IDSEM- Body Art, Body HorrorIDSEM-"

Through the use of legal cases, law review articles and contemporary analyses and critiques, the course will expose students to the ways that race has shaped the criminal law and its administration. The goal of the course is to explore both the historical and contemporary treatment of race in the United States by the courts, policy-makers and to examine the construction of race as a concept and identity in the law. Students will gain a basic understanding of legal decision-making at the various discretionary points in the criminal process and how race informs the exercise of discretion.Food and Nature in Cities IDSEM-"

How did these men define their kingship and communicate their power to their subjects, rivals, and allies? In this class, we address these questions, concentrating in particular on the role of visual material in the construction and maintenance of the image of kingship in the ancient Near East (an artifi-cial, modern category that encompasses many millennia of diverse civilizations in and around the region of the modern Middle East). Working primarily with archaeological mate-rial and with pieces of art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we think about how ancient kings and their courts used images to assert the king’s right and worthiness to rule, to attest to his character, and to describe the extent of his power. We consider, too, the legacies of individual kings and how successors—ancient and modern—have responded to them. And we look at the evidence for women in and around positions of power. Monuments from the following cultures will be our focus: Early Dynastic, Akkadian, Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, Achaemenid Persian.Postcolonial Theory and Visual Culture IDSEM- Kings and KingshipIDSEM- Kings and KingshipIDSEM- Kings and KingshipIDSEM-"

Drawing from black studies, cultural studies, performance studies and sexuality studies, the seminar is aggressively interdisciplinary—be prepared to critically engage history, literature, philosophy, art, music and film texts—and rather eclectic. We will wend our way through topics as varied as fugitive slave laws and avant-garde jazz, black existential-ism and afrofuturism, Afropunk, Pariah and The Brother from Another Planet as we analyze works by Bruce Nugent, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Thelonious Monk, James Baldwin, Amiri Baraka, Sun Ra, Samuel R Delany, Octavia Butler and Audre Lorde.

To better posit the Great Plague (and its recurrences) as an early confrontation with the hazards of globalization, we immerse ourselves in Renaissance texts to explore the tropes of the invisible enemy, the wrath of God, the psyche of hysteria, the fear of the other, of the intruder, of the undesired. The effects of this catastrophe on the social fabric of the communities it touched were not only pervasive but enduring; so were the psychic wounds it inflicted. Faced with such traumas, intellectuals and artists felt compelled to fully measure the effects of the plague, as well as compre-hend its deep philosophical and moral consequences. This initial investigation into early modern reactions to epidemics propels us in the second half of the semester into a study of current responses to infectious diseases, mainly through literary representations of current pandemics: AIDS, Sars, Ebola, and Zika; we also look at hypothetical diseases that operate as thought experiments. We will consider a wide set of questions: What kind of art do epidemics provoke into being? How do diseases shape social and state structures? When weighed against individual liberties, what kind of ethi-cal concerns should attend the elaboration of policies such as quarantine, scapegoating, contagion containment? How does disease mediate the relationship between society, the individual, and the family? Why does humor play such a fash-ioning role in the representation of epidemics?Spaces of Early Modern Science IDSEM- Plagues, EpidemicsIDSEM- Plagues, EpidemicsIDSEM-"

New technology was tested in courts, nature was replicated in the workshop, and public dissections began to be conducted in universities. How did such spaces delineate new understandings of science through the formalization of practice or the privileging of observation? How did they contribute to the formulation and transmission of scientific knowledge? This course takes as its subject the emergence of these kinds of spaces, considering the library, the labora-tory, the botanical garden, the anatomy theater, the obser-vatory, the workshop, the utopian space, and the space of the unknown.

This course allows us an opportunity to think about the ways race is framed through the lens of a camera. Our interest in race and photography is primarily American in context, dating from the early twentieth century through the pres-ent day, and principally photojournalistic and documentary in form. We explore key moments in American history, as well as seminal photos, as we consider the politics and ethics of representation. Through sociological, historical, and journalistic prisms, we examine, for instance, slave and lynching imagery, documentation and even propaganda around certain ethnic populations in the US, and coverage of the Civil Rights Movement. Ultimately, we progress right to the contemporary moment, with discussion of race and the photographic image in the age of social media. We also consider American coverage of peoples abroad, typically in war-based settings, as we extend our political and social dis-cussions both geographically and conceptually. Throughout we ask, how have photographers reinforced or contested prevailing views of racial identity through the photographic form? And how are viewers influenced by these portrayals of race? Readings include theory and critical essays, as well as literary, journalistic, and historical accounts, and we will be looking at—and learning to read closely—a lot of pho-tography. Authors may include: Frederick Douglass, Marita Sturken, Martin Berger, and Susan Sontag. Students write response papers and longer essays, will take trips to galler-ies and photo institutes, and can produce a visual project of their own.

First Class: Sept. 5; Last Class: Oct. 17.One of the most distinctive dimensions of contemporary glo-balization has been the flourishing of transnational activism. Causes, organizations and activist networks have crossed borders alongside capital, goods and labor to reshape the ter-rain of political engagement. In some cases the campaigners are crossing borders, in other cases local activists are trans-lating their issues into a register that can travel. This class examines the intended and unintended consequences of this turn to transnational activism in relation to the political subjectivities it calls forth, the political horizons it shapes and the global governance regimes it legitimizes. The course will focus on human rights and humanitarian initiatives, including transantionational campaigns (such as campaigns to ‘Save girls from Boko Haram’ or 'End sweatshops in Bangladesh'). In studying the work of international institutions (be it non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International or multilateral institutions such as the International Criminal Court), we will also look at the new constellations of state-actors, international agencies and civil society that have come together in invoking the language of human rights in the name of agendas such as democracy promotion or end-ing poverty. Reading important critical interventions of the last decade, the class will collectively analyze how different approaches mobilize and challenge different actors, causes and alternative imaginings of 'the global'.

As site artists confront the matrix of social forces, changing political policies and overlapping communities that relate to a given site, their aes-thetics, creative process and goals have shifted. How are they blurring the lines between art and activism, art and urban renewal, art and real life? This arts workshop will emphasize making site work by completing a progressive series of stud-ies, using various artistic mediums. We will also be reading about and viewing site work by seminal artists in this field.

We will read food journalism, personal essays, humor, cookbook excerpts, blogs, philosophy and poetry. The course will be evenly divided between close, critical reading and discussion of various food writers' work, and experimenting with several forms of food writing our-selves.

But what about when adults play? Through play we find our freedom, spontane-ity, and our aesthetic. What is there in human beings that enables us to play? Why is play considered an innate capac-ity of people from the beginning of recorded history? What qualifies as play? When does play become art? In this course, everyone plays and in doing so examines the historic and contemporary uses of play as a potentially universal impulse of humans, across generations, time and space. Play’s capac-ity to create and sustain community will be considered. We will examine play as it is reflected through theories of child development, dramatic improvisation, fine art, politics, social construction and identities, music, religion and spirituality, literature and social media. Students will examine the neces-sity of play in their own child and adult lives—the creative spirit, the adventurer, the empathic connection with human-ity, and laughter, too.

The class will read and discuss a variety of texts that center around various modes of culture crossing, such as travel and study abroad; immigration, exile, expatria-tion and repatriation; third culture and diaspora identities; and historical clashes and conflicts. Through an ongoing examination of structural and craft issues in the exemplary texts, students will make creative decisions to help write three main assignments dealing with themes of Memory, Identity and Conflict. We'll use our discussions of Memory to help focus on expository and reflective rhetorical strate-gies, Identity as a way to experiment with point of view and character development, and Conflict as a method for exploring structure and dramatic tension. In order to write cross-culturally about personal experiences, students will be encouraged to create texts along the spectrum between creative nonfiction and autobiographical fiction. Theoretical essays will help inform how we ethically position ourselves as writers observing cultures not (necessarily) our own in order to inform audiences and to challenge our own prejudices.

In this advanced creative nonfiction writing course, you’ll learn how to hack your own unique brain into an idea-generating machine, and pair each idea with the genre that best suits it. Course readings will include essays by great practitioners past and present, among them James Baldwin, Eula Biss, Barbara Ehrenreich, Darryl Pinckney, Richard Rodriguez, Rebecca Solnit, Alice Walker, Ellen Willis, and Virginia Woolf. We will analyze these works to figure out how each idea was brought to fruition, and learn tricks of the trade that will in turn fuel your idea-generator.

From the outset students in this course are treated like writers. They will decide on the subject they write about and the approach they take. No subject is too trivial and no approach off limits—it is pos-sible to write about anything in this form that is sturdy and elastic, can narrate and describe, make a point and accom-modate much else besides. The test of an autobiographical essay is its ability to engage the reader and communicate the nature of lived experience. Students will read some of their essays in class, will comment on the essays of their classmates and will meet with the instructor in conference at least three times over the semester. Readings will be chosen from essays, poems, memoirs, diaries and letters by James Baldwin, Elizabeth Bishop, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Auster, James Schuyler, Eileen Myles, Patti Smith, Mary Karr, Jim Bouton, Siri Hustvedt, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Ned Rorem, Joe Brainard and the wide variety of autobiographical material on the Internet, a veritable autobiography machine.Outsider in the City: Writing Your New York Story WRTNG-"

This course invites you to discover writers who have used New York as a setting or as a controlling metaphor to create stories and essays and to use field trips as an inspiration to write your own. We will look at how different writers have developed their representa-tions of New York. We will study the city's glamorous gala goers, it teeming ethnicities, its under-classes, its vibrant diversity and accompanying tensions. We will consider how the city, its people and its spaces are mediated and created through fiction and nonfiction and consider common themes and connections in the many literary iterations of New York. Simultaneously, we will try and imagine our own New York and people it with our own characters and events we cre-ate and through a blog that connects the experience of the texts with the site visits.

This class offers specific units which intro-duce sub-genres of YA through assigned readings and discus-sion. We will also workshop students' corresponding YA novel excerpts. We will pay close attention to voice and dialogue, as well as study and practice the importance of world building. We will also discuss the importance of representation and the increased visibility of diverse characters in young adult fiction. Assigned readings will focus on young adult literature from the last twenty years and be broken up into sub-genres including fantasy and science fiction (Grasshopper Jungle by Andrew Smith and Dorothy Must Die by Danielle Paige), liter-ary fiction (Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Sáenz and The Sun Is Also A Star by Nicola Yoon), and magical realism (Still Life With Tornado by A.S.

Television has largely supplanted film as the go-to source for engrossing, adult narratives, and for boundary-pushing storytelling. This course will offer students the opportunity to burnish their writing skills while studying the evolution of the television drama since 1990. Over the course of the semester, students will watch groundbreaking series like The Sopranos, The Wire, and Friday Night Lights, and write about the variety of narrative and aesthetic styles endemic to Golden Age televi-sion, grappling with questions of gender, sexuality, race, and American identity central to many of these shows. In work-ing on our writing, we will look at everything from recaps to reviews to narrative histories in order to grasp the wide range of quality writing on television. Writing assignments will ask students to analyze the antihero figure exemplified by the likes of Tony Soprano, as well as series like Crazy Ex-Girlfriend that sought to break out of that now-familiar mold. Written work will allow students to try their hand at close analysis of television episodes, along with broader overviews of the arc of a series’ entire run. Readings will include essays by Emily Nussbaum, Alan Sepinwall, Brett Martin, Roxane Gay, David Simon, Clive James, Ariel Levy, D.T.

We will “workshop” student drafts and favorite published fictions. With student work (turned in under deadline and duress) we will concen-trate on potential as opposed to measuring drafts against the completed best. As best we can we will focus on "the how" of the craft of fiction as opposed to focusing on "the what" of what a story might have to say.

From its early iterations and influences in burlesque, vaudeville, and operetta to the complex contemporary amal-gams of book, music, lyrics, and dance, the American musical has proven a rich crucible for the exploration of identity and culture, form and content, and ideas and emotions. This arts workshop will offer actors a technical foundation for acting in musical theater. We will deal broadly with the history of musical theater in context by exploring both the process by which actors engage with musical material and the develop-ment and aesthetics of the form. Participants will work on songs and scenes taken from the giants of musical theater including: Rodgers & Hammerstein, Kander & Ebb, Stephen Sondheim, and more. How do we merge the receiving nature of acting with the giving nature of singing? How do we “jus-tify” the decision to sing at all? Our survey of the evolution of musical theater will ask: What does the history of the American musical tell us about our cultural history? What do musicals teach us about the interdisciplinary nature of living in the arts? All students in this course must be comfortable and confident singing actors. Everyone will be required to rehearse outside of class time, complete written and analyti-cal assignments, and commit to a public presentation at the end of the semester. In order to be accepted into this course, attendance at the first class is mandatory for all, including registered students.Directing for the Twenty-first Century ARTS-"

What are the implications concerning the role of the director? This course examines the origin of the stage director and how the craft has evolved since the last century. We will begin with several hands-on components that explore the fundamentals of stage direction including theatrical composition, analysis of material, collaboration with actors and designers, and the development of a directorial point of view. Special empha-sis will be given to rehearsal frameworks that cultivate an understanding of the collaborative nature of directing as well as build equitable and inclusive spaces fostering generos-ity, encouragement, and risk-taking. Throughout the course particular attention will be given to the relationship between form and content, modes of spectatorship, and the political and philosophical implications of staging choices. Students will attend and analyze productions in New York City, pres-ent and observe creative work using a vocabulary for critical analysis, and keep a journal responding to readings. Our investigation is intended to lead to the development of an individual voice for each student and clarity in one’s directo-rial point of view.The Open Voice ARTS-"

In it we will study vocal technique for actors in a truly interdisciplin-ary manner using the physical practices of vinyasa yoga and qigong, the voice techniques of Cicely Berry, Chuck Jones and FM Alexander, and readings from ancient and contemporary philosophers and poets. Every class will fully engage the body, voice and mind, ultimately seeking to unify these three components of the self so that each student can use his or her unique instrument most efficiently and effectively. This course will ask questions such as: What does it means to “be present” as performers, creators, public speakers and citi-zens? How can a performer use his/her vocal instrument in the most open and free manner? How do we listen on stage? How can we each be at the center of our own rehearsal process? How do individuals form a collective ensemble? What is mindfulness? Students will explore these questions both intellectually and physically throughout the semester.

Questions examined include: What makes something funny? Why do audiences laugh? What is the relationship between performer and audience in comedy? How does a performer get the laugh without ‘asking’ for it? How is humor specific to certain cultures, historical periods, genders or age groups? Are any elements of humor universal? Does the nature of performing comedy change from medium to medium? The course investigates these questions through readings, lectures, discussion and experiential exercises. Students are challenged to synthesize theory, historical traditions, and practical application into viable comedic performances. Students will experiment with this synthesis through discussing, analyzing, rehearsing and performing scenes/monologues drawn from major comic tra-ditions including: masked forms (such as Greek Old Comedy and Commedia dell’Arte), high comedy (like the comedies of Shakespeare and Moliere), low comedy (such as the slapstick of Charlie Chaplin, Mel Brooks, as well as modern sketch, improv and stand-up comedy) and that which defies easy categorization (such as Monty Python or Sacha Baron Cohen). The course will culminate in a public presentation, allowing students to share select comedic performances with an audience.

In this class we will be listening to the communication from our bodies and honoring our body’s wisdom. Our body constantly communicates important information that when we listen we can make profound changes in both our body and consciousness. Body educator Elaine Summers states, “As you learn to concentrate and listen to all your voices, not only your physical one, but the creative consciousness and the psyche as well, you gain the power to use all your innate abilities.” This experiential workshop uses the methods of The Alexander Technique, The Feldenkrais Method, Kinetic Awareness and its predecessors to increase awareness in the body/mind. The developers of these methods recognize that by using focused attention to sense the body in motion and at rest muscular tension and poor body habits can be released. These techniques are valuable for anyone who wants to gain more freedom of expression, range of motion, comfort, con-centration and presence in their work, art and daily lives. The course is designed for the student who is ready to commit to the in-depth process of investigation that is required.

We spend most of our time in the studio, moving through physical warm-ups structured to prepare ourselves for developing dance mate-rial informed by live performances, videos, guest appear-ances, and readings by and about dance-makers, from the first post-modernists of the 1960s through those continuing their lineage and those exploring completely different paths. We consider dance as an element of interarts performance, work joining dance and technology, site-specific choreogra-phy, and improvisation as both an autonomous movement practice and a way to generate movement for choreography. We borrow, of course, from what students bring to the work-shop: their individual dance histories as well as their interests and desires. Readings may include essays by Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Simone Forti, Jonathan Burrows, André Lepecki, Allan Kaprow, Ramsay Burt, and Nancy Stark Smith.Choreography: A Field Guide for Dance ARTS-"

This class is a guide through the elements used in making a dance. Choreography can be a sensuous non-verbal game, as well as a way to express identity in today’s complex world. Each week a different tool used in the creating of a dance is identified and explored. There is a short technique class based on the formal device studied that week, making physi-cal this knowledge. The student begins with short movement studies, leading to group studies of increasing complexity as they incorporate their knowledge of these skills. Teacher and class respond to the work of each, building understanding and confidence. A final performance in the theater is videoed and uploaded for student use. Each week the choreogra-phers who excel in their use of an element under study are introduced through readings and videos. The psychological storytelling of Martha Graham, Balanchine’s blazing neo-clas-sicism, the chance field dances of Merce Cunnigham, Twyla Tharp’s humorous inversions and the space- altering decon-structions of William Forsythe are studied. Mathew Bourne’s gay Swan Lake and the powerful black gospel songs of Alvin Ailey are seen as models of an intention that has been fully realized. The study of space, time, energy, and theme and variation are studied and seen as handled by the masters.

Ancient Greek and African musicians used song for recreation, to preserve communal memory and to link the visible world with the invisible. Music making was rooted in mythology, legends and folklore and was associated with gods, ancestors and heroes. The musician, through his/her technique, had to be able to combine sounds and images through the use of voice, gesture, dance, and instruments to form a musical reminiscence.

How do we make our songs more lyrically alive and our words more singable? In this course we will inves-tigate a structural approach to a “whole language” strategy for creating text/music pieces.  Beginning with written mate-rial generated from in-class writing prompts, students will learn to decode words as sounds and turn them into music by looking at hard and soft stresses, notating phrases and pauses musically (and phonologically) and attaching pitches. The process of underscoring poems and stories will also be investigated, giving attention to the magical way music can heighten mood and affect the meanings of words. No formal musical training is required for this course but musicians who love words and writers who love music are welcome. Readings will include essays by poets Denise Levertov, Robert Pinsky, Robert Haas, James Fenton and essays in the semiot-ics of music.

We will explores the process by which a concept becomes a three dimensional model and conse-quently a public monument. We will also investigate how ideas, or concepts in history have influenced individual artist in making public monuments. Some examples of this type of didactic art that we will explore are: Perikles’ Athenian building program after the Persian wars, Michelangelo’s David, the Columbia University “Alma Mater” in the middle of Columbia’s campus, the Peace Fountain next to St. John the Divine, Ghandi’s bronze on Union Square, Grand Army Plaza, “Sherman Memorial,” Avenue of Americas “Liberators Monuments,” Central Park “Literary Walk-Shakespeare” and “Angel of the Waters” and other sculptures and architectural sights in New York City.

The ebb relinquishes 12 hours of waterborne mystery; the flow’s 12 hours blanket refreshes the shore’s human impositions. New York City’s 578 coastal miles inspire this photojournal-ist/ documentary workshop to explore ongoing changes in commercial development, political innovation and envi-ronmental climate. The gradual cleansing of New York City waterways has encouraged neighborhood communities to revive their historical, artistic, and literary traditions along shorelines once occupied by industry. Now attracting vibrant cultural activity, New York City coastal communities are again looking at the water, seeking inspiration in its beauty. Embarking on a photographic project of their design, stu-dents will develop their own personal viewpoint on society’s relationship to New York waterlines, determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a unique relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color).

UG 1515," Talk to Me: Art of Storytelling for Audio & Radio Sloan Mon 6:20-9:00 p. 69ARTS-4 UN Mon 6:20-9:00 Judith SloanThis arts workshop focuses on the art and production of storytelling in audio for documentary, commentary, and personal narrative. With the increasing presence of new technologies, webcasting, and visual stimulation, this course concentrate on the power and influence of audio/sound pro-duction. As issues of diversity, race, and cultural representa-tion are increasingly becoming part of the public dialogue, this course will also look at current podcasts and dialogues taking place in the world of media producers. For the first part of the course, we will explore the history and influence of radio as a medium and listen to radio works from various sources including This American Life; Radio Diaries by Joe Richman; the early radio work of Studs Terkel, WNYC's Radio Lab, and works by Jay Allison through transom.org. We will also listen to new online platforms for documentaries and stories including animations where audio is the driving force. In the second half of the course students will create radio and audio pieces, record stories and sounds in the city, col-lectively and individually culminating in a produced podcast at the end of the semester. Visits by guest producers will enhance the class experience. Readings include excerpts from: Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America's Media by Eric Klinenberg; The New Kings of Nonfiction by Ira Glass; Radio Realities: Telling True Stories in Sound by John Biewen. Students should have a basic knowledge of audio editing software: ProTools, GarageBand, Audacity, Logic, or other editing software.arts workshops70    Fallarts workshopsIntroduction to Dramatic Writing: The Short Play ARTS-"
UG 1570," Writing for the Screen I Thompson Thu 6:20-9:00 p. 70ARTS- 4 UN Thu 6:20-9:00 Selma ThompsonThis workshop is for writers ready and willing to make the time commitment necessary to produce a well-structured outline and at least the first draft of a feature-length screen-play. We will hone our craft through writing exercises, and through screenings of film scenes that illustrate aspects of dramatic writing. Attention will be paid to the fundamentals of drama, including dialogue, subtext, motivation and char-acter-revealing action. The majority of our time will be spent presenting work and giving/receiving feedback; the ability to engage in collaborative discussion, and offer useful commen-tary, is an essential professional skill. Additionally, we will read/analyze recently produced screenplays to understand structure and how to make the story exciting “on the page”. Students should come to the class with some scriptwriting experience and/or a background in acting or film.Writing for Television I ARTS-"
UG 1571," Writing for Television I Douglas Mon 3:30-6:10 p. 70ARTS- 4 UN Mon 3:30-6:10 Imani DouglasThis workshop will explore the process of turning an idea into a teleplay. Prior to delving into the world of television, we will take a peek into writing for stage and film. The differ-ences and similarities of these mediums will be investigated, via such works as Neil Simon’s The Odd Couple, successful in all forms—stage, film, and TV sitcom. Structure, function and form will be examined via the reading of scripts and viewing of films and classic TV. Students will spend ten weeks of the semester creating, developing, and writing a sitcom episode of a classic television series, such as I Love Lucy. Students will learn first-hand what it takes to complete a writing assign-ment from pitch, to beat sheet, outline, first draft, rewrite, to writer's first, under the direct supervision and guidance of an executive producer. In this way, students will learn the business of the TV writer and what it takes to be successful in “the room” of a Hollywood TV show. Readings may include Writing for Television by Madeline DiMaggio and Laughs, Luck and Lucy! by Jess and Gregg Oppenheimer. This course is open to students with a serious interest in the craft of writ-ing for television. This writing-intensive workshop is modeled on the industry, requiring strict adherence to deadlines and mandatory attendance.Lyrics on Lockdown ARTS-"
UG 1593," Lyrics on Lockdown Anderson Mon 3:30-6:10 p. 70ARTS- 4 UN Mon 3:30-6:10 Piper AndersonThis course was formerly called Lyrics on Lockdown and led workshops inside of Rikers Island, but with the removal of youth from Rikers, we aim to look beyond incarceration to explore a growing movement to end the harmful practice of secure detention for youth. This course will focus on the uses of the arts, culture, and education tools for positive alternatives to secure detention for youth. Through hands-on collaboration with court involved youth, students will imagine and propose alternatives to incarcerating adolscents in detention facilities. Through course readings, guest speak-ers students, and a hands on creative practice students will investigate the crisis of incarceration in this country and how this crisis impacts the lives of youth and their communities. Guest speakers may include representatives from state and local public office, and advocacy organizations leading cam-paigns to end the criminalization of youth and close Rikers Island as well as individual leaders directly impacted by mass incarceration. Readings include writings by scholar/activists such as Paulo Freire, Michelle Alexander, Angela Davis and Chris Emdin. Students will partner with a community based program serving court involved youth to design a protoype that envisions the end of youth prisons and the construction of supportive community alternatives. They will present their proposals at a Youth Justice Forum for city officials, scholars, and youth advocates at the end of the semester. Students do not need to be artists to participate in the course, however, creativity, community building, and collaboration will be an integral part of the curriculum.From Script to Screen: Making the Short FilmARTS-"
UG 1621," Architectural Design and Drawing Goodman Wed 6:20-9:00 p. 71ARTS- 4 UN Wed 6:20-9:00 Donna GoodmanThis workshop begins with an introduction to the design process through an analysis of a house by an important archi-tect. The analysis explores the basic concept or partiof the design, historical and environmental issues, as well as func-tion, circulation, spatial organization, site, zoning, light, pro-portions, structure, and materials. In developing this project, students explore a vocabulary of design terms, the process of creating architectural drawings, and issues in history and theory. In the projects that follow, students create their own designs for various types of structures. The projects might include a loft space in New York, a house in the country, or a small commercial or public building. These projects provide the experience of creating designs by applying the concepts learned in the analysis. Students are also introduced to the basic techniques of drafting, rendering, and using Sketchup or similar software to create a design. Films, lectures and texts on architectural theory provide additional insight. Design experience is useful, but not required.Digital Art and New Media ARTS-"

ARTS- 4 UN Fri 2:00-4:45 Cynthia AllenThis course may be combined with a 2-unit, competitive internship (information forthcoming) arranged by Gallatin.  This workshop seeks to bring students from varying back-grounds together to engage in evaluating and developing digital new media for the Internet and other new media art installations. The Internet makes possible cutting-edge, student-centered, constructivist learning by collecting a vast array of educational and creative resources that can be explored: photos, text, animation, audio, software, and film materials. Each student brings to the class a set of experiences and skills, such as research, writing, design, film, music, photography, computer gaming, performance, anima-tion, computer literacy, software knowledge, and Internet experience. Through lectures (including a survey of digital new media innovations), group discussions, field trips, and workshops, students will develop individual projects, based on their new media skills. The workshop will deconstruct innovative new media installations, mixed reality innova-tions, computer games, and films that use digital new media. The class will discuss new media concepts, content strate-gies, and frameworks that bridge theory and practice. Class projects, readings, and Blog journal-keeping reports are essential components of this workshop. Students are encour-aged to supply their own media and take advantage of NYU’s Lynda.com new media tutorials.Making Virtual Sense: 3D Graphics Studio for Critically-Driven Creative Applications ARTS-"
UG 1647," Making Virtual Sense: 3D Graphics Studio  Skelton Tue 3:30-6:10 p. 71ARTS- 4 UN Tue 3:30-6:10 Carl SkeltonUntil recently, the creation of interactive 3D graphics was only possible for large and capital-intensive uses: the armed forces, large-scale architectural/engineering work, mass entertainment. Now, open-source applications and power-ful personal and portable computers are making it practi-cal for individuals and small groups to independently build and share alternative visions. Whether you are interested in exploring new ways to construct complex networks of ideas in the present, or to imagine physical spaces to reflect and support new ways of life, this arts workshop provides a blend of critical orientation and hands-on experience. In this open project studio, the majority of course time and work will be taken up with the development of student-built individual or small team concepts, to be developed as 3D graphic "fly-through" models. Theoretical discussions will be initiated with a mix of relevant writings and media. Here is a representative sampling of sources: Douglas Engelbart, Eric Raymond, William Gibson, Zaha Hadid, Judith Donath, the Athenian Acropolis, the Kalachakra mandala, Salisbury Cathedral, the Schindler house, Artigas gardens, the 1958 World's fair Philips pavilion, the Seagram's building, Grant Theft Auto IV, the monastery of La Tourette, the Mangin plan, compendium.org, Betaville.72    FallThe Gameplay's the Thing: Story and Game Design ARTS-"
UG 1649," The Gameplay's the Thing: Story and Game Design Bishop Mon 6:20-9:00 p. 72ARTS- 4 UN Mon 6:20-9:00 Barton BishopIn recent years, video games have exploded as both a cul-tural force and a pioneering creative medium. Many critics and creative professionals believe that gaming offers both its practitioners and its audience the next evolution in sto-rytelling. But how--and why--did digital games evolve from mechanic-focused experiences such as Pong and Tetris into more narrative-rich undertakings along the lines of Mass Effect, Horizon Zero Dawn, and The Last of Us? In this course, we will explore the vibrant and complex intersection between narrative expression and interactivity, examining the myriad ways dramatic storytelling techniques can be applied to a series of design mechanics to bring context to the player’s action, and, inversely, the ways that mechanics and design can be employed to express a theme or to convey a story. The course is intended to appeal to all gaming backgrounds--neophytes with a casual interest in games, enthusiasts who’ve spent many years passionately gaming and discuss-ing games, and everyone in between. The first half of the course will establish a creative grammar and a base of com-mon reference points from which students will develop their creative projects. The second half of the course will focus on the creative project. Students will be challenged to “gamify” a popular work of literature (of their choosing with professor approval) into an interactive project--video game, interactive fiction, board game, interactive theatre, or any combination thereof. Incorporating the fundamentals established in the first half of the course, students will develop a game concept through multiple rounds of iteration and feedback, eventu-ally breaking down the mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics of the proposed project via a highly detailed game concept document—the blueprint of an interactive experience. In the end, students should come away with a command of basic game vernacular, inspired to view Game Theory and Design as expressive narrative tools available to them in their own creative toolbox, regardless of discipline or medium.Innovations in Art Publications ARTS-"

A Body in Places is a multi-faceted course that contemplates the notions of human fragility, existential solitude, and meta-phorical “nakedness.” Taught by NYC-based interdisciplinary performing artist Eiko Otake, students will engage in move-ment study, art making, and exploration of different places. How does being or becoming a mover reflect and alter each person’s relationship with the environment, history, lan-guage, and other beings? How are we defined by or/and how do we define our relationships to the particulars of place? Reading assignments will focus on our collective experience of massive violence and human failure. In addition to the Gallatin studio, we will also work at the Cathedral of St. John the Devine where Eiko is an artist-in-residence.

First Class: Sept. 4; Last Class: Oct. 23.From Murnau’s Nosferatu to Bryan Fuller’s Hannibal, horror has proven to spawn its own storytelling archetypes, serving as strong subtext for race, faith, politics and sexuality. This seven week arts workshop gives the participants the screen-writer’s tools and weapons to research, develop and execute an original genre feature treatment or TV series outline. We will explore how different horror auteurs deliver a unique vision from the same source material, as well as how this par-ticular genre has transcended and influenced even the most “respected” mainstream directors. The sessions will not only cover the question of subverting narrative components and theme, but also creating “mood” and the “sense of the omi-nous”. Students will research and settle on an original hor-ror source [literary, folkloric or real-life], and will be guided throughout the stages of creating their own unique mythol-ogy and characters, as part of the fully- developed feature treatment or TV series outline—which will then generate a short film script in proper industry-standard format. In-class screening excerpts will include Dracula [Todd Browning and F. F. Coppola], The Thing [John Carpenter], Ringu [Hideo Nakata], Get Out [Jordan Peele], Let The Right One In [Tomas Alfredson], Rosemary’s Baby [Roman Polanski], The Fly [David Cronenberg], American Psycho [Mary Harron], Ju-On [Takashi Shimizu], The Shining [Stanley Kubrick], The Autopsy of Jane Doe [André Øvredal].

But to avoid them entirely may be impossible. Which makes the work of the cultural critic, part of whose job is to locate and question them wherever they occur, that much trickier and deeper. In this advanced writing seminar, we will move toward a sophis-ticated relationship with the cliché. What is the difference between cliché and idiom, meme, tradition, trope, arche-type, stereotype? Where do they live and breed? What do they accomplish? If, as Adam Phillips says, “clichés are there to stop us being suspicious,” can they be much more than a writer’s bad habit--can they even be used for societal oppres-sion? Or, conversely, can they bring people together? We will read criticism which notices the use of clichés in many forms of culture, by Hannah Arendt, George Orwell, Margo Jefferson, Leslie Jamison, Teju Cole, D.H. Lawrence; we will also study its use in fiction (Paul Beatty), drama (Samuel Beckett), visual art (Kara Walker), poetry (John Ashbery) and music. Students will write critical essays in response to the readings, as well as to current cultural or social events, pay-ing special attention to how clichés function in the subject itself and the discourse around it.Storytelling in the Digital Age ELEC-"

We will examine every aspect of the craft of traditional fiction writ-graduate electivesing: plot, structure, point of view, narrative voice, dialogue, building of individual scenes, etc as well as the new tech-niques of the digital age: hypertext, visual and audio images, social media. We will learn how to balance the traditional with the new without overwhelming the written text with gadgets. The class will become a creative lab studying ideas by others, coming up with their own, presenting their fiction, responding to the writing of others, and discussing questions about literature, editing, and publishing in the digital age. Each student will create and present to class a work of fiction based on some of the ideas we will be discussing. The works don’t have to be in the electronic form, but the students will need to explain how they would work. Each student will create a basic website with a writer’s profile and portfolio of her works.

Open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor (vn10@nyu.edu).From Nuremberg to the South African Truth Commission, there have been many efforts to grapple with the demands of law and the persistence of memory in the aftermath of atrocity and in the name of justice. In some cases this work has been undertaken by "victim"/survivor groups, in others by the communities that bore witness to the atrocity, in yet others by the state or even by international institutions act-ing in the name of "humanity." This class will study the ways in which the terrain of law, legality and illegality get mobilized to advance some memories and evade others. We will look at the work of courts as well as institutions such as truth commissions, collective initiatives such as memorials, indi-vidualized interventions such as witness testimonials, literary projects and ongoing claims for reparations and redress by social movements. The class will read scholars who seek to analyze how different 'memory projects' negotiate, challenge or legitimize different actors and alternative imaginings of 'justice.' The course is open to graduate students; advanced undergraduates are permitted with the permission of the instructor. There is a lot of reading for the course —virtually a book a week for most weeks—so those interested should be motivated to dig deep in this area over the course of the semester. Readings include Sophocles, Hannah Arendt, Judith Butler, Mark Osiel, Cathy Caruth, Saidya Hartman, Kamari Clark, Gerry Simpson, Ruti Teitel, Walter Benjamin, Rosalind Shaw and others.Bodies at Work: Gender and Labor in Contemporary Visual Culture ELEC-"

How are those values related to the value of women’s bodies and women’s work historically, both in the public and private spheres? Taking the glamorous figure of the runway model as our point of departure, this course explores the different kinds of labor entailed by the female-identifying body’s insistent commodification across fields of popular cultural production, with an emphasis on the fashion and beauty industries. We will put into dialogue the representational as well as material dimensions of women’s bodies in fashion, film, art and pop music, interrogating the dominant paradigms that shape female embodiment and bodywork in the 21st century. Students will learn to use political theory, sociology, feminist and media studies literatures to read recent films, ethnographies and journal-istic accounts of female bodywork, while weekly current events presentations enrich our discussions. Texts include Ciara Cremin's Man-Made Woman, Linda McDowell’s Capital Culture,  Iris Marion Young’s On Female Body Experience, and  Ashley Mears’  groundbreaking study of the modeling industry,  Pricing Beauty.78    Summer & Fallsummer & fall facultyNancy Agabian essay;

What changes in identity and in political, social and economic status did they experience? What were the newcomers’ expectations of their environment, and what reality did they encounter? Our study will look at coping mechanisms, the forging of intra-tribal identity, the sociology of survival, and the concept of ‘otherness.’ We will visit notable sites including The Hispanic Society of America, the National Museum of the American Indian, Henry Street Settlement House, the Tenement Museum, the African Burial Ground, the Eldridge Street Synagogue, El Museo del Barrio, the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, The Museum of Chinese in America, and the Lewis H. Latimer House. Readings may include such texts as How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, The Warmth of Other Sons by Isabel Wilkerson, The Lucky Ones by Mae Ngai, Down These Mean Streets by Piri Thomas, and Imagined Communities by Benedict Anderson. Films include Clint Eastwood’s Gran Torino and the documen-tary Family Name by Mackie Alston.The Self and the Call of the Other FIRST-UG 49 4 UN Mon, Wed 12:30-1:45 Judith GreenbergOvid’s story of Echo and Narcissus from Metamorphoses portrays the dangers of refusing to heed the call of the Other. Absorbed by his own image, Narcissus ignores the nymph Echo, who relies upon his words to speak. His solipsism leads to their deaths. This class takes Ovid’s story as a model for investigating how the self is shaped in relation to the other, a question considered by psychologists, writers, philosophers, filmmakers and literary critics. We will read psychological discussions of the development of the self or ego (Freud, Winnicott, Benjamin), literary portrayals of the self in rela-tion to others (Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, Joyce’s “The Dead,” Duras’ The Ravishing of Lol V. Stein), and philosophical essays (Blanchot, Levinas). We will examine the breakdown in the connection between the self and the other due to trauma, reading essays in trauma studies (Caruth and Brison), and the ways in which colonialism and empire shape conceptions of self and other, reading novels (Forster, A Passage To India) and theory (Said, Spivak). We will also ask what problems arise specifically when women speak—how Echo finds a voice—viewing the films Spellbound and Sunset Boulevard.The Thingliness of Things FIRST-UG 51 4 UN Mon, Wed 12:30-1:45 Eve MeltzerThis course engages a seemingly simple question: What is an object? Relatedly, what is a thing? As a means of illuminating these questions, we will consult everyday objects, theories of various object forms (from our very first loved objects, to commodities, fetishes, even lost things) and literary and artistic representations. One of our challenges will be to learn to read objects both by having them at hand, and by understanding how economic, psychic, and social values shape their visual and material properties. In this process, we will engage the popular view that objects tell us some-thing, first and foremost, about the people who create and use them. We will also encounter the taboo proposition that objects may have an intentionality of their own, and that humans do not dictate the meaning of all things. Readings may include Winnicott, “Transitional Objects and Transitional Phenomena”; Marx, “Commodities”; Hebdige, Subculture: The Meaning of Style; Baudrillard, “The Ideological Genesis of Need”; Proust, Remembrance of Things Past.Holy Grails FIRST-UG 70 4 UN Mon, Wed 12:30-1:45 Andrew RomigThe Quest for the Holy Grail has captured the modern Western imagination, inspiring bestselling fiction, scholarly and conspiratorial study, and no fewer than fourteen feature films since the silent era. In this course, students will dis-cover the ways in which our twentieth-century fascination with the legendary Cup is only the most recent incarnation of a long obsession in popular Western culture—one that reaches back in time to at least the twelfth century, and possibly earlier still. The Holy Grail will serve as a case study for learning about the Middle Ages and medievalism in our world today. We will study the flourishing of the Grail legend in twelfth- and thirteenth-century courtly society, but we will think about other “Grails” as well: quests for the unknown, the unseen, and the unconquered; fascination with con-spiracy; fear of cultural and religious difference; and above all, the hope that human beings invest in symbols, not just of the divine, but also of transcendent kindness, compassion, and sacrifice. Readings will include the Perceval romances of Chrétien de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach, Robert de Boron’s Merlin, and Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. We will examine our modern associations of the Grail legend with Crusade, the Knights Templar, the Papacy, and Christian 2018 23spirituality. And in dialogue with theorists of anthropology, political science, psychology, and comparative mythology, we will discuss why we pursue holy grails in the first place—what keeps us striving for those tantalizing, ultimately unreachable goals that nevertheless compel us ever forward.Political Theatre FIRST-UG 71 4 UN Tue, Thu 2:00-3:15 Valerie FormanWhat makes theatre political? What hopes for changing the world does theatre dramatize? What does the study of the-atre teach us about politics? How does the theatre become a productive site for representing, and even enacting, politi-cal change? This course explores these questions by reading plays from different historical periods and from different parts of the world. The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to plays that not only address a range of political issues (for example, about race, gender, sexuality, class, violence, the governing of subjects, and the produc-tion of good citizens) but also attempt to enact change and engage the community. We will thus be reading innovative plays alongside theorists who investigate and imagine the political potential of theatre and performance. By attending plays and participating in experimental theatrical exercises ourselves, we will be able both to think about what makes theatre political and to experience its effects through our own creative actions. We will make at least one trip to the theatre together, and students will be encouraged to explore alternative theatrical sites in NYC. Likely playwrights we will study include: Ngugi wa Thiong'o & Ngugi wa Mirii, Anna Deveare Smith, Caryl Churchill, Clifford Odets, and Sara Kane.The Arabian Nights FIRST-UG 75 4 UN Mon, Wed 11:00-12:15 Sinan AntoonThe Arabian Nights (The Thousand and One Nights) is one of the most fascinating "world" texts. Since its translation and publication in European languages it has captivated the imagination of countless writers and artists such as Poe, Joyce, Borges, Mahfouz, and Rushdie. It continues to play a disproportionate role in constructing and perpetuating an essentialized and imaginary East, populated by violent and hypersexual beings. The narratives of the Nights and the cultural archive they have spawned have had a fascinating influence on literary and artistic production, popular culture and political imagination. The course introduces students to this important world masterpiece and the debates surround-ing it. We will start out by briefly tracing the genealogy of this collectively authored and anonymous text, its collection and versions and the cultural context of its translation and popu-larity in the west. We will then explore the literary structure and narrative strategies an d dynamics of the Nights, read some of its most famous cycles and discuss how they have been read from a variety of perspectives, focusing primarily on gender and sexuality, power and politics, and otherness and boundaries. In the last part of the course we will read some of the modern literary works inspired by the Nights (Borges, Mahfouz, and Rushdie) and will end by watching and exploring how the Nights fared in adaptations in popular culture, especially in the US.The Game of Go and the Art of War in Early China FIRST-UG 77 4 UN Mon, Wed 9:30-10:45 Ethan HarknessIn this course, we will combine academic study with an expe-riential approach to the topic of strategy as an element of both structured play and warfare in early China. To set the stage, we will begin by thinking about the larger meaning of play as a universal human activity and contextualizing several examples of popular games from the Chinese tradition with background reading on related philosophical and cosmologi-cal beliefs. At the same time, we will learn the fundamentals of the ancient Chinese game of Go (weiqi), a favorite pastime of scholars and generals since the Han dynasty. Students will be introduced to on-line resources that allow them to play the game in real time with opponents from around the world, and they will also visit local New York City Go clubs. Using knowledge of Go strategy, students will then grapple with classical Chinese philosophy on the art of war by writers such as Sunzi and Sun Bin as well as selected works of Mozi, Guanzi, and Xunzi. Finally, we will conclude with modern echoes of the longstanding relationship between Go and warfare in literature such as Kawabata’s The Master of Go and Shan Sa’s The Girl Who Played Go.Double, Double FIRST-UG 89 4 UN Tue, Thu 6:20-7:35 Eugene VydrinWhat happens when we look out into the world and find our own face staring back? An encounter with a double is an inti-mation of immortality, of the body’s survival beyond its lim-its, which reminds the self of its own demise. A double is the outward projection of internal division, a copy that displaces the original, continuity that tears the fabric of rationality. This class will explore the ambivalence of the double by examin-ing its repeated appearances in literature, photography and film, psychoanalysis and critical theory. Freud’s concept of the uncanny explains the double as our confrontation with what we failed to keep hidden from ourselves, the return of first-year interdisciplinary seminars24    Fallthe repressed. But doubling is also a form of magic, a practice of making resemblances that live a borrowed life, and a way of knowing the world: an “embodied knowing” by imitating, knowledge as mimicry rather than mastery. In Lacan's theory of the mirror stage, mimicry is how we form our ego: we imitate our own reflection, longing for an image of bodily coherence that we can never match. In photography and film, doubling defines the very nature of the medium, which simultaneously copies the world and causes it to disappear. We will consider the camera itself as a double, a mechanical eye that positions the viewer’s gaze and projects it onto the film. Students will write several analytic essays exploring these views of the double through close readings of texts on the syllabus. Readings may include essays by Rank, Freud, Kofman, Benjamin, Taussig, Lacan, Mulvey, and Silverman; fiction by Borges, Poe, Conrad, Hoffmann, Shelley, Wilde, and Woolf; photography and films by Arbus, Hitchcock, and Mulvey.From Mishima to Murakami: Postwar Japanese Fiction and Film FIRST-UG 99 4 UN Mon, Wed 2:00-3:15 Nina CornyetzThis course aims to familiarize students with a range of post World War II Japanese prose fiction and cinema. We will pursue close readings of our varied texts to discuss the concerns of 1950s-2000s literary and filmic texts, and how those concerns are articulated. Our inquiry will straddle immediate postwar laments over a disappearing traditional culture to the celebration of globalism and consumer-ism, and the increasingly multicultural nature of Japanese culture. Our survey will include texts by feminist women, outcastes, and Korean-Japanese. One of our goals will be to recognize the diversity of Japanese postwar fiction, and to complicate American provincial notions of what constitutes “Japaneseness.” Alongside the fiction we will read relevant sources on narratology and film theory. Our books will include Kawabata’s Snow Country, Mishima’s Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Murakami’s Hard-Boiled Wonderland, and Enchi’s Masks. The films will include Morita's "Family Game," Mizoguchi's "Sisters of the Gion" and Sai’s "Blood and Bones.Literature and the Environment FIRST-"
