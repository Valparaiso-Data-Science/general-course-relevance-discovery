He was born in New York but came west seekingadventure. In 1821, he came to what is now Pike County. He and a friend, WillardKeyes, set up a bachelors lodge near New Canton and made a home for bachelors untilthey could find brides to aid them in settling the frontier.In 1822, John Wood headed for the Illinois bulge on the Mississippi now known as Quincy. He built Quincy’s first log cabin and widened the Fort Edwards Trail to lowerPike County to help in the settling of his new frontier community. He served asQuincy’s mayor several times, served in the General Assembly, and in 1856 was electedLieutenant Governor. Upon the death of Governor William Bissell in 1860, John Woodbecame Governor of Illinois, fulfilling a life of adventure and pioneer vision.It seems appropriate that John Wood Community College, often called a pioneer         because of its innovations in education, has been named in honor of John Wood, apioneer in this area with bold ideas and an innovative mind.JWCC—A Pioneer in EducationJohn Wood Community College was created to provide quality, affordable programs             in higher education for District residents. The first meeting of the Board of Trusteeswas held in November 1974, and the College’s initial 668 students began attendingclasses in August 1975. When the College opened, it relied heavily on an innovative“common market” approach to education to serve District residents. Over the years,the College responded to enrollment demands and community needs by expanding itsown curricula and services to provide a full scope of baccalaureate transfer andcareer/technical programs and student life opportunities. JWCC’s early reputation forbeing a pioneer in higher education, however, set a direction that the College stillfollows today: that of exploring innovative ways to share resources and partnering withother community entities to serve its constituents.In another innovative effort to serve residents of the District, the College introduced       Open Learning courses, offering individualized, self-paced instruction. In addition,JWCC has developed online associate degrees and courses; an extensive communityoutreach program; and is a pioneer in efforts to develop cooperative programs withbusiness and industry.This innovative approach to education—with its emphasis on cooperation and         collaboration—has been one of the reasons for the College’s continued success. In thefall of 2017, nearly 2,000 students were enrolled in credit classes. These students rangedin age from 14 to 68, with 33 percent of all students 25 years of age or older.

To avoid difficulty intransferring, students should work closely with a JWCC advisor. By working with anadvisor and the institution to which the student desires to transfer, a course of studycan be planned which will facilitate a smooth transition.The first two years of college work at most four-year institutions include basic courses that can be taken at JWCC. While students are not required to work on associatedegrees, there are a number of advantages in doing so. First of all, a student will havesomething to show for efforts after two years of college. Second, and more important,the general education requirements for a two-year degree at John Wood are very similar to the requirements at most four-year colleges and universities. Finally, earning anassociate degree actually assists the student in transferring to most four-year privateand public universities in Illinois and neighboring states.To assist students who transfer, John Wood Community College participates in the    Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide agreement that allows students totransfer general education courses taken at JWCC to four-year public colleges anduniversities in Illinois. Completion of the IAI General Education Core Curriculum atJohn Wood Community College assures transferring students that lower-divisiongeneral education requirements for a bachelor’s degree have been satisfied. (Specificmajors will have additional requirements.) This agreement is in effect for studentsentering JWCC and other Illinois Community Colleges. Details about the IllinoisArticulation Initiative (IAI), highlighting the general education curriculum, areavailable at www.iTransfer.org.Even though the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) continues to be the primary statewide vehicle for encouraging transferability among postsecondary institutions inthe state of Illinois, the Transferology web siteis also available to enhance the availability and accuracy of transfer information for an effective and efficient degree completion. IAI focuses on articulation of general education and foundational course-work at the lower division level, and Transferologyprovides information on all coursesand degree completion requirements available to students. Transferologyis a freeservice and may be accessed at www.iTransfer.org or directly atTransferology.com.Transfer degrees are available in the following programs.

Additionally, a student must be a high school graduate seeking an aid-eligible certificateor associate degree or be enrolled in a baccalaureate transfer program.Degree seeking students should complete and submit an annual Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). John Wood Community College will receive the resultsof the student's application if the student indicated JWCC's code of 012813 in the filingprocess. In response to this application the student will receive a Student Aid Report(SAR). The SAR should be reviewed for accuracy and retained for the student's records.Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA as soon as the application is available. The application is available online at www.fafsa.gov. The priority filing date for JWCCstudents to submit the FAFSA is as soon as the application opens each year but at aminimum eight weeks in advance of the term of enrollment. By checking the studentSOLAR account, students will be aware of all outstanding documents needed tocomplete the FAFSA process. Students and their families are encouraged to contact theFinancial Aid Office for assistance. Payment arrangements for student accounts must be made a week prior to the start of classes. If financial aid is not filed and resolved, the student must make payment arrangements. Students should contact the Business Office at 217.641.4207 for paymentoptions.Student Online Access to Records - Financial AidStudents with an active SOLAR account can view awards, outstanding document        requirements, and Satisfactory Academic Progress standing and accept Terms andConditions. Each year, students seeking to use financial aid must accept the “Termsand Conditions” and complete any outstanding requirements to receive Title IV or stateawards.Limitations to EligibilityThe following limitations apply to all federal Title IV financial aid programs.1.Federal aid may be paid only for courses required for the JWCC degree         or certificate. Once degree requirements are met, the student is no longer aid            eligible.2.A student may receive federal aid for a maximum of 30 semester credit hours of developmental coursework.3.Repeated Courses: Financial aid may pay for the repeat of coursework to improve an earned grade of “F”. Students repeating a course with an earned grade of “D” will qualify for financial aid to repeat the course one time only.4.Max Hours: The maximum hours for which a student may be aid eligible is 150% of the credits required for his/her program. Please review the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) section of the catalog for more details.FAFSA ApplicationAttendingApplication Open DateTax Information2018-2019fall 2018spring 2019summer 2019October 1, 20172016 Tax Information2019-2020fall 2019spring 2020summer 2020October 1, 20182017 Tax Information51Financial Aid ProgramsI.Federal GovernmentA.Federal Pell Grant (PELL)The Federal Pell Grant is the foundation program of federal student assistance. It is awarded to students on the basis of financial need and does not have to be repaid. Funds received from the Federal Pell Grant may be used for all legitimate educational expenses, including tuition, fees, books and related living costs. Lifetime PELL limit exists of 600%.B.Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)The SEOG is awarded to students with exceptional need and the amounts will vary by enrollment status.C.Federal Work-Study Program (CWS)Part-time jobs are available to JWCC students. These include a limited number of clerical, secretarial and maintenance positions. CWS students typically work eight to ten hours per week.D.Federal Stafford Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)This is a loan program whereby students may borrow money for educational expenses. The interest rate will change on July 1 of each year. Repayment of principal begins six months after the student either graduates or ceases to be enrolled at least half time (minimum of six credits per term).To apply for a Federal Stafford Loan, students should follow our online loan process at the financial aid section of the College’s Web site. Applicants must have FAFSA results on file in the Financial Aid Office to apply for a Stafford Loan.The combined amount that dependent students may borrow from both the subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs is $5,500/year ($2,750/semester) for freshmen (0-27 earned hours) and $6,500/year ($3,250/semester) for   sophomores (28+ earned hours). These amounts may vary based on the amount of other financial aid and the amount of credit hours the student is taking.The combined amount that independent students may borrow from both the subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs is $9,500/year ($4,750/semester) for freshmen (0-27 earned hours) and $10,500/year ($5,250/semester) for sophomores (28+ earned hours). These amounts may vary based on the amounts of other financial aid and the amount of credit hours the student is taking.The maximum for subsidized loans cannot exceed $3,500/year      ($1,750/semester) for freshman and $4,500/year ($2,250/semester) for          sophomores.As of July 1, 2013, first-time borrowers will have a time limitation on Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility. In general, a student may not receive Direct       Subsidized Loans for more than 150% of the published length of his or her program. Example: For a two-year associate degree program, the maximum period for which a student can receive a Direct Subsidized Loan is three years (150% of 2 years = 3 years).Financial InformationAnd Financial Aid52Since all loans must be repaid, students are urged to approach borrowing with extreme caution. The Federal Stafford Loan program provides an excellent means of obtaining needed funds for educational expenses, but these funds become a debt which must be included in the borrower's future financial    planning.E.Iraq and Afghanistan Service GrantFor students who are not Pell-eligible due only to having less financial need than is required to receive Pell funds; whose parent or guardian died as a result of military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after the events of 9/11; and who, at the time of the parent’s or guardian’s death, were less than 24 years old or were enrolled at least part-time at an institution of higher education. Eligibility is determined by the Department of Education and the school is notified.Return of Title IV Financial Aid FundsJWCC is required to determine the earned and unearned portions of Title IV aid awarded to students as of the date the student ceased attendance within a period of enrollment (per term).  Funds will need to be paid back if the student fails to complete 60% or more of the original enrollment period. Withdraws may be initiated by a student’s instructor. JWCC defines last date of attendance as one of the following: 1.The date that the student began the College’s withdrawal process or            officially notified the College of his/her intention to withdraw;2.JWCC will, as a general rule, use the standard 50% of the term as the last date of attendance for unofficial withdrawals (including zero earned       credits) unless a later date of withdrawal can be documented by the           institution.The length of term for each calculation is determined by the student’s original enrollment. Even if a shorter module (ie: 8-week course) is completed but the original enrollment included a 16-week course, the calculation is based on a      16-week period. JWCC must complete Title IV reviews of unearned funds as soon as possible but no later than 45 days from the determination of a student’s withdrawal.Federal student financial assistance is earned on a per diem basis up to the 60% point in the semester. Title IV funds that are required to be returned are done in the following order: Unsubsidized Direct Loans, Subsidized Direct Loans, Direct Plus Loans, Pell, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG), and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant. The student is responsible for returning any unearned funds that we disbursed directly to him/her. A copy of the worksheet used to calculate the return of funds to Title IV programs may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office.  If a student did not receive all of the funds earned, the student may be due a post-withdraw disbursement. If the post- withdraw disbursement included loan funds, a student may choose to decline the loan funds so that the student does not incur additional debt. JWCC may automatically use all or a portion of the post-         withdraw disbursement (including loan funds, the student accepted for tuition,53fees, and books). For all other school charges, JWCC needs the student’s          permission to use the post-withdraw disbursement to reduce your debt at the school (JWCC asks for this permission from the student during the enrollment process).  Any additional funds after cost are covered is released to the student if requested.A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60% point earns 100% of Title IV aid for that semester. A student who owes an overpayment to Title IV is ineligible for additional funding until the overpayment is fully repaid.II.State GovernmentA.Monetary Award Program (MAP)The Monetary Award Program makes awards to students on the basis of         financial need. Applicants must be Illinois residents attending Illinois schools. The awards apply to tuition only, and the funds are paid to the College on the student's behalf. Both full and partial awards are made, depending on need. Application for the MAP is made when completing the FAFSA form by the applicable deadline. It is recommended a student file the FAFSA as soon as the application opens. To learn more about MAP, visit www.isac.orgwhere a student can view Rights and Responsibilities of accepting funds.B.Silas Purnell Illinois Incentive for Access (IIA) GrantPending State of Illinois funding renewal, the Silas Purnell Illinois Incentive for Access program offers a one-time grant to first-year students who are      Illinois residents with limited ability to pay for college. This grant was           established by the Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC) to improve access to higher education.III.Awards for VeteransFederal Veterans' BenefitsJWCC is approved as an eligible institution for the instruction of veterans,  reservists and dependents under Title 38, United States Code programs by the Illinois State Approving Agency.

These awards are need and non-need based and/or merit based.  Examples are the Quincy Service League and Altrusa Interna-tional. Some scholarships exist with local employers of students or their      parents. Amounts vary by scholarships, as do the application processes.Statement of Satisfactory Academic ProgressThe federal government requires that the Financial Aid Office of John WoodCommunity College (JWCC) monitor the academic progress of all applicants forstudent financial aid.  This regulation requires that the College establish a SatisfactoryAcademic Progress policy that includes both a pace (quantitative) and a qualitativemeasure of progress. In compliance with these regulations, the College has adoptedthe following policy in regard to all state and federal financial aid eligibility.Satisfactory academic progress is evaluated at the end of each structured semester.Pace (Quantitative) MeasuresConsistent progress toward the degree or certificate shall require that no less than     67% of all attempted coursework be successfully completed. This is a cumulativerequirement and will be checked at the end of every term of enrollment. Studentsfailing to meet this 67% cumulative threshold will be placed on financial aid warning.If student is already on warning then they will be placed on suspension.EXAMPLE:  To meet the minimum completion rate of 67%, a student who has             attempted 28 cumulative credit hours at JWCC must have successfully completed(earned) a minimum of 19 of those 28 hours (all calculations are rounded up).Qualitative MeasureAll students are required to meet a minimum cumulative grade point average as           determined by the following chart:A.Up to 19.5 hours of coursework attempted..................................1.51B.20.0 – 29.5 hours of coursework attempted..................................1.60C.30.0 – 39.5 hours of coursework attempted..................................1.75D.40.0 – 49.5 hours of coursework attempted................................1.85E.50.0 or more hours of coursework attempted..............................2.00The maximum attempted hoursfor which a student may be aid eligible is 150% of the credits required in his/her program. In determining credit hour limits, it is            important to note the following:Financial InformationAnd Financial Aid56Credit hours transferred from other schools that are accepted toward completion of your JWCC program count as hours attempted and hours completed. However, transfercredit hours are not included in the calculation of your grade point average; If you change majors, the credit hours taken under all majors will be included in thecalculation of the attempted credit hours total, the GPA calculation and the maximumtimeframe for degree completion.Pace and Qualitative ConsiderationsAttempted credit hours include the following whether or not paid for with financial aid: Earned Hours (Grades of A-D), Withdrawal (W, WI, WA, WB), Failure (not apassing grade)(F), Incomplete (I, RD), and Pass/Fail (P/F).Withdrawal from Courses– If you withdraw (“W/WI” “WA/WB”) from a course   during the semester, after the census date, the course credit hours will be added to yourattempted credit hours total.Incomplete Courses– Credit hours for incomplete courses (“I” (incomplete), “RD” (in progress)) are included in the calculation of your attempted credit hours total, butnot in the calculation of your GPA. Until updated with grade change they count as 0points in GPA. When a grade change is submitted through the Registrar's Office theGPA calculation is updated.Pass/Fail Courses– Credit hours for pass/fail courses are included in the calculation of your attempted credit hours total, but not in the calculation of your GPA.Remedial Coursework– Credit hours for remedial classes are counted as attempted hours in determining pace. Remedial courses are included in the calculation of GPA.Non-credit remedial courses are considered transferred in and are counted in attempted hours.Repeat Coursework– A student who has received a grade of less than a “C” in a course and is repeating that course will have those hours added to the attempted credithours total. However, for GPA purposes if the second grade is higher than first then thefirst is excluded in GPA calculation and the second replaces. Additional repeats are counted in attempted hours and GPA calculations.If a student fails to earn any credit for the term, he or she will be placed on financial aid warning. When the student next enrolls, if he or she once again fails to earn any credits for the term, he or she will be placed on financial aid suspension. Evaluation of Academic Records Evaluation of academic records will take place at the end of each structured semester.Any student not meeting the minimum satisfactory academic progress standards at thattime will be placed on financial aid warning. A student is eligible for qualified fundingwhile on warning. If minimum standards of satisfactory progress are not met by theend of the warning term, the student will be placed on financial aid suspension and nofurther federal or state student assistance will be available.A student placed on financial aid suspension is expected to provide for their own          educational expenses. Any student placed on financial aid suspension may appeal tothe Director of Financial Aid if any of the following apply:  death of a relative, an injuryor illness of the student, or other special circumstances. All appeals must be put inwriting on the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Appeal form. These forms areavailable in the Financial Aid Office or online at http://www.jwcc.edu/students/financial_aid/. 57Suspension appeals approved in which a student may potentially meet SAP standard the following term of attendance will result in the student being placed on financial aidprobation for the subsequent semester. Probation is for one term only and the studentis eligible for qualified financial aid. At the end of the probationary term the studentmust meet SAP requirements or go back to suspension status. Suspension appeals approved in which a student will not meet SAP standard the          following term of attendance will have an individual academic plan developed. Anacademic plan will require the student to fulfill certain terms and conditions. He/shewill be eligible for qualified funding for that term/semester. He/she will retain eligibilityfor funding as long as the academic plan is followed. Specific academic advising forall students is provided by the Advising Office. Any changes to the academic plan mustbe approved in advance by the Director of Financial Aid. If an exception is not granted under the appeal process, a student may request             reconsideration of financial aid eligibility after the student has taken (at his or her ownexpense) no less than six credit hours and passed all attempted credit hours with a gradeof “C” or better. If the student attempts more than six hours, the student will beevaluated on all attempted credit hours within that term. All coursework involved inthe reconsideration request must be taken at John Wood Community College. Exceptions to the SAP policy will be considered by the Director of Financial Aid on an as-needed basis. The decision of the Director is final.Financial InformationAnd Financial Aid59ACADEMIC INFORMATIONUnit of CreditA semester houris the amount of credit usually earned by attending a non-laboratory class for fifty minutes a week for 15 weeks. In laboratory courses, one semester hourof credit is granted for every two or three hours of laboratory work. Classes which meetfor fewer than 15 weeks will meet more minutes per week for the same amount ofcredit.Classification of Students as Freshmen or SophomoresStudents are classified according to the number of semester credit hours or equivalent they have earned. Developmental coursework and on-level coursework taken for creditis included.Freshman        A student who has earned fewer than 28 semester hours of creditSophomore     A student who has earned 28 or more semester hours of credit but who has not received an associate degreeSpecial            A student who has earned 70 semester hours or more of college credit or has already received a degreeClassification of Students as Full-time or Part-timeFor classification purposes, a student will be designated as a full-time student for a given semester if he or she is enrolled for 12 or more semester hours in the semester.A student is designated as full-time for the summer term if he or she is enrolled for 6 or more semester hours in the summer term. A student who is not full-time is consideredpart-time.NOTE:Regardless of the term, Financial Aid calculations are based on the number of approved financial aid hours for the term. Awards are pro-rated based on the enrolledhours. Federal financial aid credit hour classifications are as follows for each term:full-time (12+), three-quarter (9-11), half (6-8), and less than (5 or <).Grading SystemA grade represents an instructor's evaluation of a student's academic performance in a course and is determined by examinations and other criteria as established by theinstructor. Some courses are based on the student's acquiring certain skills or proficien-cies. These courses, in which the mastery of the material is paramount, are compe-tency-based and may use a grading scale of A through C, or they, like the College'sother courses, may use the grading system below. In either case, each instructor's coursesyllabus clarifies his/her grading process and student requirements.AcademicInformation60GradeExplanationGrade Points AwardedPer Credit Hour                  AExcellent4                  BAbove Average3                  CAverage2                  DBelow Average1                  FFail0                  PPass0                  WWithdraw 0                  WIWithdraw after midterm0                  WVCourse waived0                  AUAudit0                  IIncomplete0                       No grade points are given for W or WB (used only up to midterm), WI or WA (usedafter midterm), F, P, AU, and I. A student's grade point average is not lowered for gradesof W, WI, AU, I, or P.Pass/Fail Grading OptionA student may take a course "pass/fail" by receiving permission in advance from the instructor and notifying the Registrar. This option means that, rather than being assignedA, B, C, or D, the student will receive either a "P" (Pass) or "F" (Fail). A course takenon a pass/fail option will not affect the student's grade point average if the studentreceives a "P"; however, an "F" will affect the student's grade point average the sameas an "F" received for a course taken on a non-pass/fail option. The decision to take acourse pass/fail must be made at registration and cannot be changed after the drop-addperiod. NOTE: No more than 10 percent of program requirements in degree orcertificate programs should be taken on pass/fail basis.Determining the Grade Point AverageTo determine the grade point average (GPA), multiply the number of grade points for each grade received by the number of semester hours for that course. Then divide thetotal number of points by the total number of semester hours attempted, excludingcourses with W, WI, P, I, and AU grades.Academic HonorsJWCC issues a Dean's List after each fall, spring, and summer term. The list indicates (1) those students who were enrolled for nine or more hours who earned a grade pointaverage of 3.5 or higher and (2) part-time students who have accumulated at least fifteen semester hours but have taken less than nine semester hours the present term and havea cumulative grade point average of 3.5, as well as a term GPA of 3.5 or higher.61Associate degrees will be granted with the distinction of Honors, High Honors or   Highest Honors to candidates of superior academic achievement. A student with acumulative grade point average of at least 3.85 in all his or her college courses will begraduated with Highest Honors; a student with an average of at least 3.50 but less than3.85 will be graduated with High Honors; a student with an average of at least 3.25 butless than 3.50 will be graduated with Honors. In certificate programs all students withat least a 3.50 grade point average will be graduated with Excellence.Academic Honor SocietiesPTK, an international honors organization with more than 900 chapters, recognizesacademic achievement at community college campuses. The Alpha Tau Gamma chapterof John Wood was chartered in 1991. At JWCC, PTK has the following membershiprequirements: A student must have completed twelve semester hours of associate degreework, maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5, and be currently enrolled in classesat JWCC. Students are inducted at ceremonies held semi-annually. These students arespecially recognized at graduation and are eligible to wear approved academic regalia.For more information, contact the advisor at PTK@jwcc.edu. Other departmental societies may exist on campus.Auditing CoursesWith approval of the instructor and the Registrar, a person may audit a course. The    decision to audit a course must be made at registration and cannot be changed after thedrop/add period. No credit is recorded for an audited class. A student auditing a courseis subject to availability in that course. Students taking the course for a grade will begiven preference in terms of availability.Release of TranscriptsTranscripts will be withheld for any student who has not fulfilled his or her financial commitments to the College.Appeal of Final Grade1.A student who wishes to appeal a final grade must do so within 30 days after the grade is posted. The student is encouraged to first meet with the faculty   member. Every attempt should be made to resolve the grade concern with the       faculty member.2.If the student is not satisfied after consulting with the faculty member, he or she may next appeal to the appropriate academic dean. The dean will meet with the   faculty member and the department chair to review the appeal. The dean will notify the student in writing of the dean’s decision.3.If the student still is not satisfied with the grade assigned, he or she may appeal the decision to the Vice President for Instruction for further review. The Vice President for Instruction will review the appeal and communicate the decision to the student in writing. The action of the Vice President for Instruction is final.4.This process will be accomplished in a timely manner and within one semester of the posting of the grade.5.Final decisions as outlined above will be communicated to the Registrar to be     included on the student’s permanent academic record.AcademicInformation62Student Withdrawal from CoursesIn general, a student who enrolls for, pays for and attends a course remains officially enrolled for that course and is entitled to a final grade unless the student withdrawsfrom the course. At this time, total withdrawals using the SOLAR system are notavailable. Withdrawal from a credit course is allowed until seventy-five percent of thecourse is completed. Students who wish to withdraw should first visit with theiracademic advisor.Withdrawal from a credit course can be processed with the Advising Office or through a student’s SOLAR account. It is appropriate to confirm your withdrawal with theAdvising Office and Financial Aid Office prior to the last day to withdraw if you haveany question about your withdrawal. Students who fail to withdraw officially from acourse may receive the final grade they have earned, perhaps an “F”.If students withdraw from a course during the first 10 days of the semester, for courses lasting longer than eight weeks, that course does not appear on their permanentacademic record. For terms eight weeks or less, this drop period is only five days.(NOTE: The College issues tuition and fee refunds per the refund policy outlined inthe Financial Information section.) Students who withdraw after the tenth day of thesemester but beforethe midterm will receive a W (withdrawn) recorded on theirpermanent records for that course. Those who withdraw after the midterm date for thecourse but before the last day to withdraw (see Last Day to Withdraw, below), receivea WI designation (withdrawn after midterm) on their record. The W and WIdesignations are not figured into the student's grade point average.Last Day to WithdrawStudents may withdraw from a class any time before seventy-five percent of the term has been completed. The specific days to withdraw are available through the Advisingand Registrar’s offices. The student is responsible for knowing his or her last day towithdraw for each course. After the last day to withdraw, students are not permitted todrop the course and will receive the final grade they earn.Administrative WithdrawalThe College itself may withdraw students from a course for which they have enrolled:1.The College will withdraw students who have enrolled but have failed to pay their tuition and fees by the payment due date. In this event, the course does not appear on the permanent record after withdrawal.2.The College may withdraw students who have enrolled for a course but who have not attended during the first 10 days of the term, or the first two class meetings for classes that meet once a week, as notified by the instructor. The College issuestuition and fee refunds if appropriate. Again, the course does not appear on the  permanent record.3.For purposes of certifying actual course attendance as required by the Illinois    Community College Board and in accordance with JWCC Board Policy, instructors may recommend that the College withdraw students for lack of engagement.4.The Dean of Students office retains the right to withdraw a student from a course for emergencies or for the purpose of discipline under established rules of          procedure. The Dean of Students will deem the type of withdrawal necessary in each case.63The Records and Registration Office notifies students of their administrative          withdrawal from a course and also notifies the Financial Aid Office. (NOTE: In somecases, a student's withdrawal from a course may result in a significant decrease or lossof the student's financial aid or in that student being placed on Financial Aid Warningor Suspension.)Students who have been administratively withdrawn but who wish to continue with the course may be reinstated at the discretion of the instructor in consultation with theRegistrar. Students may appeal denials of reinstatement following the normal appealprocess. Depending on circumstances, reinstatement requires an additional $75 fee.(Please visit www.jwcc.edufor the most up-to-date information.)Incomplete (I) GradesA grade of “I” (incomplete) may be given by an instructor if, in his or her judgment,      in conjunction with the Registrar, circumstances well beyond the student's control foran extended period of time preventing the student's completion of required course workduring the semester. When an instructor grants an “I” grade, the  instructor willcomplete a contract (Incomplete Report Form) with the student, specifying the date bywhich the student will complete the course and indicating the course material that needsto be completed. No such contract may be written with a completion day beyond theend of the immediately following term or 16 weeks after the end of the term in whichthe “I” was granted, whichever comes later. If the student does not complete the courseby the contract completion date, the “I” will be changed to the grade the student wouldearn without having all the course work completed. Pending incomplete grades couldaffect enrollment for future semesters for classes requiring the completion of theincomplete course.Repeating of CoursesA student who has received a grade of less than a “C” in a course may repeat the course one time without being penalized by having the course counted as additional hoursattempted. The student will be given the grade earned in the course when it is repeated,as long as that grade is an A, B, C, D, or F (W, WI, AU, or I will not count as repeatsunder this policy).Repeating a course will affect the student's transcript as follows: The course and the grade received for that initial course remain on the transcript, with a notation that thecourse is excluded from counting toward the GPA. The repeated course and grade arealso listed. Only the repeated grade is counted when the GPA is determined.For students repeating a course that was used as part of a previously awarded credential, the credit hours for the repeated course will not be counted in the student’s GPA orGPA hours.Financial aid eligibility for course repeats may be limited. Specific information is given in the Financial Information-Statement of Satisfactory Academic Progress section ofthis catalog.Academic Probation, Suspension and ReadmissionA student whose progress falls below minimum requirements is placed on academicprobation. If the student has not removed the probation at the end of the followingsemester, he or she will be suspended for one semester. The student has the privilegeof appealing to the Chair of the Student Issues Committee for immediate reinstatement.The petition should include descriptions of any extenuating circumstances and a statement of reasons for expecting immediate improvement in the quality of academicachievement. The petition will then be reviewed by the Student Issues Committee. The AcademicInformation64student will be expected to appear before the committee to ask for reinstatement. The committee, after considering all of the information presented, will then reach a decisionas to whether the student will be allowed to continue. If the committee decides thestudent may not continue, the student may appeal to the Dean of Students.A student on academic suspension who wishes to apply for readmission after the lapse of one or more semesters must then follow the procedure described above; however,the petition will not be forwarded to the Student Issues Committee but will be actedupon by the Dean of Students. The petition for reinstatement must be submitted to theDean of Students at least two weeks before the late registration period for the semesterin which the student wishes to be readmitted. The Dean of Students may readmit astudent on such terms and conditions as the Dean of Students requires; however,petitions may also be denied.Minimum RequirementsEach student is expected to make reasonable progress toward his or her academic     goal. A student is considered to be making minimum progress if he or she has gradepoint averages as follows:After 9 hours of course work have been attempted1.51After 20 hours of course work have been attempted1.60After 30 hours of course work have been attempted1.75After 40 hours of course work have been attempted1.85After 50 hours of course work have been attempted2.00Course LoadThe maximum credit hour load for which a student may enroll is 18 in a given semester, exclusive of physical education activity, music activity, and guidance courses. Anycourse repeated for the purpose of an improved grade must count as part of the courseload. Individuals considering course loads containing courses scheduled for less thana full semester (e.g., 8-weeks courses, etc.) should consider the expanded weekly timecommitment before registering and may be restricted to fewer credit hours. Exceptionsto the above must be approved by the Registrar.A student claiming USDVA benefits must be enrolled in 12 credits per semester or its equivalent in an accelerated term to be considered full time. The VA will pay forenrollment of half-time or greater under Chapters 30, 31, 32 and 35; one-fourth timeor greater under Chapter 1106. Veterans eligible for Chapter 33 benefits should contactthe College’s Veterans Coordinator. Students receiving federal financial aid must beenrolled in 12 credit hours to be eligible for a full-time award.Attendance PolicyStudents are expected to attend all meetings of classes in which they are enrolled. Tardies may be considered as absences by the instructor. A student should report anyabsence to the instructor, who will decide whether the work missed should be made upand determine what credit, if any, should be allowed for work submitted late. Verifiedabsences due to college business, illness of student, or death in the family will berecorded as absences by an instructor; however, the instructor may or may not countsuch absences toward excessive absence totals.65Pursuant to the Volunteer Emergency Worker Higher Education Protection Act (public Act 94-957), the College will reasonably accommodate the absence of a student whois a volunteer emergency worker when that absence is caused by the performance ofhis or her duties as a volunteer emergency worker. An absence generally will be treatedas an excused absence. Students entitled to this accommodation are required to notifythe Dean of Students that he or she is a volunteer emergency worker as defined by theVolunteer Emergency Worker Protection Act (50 "
ILCS 748,"/3) and also the specificemergency agency with which he or she is associated.Excessive absence may be sufficient cause for dismissal from class by the instructor. The final decision as to what constitutes excessive absence from a class is left to theinstructor and JWCC personnel.JWCC also makes reasonable accommodations for students who are members of the active military. Students who are deployed during the middle of a term or who need JWCC assistance in order to fulfill their military obligations should contact theveteran’s coordinator at 217.641.4330. Students are highly encouraged to inform theappropriate college personnel of their need for assistance as early as possible so thatappropriate accommodations can be made. All notifications of deployment or trainingare the responsibility of the student to appropriate college personnel as outlined.Because trainings are known in advance, students should take these into account whenregistering. Trainings may or may not receive accommodations.The University Religious Observances Act (110 "
ILCS 110,") prohibits public institutions of higher education from discriminating against students for observing religiousholidays in regard to admissions, class attendance, scheduling of examinations andwork. Absence from classes or examinations for religious observance does not relievestudents from responsibility of any part of the course work required during the periodof absence. To request accommodation, students who expect to miss classes,examinations or other assignments as a consequence of their religious observance shallprovide instructors with reasonable notice of the date or dates they will be absent.Students who believe that they may not have been reasonably accommodated shouldcontact the instructor of the class or the department chair. If the issue is not resolved atthe department level, students may petition through the Academic Appeal procedure.AcademicInformation66DEGREES/CERTIFICATES ANDREQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATIONDegree requirements are listed in this section of the catalog. Up-to-date informa-tion is available at www.jwcc.edu. Suggested and required courses for each degreeare listed in the program description section of the catalog. Since graduationrequirements at universities and colleges vary, the courses of study listed in thecatalog are suggested guidelines only. To avoid difficulty in transferring credits tothe institution at which the student plans to complete studies, the student shouldwork closely with a JWCC advisor as well as the department at the college oruniversity to which the student plans to transfer.This section of the catalog has a two-fold purpose: to provide limited information about careers that can begin at JWCC and to outline requirements for JWCC degrees andcertificates. The description may include opportunities in the field along with asuggested set of courses which will prepare a person for a position of further study inthat field. Course descriptions of all JWCC courses are contained in the last section ofthe catalog.The career information included in this catalog is based onthe "Occupational Outlook Handbook" published by the U.S.Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics; the informationprovided in the handbook reflects a national picture concerning thenature of the work, places of employment, employment outlook, andworking conditions of each occupation. Supplemental data was takenfrom the Coordinated Occupational Information Network (COIN).While the staff feels comfortable with the materials used concerningJWCC programs, students should be aware that employment profilesvary from community to community.If a student is interested in a major field which does not appear to be offered at JWCC,that does not mean that the first two years of a four-year degree program cannot betaken at JWCC. For information on other major fields, contact the Director ofAdvising and Retention.Planning the Degree ProposalEach student should complete a degree plan with his or her advisor prior to the first     semester at John Wood Community College. This should outline an academic planwhich will meet all of the requirements for the degree toward which the student isworking. Also, this academic plan should include the first two years of work in an areaof concentration required by a specific four-year institution to which the student plansto transfer (associate in arts, associate in science, associate in fine arts, or associate inengineering science degree) or should include all the courses required for a major in atechnical field of study (associate in applied science degree).67Program RequirementsAlthough academic program requirements may change with each edition of the college catalog, a student may graduate under the current program requirements or anyprogram requirements in effect since the student's first enrollment so long as it iscontinuous. However, no student may graduate under program requirements more thanfive years old without special permission from the program coordinator/director andthe Vice President for Instruction. The College automatically exempts from this"five-year" rule only those students who have been continuously enrolled in theirprograms. (In this context, a  student is defined as continuously enrolled in a programwhen that student successfully completes at least six (6) semester hours applicable tothat program per calendar year.)A student whose enrollment has been interrupted for one year or more must follow the program requirements in effect at the time of re-enrollment or those of any catalogpublished after re-enrollment.Currency of Technical CoursesStudents who completed technical courses more than four years in the past may find the information and skills from such courses to be obsolete. In order for technicalprogram graduates to possess current knowledge and skills applicable to the job market,students are required to repeat any technical course for certificate/degree completionwhich was completed more than four years prior to the current term. Exceptions to thisstandard can be requested by the student to the appropriate instructional departmentchair. Approval of exceptions can be granted only by the respective department chairbased on documented evidence provided by the student. The department chair shallformally notify the Registrar of approved exceptions.Earning More than One Associate DegreeStudents desiring to receive more than one associate degree must complete a minimum of an additional 12 credit hours for each successive degree and fulfill all degreerequirements of each credential. Students should remember that areas of concentrationdo not constitute a different degree. This primarily affects the degrees of associate ofarts and associate of science.Graduation ApplicationStudents who are nearing the completion of their program are required to file a        Graduation Application form prior to or during registration for their final term. Thiswill ensure an early evaluation and reduce the possibility of a deficiency in graduationrequirements. The deadline to submit the form and be eligible to participate in theMay graduation exercise is February 15.Meeting graduation requirements is ultimately the responsibility of the student. Students are encouraged to be familiar with the catalog and program requirements and to workwith their academic advisor in selecting courses.Graduation CeremoniesGraduation ceremonies are the celebration of a student completing a field of study. Each spring JWCC conducts a graduation ceremony in which faculty, staff, family,friends, and students come together to recognize and honor academic achievements.All eligible degree and certificate recipients are encouraged to participate in graduationceremonies.AcademicInformation68Everyone who has filed a Graduation Application form and who has successfullyplanned or completed the program during the year will be invited to participate inceremonies. A fee is assessed to cover student related expenses associated withgraduation. This fee is payable in the Business Office. (See Tuition and Fees section.)Participation in ceremonies is allowed prior to verification of completion of final courses. The actual degree or certificate is posted to the official transcript and thecertificate or diploma is released when all requirements have been met and verified bythe Registrar.Diplomas, Certificates, DegreesInformation regarding completion of degrees and certificates is posted to the official academic transcript. Verification of a degree or certificate can be made by ordering atranscript. A diploma or certificate may be ordered through the Dean of Students Office.You may pick up an order form in the Dean of Students Office. (Fees are subject tochange at any time; please visit www.jwcc.edufor the most up-to-date information.)Degrees and Certificates AvailableJohn Wood Community College offers a number of degree and certificate options to meet the diverse needs of the residents of its district. The associate in arts (AA), theassociate in engineering science (AES), the associate in fine arts (AFA) and the asso-ciate in science (AS) degrees are designed to serve students desiring to transfer to four-year colleges and universities. The associate in applied science (AAS) degree is offeredfor students interested in specialized career/technical training and preparation for full-time employment. The College also offers the associate in general studies (AGS) degreefor students who wish to design a course of study to meet their individual needs. JohnWood Community College has received approval to grant associate of arts, associateof science, and associate of general studies degrees earned through online coursework.Certificates, which require fewer credit hours than the degree and are generally highly specialized and structured courses of study, are available in most of the College'scareer/technical program areas. Students desiring less structured and more flexibleprograms of study may pursue a certificate in general studies.Associate Degrees (AA, AES, AFA, AS, AAS)The associate in arts (AA), the associate in engineering science (AES), the associate in fine arts (AFA) and associate in science (AS) degrees are designed for students planningto transfer to a four-year college or university for a baccalaureate degree. The AA degreeprovides emphasis in the social sciences, humanities, communications, and the arts.Students who wish to major in math, engineering, agriculture, the natural sciences, andsimilar fields that require heavy undergraduate requirements in mathematics andscience should pursue the AS degree. The AES degree is available for those studentsseeking a degree in engineering science. The AFA degree is available to those studentsseeking a degree in music performance. For the AA, AES, AFA or AS degree, thecandidate must complete at least 64 credit hours (65 credit hours for AES and AFA) incourses numbered 100 or above, including courses in the following three areas: generaleducation, the area of concentration (if declared for the AA/AS), and electives.69The associate in applied science (AAS) degree is available to students seeking theadvantage of specialized training in preparation for full-time employment. Studentswho complete prescribed requirements of a specific career program will receive theAAS degree. Students pursuing the AAS degree should understand that career/technicalprograms are designed to make a student job-ready and not all such programs can beassured of college transfer. The College encourages these students to consult a JWCCadvisor.General Education GoalsAssociate DegreeJWCC believes general education is a vital and basic part of a student’s education.  General education is defined as education which promotes a common base of knowl-edge intended to provide students with the skills necessary to participate in a widerange of activities which enhance the overall quality of life in the community. Specificgoals have been devised which reflect essential areas of general education competence.In addition to learning the skills and mastering the knowledge of their specificprogram(s), students will be able to:General Education Goal 1:   CommunicationThis area of study will help the student become proficient in developing, evaluating, and analyzing written, oral, and visual messages appropriate to the situation, purpose, and audience.General Education Goal 2:   Humanities and Fine ArtsThis area of study will help the student develop an understanding of the human condition through investigation, appreciation, and evaluation of the humanities.General Education Goal 3:Social and Behavioral Science(Includes Psychology, Sociology, History, Economics, and Political Science)This area of study will help the student to develop an understanding of the self, others and the world in which he or she lives through investigation of social, cultural, economic, political, and historic influences on human thought, values, and behaviors.General Education Goal 4: MathematicsThis area of study will help the student to use abstract and deductive reasoning to interpret and critically evaluate data and to effectively solve problems.General Education Goal 5:   Physical and Life SciencesThis area of study will train the student to comprehend and apply the basic principles of science and methods of scientific inquiry.General Education Goal 6:      Information LiteracyThis area of study will help the student to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to use information effectively through appropriate technology and media.AcademicInformation70Graduation RequirementsA.General Education Course RequirementsThe specific requirements needed to fulfill the general education component of the degrees are outlined as follows:AAAFAASAAS      AESHrs.Hrs.Hrs.Hrs.Hrs.1.Communication Skills:a.Written3                                                                    6             6           6             3           6b.Oral                                               3             3           3             3           --2.Humanities & Fine Arts                    9             6           6             3           3                                                                                                                     OR3.Social & Behavioral Sciences           9             3          6             3           64.Mathematics & Natural Sciencea.Mathematics                                 3             3           6             3          12b.Life Science                                  3-4        3-4          3-4         --           --c.Physical Science                           3-4        3-4          3-4         --           4d.Life/Physical Science                                                3-4                       5.First Year Experience                         1             1           1             1            16.General Education Course                  --            --           --           3-4         --(from approved list of communications, natural science, mathematics, humanities, social & behavioral science)                    TOTAL HRS.                             38            29        38         16-17      32 The required general education hours for associate degrees must be selected from the following courses grouped by general education category.

It is           designed to help students build stronger relationships within their college      experience, to learn how to learn at the college level, to improve both their soft skills and academic skills, and to establish a stronger foundation upon which to complete their college education.B.The Area of Concentration RequirementsFor students seeking the AA or AS degree, JWCC does not offer a "major" as     typically found at a four-year institution. However, the College does provide Area of Concentration courses which must be completed in the appropriate program of study.For students seeking the AES degree, there is a list of required courses on the      Engineering page later in this catalog. For students seeking the AFA degree, there is a list of required courses totaling 36 semester hours that students must complete. See Fine Arts later in this catalog.Students who wish to declare an Area of Concentration must complete a         minimum of 12 semester hours within that Area of Concentration. Students should be aware that other courses may be required for the completion of their "area of concentration" at four-year institutions. Not all Areas of Concentration are listed. If a specific area which is not listed is desired, contact an advisor for assistance in determining courses to meet the Area of Concentration requirement. In special    situations, students may have legitimate reasons for deviating from the Area of Concentration courses listed in the catalog. Before deciding upon an Area of      Concentration, each student planning to transfer to a baccalaureate program should meet with an advisor and seek to learn what the two-year requirements are for the four-year major discipline.For students seeking the AAS degree, the required curriculum directly supports learning in the technical field. The number of hours required in a given career/technical field varies by program. Each student planning to acquire the AAS degree must complete the specific courses required. A minimum of 35 semester credit hours is needed to satisfy the requirements.75C.Elective RequirementsSome programs require elective semester hours that bring the total program hours to 64.D.Other Requirements1.A minimum of 64 semester hours is required for graduation.

Students receiveexcellent training opportunities through experiential and active involvement with chil-dren on campus, in area childcare facilities and in local schools. Early Childhood stu97dents are encouraged to observe and assess children as they develop academically, so-cially, physically and mentally in their study of the whole child. Creating a warm, safeand nurturing environment which is supported by the family and the community is thegoal of this unit of study. Best practices in Early Childhood education are stressed inall classes, education training and events. Qualified applicants will be admitted into the program and placed into mathematics and English general education classes based upon assessment scores.A practicum and field service opportunity will be arranged by the faculty advisor which sums up the theories learned in the classroom and provides real life experience workingwith children at an approved agency, center or school. Before placement in thepracticum, students must pass an Illinois State Police background check and receiveclearance before admission into public entities working with children. Students will berequired to submit a current record of a physical examination, pass  a TB test and showproof that they are physically and mentally in a state of good health before they can beconsidered for being placed in the practicum. As required by the Department ofChildren and Family Services, safety orientation tests and screenings may also berequired before placement in a child focused agency or school.NOTE: Only students who do not need additional coursework and who take the number of credits or courses as listed each semester can complete the program in the time given.

Economistsanalyze the relationship between the supply of goods and services on the one handand demand for them on the other. Economists also examine how goods and servicesare produced, distributed and consumed. Some economists are concerned with   ProgramsOf Study98specific fields such as farm, wage, tax, and tariff problems and policies. Others developtheories to explain the causes of employment and unemployment or inflation. Mosteconomists analyze and interpret a wide variety of economic data in the course of theirwork.Economists who work in colleges and universities teach the theories, principles, and methods of economics and conduct or direct research; they frequently write and act asconsultants. Economists in government collect and analyze data and prepare studiesto assess economic conditions and the need for changes in government policy.Economists who work for business firms provide management with information           to make decisions on marketing and pricing of company products, the effect ofgovernment policies on business and international trade, or the advisability ofbusiness.Students completing the transfer program in economics at John Wood Community   College typically choose to attend a four-year college or university to complete theirbachelor's degree and possibly pursue advanced degrees.

Generally, there are two broad classes of mathematical work:pure mathematics and applied mathematics. The pure mathematicians advance scienceby developing new principles and new relationships existing between principles ofmathematics. Mathematicians in applied work use mathematics to develop theories,techniques and approaches to solve problems in natural and social science.The JWCC program of study satisfies the demands and competence of both of these areas by providing the student with a comprehensive course selection. In addition, thiscurriculum provides the background needed to pursue training in the high technology               fields of computer science and engineering.

IAI: M1 902The course prefix, MAT, places the course in alphabetical order in this section of thecatalog and assigns the course to a major field or discipline; in this case, MAT is theprefix for courses in mathematics. The course number, 109 in this case, indicates levelof course (see next page for course numbering explanation).Immediately to the right of the course title is one, two or three asterisks (*), indicating the number of times a course may be repeated.To the right of the repeatability designation is the number of credit hours assigned         to the course. (A few courses may vary in credit hours according to specificcircumstances.)Beneath the course title are indicated any special requirements that students must meet before they enroll in the course. For some courses, students must have alreadycompleted certain other courses (these other courses are called prerequisites) or havethe specific permission of the department to enroll; for others, a particular course shouldbe taken concurrently (at the same time) as the course describes. Any such specialrequirements or even recommendations are listed immediately beneath the course title.Immediately following the description of course content is the IAI (Illinois Articulation Initiative) code to assist students planning to transfer to another Illinois institution.See “College Transfer Programs” section for details on the IAI. Lecture hours andlaboratory and/or clinical hours are indicated for courses requiring contact hours inaddition to the lecture hours. For courses that are offered only via the Internet, asOpen Learning courses, or at a certain location (i.e., Agricultural Education Center), astatement may follow the course description.course prefixcourse numbercourse titletimes course is repeatablecredit hoursspecial requirementsfor enrollment(if applicable)Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) CodeCourse Descriptions128COURSE LISTINGThe course listing section is divided into three subsections:I.Courses Applicable to Associate Degrees, Career/Technical Certificates, Vocational Skills and General Studies Courses. This is the vast majority of courses.II.Adult Basic Education/Adult Secondary Education (GED) Courses.III.Community Education Courses.John Wood Community College does not recommend that students do self- orpeer-advising. The selection of courses and programs of study can be somewhatconfusing and complex. The College strongly recommends that students rely onthe College's experienced advising staff to help select the right course/courses toensure transferability and to meet degree requirements.Note: Students who completed technical courses more than four years in the past mayfind the information and skills from such courses to be obsolete. In order for technicalprogram graduates to possess current knowledge and skills applicable to the job market,students are required to repeat any technical course for certificate/degree completionwhich was completed more than four years prior to the current term. Exceptions to thisstandard can be requested by the student to the appropriate instructional departmentchair. Approval of exceptions can only be granted by the respective department chairbased on documented evidence provided by the student. The department chair shallformally notify the registrar of approved exceptions.Generally, courses are numbered as follows:001 through 099 - Developmental, remedial, and college preparatory courses. These courses do not apply toward transfer degrees; however, certain courses may apply to an AAS degree.100 through 299 - Career/technical and baccalaureate-level courses. (These courses may transfer depending on the transfer policy of the institution and academic department to which the student plans to transfer.) These courses mirror the first two years of coursework at a four-year college or university.129I.COURSES APPLICABLE TO ASSOCIATE DEGREES,CAREER/TECHNICAL CERTIFICATES, VOCATIONAL SKILLS, AND GENERAL STUDIES COURSESACCOUNTI or  with a grade of “C” or above within two semesters,                         or appropriate placement test score, or consent of department                        Fundamentals of chemistry for the non-science major.

Community College depicts John Wood,pioneer and trailblazer, standing tall and strong, looking to a future filledwith opportunity. The plat map he holds in his hands reflects planningand the pursuit of knowledge, while the cornstalk rising from the fertilefield is at once a representation of agriculture as well as a metaphor forthe seed of knowledge planted in the mind of the student, carefullycultivated, and maturing to benefit many. The bluffs and tree line of theMississippi River Valley are enduring landmarks, while the bridge androads identify strengths in industry, transportation, and technology.Finally, the cog border symbolizes John Wood Community College as animportant part of a greater mechanism. Like John Wood the man, JohnWood Community College is a pioneer of innovation helping to build abetter future.- Unanimously adopted by the JWCC Board of Trustees on January 21, 2009- Seal design by William Beard, JWCC student 2008-09 and current JWCC staff member- Narrative description by James Huber, JWCC student 2008-09206"
