ONE course in Literary Theory and Cultural Critique:1The late-twentieth century saw a revolution in the fieldof literary studies in the United States, as critics turnedtheir attention to the contextual and historical nature of ourcategories of knowledge. This turn to theory was influencedby developments in psychoanalysis, linguistics, philosophy,political theory and sociology and by the emergence of socialmovements that challenged such structures as patriarchy,homophobia, racism, imperialism, economic inequality, andenvironmental violence. The avenues of inquiry openedup brought an increased awareness of the implication ofliterature in the operations of power and ideology; a sense ofthe potential for literary modes of presentation to challengeand displace such operations; and a new attention to the roleof gender, race, empire, class, and sexuality in the formationof the literary work. Courses that satisfy the Literary Theoryand Cultural Critique requirement explore some dimensionof these issues – either directly, taking as their primary focusa set of theoretical questions or debates, or indirectly, byexamining a compelling topical question of social and politicalsignificance through works of literature and literary theory.6.

The geosciences arehighly interdisciplinary, thus students must take some supporting mathand science courses. Geoscience courses emphasize a process-orientedapproach, with hands-on experiences in labs and on field trips. There isa strong emphasis on active and collaborative learning, and on practicein communication. Students may choose an AB (total of 13 courses) oran ScB (19 total courses, including one semester of research). Thereare many opportunities for students to do research work (typically in paidpositions) during the academic year or in the summer, in areas suchas deformation and properties of geological materials, deciphering thegeologic history of some local rocks, or analysis of planetary images.Standard program for the A.B. degreeThis program provides a broad introduction to the geological sciences.Recommended for students seeking a liberal education and a generalunderstanding of Earth processes and Earth history. Especially attractivefor double concentrations, such as geology and economics as a careerpath to law or business, or geology and English as a career path tojournalism or technical writing.Basic supporting science courses"

And how is socialchange – that is, the making of new rules and expectations – possible?When we respond to rules, do we act as free-willing individuals or dowe follows social structures we have no control over? These questionshave motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the argumentshave been already developed by the four "forefathers" of sociology: KarlMarx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Georg Simmel. Looking at thetransformations around them – the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the metropolitan, the decline of religion, andmuch more – they developed arguments that allow us to better understandourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic andsocial transformations around us.FallSOC1010S0116875MWF1:00-1:50(06)(P.

Specifically, high throughput technologies have renderedvast new biological data sets that require novel analytical skills for themost basic analyses. These technologies are spawning a new "data-driven" paradigm in the biological sciences and the fields of bioinformaticsand systems biology. The foundations of these new fields are inherentlymathematical, with a focus on probability, statistical inference, andsystems dynamics. These mathematical methods apply very broadlyin many biological fields including some like population growth, spreadof disease, that predate the genomics revolution. Nevertheless, theapplication of these methods in areas of biology from molecular geneticsto evolutionary biology has grown very rapidly in with the availabilityof vast amounts of genomic sequence data.

Any student interestedin a course of graduate study should speak to the Joukowsky Institute'sAssistant Director and faculty members as soon as possible,, not leastfor advice about additional forms of preparation. Graduate work in thearchaeology of the ancient world, for example, requires knowledge ofappropriate ancient, as well as modern, languages. Students should startwork on acquiring these skills as early as possible.The Honors ThesisThe Honors thesis is an extended essay, usually of between 40 and60 pages in length, researched and written under the supervision of afaculty advisor and second reader during the senior year (during which thestudent must be enrolled in  in theSpring semester).Where appropriate, the advisor or the reader, but not both of them, maybe in a unit other than the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and theAncient World. The specific topic and approach of the thesis are workedout between the student and the thesis advisor, with assistance from thestudent's second reader. This process should begin in the latter part of thestudent's junior year.A preliminary title and one page outline of the proposed Honors thesis isdue to the Joukowsky Institute's Assistant Director and the thesis advisorby May 15th of the junior year.The deadlines for thesis drafts, and for final thesis submission, will beagreed between the student and the faculty advisors.

You can learn more by visiting the honorspage (https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/education/undergraduate/honors) on the IBES website.Ethnic StudiesEthnic Studies is an interdisciplinary, comparative concentration thatexamines the construction of race and ethnicity in social, cultural,historical, political, and economic contexts. Concentrators developindividual programs based on areas of focus in consultation with facultyadvisors, drawing from courses in the humanities and social sciences.Typical areas of focus are social issues (such as inequality, education,or health), cultural production and the representation of racial groups,processes of racialization, the historical formation of transnationalcommunities and of diaspora, and the history of particular ethnic or racialgroups.The Ethnic Studies concentration (https://www.brown.edu/academics/american-studies/ethnic-studies) at Brown emphasizes the historiesof diverse racial groups within and across the borders of the UnitedStates, including examining issues of diaspora, migration, socialmovements, and the political economies of social inequality and racialformation.  Concentrators strive for intellectual fluency in a range of criticalapproaches to race and ethnicity across disciplines, and demonstrate thisfluency through the composition or creation of a significant piece of originalresearch or creative work.Brown University established an Ethnic Studies concentration in 1996,originally within the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America(https://www.brown.edu/academics/race-ethnicity) (CSREA). In the Fall of2013, as part of changes to the CSREA and to better support students,Ethnic Studies joined a long established Brown department, AmericanStudies (https://www.brown.edu/academics/american-studies/home). Many American Studies faculty members (https://www.brown.edu/academics/american-studies/people) work in the areas of race andethnicity and have held joint appointments in Ethnic and American Studieswhile American Studies PhD students (https://www.brown.edu/academics/american-studies/graduate-students) have done some of the most excitingEthnic Studies research on campus.As an academic field, Ethnic Studies is rooted in the protests of the1960s and 1970s, out which emerged the very first Latino/a Studies,Asian American Studies, African American Studies, and Native Americanstudies programs.  Organized around straightforward political goals – theenrichment through diversification of the curriculum and the systematic,multi-disciplinary, and the often comparative study of racial and ethnicinequality – Ethnic Studies has become an important feature of majorresearch universities.Faculty, both core and affiliated, create and participate in groundbreakingEthnic Studies scholarship.  Areas of faculty research include borderlandshistory, Latina/o literary studies and visual culture, indigenous movements,migration and African American cultural studies as well as the intersectingfields of gender and sexuality, queer theory and critical race theory. Students can focus their study on specific populations (e.r. Latina/os,Asian Americans) and choose a thematic interest including such currentexamples as : "social issued affecting radicalized groups" (students havelooked at health disparities or educational inequality); "the study of culturalproduction or cultural representations;" "the theory of a particular racial orethnic group;" and " the study of comparative processes of radicalization."For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).Brown University            251Requirements (for students starting with theclass of 2020), , & "

This focus is contrasted with more macro-levelapproaches, which take the organization (instead of the individual) as theprimary unit of analysis. For example, studies of organizations from aneconomic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of theorganization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from amacro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization'sroutines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment.

A programming course is alsorecommended, but not required. The entire program is subject to approvalby an Engineering Concentration Advisor and the Chair of the EngineeringConcentration Committee.Standard programs for the Sc.B. degreeAll Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) program tracks build upon a common coreof engineering knowledge and skills applicable across all engineeringdisciplines. The goal of this engineering core curriculum is to preparedto practice engineering in an age of rapidly changing technology. Two-thirds of this four-year program consists of a core of basic mathematics,physical sciences and engineering sciences common to all branches ofengineering, including a thorough grounding in programming and technicalproblem solving. This core provides our graduates with the basis of theory,design, and analysis that will enable them to adapt to whatever may comealong during their careers.At the same time, the core courses assist students in making informedchoices in determining their areas of specialization, at the end of theirsophomore year. To this end, first-year students are given an introductionto engineering - featuring case studies from different disciplines inengineering as well as guest speakers from industry. This aspect of theprogram is different from that at many other schools where students areexpected to select a specific branch of engineering much earlier in theiracademic program.In addition, all Sc.B. programs in Engineering must be complementedby at least four courses in humanities and social sciences.The minimumfour-course humanities and social sciences requirement for the Sc.B. inEngineering cannot be met by advanced placement credit.Special ConcentrationsIn addition to the standard programs described above, students mayalso petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to pursue aspecial engineering Sc.B. degree of their own design. Such specialSc.B. programs are not ABET-accredited.  Students with a specialconcentration will receive an Sc.B. degree in engineering, but a specificarea of specialization will not be noted on their transcript. A special Sc.B.concentration is intended to prepare graduates for advanced study inengineering or for professional practice, but in an area that is not coveredby one of the existing Sc.B. programs.  Accordingly, special concentrationprograms are expected to consist of a coherent set of courses withbreadth, depth and rigor comparable to an accredited degree.  A total of21 engineering, mathematics, and basic science courses are required.The program must include at least 3 courses in mathematics, at least 2courses in physical or life sciences; and at least 12 courses in engineering.At least five of the engineering courses must be upper level courses,and one must be a capstone design course or independent study, whichmust be advised or co-advised by a member of the regular engineeringfaculty. Note that not all engineering courses may be used to meet Sc.B.requirements: for example, the courses not allowed to count toward theA.B., will not qualify. Petitions should be prepared in consultation with anengineering faculty adviser, who will submit the petition to the EngineeringConcentration Committee.  Petitions must include: (i) a statement of theobjectives of the degree program, and an explanation of how the coursesin the program meet these objectives; (ii) course descriptions for anycourses in the program that are not part of standard ScB engineeringconcentrations; (iii) a detailed description of any independent studycourses used for concentration credit, signed by the faculty adviser for thiscourse; and (iv) an up-to-date internal transcript.Professional TracksWhile we do not give course credit for internships, we officially recognizetheir importance via the optional Professional Tracks. The requirementsfor the professional tracks include all those of the standard tracks, aswell as the following:  Students must complete two full-time professionalexperiences, lasting two to four months each (or two part-time experiencesof equivalent total effort), doing work that is related to their concentrationprograms. Such work is normally done within an industrial organization,but may also be done at a university under the supervision of a facultymember. For the work to be considered related to a concentrationprogram, the job responsibilities must make use of the material fromone or more courses of the concentration (regardless of whether thestudent has taken those courses or not at the time of the internship). OnFor up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).238         Undergraduate Concentrationscompletion of each professional experience, the student must write andupload to ASK a reflective essay about the experience addressing thefollowing prompts:•Describe the organization you worked in and the nature of yourresponsibilities.•Which courses were put to use in your work? Which topics, inparticular, were important?•In retrospect, which courses should you have taken before embarkingon your work experience?•What are the topics from these courses that would have helped you ifyou had been more familiar with them?•What topics would have been helpful in preparation for this workexperience that you did not learn at Brown?•What did you learn from the experience that probably could not havebeen picked up from course work?•Is the sort of work you did something you would like to continue doingonce you graduate? Explain.•Would you recommend your work experience to other Brownstudents? Explain.The reflective essays are subject to the approval of the student'sconcentration adviser.Entry to the Professional Track requires a simple application form to becompleted by the student and approved by the Concentration Advisorat the time of the concentration declaration.  If the student has not yetdeclared a concentration, the form may be approved by the Chair of theConcentration Committee.  The Concentration Advisor will certify that allProfessional Track students have completed the necessary internshipsand will grant approval for the associated reflective essays.  All otherrequirements remain identical to those in the standard tracks in theconcentrations.Chemical and Biochemical Engineering Track:The Chemical and Biochemical Engineering program is accredited bythe Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.The education objectives of the Chemical and Biochemical Engineeringprogram are to prepare graduates: (1) to pursue productive scientificand technical careers, beginning with entry-level engineering positionsin industry, or graduate study in chemical or biochemical engineering orrelated fields; or to successfully pursue other careers that benefit from theanalytical or quantitative skills acquired through the Brown CBE Program;(2) to effectively apply the principles of chemical and biochemicalengineering, problem-solving skills, and critical and independent thinking,to a broad range of complex, multidisciplinary technological and societalproblems; (3) to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, toprofessionals and audiences of diverse backgrounds, and to pursuetechnical approaches and innovations that address the needs of societyin an ethical, safe, sustainable, and environmentally responsible manner.The student outcomes of this program are the ABET (1)- (7) StudentOutcomes as defined by the "ABET Criteria for Accrediting EngineeringPrograms" (available online at http://www.abet.org/accreditation-criteria-policies-documents/).1.

An undergraduate concentration inClassics furnishes students with a broad liberal education, and providesspecialized training for those students intending to enter graduate school.Students may choose to study Ancient Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and/orModern Greek, and to explore courses in literature, mythology, history,philosophy, and religion. Students may either pursue the standard Classicsconcentration – the most popular choice – or one of several optionaltracks: Greek, Latin, Greek and Latin, South Asian Classics, Sanskrit,Greek and Sanskrit, or Latin and Sanskrit. Concentrators who pursuean honors degree write a senior thesis, typically over the course of twosemesters during their senior year.Beginning with declarations submitted after September 1, 2018, all tracksexcept "Greek and Latin," "Greek and Sanskrit," and "Latin and Sanskrit"require the satisfactory completion of nine courses as described below.The introductory courses in Greek and Latin may not usually be countedtoward a concentration, but those in Sanskrit may be counted toward theconcentration requirement in some of the tracks.

Another lower-level physics course is necessary for astudent to develop familiarity with the tools which have been employed inproducing the physics knowledge.A natural introduction into philosophy of physics comes from a coursein Early Modern Philosophy. To a large extent, Early Modern Philosophywas shaped by scholars who combined interest in philosophy and physics(e.g., Rene Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz). Theinfluence of the XVII century physics revolution on other central figuressuch as Kant is unquestionable. Early Modern Philosophy sets anintellectual stage for many subsequent developments in the Philosophyof Physics and directly addresses some of the most perplexing issueslike the connection (or lack thereof) between physics and religion. Thecore of the Philosophy requirement involves two courses in Epistemology,Metaphysics and Philosophy of Science. One course in this field would notbe sufficient due to its very broad nature. Students are strongly advisedto take a relevant History course. This requirement can be substitutedby an additional philosophy course to reflect interests of those studentswho want a deeper background in Epistemology, Metaphysics andPhilosophy of Science or have other related interests such as AncientNatural Philosophy.In addition to the above philosophy courses, "

In studying premodern knowledge work through itsown disciplinary understandings, we explore the research methodology ofreconstruction, i.e., the argument that we must reconnect material objectswith texts, and both with laboratory research practices, to fully understandpremodern knowledge work.

Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction.CSCI0170/0180 is an introductory sequence that helps students beginto develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence to solve computationalproblems elegantly, correctly, efficiently, and with ease. The sequenceis unique in teaching both the functional and imperative programmingparadigms---the first through the languages Scheme and ML in CSCI0170;the second through Java in CSCI0180. The sequence requires noprevious programming experience. Indeed, few high school students areexposed to functional programming; hence even students with previousprogramming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part oftheir education.Although students are taught to use programming languages as tools,the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. Onthe contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science ismuch more than programming! All of the following fundamental computerscience techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms,data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, andcollaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareasof computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic,natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180,from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/serverarchitectures.FallCSCI0170S0116124MWF10:00-10:50(14)(J.

Students in EastAsian Studies will gain language proficiency and familiarity with East Asiathrough advanced courses in a variety of disciplines. Concentrators arestrongly encouraged, but not required, to study in East Asia for one ortwo semesters. The concentration requires students to demonstrate abasic proficiency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.The Language RequirementThe concentration requires students to demonstrate a basic proficiencyin Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. For the purposes of the concentration,proficiency is determined to be consistent with successful completionof the Department’s third-year course sequence in Chinese, Japanese,or Korean (0500-0600), or its equivalent. Native speakers of theselanguages may, for example, demonstrate competency such that languagecourses may be unnecessary. Department language instructors may alsodetermine that course work completed at one of the language-intensivestudy abroad programs attended by our undergraduates is comparable tocourses offered at Brown. Up to three upper level (700-999) may count aselectives for concentration credit.Note that we do not equate completion of third-year Chinese, Japanese, orKorean with fluency in these languages. Rather, we believe that studentswho have demonstrated the skills associated with third-year Chinese,Japanese, or Korean have acquired a foundational understanding of thelanguages’ grammar, vocabularies, and conversational patterns, such thatthey are able to make themselves understood in everyday situations, andto understand both spoken and written communication. For the purposes of the concentration, language courses through the third-year are treated as an accompanying requirement.Language Prerequisites (demonstrating proficiency throughthe third-year or 0600 level in one of the three languagesbelow)Chinese"

In the United States, public schools have long been apreferred (albeit imperfect) lever for equal opportunity, at times contributingto economic competitiveness, innovation, and human capital development,but far too often perpetuating larger social and economic inequalities. TheEducation Department’s mission is to understand and improve educationthrough research and teaching, with a particular focus on K-12 publiceducation in the United States.Through multiple analytical lenses and disciplinary perspectives, theEducation Studies concentration challenges students to understandhuman development, the purposes and processes of education, andthe public and private institutions that shape educational opportunitiesand outcomes. The concentration offers students a deep and broad-based grounding in key concepts and theories related to individuals(as developing children, learners, and teachers), contexts (families andcommunities), organizations (schools, government, and policy arenas),and ecosystems (history, culture) and the ways these levels interactand intersect to influence children’s development, their educationalopportunities, and their outcomes. A hallmark of our concentration isdeveloping students’ understanding of how theory is connected to bestpractice. Our concentration provides opportunities to delve into some ofsocial science’s biggest questions and to connect those questions to real-world consequences and applications.For more information, please contact John Papay(john_papay@brown.edu?subject=Education concentration), Director ofUndergraduate Studies.Concentration Requirements Concentrators take several Foundation courses in key areas (History,Policy, Human Development, Research Methods) and choose an Areaof Emphasis in which to specialize (either Policy & History or HumanDevelopment). Policy & History provides the historical underpinnings andintellectual skills for students to think critically about education issues ina number of settings. In the Human Development area, students learnabout psychological, social, and cultural processes in a variety of contexts,including schools, families, peer groups, and neighborhoods, particularlyin urban settings. The Department's website (https://www.brown.edu/academics/education/undergraduate) includes a list of concentrationadvisors.The concentration in Education Studies requires a total of 10 courses, asfollows:•Research Methods Course:  core requirement can be waived for studentswith an AP exam score of 4 or 5 in both Microeconomics andMacroeconomics.For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).Brown University            2492The core requirement of  "

Students will learn about the art, architecture, and materialculture of the ancient world, exploring things of beauty and power, as wellas the world of the everyday. Concentrators will also learn "how to do"archaeology - the techniques of locating, retrieving and analyzing ancientremains - and consider how material culture shapes our understanding ofthe past. Concentrators are encouraged to pursue research opportunitiesthrough summer fieldwork, museum experience, or independent studyprojects.The undergraduate concentration in Archaeology and the AncientWorld provides students with an opportunity to explore the multi-faceted discipline of archaeology, and encourages an interdisciplinaryapproach to engaging with the ancient world.  While the core focus ofArchaeology and the Ancient World at Brown University is archaeologyand art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East, thisconcentration encourages students to reach beyond this geographic area,to engage with Brown’s many strengths in history, epigraphy, art, ethics,engineering, religious studies, and the sciences – to name just a few. Theconcentration, with its three distinct but overlapping tracks, is intended toallow students flexibility in structuring their own path through this diversefield of study. All three tracks begin with the same foundation.

Theconcentration is also designed to allow students to build progressivelyupon what they have learned, moving from introductory courses to upper-level seminars.It is expected that, in completing the requirements for this concentration,students will incorporate courses that offer new perspectives on thecomplex dynamics of social inequity, exclusion, and difference, andwhich encourage engagement with the community – both by enrolling inclasses designated as Diverse Perspectives in Liberal Learning (DPLL)and through non-DPLL classes that explore similar themes.  Researchopportunities, through summer fieldwork, internships, museum experience,or independent study projects, are strongly encouraged.Within this concentration, the three tracks are:•Archaeology and the Ancient World: the most flexible of theconcentration tracks, allowing students to explore any region or timeperiod, and to develop their own areas of focus, such as museumstudies, ethics and politics of the past, engineering and materialsanalysis, cultural heritage, or environmental studies.•Classical Archaeology: for those interested chiefly in the ‘classic’civilizations of the Mediterranean (especially Greece and Rome),as well as for those interested in both earlier (prehistoric) and later(medieval) periods in that geographic region.•Egyptian and Near Eastern Archaeology: for those interested chieflyin the cultures of Egypt and the ancient ‘Near East’ – Anatolia, theLevant, Mesopotamia – from prehistoric through Islamic times.Required Courses:The student must take a total of 10 courses, including:CORE REQUIREMENTS:4All three tracks share four Core Requirements: twointroductory courses providing an overview of archaeology’stwo central aspects (field methodologies, and art history); andtwo introductory courses in the core geographical focus of theJoukowsky Institute (Classical/Mediterranean archaeologyand Egyptian/Near Eastern archaeology).One introductory course in archaeological methodology and/orscientific approaches, preferably:1, with permission.5Note that , with permission.2 or  or   with permission.2No course may be "double-counted" to satisfy both the mathematical-economics and data methods requirement.Honors and Capstone Requirement:Admission to candidacy for honors in the concentration is granted on thefollowing basis: 3.7 GPA for Economics courses, and 3.5 GPA overall.

Medieval Cultures focuses on the6th-15th centuries, combining interdisciplinary perspectives with in-depthstudy of one or two related disciplines.Late Antique Cultures deals with the 3rd-9th centuries, when ancientcultural forms were still in place but medieval cultures were beginning totake shape simultaneously. The first undergraduate degree of its kind inthis country, Late Antique Cultures studies the changing relation of culturalpractices, social patterns, political and economics forms, and artistic andliterary traditions in this imporant transition period.A traditional area of study in Medieval Cultures is Western Europe in theHigh Middle Ages, but students are encouraged to work comparatively inByzantine, Islamic, Judaic and/or Slavic cultures in the middle ages.Medieval Cultures Track It is recommended that prospective concentrators take the introductorycourse, Medieval Perspectives, during their freshman or sophomore year.RequirementsTen courses approved by the Program in Medieval Studies, including twocourses in medieval history and one 1000- or 2000-level course that usesprimary texts in a medieval language other than Middle English. Interestedstudents are invited to discuss their plans with an appropriate facultymember of the Program. A concentration proposal should be prepared inconsultation with the faculty advisor and submitted to the Program Chairfor approval.Under the supervision of the director of the program, studentsmay choose courses from the following:"

Particular attention is paid to issues of readingengagement for striving adolescent readers, issues of access to literacythrough adolescent literature, ways that adolescent literature can be pairedwith the classics, and issues of censorship in American public schoolclassrooms and public libraries. Students in this course will walk awaywith an understanding of the place of adolescent literature in today’sdebates as well as a background in choosing, reading, and analyzing theliterature itself. Written assignments include weekly reading responses, anannotated bibliography, and a short, 3-5 page paper. There is a substantialamount of independent self-selected reading as well as one collaborativegroup project with a presentation.FallEDUC1090S0115861M3:00-5:30(05)(L.

Undergraduate Teacher Education Program(regardless of student start date)Note: The Undergraduate Teacher Education Program is not aconcentration.  It consists of a series of courses which will preparestudents for secondary teacher certification.The Department of Education, in cooperation with other departments,offers a program of study in teacher education leading to certificationin secondary school teaching: the Undergraduate Teacher EducationProgram (UTEP).  This program is offered in English, History/SocialStudies, Science (Biology, Chemistry, or Engineering/Physics), and leadsto state certification for public school teaching in these fields.The Undergraduate Teacher Education Program consists of threecomponents: courses in educational theory, courses in the teaching field,and student teaching.  These are designed to complement and enhancethe liberal education derived from concentration courses and electives.Students who are interested in completing the Undergraduate Teachereducation Program must confer with the Education Department as earlyas possible in order to plan a coherent program.  The program includes amethods course, offered during the summer in conjunction with teaching atBrown Summer High School, between Semesters VI and VII.Courses in the teaching fieldBecause the program emphasizes the importance of knowledge inthe teaching field, students are  required to complete an academicconcentration in the subject which they are preparing to teach or a closelyrelated field.  This does not mean that a student must elect a standardconcentration in the field.  However, such a student must, as part of orin addition to his/her chosen concentration, elect a substantive numberof courses in his/her teaching field.  Students considering the programshould consult with advisors both in the academic department and in theEducation Department to design an appropriate program of study thatmeets Rhode Island state certification requirements and those of manyother states.All of the required courses in education must be taken at Brown.

(See the “Study Elsewhere”section of the University Bulletin for procedures, or contact the Deanof the College.) Transfer courses that are used to meet Engineeringconcentration requirements must be approved by the student’sconcentration advisor, and must be described briefly on the student’selectronic concentration form.  Transfer courses that are determined bythe concentration advisor to be substantially equivalent to a requiredBrown course automatically fulfill concentration requirements. In rarecases, students may petition the concentration committee to use coursesthat do not have an equivalent offered at Brown to meet a concentrationrequirement.  Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if thestudent’s overall program meets published educational outcomes forthe concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, andengineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements.Students should consult their concentration advisor for assistance withdrafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit ismade by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee.Substitutions for Required CoursesA student may petition the Concentration Adviser to substitute a coursein place of a requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if thestudent's modified program continues to meet the published educationaloutcomes for the concentration, and has sufficient basic science,mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet accreditationrequirements.   If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher levelcourse in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere,it can be approved by the Concentration Adviser. (For courses takenelsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred.)  Students wishing tomake substitutions of a broader nature should consult their ConcentrationAdviser for assistance with drafting their petition to the EngineeringConcentration Committee, which may be approved by a majority vote.Standard Program for the A.B. degree:Candidates for the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree with a concentrationin Engineering must complete at least eight approved Engineeringcourses. The eight courses must include at least two 1000-levelEngineering courses.

Smailbegovic)The Experiment: Poetry and Knowledge2. ONE course in Medieval and Renaissance Literatures(Pre-1700):1These courses, which center on Medieval and Renaissanceliterary works, cast light on periods that can come acrossto us as both familiar and strange. They focus our attentionon how literatures from these periods depict concepts suchas aesthetics, romance, gender, sexuality, race, power andpolitics in ways that are like and unlike how we tend to think ofthem today—on how pre-modern or early modern works canboth defamiliarize the categories of experience and identitywe tend to take for granted and also suggest somethingof their origins. Several courses under this rubric will alsoengage with recent literary and filmic adaptations of worksfrom these eras, exploring how many such works continue tofunction as vibrant and at times ambivalent inspirations for theliterary imaginings of later periods.3. ONE course in Literatures of Modernity (Post-1700):1These courses explore the many strands of writing in Englishthat have emerged from the eighteenth century through thepresent, shaping the contemporary world. These literaturesreflect on political, economic, and intellectual history, from theidea of the nation and the structures of capital through the riseand dissolution of empire and the emergence of postcolonialstates, including the forms of race, gender and sexuality thatcut across them. Courses also examine how aesthetic workscan shape and critique their moment: they look at genres likethe novel and short story, poetry, drama, essays, and new,hybrid forms that have arisen with expanding digital media;they also take up a multitude of literary movements whoseinfluences remain with us today, including Romanticism,realism, naturalism, modernism, and post-modernism.4. ONE course in Literatures of the Color Line:1In 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois famously proclaimed in "The Soulsof Black Folk" that “The problem of the twentieth century isthe problem of the color-line,—the relation of the darker tothe lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America andthe islands of the sea.” Courses in this category explorethe complex ways in which literary texts have addressedAmerican histories of race, ethnicity, and empire. They maydo so from the vantage point of ideas about difference andhierarchy that predate the modern conception of race and byengaging with earlier histories of conflict and contact. Thesecourses explore issues of intersectionality as well, highlightinghow race operates in relation to other structures of differencesuch as gender, sexuality and class."

Canwe speak of a single methodology that ties GNSS together? How mightscholars work on gender and/or sexuality while respecting disciplinaryboundaries and training? We will start with the premise that studiesin gender and sexuality are tied together by critique that questionsfoundational assumptions and takes account of its own position within agiven field of knowledge. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongsidedisciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, wewill investigate how critique operates and how standards of evidence aremarshaled in particular disciplines.SprGNSS2000S0125161T3:00-5:30(D.

But upon thesepremises, the question would nonetheless arise: how might any passionbe addressed or ascertained in this way, if each affect would always differfrom any word that may be given of it?

Today the region remains in many ways colonial, as Quechua- andAymara-speaking villagers face a Spanish-speaking state, as well as anever-more-integrated world market, the pressures of neoliberal reformfrom international banks, and the melting of the Andean glaciers.FallHIST1340S0116752TTh9:00-10:20(02)(J.

How didrefrigerators, automobiles, washing machines, stereos, and blue jeansbecome proxies of the world superpowers and mechanisms of impersonalrule in the hands of local regimes? How were Caribbean populationstransformed by modernizing and developmentalist policies, and how didthey resist the marketed allure of empires? Consuming the Cold War inthe Caribbean answers these questions, exploring the politics of modernmaterial and visual regimes in Cuba and the region during the post WWIIera, addressing such regimes as mechanisms of soft power, impersonalrule, political critique, and resistance.FallLACA1503PS0117346T4:00-6:30(09)’To Be Arranged'"

We stress creative thinking and criticalproduction: comparative analysis and theoretical reflection, as well aswork that integrates practice and theory. We thus bring together aspectsof modern culture that are normally separated by departmental structuressuch as film and media studies, fine art, literature, literary arts andphilosophy. This concentration offers the student a range of possiblespecializations.  A student might decide to focus on the critical studyand production of a certain type or combination of media (print,photography, sound recording, cinema, video, television, and digitalmedia); or they might focus on certain cultural, theoretical and/or socialformations (for example, gender/sexuality in post-Cold war television,postcolonial theory and film, the changing form of the novel, theories ofsubjectivity and ideology, video games and theories of representation).  These paths are united by a commitment to critical thinking/practice:rather than reproducing conventions, MCM concentrators learn howconventions emerge, what work they do, and explore ways to changethem.Track ITrack I concentrators may choose to study a particular historical moment,a medium, or a mode of textual production, in combination with theoreticalstudies that examine the categories of cultural analysis: for example,the distinction between high and low culture. Examples of areas ofinterest include but are not limited to film, gender/sexuality, digital media,television, post-coloniality, the novel, modern thought, the modern arts,sound, and theories of ideology and subjectivity. Productive work in somemodern medium or textual mode is encouraged for all concentrators.MCM’s approach to production recognizes the inextricable link betweentheory and practice, and the possibility of a fruitful complicity betweenthem. Production, in the sense defined here, is a theoretically informedsphere or practice, one within which acknowledged forms of culturalcreation are tested and extended in close complementarity with theanalyses conducted elsewhere in MCM.Track I consists of 11 courses.Core courses"

If pursuing a capstone project, students will be required tosubmit, by the end of the shopping period of the fall of their senior year,  ashort proposal (300 words) that describes how they are going to completethis requirement.An Honors Thesis is a two-semester independent study supervised by athesis advisor ().  These two courses constitute the additionalcourses needed for honors in the concentration.An honors thesis can be textual, or it can take other forms (multi-media,visual, artistic, or musical, for example).  The form and substance of a non-textual honors thesis must conform to the rigorous regulations set out bythe relevant department(s) and the Dean of the College.Additional Honors RequirementsTo be eligible for Honors, students will have earned an "A" in the majorityof courses for the concentration.Students may graduate with Honors in South Asian Studies by completingan undergraduate Honors thesis under the supervision of at least onereader drawn from the CCSA faculty* and one additional reader from theBrown (or RISD, in the case of Brown-RISD students) faculty community.In order to pursue Honors, students must submit the following materials tothe CCSA DUS by April 25:1.A prospectus (3-5 pages, describing the major research questions andmethods to be used, complete with bibliography) that has been readand vetted by the student's intended primary reader. 2.An email from the faculty member who will serve as primary reader tothe CCSA DUS noting their willingness to advise on the thesis. In addition, students must:1.Enroll in a two-semester sequence of Independent Study, or under a relevant depawrtment course code2.Designate a second reader by September 30 of the senior year. Second readers should also confirm their willingness to serve as areader by sending an email to the CCSA DUS.  3.Be in regular contact with the thesis advisor about the progress of theproject.4.Present their research to the CCSA community during their finalsemester. For mid-year graduating students, the topic and primary reader must beidentified and confirmed by mid-November of the junior year, and a secondreader must be arranged and confirmed by January 30 of the senior year.A complete penultimate draft of the thesis is due to both readers on April1.  A final draft that incorporates readers' comments is due back to thereaders on April 15 of the student's senior year.* This includes all people listed under the Faculty, Postdoctoral Associate,and Visiting Scholars (limited to those in residence at Brown) tabs on theCCSA website.StatisticsThe Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics is designed to providefoundations that include basic statistical concepts and methodologies,and to expose students to the role of statistical thinking and analysisin interdisciplinary research and in the public sphere. To ensure deeprigorous understanding of the foundations and main methods of analysisin statistics, the program is composed of three parts: a) foundations inmathematics and computing, combined with an introduction to statisticalthinking and practice; b) four core courses on the fundamentals ofstatistical theory and data analysis; and c) more advanced materialcovering important areas of statistical methodology. A capstone projectinvolving substantial data analysis or focused on methodology/theory isrequired. Students also have opportunities to acquire practical experiencein study design, data management, and statistical analysis by working asundergraduate research assistants in projects in one of the participatingacademic departments or Research Centers at Brown.The Concentration is based on several premises: that statistics is ascientific discipline in its own right, with specialized methodologies andbody of knowledge; that it is essentially concerned with the art andscience of data analysis; and that it is best taught in conjunction withspecific, substantive applications. To this end, the Concentration isdesigned to provide foundations that include basic statistical conceptsand methodologies, and to expose students to the role of statisticalthinking and analysis in interdisciplinary research and in the publicsphere.  The Concentration prepares students for careers in industryand government, for graduate study in statistics or biostatistics and othersciences, as well as for professional study in law, medicine, business, orpublic administration. The undergraduate concentration guide is availablehere (https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostatistics/undergraduate-statistics-concentration).The Undergraduate Concentration in Statistics is administered by theDepartment of Biostatistics and leads to a Sc.B. degree. To ensuredeep rigorous understanding of the foundations and main methodsof analysis in statistics, the program is composed of three parts. Thefirst part entails foundations in mathematics and computing, combinedwith an introduction to statistical thinking and practice. The second partincludes four core courses that provide a comprehensive account ofthe fundamentals of statistical theory and data analysis. The third partdelves into more advanced material covering important areas of statisticalmethodology. In addition to the formal coursework, students are requiredto complete a capstone project that involves a substantial data analysisor a methodological/theoretical project.  Students also have opportunitiesto acquire practical experience in study design, data management, andstatistical analysis by working as undergraduate research assistants inprojects in one of the participating academic Departments or ResearchCenters at Brown.

Africana  Studies engages issues abouthistorical and contemporary responses to local and global crises.  Itengages with how people of color create their own knowledge culturallyand politically.  It is  oftentimes a critique of how forms of knowledge areproduced. Concentrators acquire a host of interdisciplinary skills thatallow them to ask questions about the world around them, and forms of  knowledge production while  developing critical analytical skills.  Ourconcentrators deploy these skills in  other classes, enriching  their owngeneral intellectual development.In order to develop requisite competency in the discipline of AfricanaStudies, concentrators must complete eight (8) semester-long coursesoffered by or cross-listed with the Department. Six (6) courses must havean AFRI prefix or be offered by Africana Studies core faculty.  Two (2)courses can be cross-listed.  In some cases, Concentrators may petitionthe Department to accept other appropriate courses. Of these 8 courses,the following Africana Studies courses are required:•"

TheDepartment of Anthropology at Brown is a vibrant, award-winning groupof scholars working primarily in the subfields of cultural anthropology,archaeology, and anthropological linguistics.  The concentration providesstudents with a broad introduction to the discipline and includes themajor subdisciplines of the field: sociocultural anthropology, archaeology,anthropological linguistics, and biological anthropology. The departmentalso allows students to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program (https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/special-programs/public-service/engaged-scholars-program). ESP is for students with an interest in makingdeeper connections between their concentration curriculum and long-termengaged activities such as internships, public service, humanitarian anddevelopment work, archaeological excavations, and many other possibleforms of community involvement.Concentrators should select their courses in anthropology in consultationwith the concentration advisor.

The basic mathematical skills ofApplied Mathematics come from a variety of sources, which depend onthe problems of interest: the theory of ordinary and partial differentialequations, matrix theory, statistical sciences, probability and decisiontheory, risk and insurance analysis, among others. Applied Mathematicsappeals to people with a variety of different interests, ranging from thosewith a desire to obtain a good quantitative background for use in somefuture career, to those who are interested in the basic techniques andapproaches in themselves. The standard concentration leads to eitherthe A.B. or Sc.B. degree. Students may also choose to pursue a jointprogram with biology, computer science or economics. The undergraduateconcentration guide is available here (http://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/undergraduate).Both the A.B. and Sc.B. concentrations in Applied Mathematics requirecertain basic courses to be taken, but beyond this there is a great dealof flexibility as to which areas of application are pursued. Students areencouraged to take courses in applied mathematics, mathematics and oneor more of the application areas in the natural sciences, social sciencesor engineering. Whichever areas are chosen should be studied in somedepth.Standard program for the A.B. degree.Prerequisites"

Studentsmust become knowledgeable in four areas of emphasis: perception,cognition, language, and cognitive neuroscience, as well as a set ofmethods relevant to Cognitive Science research. Students then createtheir own focus area of study, potentially integrating coursework fromthe Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences department witha diverse subset of fields including Computer Science, Neuroscience,Philosophy, Anthropology, Applied Math and Education.The A.B. programis primarily for students interested in studying human mental processesand acquiring a research orientation to the study of the mind. TheSc.B. program is designed for students who wish to develop a strongerbackground in Cognitive Science and requires students to engagein a specific research project in the focus area of their choosing. Werecommend that prospective concentrators register for one of the gatewaycourses and at least one other core course in their first or second year.Concentration Requirements (Effective, Classof 2019)The A.B. concentration requires 12 courses.

The aim of the program is toencourage students to study a varied and illustrative range of literarytopics rather than the total development of a single literary tradition.  Trueto the spirit of Brown’s New Curriculum, a concentration in ComparativeLiterature affords great academic freedom.  For example: advancedcourses in any literature department at Brown count for concentrationcredit; although English is commonly one of the languages that studentsapply to their Comparative Literature studies, basically any language--ancient or modern--supported at Brown may form part of a ComparativeLiterature concentration program.  In essence, concentrators study agenerous range of literary works--from Western cultures, both ancient andmodern, to Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic--and develop a focused criticalunderstanding of how cultures differ from one another.  ComparativeLiterature differs from other literature concentrations largely through itsinternational focus and its broad-gauged view of art and culture in whichthe study of languages is combined with the analysis of literature andliterary theory. All students take a course in literary theory and have theopportunity to complete a senior essay.Please contact Professor D (stephanie_merrim@brown.edu)ore Levy(dore_levy@brown.edu?subject=comp lit concentration), the Director ofUndergraduate Studies, with questions.There are three concentration tracks in Comparative Literature, as follows:Track 1: Concentration in ComparativeLiterature with two languages•Complete prerequisites(s) for taking 1000-level courses in yourtwo languages by Semester V (students working in non-EuropeanFor up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).220         Undergraduate Concentrationslanguages may be allowed more latitude; be sure to consult aconcentration advisor about constructing an individualized plan).•Comparative Literature 1210 (asic Physics A1asic Physics ATotal Credits171 For the current list of approved courses in all categories, see theCLPS Psychology page.Public HealthPublic Health is an interdisciplinary concentration through which studentsexamine a variety of health issues, including population health anddisease, health policy, cross-cultural and international aspects of health,the organizational and social structures through which health servicesare delivered and received, and the public health system. Coursesin the concentration allow students to explore the ways in which thesocial, political, behavioral and biological sciences contribute to theunderstanding of patterns of population distributions of health and disease.The concentration also provides students with courses in basic researchmethods and statistics necessary for problem solving and critical thinkingin the emerging emphasis on evidence-based health care and publichealth.The undergraduate component to the five-year AB/MPH differsin some ways from the Public Health concentration.

Inmost areas of science and in many liberal arts fields, cutting-edge workdepends increasingly on computational approaches. The undergraduateprogram at Brown is designed to combine breadth in practical andtheoretical computer science with depth in specialized areas. These areasrange from traditional topics, such as analysis of algorithms, artificialintelligence, databases, distributed systems, graphics, mobile computing,networks, operating systems, programming languages, robotics andsecurity, to novel areas including games and scientific visualization.Our requirements are built on a collection of pathways, each representinga well defined area within computer science.  Concentrators interested inparticular areas can choose the courses included in particular pathways.  Conversely, concentrators who are unsure of their area of interest butwho have particularly enjoyed certain courses can choose pathways thatinclude these concentrations.  Students may not use more than two CSCI1970 courses to complete the requirements for the Sc.B. and one CSCI1970 course for the A.B. requirements.Requirements for the Standard Track of theSc.B. degreePrerequisites (0-3 courses)Calculus prerequisite: students must complete or place out ofsecond semester calculus.0-3"

It prepares students for professional careers that incorporateaspects of economics and computer technology and for academic careersconducting research in areas that emphasize the overlap between thetwo fields. Concentrators may choose to pursue either the A.B. or theSc.B. degree. While the A.B. degree allows students to explore thetwo disciplines by taking advanced courses in both departments, itssmaller number of required courses is compatible with a liberal education.The Sc.B. degree achieves greater depth in both computer scienceand economics by requiring more courses, and it offers students theopportunity to creatively integrate both disciplines through a designrequirement. In addition to courses in economics, computer science, andapplied mathematics, all concentrators must fulfill the Computer Sciencedepartment's writing requirement by passing a course that involvessignificant expository writing.Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree.Prerequisites (3 courses):ccelerated Introduction to ComputerScience (and an additional CS course nototherwise used to satisfy a concentrationrequirement; this course may be CSCI0180, an intermediate-level CS course, ora 1000-level course.)Two of the following intermediate courses, one of which must bemath-oriented and one systems-oriented.2ccelerated Introduction to ComputerScience (and an additional CS course nototherwise used to satisfy a concentrationrequirement; this course may be CSCI0180, an intermediate-level course, or a1000-level course)Two of the following intermediate courses, one of which must bemath-oriented and one systems-oriented:2ccelerated Introduction to ComputerScience (and an additional CS course nototherwise used to satisfy a concentrationrequirement; this course may be CSCI0180, an intermediate-level CS course, ora 1000-level CS course)"

By virtueof its broad interdisciplinary nature, the study of decision making coverswork found in a variety of more traditional disciplines including psychology,cognitive science, economics, philosophy, computer science, andneuroscience. Professor Steven Sloman (steven_sloman@brown.edu?subject=Behavioral Decision Sciences) is the concentration advisor.

Students with multiple concentrations maynot apply more than 2 courses from a second concentration to the AB inBehavioral Decision Sciences.  No more than 2 courses can be transferredfrom another institution to count toward concentration credit.HonorsStudents interested in honors should identify a faculty honor's sponsor andsign up with the concentration advisor during Semester 6.  Although thereis no minimum grade point average to enter the program, admission to theprogram is limited to students who have accumulated a strong academicrecord, and show evidence that they will meet the program's requirements.  It is expected that honors candidates will conduct a year-long researchproject under the direction of a faculty sponsor culminating in a writtenthesis at the end of Semester 8.  Honors theses can serve to satisfy thecapstone requirement, although honors students are expected to attendthe capstone seminar in the fall of their senior year.Biochemistry & Molecular BiologyHow does life work at the molecular level? This question is at the coreof the concentration program Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Inearlier years of this discipline, the focus was on structure and function ofproteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates and small molecules suchas vitamins. Today the logical approach and tools of biochemical scienceare being expanded to new areas in neuroscience, developmental biology,immunology, pharmacology and synthetic biology (the design of analogsof biological systems). Training in biochemistry begins with a foundationin mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. Some courses offered inother departments, including engineering, geology and computer science,are also useful. A key component of this program is the year of hands-onresearch carried out in collaboration with a faculty member here at Brown.Faculty sponsors are drawn from both the Chemistry Department and theDivision of Biology and Medicine, and include basic science and clinicalfaculty.Standard program for the Sc.B. degreeStudents must take twenty courses in biology, chemistry,mathematics, and physics, including the following corerequirements, some of these may be fulfilled with AP credits.Students are expected to take courses that will count towardthe concentration ABC/NC.  Students should discuss the S/NCoption with their concentration advisor if circumstances warrantconsideration.  Students should not register S/NC for a concentrationcourse without advisor pre-approval.Three courses in mathematics, statistics and/or computerscience, typically including "

Concentratorsseek to understand the basic principles, approaches and vocabularyrelevant to the study of entrepreneurship from the disciplines ofeconomics, organizational sociology and engineering. Building on thismultidisciplinary base, students develop specialized expertise in oneof the three disciplinary approaches, with special emphasis on criticalreasoning and quantitative research methods. In senior year capstoneprojects, students apply and integrate multi-disciplinary learning byworking in groups on real world projects, including the creation of newventures. BEO students interested in the theory and practice of addressingsocial challenges might consider the Engaged Scholars Program (https://www.brown.edu/academics/business-entrepreneurship-organizations/beo-engaged-scholar-program-esp).The three tracks of the concentration are as follows:1.Business Economics2.Organizational Studies3.Entrepreneurship and Technology ManagementUpon completion of all concentration requirements, students receivethe Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree in Business, Entrepreneurship andOrganizations.The CurriculumBusiness Economics Track(Effective beginning with the graduating classof 2021)Foundation Requirements (foundation requirements mustbe completed before taking the capstone in fall of senioryear)enior Conference CourseTotal Credits211Other approved courses in applied mathematics, biology, computerscience, geological sciences, or engineering may be substituted forsome of the twenty-one.Students are advised to take at least six courses in the humanitiesand social sciences.Honors Requirements for Chemical PhysicsAll ScB Chemical Physics concentrators who completes the followingrequirements are candidates for Honors; no separate application isnecessary.The requirements for Honors in Chemical Physics are:* A strong grade record in concentration courses.

This is to be prepared in connection withunder the direction of a faculty supervisor.Physics and PhilosophyThe Physics and Philosophy concentration is for students with a deepinterest in physics who do not need to acquire the laboratory andcomputational skills of a professional physicist. The concentration allowsstudents to grapple with computational problems and deepen theirinvestigation of conceptual and epistemological issues. By the end of theprogram, concentrators possess an excellent conceptual understandingof the most philosophically interesting physics, relativity and quantummechanics.This concentration should prepare a student either for graduate study,especially in a history and philosophy of science (HPS) program, orfor employment in science education or journalism. Other professionssuch as law and medicine will look favorably on such concentrators forhaving versatile interests and being able to master difficult material. Theconcentration may serve as an excellent preparation for a law schoolsince physics and philosophy both exercise a rigorous approach toproblems of immediate relevance to life but at the same time assume twocomplimentary and sometimes competing viewpoints.AdvisingConcentration advisors from the Departments of Physics and Philosophywill guide students working towards the A.B. degree.CurriculumThe curriculum builds around the fields of physics that have had thebiggest impact on philosophy, especially Quantum Physics, and thefields of philosophy most relevant for physics, such as Epistemology,Metaphysics and Philosophy of Physics. It is strongly recommended thatstudents complete at least one relevant history course.There are 11 required courses (5 in Physics, 5 in Philosophy orHistory, one course in mathematics) and a final project. The choiceof the courses is dictated by the following considerations. The fieldof physics with both deepest philosophical implications and deepestinfluence on the rest of physics is Quantum Mechanics. Thus, a1000-level course in Quantum Mechanics or a closely related fieldsuch as Statistical Mechanics is indispensable. The second fieldof physics most relevant for the concentration is Relativity. Thisfield touches upon and serves as a foundation for a broad list ofsubjects with major philosophical implications of their own, forexample: enior Conference CourseA course from the "

It fosters scholarlyskills such as close reading (of texts, images, artifacts, and other socialdata), excellence in writing and verbal expression, interpretation of thepast and present from multiple forms of evidence, and assessmentof contemporary social issues. By exploring the public and privateconcerns that the study of religion highlights -- for example, the creationof community, the nature of the individual, suffering and death, notionsof good and evil -- students discover new ways of engaging the complexworld in which they live. As students examine religious activity in theAmericas, South and East Asia, the Middle East and West Asia, Africa,and Europe, they not only learn about the formation and transmissionof beliefs, behaviors, values, rituals, and identities but also come tounderstand how diverse peoples have expressed religious understandingsof themselves and others through politics, institutions, conflicts, andspaces commonly recognized as secular.1.

In order to qualify, thecandidate for honors in the Department of Classics ordinarily will beentering his/her seventh semester of study and must have an “A” average(3.50 or higher on a 4.00 scale) in the concentration.Cognitive NeuroscienceCognitive neuroscience is the study of higher cognitive functions inhumans and their underlying neural bases. It is an integrative area ofstudy drawing primarily from cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience,and linguistics. There are two broad directions that can be taken inthis concentration - one is behavioral/experimental and the other iscomputational/modeling. In both, the goal is to understand the nature ofcognition from a neural perspective. The standard concentration for theSc.B. degree requires courses on the foundations, systems level, andintegrative aspects of cognitive neuroscience as well as laboratory andelective courses that fit within a particular theme or category such asgeneral cognition, perception, language development or computational/modeling. Concentrators must also complete a senior seminar course oran independent research course. Students may also participate in thework of the Brown Institute for Brain Science, an interdisciplinary programthat unites ninety faculty from eleven departments.Standard Program for the AB degree(Effective Class of 2019)The A.B. concentration requires 12 courses.

The definitionof “science” is flexible.  A good number of these courses will be outside ofCLPS, but several CLPS courses might fit into a coherent package as well.

The concentration isgrounded in the social sciences – anthropology, sociology, politicalscience, and economics – but it also heavily draws from history, art, andother disciplines in the humanities. The requirements are designed withthree goals in mind: first, provide concentrators a solid foundation in thequestion of development; second, allow concentrators to develop expertisein a specific region that is of interest to them; third, give concentratorsaccess to a wide range of courses in a large number of disciplines ofinterest to them. Concentrators are encouraged to do their own originalfield research. During the senior year, concentrators complete a capstoneexperience tailored to their interests (http://brown.edu/academics/development-studies/about/what-ds-capstone) in some aspect ofinternational development.

EDUC 2090L,"iteracy Across the Curriculum1Egyptology and AssyriologyThe concentration in Egyptology and Assyriology offers students a choiceof two tracks: Assyriology or Egyptology. The department promotescollaborations with other academic units at Brown devoted to the study ofantiquity including Archaeology, Classics, Judaic Studies, and ReligiousStudies. Egyptology and Assyriology also collaborates with Brown'sJoukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World.Assyriology TrackAlso known as the Near East or Middle East, Western Asia includespresent-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and other neighboring states, a broadgeographic area that was connected in antiquity with the wider world—the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia,and the Asian subcontinent. Students will be exposed to the criticalstudy of the ancient cultures of this region (ca. 3400 B.C.E.–100 C.E.)using the tools of archaeology, epigraphy, and historical inquiry. A varietyof interdisciplinary, comparative, and theoretical approaches will beintroduced to give students the tools and methods to explore this region’sancient languages and literatures, political and socio-economic modes oforganization, art and architecture, religious traditions and other systems ofknowledge, such as early science.The Assyriology (ASYR) track requires a total of at least ten (10) coursesthat are determined in the following way:Introductory courses:3"
ASYR 0800T,"he Cradle of Civilization? An Introductionto the Ancient Near Eastor he Cradle of Civilization? An Introductionto the Ancient Near Eastor "
ARCH 1600A,"rchaeologies of the Near Eastrchaeologies of the Near EastElective Course: Any course germane to ancient Egypt or theancient Near East or Mediterranean world. Alternative andelective courses must be approved by the undergraduateconcentration advisor. Such courses will normally be offeredby Egyptology and Assyriology, the Joukowsky Institute forArchaeology and the Ancient World, Religious Studies, Classics,Judaic Studies, Anthropology, History of Art and Architecture,History, or Philosophy. Concentrators are welcome to take mostcourses offered by Egyptology and Assyriology (EGYT andASYR), Archaeology (ARCH), or related departments, thoughsome may require the instructor’s approval. Concentratorsshould consult with the concentration advisor to discuss thecourses most suitable to their interests.1Total Credits101 Required for all students pursuing the Egyptology track.2Or an EGYT or ARCH course in material culture.CapstoneAll concentrators in Egyptology and Assyriology are required to completea capstone project. The project can take many forms, but the commonfeature shared among all possible projects will be a public presentation.Typically in the final semester before graduating, the concentrator willgive this capstone presentation before faculty, fellow students, and otherinterested audiences. If the concentrator is writing an undergraduatehonors thesis, the procedure for which is detailed below, this work shouldprovide the content for the capstone presentation. Students not writingan honors thesis will base their presentation on a research project morein depth than a class project, though the topic may stem from a courseproject or paper. The format of the presentation may vary; suggestionsrange from an illustrated lecture to a video or an installation presented withdiscussion. Both the content and the format of the capstone project shouldbe discussed with and agreed upon by the concentration advisor no laterthan the end of the first semester of the senior year.Honors in Egyptology and Assyriology1. Becoming an honors candidateStudents who wish to consider pursuing honors should meet with theUndergraduate Concentration Advisor in the first half of their sixthsemester.Eligibility is dependent on:•Being in good standing•Having completed at least two thirds of the concentration requirementsby the end of the sixth semester.•Having earned two-thirds "quality grades" in courses counted towardsthe concentration. A "quality grade" is defined as a grade of "A" or agrade of "S" accompanied by a course performance report indicating aperformance at the "A" standard.To pursue honors candidacy, eligible students must:•Secure a faculty advisor and discuss plans for the proposed thesisproject well before the established deadline; this can be done by emailwhen a student is abroad.•Prepare a thesis prospectus (see below).•Submit the prospectus to the advisor, one other proposed facultyreader (at least one of the readers must be in the department) and thedepartment chair no later than the first week of the seventh semester.The structure of a thesis prospectus:An honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is a substantial piece ofresearch with some degree of originality that demonstrates the student'sability to frame an appropriate question and deal critically with the range oforiginal and secondary sources.  A thesis prospectus is a short analyticaldocument consisting of several parts.  It will normally include a conciseand focused research question; a justification for that question thatdemonstrates familiarity with previous research on the topic; a projectdescription that includes a discussion of the types of evidence availableand appropriate to answering the proposed question; a discussion ofmethods of collecting and analyzing that evidence; a conclusion thatreturns to the research question and assures the reader that the projectwill add value to our understanding of the topic; and a bibliography.  Theprospectus will ordinarily be in the range of 5-7 pages in length, exclusiveof bibliography.  The prospectus will include proper citations throughout.Determination of whether or not a student may pursue the proposedproject will be made on review of the prospectus by the readers anddepartment chair. Prospectuses will be evaluated on the following scale:1.No concerns about the viability of the project.2.No concerns about the viability of the project, but minor weaknesses inthe execution of the prospectus. 3.Concerns about the viability of the project, but willingness toreevaluate a revised prospectus submitted within two weeks of receiptof evaluation.For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).236         Undergraduate Concentrations4.Reservations that the prospectus does not describe an honors-worthyproject.5.Poorly conceived and shoddy work. Prospectuses will be returned to the student with this numerical evaluationand comments one week after submission of the prospectus.  Aprospectus must receive an evaluation of 1 or 2 prior to the third weekof the seventh semester for a student to be admitted to the honors track.Students who submit an original prospectus that is graded 4 or 5 will notbe permitted to rework the prospectus for the second submission. 2. Developing, completing and submitting the honors projectOnce accepted as honors candidates, students will pursue a course ofstudy that goes beyond what is expected of a regular concentrator.  Thisincludes:•Enrollment in two semesters of independent study in Egyptologyor Assyriology (these do not fulfill course requirements towards theconcentration).•Twice-monthly meetings with the thesis advisor and once-monthlymeetings with the second reader.  These meetings will be scheduledat the beginning of each term.•Submission of a comprehensive outline to both readers no later thanOctober 15 (for May graduates)•Regular submission of drafts.  A partial draft including a completeversion of at least one chapter or section is due before Reading Periodof the seventh semester.•A complete draft is due to both readers no later than March 15 (forMay graduates).•The revised final thesis is due in both electronic and physical form toboth readers and department chair April 5  (for May graduates).Failure to meet any deadline will result in automatic termination of thehonors process.  No extensions will be granted.  If a thesis is turned in latebut before the end of the term, credit and grade for the Independent Studymay still be granted.3. Evaluating the submitted work of honors candidatesIn order to receive honors a student must be found to have:•Remained in good academic standing throughout the academic year.•Not violated the Academic Code of Conduct during honors candidacy.•Complete or be about to complete all concentration requirements.•Produced a thesis that is judged by the readers to meet thedepartment's expectations for honors work (see below), and turned itin by the established deadlines.•Successfully defended the thesis during a half hour public presentationheld during the final exam period of the eighth semester.Students who submit theses that are deemed to fall short of theexpectations will graduate without honors.  In that case, the theses willcount as a capstone project.4. Expectations for honors theses:Originality:An honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is expected to add toexisting scholarship.  The thesis must be based on close work with primarysources (usually in publication rather than in person), supplemented bycritical engagement with a substantial amount of relevant secondaryliterature.  While the resulting study is not necessarily expected to beground-breakingly original, and may engage with a well-studied topic,it will usually include a new insight into or interpretation of the materialconsidered.Scope:An honors thesis is not a book or dissertation.  It is, however, a veryserious piece of research and writing for which two dedicated studycourses have provided substantial time to the honors student.  Thequestion upon which the honors thesis is based should be focused enoughto allow an in-depth treatment, generally in under 100 pages or 30,000words (exclusive of bibliography and illustrations).  Appropriate lengthwill vary considerably depending on the topic itself and the nature of theprimary sources being considered, particularly if substantial translation ofancient textual sources is required.Argument:The thesis should present a sustained analytic argument in answer toits structuring question.  A thesis should not be primarily descriptive ornarrative in nature.   Each chapter should contain a sub-argument thatis clearly related to the overall argument of the thesis.  The significanceof the argument and its relationship to prior scholarship should beclearly articulated.  Honors theses are not expected to demonstratecomprehensive familiarity with the secondary literature, but they areexpected to engage critically and maturely with important works on thedefined topic.Methodology:Egyptology and Assyriology are very broad fields, and the appropriatemethods will be determined in conjunction with the thesis advisor on thebasis of the questions and types of evidence - textual, archaeological,art historical - under consideration.  With very few exceptions themethodology of the thesis is expected to be conventional rather thaninnovative, rooted in the accepted practices of the field in question.Organization and writing:An honors thesis must be well organized and written.  It should includean introduction and conclusion as well as well-considered chapters thatallow the reader to follow the line of reasoning easily.  The relationshipof any section to the larger whole should be clear, and segues shouldhelp the reader move between sections.  Writing should be grammaticallycorrect, well copy-edited, professional, and consistent.  Citations andbibliography must be in an accepted style as determined in consultationwith the advisor.EngineeringThe concentration in Engineering equips students with a solid foundationfor careers in engineering, to advance the knowledge base for futuretechnologies, and to merge teaching, scholarship, and practice in thepursuit of solutions to human needs. The concentration offers onestandard Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) program and nine Bachelor of Science(Sc.B.) degree program tracks. Of these, Sc.B. programs in biomedical,chemical and biochemical, computer, electrical, materials, and mechanicalengineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commissionof ABET (http://www.abet.org). Sc.B. degree programs in environmentalengineering and engineering physics are also offered, but they are notaccredited by ABET. (Note: Students interested in structural engineeringentering in the class of 2017 and beyond may pursue a Structurestrack within the Mechanical Engineering program). Other programsleading to the Sc.B. or A.B. degrees in Engineering may be designed inconsultation with a faculty advisor. These programs must meet the generalrequirements for concentration programs in the School of Engineering.Students interested in an individualized program should consult with anEngineering faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and obtainthe approval of the Engineering Concentration Committee. Engineeringstudents with a particular interest in using their technical skills for thepublic benefit might also consider the Engaged Scholars Program (https://www.brown.edu/academics/engineering/undergraduate-study/engaged-scholars-program).Please note that all student concentration forms must be approved by theEngineering Concentration Committee, which reviews them for compliancewith all relevant program and accreditation requirements.MathematicsMathematics 0190, 0200 is the preferred sequence of courses to be takenin the freshman year.

All our courses emphasize the development of studentskills in writing, textual analysis, and argument.  The department’sfaculty members are deeply committed to undergraduate teaching andadvising.  You will find considerable diversity in our critical methods,including cross-disciplinary approaches that relate the study of literatureto history, politics, science, as well as to other art forms.  We encouragestudents in our classes likewise to forge their own new ways ofunderstanding literature and culture.In addition to the standard English concentration, we offer an Englishconcentration track in the practice of Nonfiction Writing. The concentrationin English and the English/Nonfiction track follow the same corerequirements, and students in the English concentration may electNonfiction Writing courses as electives. We invite applications fromqualified juniors to the honors programs in both English and Nonfiction.One of the largest humanities concentrations at Brown, English providesa strong foundation for a liberal education and for employment in manysectors, especially those that centrally involve writing and working withtexts (in any form).  In addition to authorship, scholarship, and teaching,these include: journalism, publishing, advertising, visual media, consulting,public relations, public service, finance, government, corporate research,and administration.  Our English concentrators routinely go on to law,medical, and professional schools as well as to graduate education inliterature and the arts.About the ConcentrationWe encourage students interested in concentrating in English to come intothe department offices at 70 Brown Street and speak with a concentrationadvisor. Students in English courses who are considering an Englishconcentration are welcome to make an appointment to speak with theirinstructor. Concentration programs must be approved by a concentrationadvisor. To declare a concentration, students must fill out an onlineConcentration form via ASK and enter their plan of study indicating therequirements that each course fulfills.Concentration Requirements (10 courses 1):1. ONE course in "How Literature Matters" (ENGL0100):1Addressing topics about which professors are especiallypassionate, these introductory courses aim to deepen andrefine students’ understanding of how literature matters:aesthetically, ethically, historically and politically. Studentsnot only engage with larger questions about literature’ssignificance, exploring the particular kinds of insights andthinking it is especially suited for conveying, they also gaina deeper awareness of the critical methods we use tounderstand and analyze it, engaging with matters of form,genre and media. Finally, these courses help studentsdevelop their skills as close, careful readers of literary formand language."

Students must define their honors project by April 1 or near the end oftheir sixth semester. The proposal is comprised of a two-page, single-paced project description along with a bibliography of relevant sources.  This proposal must be submitted for approval to the faculty along withthe application for the Ethnic Studies Honors Program form.  The proposalshould identify the problem, or question the student will focus on, andsuggest approaches and possible hypotheses or outcomes. Studentsneed to work with two professors - a director and a reader.  at least oneshould be Ethnic Studies faculty.  The proposal should name a confirmeddirector (who must sign your application form) and likely second reader(who will need to confirm at the beginning of your seventh semester).  Ifa student wants to work with two professors, neither of whom is EthnicStudies faculty, then they should have a third deader who will read the finaldraft or consult on the final project and approve it for honors in the field.  In their seventh and eight semesters, students seeking honors will enroll inan independent study class with their director during which they will followthrough on the plan devised in the spring of their junior year. Studentsand thesis directors should plan on at least a monthly meeting to discussthe research, writing, and revision of sections of the thesis.  In addition tomeeting with their director, student should also plan to meet their secondreader during this time.In their eighth semester, the deadline for a finished full draft of their projectis April 21. Students should turn in a completed (proofread, formatted,fully written) draft to their readers by that day. Of course, students willturn chapters to the director and reader before that, according to theirrecommendations, but April 21 is the absolute deadline to turn in the finaldraft.All official readers must recommend the project for honors.When written as formal research papers, honors theses are generallybetween 50-100 pages. When there is a creative or public component,students should work closely with their faculty team to determine theappropriate length of the written accompaniment.Students will make a public presentation of their work to the Ethnic Studiesfaculty during the first week of May.Requirements (for students through the classof 2019):"

Studentswill be prepared to understand and use models, make measurements,and use theories of the processes studied in these fields.  Some courserequirements may be flexible based on consultation with concentrationadvisor..German StudiesGerman Studies exposes students to the language, literature, and cultureof the German speaking areas of Central Europe.  Concentrators combineintensive study of the German language with interdisciplinary studiesby complementing courses from the German Studies core program withcourses from other departments that deal with topics from the Germancultural tradition. The quest for national identity that dominated Germanhistory in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been augmentedby contemporary Germany's efforts to come to terms with its past andcreate new ways of dealing with diversity. Our curriculum therefore looksback at the German literary, cultural, and historical tradition, examiningfigures from Goethe or Christa Wolf to Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, andHeidegger, alongside the “texts” of contemporary German media, includingtelevision, film, and music.  Most concentrators study abroad for one ortwo semesters. *In spring 2017, Professor Jane Sokolosky will serve as concentrationadvisor. Professor Kristina Mendicino will return as concentration advisorin fall 2017.Standard program for the A.B. degreeMany students elect to complete a double concentration, combiningGerman Studies with one of the above areas, or with fields such asInternational Relations or Economics, Comparative Literature or History ofArt and Architecture.Knowledge of the German language is not required for declaring aconcentration in German Studies. However, since language fluency is thebasis for sophisticated understanding of German culture, students mustmeet a language requirement by the time they graduate.Concentration Requirements•Nine courses beyond "

The additional course may be used forpreparation of the honors thesis. Students are encouraged to discuss theirthesis topics with the concentration advisor no later than the third week ofclasses in Fall of their Senior year.Health & Human BiologyHealth and Human Biology is an interdisciplinary concentration thatprovides a rigorous foundation in the biological sciences with substantivecourse work in humanities and social sciences within a subfield of HumanHealth and Disease. The program includes: background courses, biologycore courses, a set of theme courses, and a Senior Capstone activity.Background courses provide the essential foundations in chemistry,mathematics, methods, and basic biology. These support the Biologycore, which is comprised of a flexible menu of intermediate and advancedcourses. A required portion of the Biology core is Genetics, a cornerstoneof human biology and its interface with other fields. The Biology coreunderscores the related coursework within the Health and DiseaseTheme. The Theme courses are social science and humanities coursesthat form a cohesive, thoughtful grouping. Theme groupings must beapproved by the advisor. A required senior capstone course or activitybuilds on the program's focus.Program RequirementsREQUIRED BACKGROUND:Four (4) courses including:"

Whilesome courses explore special topics, others concentrate on the history ofa particular country (e.g. China or Brazil) or period of time (e.g. Antiquityor the 20th century). By taking advantage of our diverse course offerings,students can engage in and develop broad perspectives on the past andthe present.Prospective concentrators should visit the History site(https://www.brown.edu/academics/history/undergraduate/history-concentration) and visit the office hours of their prospectiveconcentrator advisor (https://www.brown.edu/academics/history/undergraduate/history-concentration/concentration-advisors) (assignedaccording to student surname).Concentration Requirements Basic requirement: A minimum of 10 courses, at least 8 of which must becourses taught by a Brown University History Department faculty member(https://www.brown.edu/academics/history/faculty) (including their cross-listed courses) and/or courses offered by the Brown History Department(such as those taught by Visiting or Adjunct Professors). Transfer studentsor study-abroad students who have spent a year or more at anotherinstitution must have at least 7 of 10 history courses taught by BrownHistory faculty or otherwise offered through the Brown History Department.SummaryCourses in the "Premodern" era (P)22 Courses in 3 different geographic regions6Field of focus4Capstone Seminar1Any combination of courses that fulfill the four requirments abovefor a total number of 10 courses*Honors (optional) 3 additional courses related to writing athesis (one of which, "
HIST 1960,"s and "
HIST 1970,"s series and select"
HIST 1980,"s courses).  These seminars are designed to serve as anintellectual culmination of the concentration. They provide students with anopportunity to delve deeply into a historical problem and to write a majorresearch and/or analytical paper which serves as a capstone experience.  Ideally, they will be taken in the field of focus and during the student’sjunior or senior year. Students considering writing a senior honors thesisare advised to take an advanced seminar in their junior year.Transferring Courses: The History Department encourages studentsto take history courses at other institutions, either in the United Statesor abroad, as well as history-oriented courses in other departments andprograms at Brown. Students may apply two courses taken in otherdepartments/programs at Brown to the ten-course minimum for the Historyconcentration. Students who spend one semester at another institutionmay apply to their concentration a maximum of two courses from otherdepartments or institutions, and those who spend more than one semesterat another institution may apply to their concentration a third coursetransferred from another institution.Students wishing to apply such courses must present to theirconcentration advisor justification that those courses complement someaspect of their concentration. Courses from other Brown departmentsmay not be applied toward the chronological distribution requirement.History courses taught by trained historians from other institutions (e.g.,from study abroad or a previous institution) may be applied toward thechronological distribution requirement so long as at least 2/3 of the coursecontent examine the "premodern" or "early modern" periods.It is normally expected that students will have declared their intention toconcentrate in History and have their concentration programs approvedbefore undertaking study elsewhere. Students taking courses in Brown-run programs abroad automatically receive University transfer credit, butconcentration credit is granted only with the approval of a concentrationadvisor. Students taking courses in other foreign-study programs or atother universities in the United States must apply to the Transfer CreditAdvisor and then get approval from a concentration advisor.Regular Consultation: Students are strongly urged to consult regularlywith their concentration advisor or a department advisor about theirprogram. During the seventh semester, all students must meet with theirconcentration advisor for review and approval of their program.COURSES "

HIAA 0010,") is anexcellent foundation for the concentration. It is not a prerequisite fortaking other lecture courses but you can count it as one of the 4 non-corecourses required for the concentration (see below for core and non-corecourses).Since the history of art and architecture addresses issues of practicewithin specific historical contexts, concentrators are encouraged to takeat least 1 studio art course. Courses in history also train students inmethods and approaches that are highly relevant to the history of art andarchitecture. Study abroad can be a valuable enrichment of the academicwork available on campus, in that it offers opportunities for first-handknowledge of works of art and monuments as well as providing exposureto foreign languages and cultures. Study abroad should be planned inconsultation with the concentration advisor in order to make sure thatforeign course work will relate meaningfully to the concentrators programof study.Four core general lecture courses, numbered  may count as one of these courses butcannot count as one of the four core lecture courses. Studentsare encouraged to take a studio class as part of this requirement.24Total Credits101 The six core lecture and seminar courses must be taken in theHistory of Art and Architecture department and cannot be replacedwith independent study, honors thesis or classes taken in otherdepartments, universities, or high schools.2 A maximum of two (2) credits may be allowed for courses taken atother universities (transfer credits or from study abroad) or coursesthat also count toward a second concentration. No concentrationcredit will be granted for AP/A-level scores, or for language classes.Architectural Studies TrackThe Optional Architectural Studies track within the History of Art andArchitecture concentration blends a variety of disciplines toward thestudy of buildings and the built environment. The concentration preparesstudents for the continued study of architecture and the history ofarchitecture in graduate school as well as careers in related areas such asurban studies.Because the architectural studies program was especially designedfor students wishing to gain greater experience in the practical skillsnecessary for a career in architecture or a related field, concentrators arerequired to take a course in design from the Visual Arts Department, theRhode Island School of Design or an introduction to architectural design,theatre set design at Brown University.Four lecture courses. These courses will be numbered between"

MUSC 0071O,"peraItalian Studies Concentration and the BrownProgram in BolognaConcentrators who enroll in the Brown in Bologna program should fulfillthe requirements according to the following sequence: prior to departure,the student should complete the level of Italian language study required("
HEBR 0600,") and one further course in Judaic Studies (within thedisciplinary focus).  Two additional courses in the disciplinary focus, atleast one of which must be outside the Program in Judaic Studies in adepartment of shared disciplinary focus (e.g. English or ComparativeLiterature), are also required.  Fulfillment of the Hebrew requirementthrough proficiency examination does not reduce the requirement to taketen courses for the concentration.4)            Of the courses required in the Program in Judaic Studies, atleast one should focus on the ancient period and one should focus on themodern period.5)            Each student, in discussion with his/her mentor, is required todesignate an advanced course (1000 level) in his/her senior year eitherwithin the Judaic Studies program or in the corresponding disciplinarydepartment as the capstone for his/her concentration.  Within the frameof this capstone course, the concentrator will write a final paper on a topicin Judaic Studies that displays in an appropriate way the theoretical andinterpretive issues of the concentration focus.  If a student opts to fulfillthis requirement in a course outside the Program in Judaic Studies, thestudent must get permission in advance both from his/her mentor and fromthe professor of the course in question since the student's final project willaddress a Judaic Studies topic or theme.6)            Students who study at other institutions, either in the UnitedStates or abroad, may apply a maximum of four courses (two topical andtwo language courses) to the concentration.7)            Double concentrators may count up to two courses that theyhave used to complete their concentration requirements in anotherdepartment towards their concentration in Judaic Studies.Honors ProgramAny student who wishes to engage more deeply in research related toJudaic Studies in any of its disciplines or branches is invited to considerwriting an Honors Thesis.The Honors ThesisThe goal of the thesis is to add to the existing scholarship in the fieldof Judaic Studies.  It should be based on original research, involvingthe close reading of primary sources.  The honors thesis is expected topresent an argument based on the student's own analysis and will engagean ongoing debate or discussion in the field, demonstrating an awarenessof the major research done until now and clearly identifying its owncontribution, however limited.  Since it is the equivalent of two semester-long courses, it should be a substantial piece of work (typically between35,000-55,000 words) containing a sustained and consistently supportedargument.  To be successful, the student needs to adopt both a criticalresearch methodology and a logical research strategy, both of whichshould be discussed in the thesis itself.  In addition to being assessed inall these aspects, the thesis will also be graded on its organization (theway in which it is structured into separate and clearly defined chaptersto support the main argument) as well as the quality and precision of itswriting.Work that simply describes and summarizes its sources along withprevious research is not acceptable.  The goal here is original researchand analysis.Entering the ProgramIn order to be considered a candidate for Honors, students will beexpected to have maintained an outstanding record (at least A inJudaic Studies courses.  The Honors thesis, which fulfills the capstonerequirement, will normally be written as a two-semester individual studyproject (numbered "

An internship or volunteer service, located in the U.S. or overseas,for one semester or one summer. Work completed during study abroadmay count toward this requirement. The service work will connect theoryto practice, applying scholarly knowledge to social challenges. Studentsare encouraged to consult with the Swearer Center for Public Servicefor assistance finding a volunteer placement. Students should also meetwith the DUS by the beginning of junior year to discuss their work planfor their service component. Upon completion of the internship or servicework, students fill and submit via ASK the Internship, Work or VolunteerService Form, available online in the LACA Undergraduate Concentrationwebpage (https://watson.brown.edu/clacs/education/undergraduate).  In addition they are expected to submit via ASK a short letter from asupervisor confirming the completion of the work.4. A capstone project.

While human languagescan differ greatly in certain respects, all are intricate, complex, rule-governed systems. Linguistics is the scientific study of these systems,their use in communicative and other social settings, and their cognitiveand neural underpinnings. The linguistics concentration at Browngives students a background in the “core” aspects of the languagesystem: phonetics/phonology (the study of speech sounds and theirpatterning), syntax (the study of combinatorics of words, phrases, andsentences), and semantics/pragmatics (the study of the meanings ofwords, sentences, and conversation). Beyond this, students may focusmore heavily in one or more of these areas and/or explore relatedquestions such as how children and adults learn language (languageacquisition), how utterances are produced and understood in real time(psycholinguistics), or how speaking and understanding are anchoredin underlying neural systems (neurolinguistics). Other areas such ashistorical linguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and linguisticanthropology can also be pursued in conjunction with offerings in otherdepartments.Requirements (10 courses)Prerequisite Course1"

Upon completing twofoundational courses in theory and musicianship, concentrators have theflexibility to craft an intellectual pathway based on their particular interestsand goals. The curriculum is supported by the Orwig Music Library, astate-of-the-art facility with holdings of over 40,000 books and scoresand an equal number of sound and video recordings. Concentrators areencouraged to participate in one or more of the departmentally sponsoredperforming organizations: Chorus, Orchestra, Jazz Band, Wind Symphony,Chamber Music Performance, Electroacoustic Ensemble, Sacred Harp/Shape-Note Singing, Old-time String Band, Javanese Gamelan, orGhanaian Drumming.Concentrating in MusicIf you choose Music as a Concentration*, you will be expected to achievewell-rounded training as a musician, regardless of the genre(s) in whichyou specialize. This training is manifested in the following generalcomponents:For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).Brown University            283Fundamental skills are important for any musician, and therefore aminimum of two music theory/musicianship courses are required of allstudents who wish to Concentrate. Students have the opportunity to enterinto various theory courses according to their interest and experience.Historical and cultural knowledge of music is another key area fromwhich Concentrators are required to complete courses. These coursesmay be studies of Western or non-Western forms of music.The creation of music is also central to the Music Concentration.Students are encouraged to make music in a number of ways, includingparticipation in ensembles, solo performance, composition, musicproduction, and/or conducting.Music faculty will be available to advise students on shaping the flexibleparts of their Concentration and achieving their goal at Brown.Concentration Requirements:Music Theory●      Two courses in music theory, which may include one 400-level andone 500-level course, or two 500-level courses.Music Scholarship, Production and Advance TheoryA minimum of four upper-level courses above 1000, must include:●      One upper-level course in musicology or ethnomusicology●      Any three upper-level courses, including graduate-level coursesAdditional Electives (according to student interest)Four additional elective courses, may include:●      Up to four half-credit courses in performance - AMP music instructionand/or Ensemble Participation (2 credits)●      Up to two courses outside of the department●      One music course below the 1000 levelSenior ProjectAll music concentrators will choose a culminating experience for theirsenior year, either a capstone project or honors project. This may takethe form of a performance, scholarly study, or original creative work. Allstudents will have a primary advisor for their Senior Project. The work maybe done independently of a course for credit, as an independent study, orwithin the framework of an existing course.Honors in Music (optional)Faculty Rules stipulate “Brown University shall, at graduation, grant honorsto students whose work in a field of concentration has demonstratedsuperior quality and culminated in an honors thesis of distinction.”In order to apply for Honors in Music, a student must fulfill the followingcriteria:1.The student must have acquired a 3.5 cumulative grade point averageoverall.2.The student must also have acquired a 3.5 cumulative grade pointaverage in courses that count toward the concentration. (“S withdistinction” equates with “A”.  Grades of “S” are not computed in thegrade point average.)Departmental Procedures:The Department designates three kinds of projects leading to honors inmusic:(a) Research project in history, theory, or ethnomusicology.(b) Performance project accompanied by pertinent research of lesserscope than (a). (Scholarly program notes required)(c) Composition/Computer Music project. (score required if applicable;recording and/or video documentation desired, short project description)NOTE: the term HONORS COMMITTEE refers to a student’s honorsthesis advisor and readers.A student wishing to propose a project should proceed as follows:1.An honors candidate must secure a faculty advisor and a secondreader to serve as an honors committee for his or her project bythe end of the year before graduation—typically, the end of thesixth semester.  At the beginning of the penultimate semester thestudent will submit a proposal describing the project to the honorscommittee for approval. The proposal must receive committeeapproval and be given to Mary Rego for distribution to the full facultyby the first day of the first full week of classes of the semester. Thedepartment faculty will vote on the proposals at the next regularlyscheduled meeting. Decisions will be based on the student’s overallperformance in music courses and on the quality of the proposal. Theadvisor will notify the student of the faculty’s decision.2.It is expected that honors projects will normally take two semestersto complete. Students pursuing honors may choose to register for"

Students may earn honors by presenting a senior thesisjudged to be of honors quality by two readers. In addition to completing theusual nonhonors requirements, the student should also have a grade pointaverage of over 3.4 in physics, philosophy and history of science courses(of which at least five must be taken for a letter grade). Honors theses areusually prepared over a period of two semesters with an advisor from theDepartment of Physics or the Department of Philosophy.Political ScienceWhy do Hindus and Muslims live in harmony in one city and fight bitterlyin another just a few miles away? Why is the U.S. the only industrializednation without a complete national health insurance? What is the legacyof slavery in the U.S.? Why are there so few women in Congress? How isradicalism in the Middle East changing? Why and how does democracyflourish? Just what is democracy? How do emotions shape our politicalbehavior? What do war movies tell us about the USA? Would lessgovernment lead to more social justice? What is social justice? How doessmuggling (of drugs, guns, and people) reshape international relations?How do immigrants see the American Dream? What is the Americandream?Political science is about questions like these. You can grapple with everyone of them –and many more— in the classrooms of the Brown politicalscience department. We study how people –nations, regions, cities,communities— live their common lives. How people solve (or duck) theircommon problems. How people govern themselves. How they think, talk,argue, fight, and vote. Students passionate about social challenges mayalso choose to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program, which allows themto connect theory and practice and gain hands-on experience working withcommunity partners.The undergraduate concentration is organized around three broad tracks,or programs of study: American politics, international and comparativepolitics, and political theory.  Twelve courses are required overall: tenwithin the Department of Political Science and two from areas outside thedepartment related to your chosen track.

Students who have already completedan introductory course in statistics will be granted permission to proceedto Level II core courses if they meet the prerequisites in mathematics andcomputing.Senior Thesis: A senior honors thesis is not a requirement for graduation,but concentrators who choose to write one are required to write amanuscript that describes a major project of statistical data analysis thatthey performed or a simulation study to evaluate the performance ofa statistical method. Students that decide to write an honor thesis willgenerally integrate their capstone project into their thesis. Generally,writing a senior thesis includes two semesters of independent study (PHP1980), the capstone project may serve as one of those.Honors: Statistics requires the completion of a senior thesis and asuperior record in the program.Study Abroad/Study Away: Up to two courses taken elsewhere (studyabroad or other transfer) may be applied to required courses.

In addition,TAPS concentrators with an interest in socially engaged performance thattackles complex social issues may pursue the Engaged Scholars Program(https://www.brown.edu/academics/theatre-arts-performance-studies/undergraduate-program/engaged-scholars-program). Everyone graduateshaving studied craft, gained familiarity with history, and investigated therole of performance arts in culture.Theatre Arts TrackThis concentration combines the study of dramatic literature, theatrehistory, performance theory, and studio work in the various theatre arts.All concentrators in Theatre Arts will gain practical experience through thestudy of acting and directing as well as in the technical production of plays,preparing students in the practical study of a cross-section of the vitalaspects of theatre craft, including one class in either dance or speech. Anessential aim of the concentration track is the engagement of students inperformance procedures (acting, dancing, directing, choreography, design,playwriting, dramaturgy, etc.) in order to experience the inter-relationshipsamong social contexts, dramatic texts and theatrical enactments. Alongwith practical study in craft, concentrators will graduate having studiedtheatre history and performance theory in global perspective, including atleast one course that exhibits geographic or topical breadth beyond whatmight loosely be called “mainstream” Euro-American tradition The studyof theatre history provides a Theatre Arts concentrator with the necessarybackground to understand a variety of dramatic and theatrical forms.The study of performance theory enhances a student’s ability to askfundamental questions about the role of theatre in social, political, culturaland cross-cultural arenas.Students wishing to enroll as concentrators in Theatre Arts andPerformance Studies and take the Theatre Arts track should see theundergraduate Theatre Arts track advisor, in order to discuss options thatwill best serve their interests.Required Courses"

Aconcentrator in this track will study the multiple modes in which liveperformance articulates culture, negotiates difference, constructs identity,and transmits collective historical traditions and memories. BecausePerformance Studies is not primarily invested in one performancemode over another (such as theatre or dance), a concentrator will gainexposure to a broad spectrum of performance modes. Studying ritual,play, game, festival, spectacle and a broad spectrum of “performancebehaviors” under the umbrella of Performance Studies, a concentrator willgraduate having investigated the role of performance in culture, includingperformative acts in everyday life, political enactment, ritual behavior,aesthetic or representational practices, and social role or the performanceof subjectivity. The history of aesthetic performance practices (such as thehistories of theatre and/or dance) will be an important part of this track,serving to ground inquiry into the broader spectrum of performance study.Students will craft their electives on this track from a wide selection ofcourses both within the Department of Theatre Arts and PerformanceStudies and across the university. The study of performance behavioracross mediums such as dance, theatre, ritual, and orature allows forgeographic and historical flexibility as not all cultures parse theatre fromdance, nor, historically, genres of religious or political ritual from genresof entertainment, play, or game.
