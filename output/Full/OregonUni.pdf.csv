Courses are appropriate for students interestedin history, art, and the larger cultural context of society. They are alsosuitable for students intending to concentrate on the practice of art orenvironmental design. The undergraduate program prepares studentsfor graduate studies in art history; it also leads to opportunities in thebusiness world, art museums, and galleries. The graduate programemphasizes both breadth and depth, and it is characterized by closeworking relationships between students and the faculty.Students explore global history, culture, and society through art andarchitecture from antiquity to the present day. Trained to celebrate thebroad spectrum of human creativity and expression, art history studentsare natural ambassadors of pluralism and tolerance, developing skillsin appreciating visual and material culture to make them true globalcitizens—ideally equipped to correlate historical events and concerns withimportant contemporary and international phenomena.The history of art and architecture program at Oregon is comprehensivein scope. Students learn at least one ancient or modern languageassociated with their main area of interest, and courses examine culturalproduction from around the globe. The department trains students tobecome guardians and advocates for culture and the arts within Oregon,the United States, and the world.Because of this rigorous training in critical thinking and communication,art history is not merely a preprofessional major for future art historians.An art history degree prepares students to embark on an array ofprofessional careers, including those in business, education, law, privateand nonprofit organizations, professional writing, and publishing. Morespecialized careers include art-based professions in museums, galleries,archives, and cultural institutes.Financial AssistanceThe department offers a number of awards and scholarships forundergraduate and graduate students in art history:•Amy and Ross Kari Scholarship in Art History•Mr. and Mrs. Eric G. Clarke Scholarship in Oriental Art•Gloria T. Lee Graduate Scholarship in Art History•Gloria T. Lee Scholarship in Art History•Ina McClung Art Scholarship Award•Sponenburgh Endowment for the History of Aesthetics of Sculpture•Marian C. Donnelly Award in Art History (Book Award)•Marion Dean Ross Award in Architectural History (Book Award)•Ellen Johnston-Laing Award in Asian Art (Book Award)Support for travel is available through the Marian C.

Landscape architectureis founded on an awareness of our deep connections to the naturalworld and how people and their work are part of the web of life. Theprofession is deeply attentive to how places serve human needs andsupport sustainable and resilient cities and other landscapes. A healthysociety rests on a commitment to sound landscape design, planning, andconservation that respects the land, its processes, its integrity—and thatof human-ecological processes, helping to fulfill human potential.Both a science and an art, landscape architecture involves creativedecision-making based on scientific knowledge of natural processescoupled with awareness of historical, cultural, and social dynamics.The profession also makes intensive use of technologies for landscapeconstruction and environmental management—digital graphics,geographic information systems, and computer-aided design. These areapplied to making richly supportive places for people and ecosystemsthat are beautiful and healthy, responding to human needs and to localnatural and socioeconomic systems.The Department of Landscape Architecture is built on the 19th-centurylegacy that landscape architecture is a design and planning professionwith responsibilities to society, the past, the future and ourselves. Theprogram combines professional understanding and skills with a liberal-arts education.As a profession, landscape architecture includes design at many scales,including ecologically based planning activities, transformation of urbanand rural landscapes, service to disadvantaged communities, and designof beautiful and functional parks and gardens. As an academic discipline,it provides opportunities for personal development through environmentalproblem-solving, graphic and oral communication, and project-orientedstudy in which small groups of students work with instructors to addresspressing contemporary problems through detailed development of landand sites.Computers in the CurriculumDigital tools are necessary for landscape architects. The departmentrequires all students to have unlimited access to their own personalcomputer. Because of the professional application of complex graphicprograms and large data files for most course work, the department’scomputer requirements exceed the average user’s computing needs.See the College of Design's Student Computer Purchasing Guide forrecommended specifications and departmental requirements.FacultyJacques Abelman, assistant professor (social justice, landscapeinfrastructure, food systems).

Students entering the postprofessional MLAprogram must have a professionally accredited bachelor’s degree inlandscape architecture or architecture.Students with professional landscape architecture degrees typicallyspend two years in residence satisfying course requirements. Studentswith professional architecture degrees who are accepted into the programmay spend an additional one to three terms, decided on a case-by-casebasis.The postprofessional MLA program seeks to prepare the student foradvanced understanding, competence, and responsibility in promotingharmonious human-land relationships through private or public practiceor teaching at the university level. Many graduate students have theopportunity to learn and practice teaching skills as paid teachingassistants and graduate employees in the department. Some graduatesare offered faculty positions throughout the world. The program takesadvantage of regional and university resources through landscapeprojects, internships, and visiting professionals, while it provides a696         Landscape Architecturebeneficial base of support and ideas in the department. The departmentrecognizes the importance of building a community for graduateeducation characterized by serious and rigorous inquiry, self-direction,and opportunities to work closely with teachers and peers in an activedesign and planning enterprise.Required coursework includes one design and planning studio, onecourse in landscape analysis and planning, one course in history,literature, and theory, Landscape Research Methods I (), students must obtaindepartment approval of a project or thesis proposal from theirlandscape architecture master's project advisor.3Completed during the second year.AdmissionProspective applicants to the MLA degree programs may find informationabout the program and application requirements on the departmentwebsite (https://archenvironment.uoregon.edu/landarch/apply/mla).Doctor of Philosophy DegreeThe doctoral program in landscape architecture offers opportunitiesfor advanced study and scholarship in ecological landscape planning,sustainable urban design, and design history and theory. Landscapeplanning is primarily concerned with assessing large landscapes anddirecting their policy, management, and land-use patterns to meet socialand environmental ends, while design typically addresses smaller areasin greater detail.Because the profession is broad and diverse, the landscape architecturePhD pursues robust development of academic, analytical, creative, andintegrative capabilities that can continue to grow throughout subsequentcareers. Accordingly, the program emphasizes the following:•Advanced expertise and understanding in a focused topic•The ability to form integrative conceptual models of landscape issues,problems, and solutionsThe University of Oregon            697•The ability to critically analyze deficiencies in knowledge in the fieldand identify needs for new, original contributions•The ability to form and investigate operationally bounded questions•The ability to independently design and execute a complete, intensiveresearch project•The ability to fully document a research project with high-qualitywriting and illustrationsThe integrative nature of landscape design as a science and an artentails development of innovative models and methods for design,education, and research. The program offers students the opportunity todevelop skills as innovative educators by working with faculty membersas teaching assistants, and to teach courses under faculty guidance.The close and supportive relationships among scholarship, teaching,professional growth, and artistic achievement foster excellence in designeducation, research, and practice. Scholars follow many routes, and theprogram provides substantial flexibility to tailor students’ programs toindividual needs.Course of StudyCompletion of the program requires demonstrated excellence throughoriginal contributions to the field. Indicators of a doctoral student’sachievements are successful completion of the oral and writtencomprehensive exams and successful completion and defense of adissertation that substantially advances knowledge in a chosen area ofexpertise.Through a series of four required courses in landscape architectureliterature, theory, and research, PhD students learn how to conduct bothqualitative and quantitative studies of landscapes and the processes thatshape them. After completing these core courses, advanced studies inmethodology, tailored to suit career intentions, are required. Advancedmethodological preparation in quantitative research occurs throughstatistical and spatial analysis as well as case-study analysis, designcriticism, content analysis, historical interpretation, and environment-behavior observation.The program prepares students to understand and apply appropriatemethods of inquiry, and to deepen their understanding of the natureand role of rigorous scholarly inquiry in landscape architecture. Courserequirements are designed to provide both depth and breadth ofknowledge in landscape architecture, and to draw on the frameworksand methodologies of related disciplines that support the student’sdissertation research.Length of Program and Steps to CompletionA PhD in landscape architecture requires a minimum of three years offull-time graduate work, including one year of residency. Depending onbackground and research goals, students can expect to complete thedegree in three to six years, with a norm of four to five years.The student’s program of study depends substantially on his or her priordegrees.Degree HeldCredits to Expect to Complete forPhDMLA or MArch68BLA or BArch only80Master's degree withoutprofessional environmental-designdegree86Courses for the doctoral degree include design-studio experience andsubject-area courses to provide a foundation in landscape architecturesufficient to support a student’s goals, research, and advanced coursework.At the completion of course work, normally the end of the second year,each student submits a written comprehensive exam, followed by anoral comprehensive exam. The examination committee will consist ofthree faculty members, two from landscape architecture and one froman outside department or program, who will prepare and administer thewritten and oral comprehensive exams. Once students have passedboth comprehensive exams, they will be advanced to candidacy. Eachstudent must submit the dissertation proposal within three terms of theexams. A student then forms a dissertation committee consisting of fourmembers, with a minimum of two from landscape architecture and atleast one from another field related to the student’s area of research. Thedissertation committee must approve the student’s written dissertationproposal following a scheduled, public proposal presentation before thestudent undertakes the dissertation.Some credit requirements may be waived or satisfied through transfercredits which must not have previously been applied to any graduateor undergraduate degree. No more than 15 credits may be transferred.Successful completion of the doctoral program is a matter of provenexcellence through substantial, original contributions to the field and notthe accumulation of a specific number of credits.RequirementsA student’s program of study is developed with the major professor and asecond doctoral advisor.PhD Required Courses, WorkCodeTitleCreditsTheory, Research, Investigation 1.

Through course workthat integrates theory and practice, the curriculum focuses on the waysgovernments, nonprofit organizations, and other institutions solve publicproblems. Students explore the economic, social, and environmentalcharacteristics of communities and systems of governance to determineeffective ways to advance the public’s goals. The curriculum helpsstudents develop knowledge of core issues related to planning and publicpolicy as well as more in-depth knowledge in a chosen field of interest.Emphasis is placed on developing skills in research; verbal, written, anddigital communication; and working in group settings.PreparationA broad liberal arts background, the development of analytical skills,and community volunteer and leadership experiences are excellentpreparation for the PPPM major. Premajors should consider course workor experience in English, public speaking, economics, political science,sociology, computer science, mathematics, and volunteer work.CareersThe bachelor of arts (BA) or bachelor of science (BS) degree in planning,public policy and management prepares graduates for entry-levelpositions in government agencies and nonprofit organizations. Inaddition, the degree provides a broad interdisciplinary, professionalbackground and a sound basis for graduate study in fields such as urbanplanning, public policy and management, business, law, journalism, andnonprofit administration.Admission RequirementsStudents should apply for admission in the term prior to achieving juniorclass standing (90–105 credits). Strong applicants will be consideredbefore this level on a case-by-case basis. Students must apply to themajor before earning 30 credits in PPPM major courses. Preference inadmission is given to applicants who have:•a grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 or better•some experience—paid or volunteer—in public service•fulfilled a majority of the university general-education requirementsThe school strongly encourages applicants from diverse backgrounds,regardless of race, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, orability, and recognizes that affirmative action and equal opportunity beginwith the development of professionals who represent a broad array ofideas and cultures.Prior to applying for admission to the major, students should takeIntroduction to Economic Analysis: Microeconomics ("
LT 611,").For students graduating, removal of incompletes awarded must besubmitted on DuckWeb no later than the Friday following exam weekof the graduating term. Grade changes must be submitted no later than30 days after the degree is awarded. Incompletes will remain on theacademic record after the degree is awarded and cannot be removed.W (Withdrawal)Student-initiated mark. Students may withdraw from a course throughweb registration. See the online class schedule for deadlines.X (No Grade Reported)Registrar-initiated mark. The instructor did not report a grade for thestudent.Y (No Basis for Grade)Instructor-initiated mark used prior to fall 2017. There is no basis forevaluating the student's performance.Effective fall 2017, the Y mark is no longer used. Instructors issue agrade of F or N, as indicated by the grading option, to students whoregister and never attend or participate in the course, and to studentswho attend and participate in part of the course but do not complete allcourse requirements.Grade Point AverageFor terms prior to fall 2016, grades for courses taken at the Universityof Oregon appear on both the official and unofficial transcript and areincluded in the term and cumulative GPA calculation.Effective fall 2016, grades for undergraduate courses taken atthe University of Oregon appear on both the official and unofficialtranscript and are included in the term GPA calculation. However, forundergraduate courses not designated as repeatable for credit, onlythe second grade earned of a repeated course is calculated into thecumulative GPA. Credit for nonrepeatable courses is given only once.Grades recorded as a result of sanctions and/or academic misconductare included in the cumulative GPA and will not be excluded in any eventof repetition. Conduct grades may not be petitioned.Four points are assigned for each credit of A, three points for eachcredit of B, two points for each credit of C, one point for each credit of D,and zero points for each credit of F. The plus sign increases the pointsassigned the letter grade by 0.3 per credit, and the minus sign decreasesthe points assigned the letter grade by 0.3 per credit. The grade pointaverage is calculated by dividing total points by total credits of A, B,14         Registration and Academic PoliciesC, D, and F. Marks of AU, I, W, X, Y, and the grades of P and N aredisregarded in the computation of the grade point average.Academic StandingWhen there is evidence of lack of satisfactory progress toward meetinggraduation requirements, the Scholastic Review Committee may placestudents on academic probation or disqualify them from attendance at theuniversity. For information and assistance, students should inquire at theOffice of Academic Advising, 101 Oregon Hall.After grades are processed at the end of each term, term and cumulativeUO GPAs are calculated for each undergraduate student, admitted ornonadmitted. A student’s academic standing is based on attempted andearned hours and on the term and cumulative UO GPAs.If a grade change affects the student’s term and cumulative UO GPAsand academic standing, the student should ask the instructor to submitthe grade change through DuckWeb immediately. Retroactive changesto a term’s academic standing are made only to remove probation fromthe term record and only if grade changes are submitted by the last dayto register and add classes for the following term. If grade changes thataffect GPAs and academic standing are submitted later than this, thestudent’s probation standing for the previous term is not amended.Academic Warning. Students receive an academic warning whenthe UO term GPA is between 0.00 and 1.99, inclusive, even if the UOcumulative GPA is 2.00 or higher. This notation is not recorded on thestudent’s official academic transcript, but does appear on the unofficialtranscript. Terms with marks resulting in no GPA are considered tobe below 2.00 unless all attempted credits for that term were passed.Students who completely withdraw from a term with W marks receive a0.00 term GPA, and are thus subject to academic warning, probation,and/or disqualification.Academic warning is given as a courtesy to advise students of potentialacademic difficulty. Academic probation does not depend on the studentreceiving prior notice of academic warning.Academic ProbationAcademic probation is earned and the notation "Academic Probation" isrecorded on the student’s academic transcript whenever the followingconditions exist:1.When the UO cumulative GPA is lower than 2.00. Students whohave earned 44 or fewer credits are allowed two terms of probationbefore they are subject to disqualification. Students with more than44 credits are only allowed one term of probation before they aresubject to disqualification. Students on academic probation whoseUO cumulative GPA is lower than 2.00 and whose UO term GPA is2.00 or higher remain on academic probation2.When students have received academic warning for two consecutiveterms and their subsequent UO term GPAs are between 0.00 and1.99, inclusive, even if the UO cumulative GPA is above a 2.00.Terms with marks resulting in no GPA are considered to be below2.00 unless all attempted credits for that term were passed. Studentswho completely withdraw from a term with W marks receive a 0.00term GPA, and are thus subject to academic warning, probation, and/or disqualificationStudents on academic probation are limited to a study load of no morethan 15 credits. Incoming students may be admitted on academicprobation and are notified when such action has been taken; thesestudents may be subject to disqualification after a single term ofprobation.Academic DisqualificationAcademic disqualification is earned and the notation "Disqualification"is recorded on the student’s academic transcript whenever the followingconditions exist:1.Students on academic probation for having a UO cumulative GPAlower than 2.00 who earn a UO term GPA lower than 2.00 in theirnext term2.Students on academic probation for having a term GPA below 2.00after two consecutive terms on academic warning and who earnless than a 2.00 term GPA for the fourth consecutive term. Termswith marks resulting in no GPA are considered to be below 2.00unless all attempted credits for that term were passed. Students whocompletely withdraw from a term with W marks receive a 0.00 termGPA, and are thus subject to academic warning, probation, and/ordisqualificationStudents may apply for reinstatement after disqualification by contactingthe Office of Academic Advising. Petitions are reviewed to determine theprobability that a student can satisfactorily complete the requirementsof a degree program. The student may enroll during the academic yearonly if the Scholastic Review Committee allows the student to continueon probationary status. Students may enroll for summer classes withoutbeing reinstated. Students who have been disqualified must petition forreinstatement to graduate.Exceptions to Academic Regulations1.Two standing university committees review requests in writing forexceptions to university rules, regulations, deadlines, policies, andrequirements: the Academic Requirements Committee and theScholastic Review Committee.

Students should contact the Office of theRegistrar to determine eligibility for credit by examination. If eligible,students will be issued an examination form. Students then obtain facultyand department approvals before the exam can be scheduled. Studentsare billed an examination fee of $25 per credit.Successful credit by examination is shown as transfer credit on theUO transcript and may be recorded as a pass (P) or graded (A, B, C,D), consistent with the options listed in the class schedule. Credit byexamination may not be counted toward the satisfaction of the graduationresidency requirement or for fulfillment of the requirement to complete45 credits graded A, B, C, D at the University of Oregon. However, creditby examination may be counted toward the requirement to complete 168credits graded A, B, C, D, P* from all institutions attended.The following are not available for credit by examination:•Courses numbered 0–99; Field Studies (196); Workshop, LaboratoryProjects, or Colloquium (198); Special Studies (199); coursesnumbered 200 or 399–410•First-year second-language courses•100-level mathematics courses and ) class session during the finalterm.Doctor of PhilosophyThe doctor of philosophy (PhD) program in linguistics is individuallytailored to meet the needs and professional goals of the student, drawingstrong interdisciplinary support from related fields at the university. Thesefields may include—but are not limited to—anthropological linguistics,cognitive science, communication disorders and sciences, discourse andtext analysis, English linguistics, first- and second-language acquisition,language-data processing, neurolinguistics, and sociolinguistics.Residency RequirementThe Graduate School requires at least three years of full-time workbeyond the bachelor’s degree for the doctorate, with at least one yearspent in continuous residence on the Eugene campus. The Departmentof Linguistics interprets the latter requirement to mean that at least sixcourses, including seminars, must be taken in the program while thestudent is in continuous residence for three academic terms.Doctoral AdvisorThe department head appoints a doctoral advisor for each student uponadmission to the PhD program.Second-Year ReviewBy the end of a doctoral student’s second year, he or she shall be givena review by the faculty members at a department meeting. Materialssubmitted by the student to the department for this review must includethe following:1.A report that includes a research plan for the next year’s course work,potential topics for the two qualifying papers, a statement about thestudent’s career plans beyond the doctoral degree (and how thespecific qualifying paper and thesis topics are relevant), and anyother details worked out in consultation with the student’s advisor2.A curriculum vitae (CV)3.Written evidence of research progress and scholarly potential,such as a substantive term paper or revision of a term paper thatdemonstrates excellence of original research or a linguistics master’sthesis; the materials must be submitted to the Department by April 15Following review of these materials, the faculty members decides eitherto accept or deny the student for continued study in the PhD program. Insome cases, a probation year may be granted for a student’s third year ofstudy; the review process is repeated at the end of the third year with anaccept outcome the only possibility for continued study.As soon as possible after completion of the review, a letter to eachgraduate student under review is issued by the director of graduatestudies informing the student of his or her status and, in the case of aone-year probation, specifying the conditions that must be met for asuccessful outcome during the additional third-year review. The languageof the probation conditions is drafted by the student’s doctoral advisorand the director of graduate studies. The director may also meet with anystudents who are denied continued study or who are granted probation.Annual reviewBeginning in the third year of the program, each graduate student mustsubmit an annual report and CV to his or her advisor by April 15 of eachyear. The report should be no more than one page in length and shoulddetail what the student has accomplished over the past year in theprogram.Doctoral Examination and Advancement toCandidacyRequirements for the Qualifying PaperThe doctoral examination consists of two original publishable papers ofsubstantial length and quality in different subfields of linguistics. The term“different subfields” may include two different methodological approachesto a single broad topic. A qualifying paper is considered publishable if thereview committee deems it to stand a reasonable chance of acceptanceby a refereed venue such as a peer-reviewed journal, although the paperitself is not required to be accepted for publication, and may be submittedto a nonrefereed venue.An unmodified MA thesis cannot serve as one of the qualifying papers.A qualifying paper may be, however, a publishable expansion or revisionof an MA thesis or publishable term paper written for a course conductedby any faculty member in the department or, where deemed reasonable,for a course conducted by a faculty member outside the department. Thepaper may be written under the supervision of either the student’s advisoror another faculty member in consultation with the student’s advisor, whoapproves the topic and the final version.On submitting each paper to the committee, and after consultation withthe student’s advisor, the student indicates in a cover note or e-mail tothe coordinator the intended publication venue for the paper. In reviewingthe paper, the committee takes into consideration the appropriateness ofthe proposed venue for the content of the paper.Submission of both papers to the proposed venue or venues is requiredbefore the student can advance to candidacy. Before applying to theGraduate School for advancement to candidacy, the student must submitto the coordinator either his or her cover letter to the venue to whicheach of the two qualifying papers was sent or, in the case of invitedpublications, the invitation letter. The publishing venue may be a refereedjournal, a refereed or nonrefereed conference proceedings volume, anonline publication, or another venue. While submission of each qualifyingpaper to a publishing venue is required for advancement to candidacy,acceptance for publication is not a requirement.Composition of the Qualifying Paper CommitteeA committee of three faculty members is drawn up to review eachqualifying paper. The committee is composed of two faculty memberreviewers and the student’s doctoral advisor. In cases where thequalifying paper supervisor is not the student’s doctoral advisor, thedoctoral advisor will be one of the two reviewers and the supervisor willbe the third member of the committee.The advisor sits on both of anindividual student’s committees, whereas at least one of the two facultyreviewers serves on only one of the two committees. One of the twofaculty members on the committee may be from another department,where appropriate.Upon completion and documented submission to a publisher of bothqualifying papers and completion of all required course work and theresearch language requirement, the student advances to candidacy forthe PhD degree. The student and the department must electronicallysubmit the advancement to candidacy to the Graduate School forapproval.Qualifying Paper Coordinator and ReviewersThe qualifying paper coordinator is a member of the faculty who•receives papers submitted by the graduate student (after approval ofthe qualifying paper by the student’s doctoral advisor)The University of Oregon            373•selects reviewers for the paper in consultation with the doctoraladvisor•sends the paper to the reviewers and sets a deadline for review(typically six weeks)•receives the reviewers’ comments and decisions•sends a summary of the comments and decisions, together with thereviewers’ specific comments, to the doctoral advisor and the student•notifies the department when the qualifying paper is submitted andwhen it is accepted by the reviewersIn the event that one or both of the reviewers requests revisions, thestudent (after the doctoral advisor approves the revised version of thepaper) submits the revision to the coordinator. A reviewer may choosewhether or not to review the revised version. If a reviewer chooses toreview the revision, the coordinator sends the revised version to thereviewer and sets a deadline for review (typically four weeks). Any furthercomments or revision requirements from the reviewer or reviewers aresent by the coordinator to the doctoral advisor and the student for furtherrevision.In the event that both reviewers reject a qualifying paper, the studentmay submit a substitute paper with the approval of the doctoral advisor.Except by petition to the faculty and subsequent faculty approval, theremay be no third submission of a qualifying paper.Doctoral DissertationA doctoral committee must include at least three linguistics facultymembers and one outside member, and must be either chaired orcochaired by the student’s doctoral advisor in linguistics. A dissertationprospectus must be submitted to and approved by the doctoral committeebefore the writing of the dissertation commences. The PhD will begranted upon completion of the preceding requirements, the writing ofan original dissertation acceptable to the doctoral committee, and an oralexamination on the dissertation.Required CoursesCodeTitleCredits.

The official website is www.fafsa.ed.gov (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov)2.List the University of Oregon (using code number 003223) on theFAFSA application as a school to receive the application information3.Apply for admission to the University of OregonDeadlinesTo be given priority consideration for the Federal SupplementalEducational Opportunity Grant, Federal Work-Study Program, andFederal Perkins Loan for all or part of any given academic year, a validFAFSA must be received by the federal processor on or before March1 prior to the academic year for which the student is applying. To meetthis deadline, submit the FAFSA no later than February 15. The FAFSA isavailable on October 1 prior to the academic year for which the student isapplying. Signing the FAFSA electronically is the recommended methodfor submission. If applicable, online applicants should mail the FAFSAsignature page, obtained from the FAFSA website, in early February.EligibilityFinancial aid eligibility for any student is determined by the differencebetween the estimated cost of education at the University of Oregon andthe expected family contribution (as determined by the FAFSA) from thestudent’s family, the student and parents if the student is a dependent,or the student and spouse if the student is married. Students (and theirfamilies if appropriate) are expected to bear the primary responsibility formeeting educational costs. When a student’s expected family contribution24         Student Financial Aid and Scholarshipsis less than the cost of education, the university attempts to meet thedifference with need-based financial aid.Assessing Financial Aid EligibilityThe university uses a method prescribed by law to determine anexpected contribution from the student and family toward the cost ofthe student’s education. The expected family contribution, derived fromusing the federal formula, is based on income and asset informationas well as certain variables such as family size and number of familymembers attending college. This system ensures that students receiveconsistent and equitable treatment. Financial aid counselors reviewunique circumstances on a case-by-case basis, at the request of thestudent.Satisfactory Academic ProgressTo be eligible for financial aid, students must make satisfactory academicprogress toward their degrees and maintain a minimum cumulative gradepoint average (GPA) and pace. Progress is reviewed annually at the endof spring term.The minimum cumulative GPA needed to meet satisfactory academicprogress is 2.00 for an undergraduate and 3.00 for a graduatestudent (except for law students seeking a JD or LLM degree, whorequire a 2.00 GPA). For more information on how your cumulativeUO GPA is calculated, including how incompletes, withdrawals, orrepetitions may affect your GPA, please visit the GPA calculator (https://registrar.uoregon.edu/current-students/grading-system/#calculating-a-grade-point-average). If a student’s cumulative GPA drops below therequired minimum at the time of the evaluation, eligibility for financialaid will be suspended unless the student appeals and is approved forreinstatement. Students may also reestablish eligibility for the subsequentterm after raising their GPA to the minimum requirement. Visit thefinancial aid website for information on the appeals process.Progress toward a degree is a further requirement, determined bydividing the number of credits attempted by the number of credits earned.Students are expected to earn credit for at least 67 percent of the creditsattempted on an aggregate basis. Credit is earned for grades A, B, C, D,and P. Credit is not earned for grades of F, W, I, Y, N, and X. A progresscalculator is located online.Students must also complete their degrees within a maximum timeframe. A student must graduate before accumulating 150 percent ofthe attempted credits required for completing his or her major. Mostmajors at the University of Oregon require 180 credits; 270 would be 150percent of that. If a student is unable to fulfill the requirements for hisor her degree before reaching this maximum time frame, financial aidwill be suspended. Visit the website (http://financialaid.uoregon.edu) forinformation on the appeals process.Complete withdrawal (or receiving a 0.0 GPA) from the University ofOregon during a student's first term or complete withdrawal (or receivinga 0.0 GPA) from the UO for two consecutive terms constitutes failure tomeet satisfactory academic progress standards regardless of GPA, pace,or time frame.For additional information, visit the website (http://financialaid.uoregon.edu/satisfactory_academic_progress).Financial Aid PackagesStudents will receive notification of their awards after their financial aideligibility has been established.

Ford Federal Direct Student LoanProgramFederal Direct Subsidized LoanStudents must demonstrate need to qualify for a Federal DirectSubsidized Loan. The university determines the amount the studentmay borrow within federal limits: $3,500 for the first academic year ofundergraduate study (up to 44 credits); $4,500 for the second academicyear (45–89 credits); and $5,500 an academic year for the remainingyears of undergraduate study. Not all students are eligible for themaximums. The Federal Direct Subsidized Loan is for undergraduatestudents with financial need. The US Department of Education paysthe interest (subsidizes) on a Direct Subsidized Loan while the studentis enrolled, during a student's grace period, and during a period ofdeferment.Student borrowers must be enrolled in good academic standing at leasthalf time and have been accepted for admission to an eligible programleading to a degree or certificate. Once repayment begins, borrowers arecharged a fixed interest rate that is set every July 1. The interest rate forthe 2018–19 academic year is 5.045 percent with an origination fee of1.66 percent (if first disbursed on or after October 1, 2017, and beforeOctober 1, 2018) or with an origination fee yet to be determined (if firstdisbursed on or after October 1, 2018, and before October 1, 2019).If a student is a first-time borrower on or after July 1, 2013, there is a limiton the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that he orshe may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. This time limit does not applyto Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct Parent PLUS Loans. If this limitapplies to a given student, the student may not receive Direct SubsidizedLoans for more than 150 percent of the published length of the program(called the “maximum eligibility period"). The maximum eligibility period istypically based on the published length of the student's current program.For example, if a student is enrolled in a four-year bachelor’s degreeprogram, the maximum period for which the student may receive DirectSubsidized Loans is six years (150 percent of four years = six years).If a student receives a Direct Subsidized Loan that is first disbursedbetween July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2014, he or she will be responsible forpaying any interest that accrues during the grace period. If the studentchooses not to pay the interest that accrues during the grace period, theinterest will be added to his or her principal balance.Federal Direct Unsubsidized LoanDirect Unsubsidized Loans are available to students who do not qualify,in whole or in part, for the Direct Subsidized Loan. The universitydetermines the amount the student may borrow within federal limits:$5,500 for the first academic year of undergraduate study (up to 44credits); $6,500 for the second academic year (45–89 credits); and$7,500 per year for the remaining years of undergraduate study. Not allstudents are eligible for the maximums.Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate and graduatestudents. There is no requirement to demonstrate financial need. Thestudent is responsible for paying the interest on a Direct UnsubsidizedLoan during all periods. If the student chooses not to pay the interestwhile in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearanceperiods, the interest will accrue (accumuluate) and be capitalized (that is,your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).A student’s financial need and dependency status determines the amountof the loan offered. Independent students, as defined by answers on theFAFSA, may borrow up to an additional $4,000 in their freshman andsophomore years and up to an additional $5,000 in their junior and senioryears.The interest rate on undergraduate loans for the 2018–19 academicyear is 4.45 percent with an origination fee of 1.066 percent (if firstdisbursed on or after October 1, 2017, and before October 1, 2018) orwith an origination fee yet to be determined (if first disbursed on or afterOctober 1, 2018, and before October 1, 2019). Interest that accruesduring in-school, grace, and authorized deferment periods will be addedto the principal when repayment begins. The interest rate for the DirectUnsubsidized Loan is fixed every July 1.The University of Oregon            27Graduate and law students may borrow up to $20,500 a year dependingon their financial need. Interest on this loan for graduate and law studentsfor 2018–19 is 6.595 percent with an origination fee of 1.066 percent (iffirst disbursed on or after October 1, 2017, and before October 1, 2018)or with an origination fee yet to be determined (if first disbursed on orafter October 1, 2018, and before October 1, 2019).Additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized LoanDependent undergraduate students whose parents are denied accessto the Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (ParentPLUS) program may be eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loanfunds. Students with fewer than 90 credits may borrow a maximum of$4,000 a year in additional funds above the maximum Federal DirectLoan limits. Students who have earned 90 credits or more may borrowa maximum of an additional $5,000 a year. Not all applicants qualify forthe maximums. The Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan may be used toreplace expected family contribution, but total direct loan (subsidized andunsubsidized) borrowing cannot exceed the cost of education.Generally, the cumulative amount a student can borrow from all FederalDirect Loans is as follows:•$31,000 (only $23,000 may be subsidized) as a dependentundergraduate•$57,500 as an independent undergraduate (only $23,000 of thisamount may be subsidized)•$138,500 as a graduate or professional studentFederal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students(Parent PLUS)This program provides loans to parents of dependent undergraduatestudents. Parents may borrow up to an annual amount that is equalto the cost of education minus any estimated financial assistance thestudent receives during the periods of enrollment. The borrower may usethe amount of the Federal Direct PLUS to replace the expected familycontribution for the loan period.The Federal Direct PLUS is limited to parents who do not have anadverse credit history or who have obtained an endorser who does nothave an adverse credit history. A direct loan program servicer, contractedby the federal government, performs the required credit check. Theinterest on the Federal Direct PLUS is fixed every July 1. The interest ratefor 2017–18 is 7 percent with an origination fee of 4.264 percent (if firstdisbursed on or after October 1, 2017, and before October 1, 2018) orwith an origination fee yet to be determined (if first disbursed on or afterOctober 1, 2018, and before October 1, 2019).Parents interested in participating in the Federal Direct PLUS programmay request the loan by visiting the US Department of Education website(https://studentloans.gov).Federal PLUS Loan for Graduate and Professional Students(Graduate PLUS)This program is offered to qualified students with or without financialneed, but the student must have financial aid eligibility. Like other directloans for students, the US Department of Education is the direct lenderof the Graduate PLUS. Typically, repayment must begin within 60 daysafter the Graduate PLUS is disbursed. However, students who meet therequirements may obtain an in-school deferment from the US Departmentof Education. There is no grace period for this loan. Interest begins toaccrue at the time the first disbursement is made at a fixed rate set everyJuly 1. The interest rate for 2018–19 is 7.595 percent with an originationfee of 4.264 percent (if first disbursed on or after October 1, 2017, andbefore October 1, 2018) or with an origination fee yet to be determined (iffirst disbursed on or after October 1, 2018, and before October 1, 2019).RepaymentPayment of all Direct Loans are handled through an assigned directloan servicer. To locate the appropriate direct loan servicer, thestudent may sign in to the National Student Loan Data System (https://www.nslds.ed.gov).Repayment of Federal Direct Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized)begins six months after termination of at least half-time enrollment.Repayment of Federal PLUS loans typically begins within 60 days of thelast disbursement of the loan. A deferment may be requested after loanapproval. Borrowers have the right to prepay their loans without penalty.Furthermore, they may choose from the following repayment plans:•A standard repayment plan with a fixed payment amount (at least $50a month) over a fixed period of time, not to exceed 10 years•An extended repayment plan with a fixed or graduated annualrepayment of at least $50 a month over a period of up to 25 years,depending on the total amount owed•A graduated repayment schedule in which payments are lower at firstand then increase, usually every two years, over a period of as muchas 10 years•An income-contingent repayment plan with varying annual repaymentamounts based on the total amount owed and the annual income ofthe borrower (and that of the borrower’s spouse, if a joint return isfiled) paid over a period not to exceed 25 years (Parent PLUS Loansare not eligible for this plan)•An income-based repayment plan designed to make repaying federalloans easier for students who intend to pursue jobs with lowersalaries such as careers in public service. Monthly payments arecapped at a percentage of the borrower’s discretionary income,which is based on family size and income rather than total amountborrowed. Payments change as the borrower’s income changes andmade over a period of up to 25 years•The Pay As You Earn Plan is designed for new borrowers (since2008) with at least a partial financial hardship. Payment amountschange as the borrower’s income changes, with a repayment periodof up to 20 years (Parent PLUS Loans are not eligible for this plan,unless it is part of a Direct Consolidation Loan). There is also anew Revised Pay As You Earn Plan with similar conditions but norequirement to be a new borrower•An income-sensitive repayment plan in which monthly payments arebased on annual income over a period of as much as 15 yearsIf the borrower does not select one of these five plans, the Department ofEducation assigns the standard repayment plan. Visit studentaid.ed.gov(http://studentaid.ed.gov) for details on all repayment plans.The borrower’s repayment liability is discharged if the borrower becomespermanently and totally disabled or dies or if the student for whom aparent has borrowed dies. Federal Direct Student Loans are generally notdischargeable in bankruptcy.Deferring RepaymentRepayment of a Federal Direct Student Loan that is not in default may bedeferred for28         Student Financial Aid and Scholarships•at least half-time enrollment in an eligible program at an eligibleschool•an approved graduate fellowship program or rehabilitation trainingprogram for disabled individuals (except medical internship orresidency program)•unemployment (up to three years)•economic hardship (up to three years)During periods of approved deferment, a Federal Direct Subsidized Loanborrower does not need to make payments of principal, and the interestis paid by the federal government. For the Federal Direct Unsubsidizedor PLUS borrower, principal repayment may be deferred, but interestcontinues to accrue and is capitalized or paid by the borrower during thattime.ForbearanceA direct loan borrower or endorser may receive forbearance from thefederal government if the borrower or endorser is willing but unable tomake scheduled loan payments. Forbearance is the temporary cessationof payments, an extension of time for making payments, or the temporaryacceptance of smaller payments than previously scheduled. Forbearancemay be granted for up to 12 months for reasons such as financialhardship, illness, or while serving in a medical or dental internship orresidency program.Deferments and forbearance are handled by the assigned direct loanservicer. To locate the appropriate direct loan servicer, the studentmay sign in to the National Student Loan Data System at https://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds/.Public Service Loan ForgivenessThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program forgives the remainingbalance on your direct loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthlypayments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for aqualified employer. More information about the program may be found onthe US Department of Education website (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service).Federal Direct Consolidation LoanLoan consolidation is a way of lowering monthly payments by combiningseveral federal loans into one loan at the time of repayment. Borrowersmay consolidate any amount of eligible loans including those borrowedunder the Federal Family Education Loan program, the Federal PerkinsLoan program, and the Direct Loan Program. The interest rate is fixedat the time of consolidation based on the weighted average of the loansbeing consolidated. Repayment of Consolidation loans may extend to30 years depending on the repayment plan selected and the amountborrowed. The result of a longer repayment term, however, is an increasein the total cost of the loan.Entrance and Exit CounselingFirst-time Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and Graduate PLUSLoan borrowers must participate in entrance counseling before a loandisbursement can be made.Shortly before graduating from or terminating enrollment at the Universityof Oregon, borrowers must also participate in exit loan counseling.Both entrance and exit counseling sessions are completed on the federalstudent loan website (https://studentloans.gov).Alternative LoansPrivately funded loans are not based on need and no federal formula isapplied to determine eligibility. However, the amount borrowed cannotexceed the cost of education minus other financial aid. Interest ratesand repayment terms vary, but are generally less favorable than thoseprovided through the federal direct lending program. Private loans areused to supplement the federal programs when the cost of educationminus federal aid still leaves unmet need.

Out of these courses individualizedprograms emerge, reflecting each student’s special interests, goals, andaspirations. Translating these goals and interests into courses, majors,and minors requires careful planning. For this reason, students must seekthe assistance of academic advisors and may not complete their firstterm’s registration without discussing options with an advisor.The importance of program planning cannot be overemphasized. Asound academic program indicates a growing intellectual maturity andsharpening of focus. A poorly planned program demonstrates the lack ofclear direction.The faculty advisor provides the student with an intellectual frameworkin which intelligent planning and decision-making can be completed,so students are strongly urged to consult advisors regularly. Theuniversity considers advising an extension of teaching and regards it as aprimary responsibility of faculty members, who schedule time each termespecially for advising.Students who have declared majors are assigned to faculty advisors intheir departments. The Office of Academic Advising coordinates advisingfor students who have not declared majors and for those interested in lawprofessions. See also Academic Advising in the Undergraduate Studiessection of this catalog.General Principles in Program Planning1.To earn a degree in four years (twelve terms), students shouldaverage 15 credits a term. In planning a term’s studies, studentsshould anticipate that each credit requires at least three hours a weekfor class meetings or homework2.Each term’s schedule should be planned to include the universitybachelor’s degree requirements and requirements for the major.Major requirements are listed in this catalog under the academicdepartment headings. Students who have not selected a majorshould spend some time exploring possible majors3.Students should read the course descriptions in this catalog and thenotes in the class schedule to learn course pre- or corequisites4.Many university major disciplines and courses require competence inmathematics. Mathematics should be started in the first year5.A second language, whether required or elective, should also bestarted in the first year if possible. Students planning to study abroadon an international exchange program during the sophomore or junioryear should achieve competence in a language early6.Each student should prepare a four-year model program of coursesand discuss the program with the assigned departmental facultyadvisor7.New students might want to explore some special curricularprograms: Freshman Interest Groups, Transfer Seminars, FreshmanSeminars, College Scholars, and Faculty Perspective Seminars.These programs should be investigated early in the first year8.Sound planning is necessary to design a program that combinescourses demanding extensive reading, daily exercises, laboratorywork, and lengthy papers9.Planning might also include the use of university resources forimproving skills in reading, computation, note-taking, test-taking, andwritingAcademic Majors, Minors, and CareersUniversity of Oregon undergraduate students must complete at least oneacademic major to graduate. A minor is another way to focus studiestoward career and interest areas. Inquiries about minors should bedirected to specific departments. Faculty advisors in the respectivedepartments are the best sources of information about majors andminors.Career PlanningCareer CenterHendricks Hall, Second Floorcareer.uoregon.eduSetting clear and achievable goals for the college years is very important.In addition to selecting a major before the end of the second year andparticipating in internships or volunteer work, it is also important toidentify the skills and the knowledge you are interested in strengtheningand creating a plan to achieve that goal.Identifying a Career. Although the availability of employment isimportant in choosing majors and careers, it should not be the onlyconsideration. Students should determine if their strengths are beingused and developed in the major field they have chosen and if theirinterests lie in that field. Assistance in determining both strengths andinterests is available to students from a variety of sources at the CareerCenter.Explore and Prepare. Through individual advising appointments, groupworkshops, and classes, staff members of the Career Center facilitatethe process of identifying potential career paths. Students can findinformation about careers with the following resources:•One-on-One Appointments. Staff members help students determinethe best steps to take in reaching specific career goals.•Career Development Classes. The center offers 2-credit coursesto assist students in career development, major selection, andpreparation for internship and job searches. Seminar: [Topic] (CAS407) (Career Decisions) covers self-assessment, career exploration,and decision-making; Seminar: [Topic] (3-1202Computer science, the study of computation, offers students thechallenge and excitement of a dynamically evolving science whosediscoveries and applications affect every aspect of modern life.Computer science is a rich intellectual field where practitioners applya computational approach to address a wide variety of interesting andchallenging problems. Computer scientists are engaged in research incore areas of theoretical computer science, computer systems design,algorithms, and programming languages, as well as more application-oriented areas such as databases, networking, and informatics.The Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS) is committedto a strong research program and a rewarding educational experience forundergraduate and graduate students.The department offers instruction and opportunities for research in thefollowing areas:•artificial intelligence•assistive technology•computational science•computer security•data science•high-performance computing•human-computer interaction•internet of things•machine learning•networking and systems•parallel and distributed computing•programming languages and compilers•scientific visualization•smart and connected communities•software engineering•theoretical computer science•universal accessThe department offers bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees; inaddition, two undergraduate minors and a selection of service coursesare offered for students who want introductory exposure to computersand computer applications. The computer science programs at theuniversity are continually evolving as the discipline matures and asstudents’ needs change.FacilitiesThe Department of Computer and Information Science is housed inDeschutes Hall, which holds faculty and graduate student offices andextensive laboratory space for research and instruction.Undergraduate majors may use campus computing labs staffed by CISundergraduate tutors and lab assistants. Undergraduate majors takingupper-division courses and graduate students share a collaborativecomputing lab for the exclusive use of CIS students. Graduate andundergraduate students engaged in active research also have access tothe computing facilities of the associated research lab.148         Computer and Information ScienceThe cognitive modeling and eye-tracking laboratory features multipleEyegaze eye trackers and a Tobii eye tracker, used to collect andanalyze the eye movements people make during human-computerinteractions, and to develop eye-controlled user interfaces for people withdisabilities. The lab also features a VRSonic SoundSim Cube spatializedaudio server used to explore three-dimensional sound perception.Research in high-performance computing and computational scienceis supported by resources shared among the department, theComputational Science Institute, and the Neuroinformatics Center.In addition, the University of Oregon, through a Major ResearchInstrumentation Program grant from the National Science Foundation,has created a large-scale computational and storage resource tosupport multidisciplinary scientific research. The Applied ComputationalInstrument for Scientific Synthesis (ACISS) is a heterogenous platformmanaged as a cloud system for computational science, informatics, anddata science.The Advanced Integration and Mining Laboratory fosters research onfinding useful patterns from the mountain of data on biology, health,medicine, neuroscience, physiology, and social networks and onintegrating data from structurally and semantically heterogeneousresources such as databases, online social networks, and the WorldWide Web.The Oregon Network Research Group Laboratory features an arrayof high-end servers, experimental test beds, and mass storages fordeveloping and testing of new network protocols, conducting large-scalenetwork measurement and data analysis.The Network and Security Research Laboratory features hardware andsoftware facilities devoted to experimentation, simulation, and analysisof various computer networking techniques (such as Internet routing,software-defined networking, online social networking, and Internet ofthings), malicious network attacks (such as distributed denial-of-serviceattacks, traffic route hijacking, Internet worms, botnets, Sybil attacks),and cyberdefense technologies (such as firewalls, antiphishing solutions,distributed denial-of-service defense, IP spoofing prevention, Internetrouting security, Internet privacy protection, and Internet of things securityand privacy).The Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory uses a mix of custom-designedand commercial hardware to study the application of assistive software toeveryday living. Researchers are particularly interested in the design ofsoftware for those with impairments that limit their use of commercial, off-the-shelf software.The Research Group on Computing and Data-Understanding at ExtremeScale (CDUX) pursues problems in scientific visualization, high-performance computing, scientific computing, and computer graphics,and especially focuses on problems where these areas intersect. Thegroup performs research for the Department of Energy, the NationalScience Foundation, and private companies, delivered in widely usedsoftware tools such as the VisIt visualization tool, and helps develop newtools, like VTK-m, a library for many-core visualization and analysis.The High-Performance Computing Laboratory conducts researchin several areas, including static analysis of software for buildingperformance models and detecting security vulnerabilities, source-to-source approaches for semantics-preserving (e.g., performanceoptimization) and semantics-modifying (e.g., security-vulnerability fixes,automatic differentiation) transformations. The lab also performs researchin modeling run-time characteristics of software, and developing andemploying numerical optimization techniques for maximizing multiple run-time objectives (performance, energy efficiency, resilience).Software engineering is applied to two emerging areas: data science andthe Internet of Things. The Flare Project is exploring new tools for datascientists. The project involves working with data science frameworks(e.g., Jupyter) and the interactive development environments (withhumans in the loop) that support those frameworks. The Foundry Projectis exploring software frameworks to support the Internet of Things with aspecific emphasis on reworking distributed algorithms that were devisedin an era when cyber-security was less of a threat.In addition, the university is a member of Internet2, a high-speed networkconnecting major research institutions.CareersThe undergraduate program is designed to prepare students forprofessional careers or graduate study. The field of computer science,which has become increasingly interdisciplinary over the past decade,offers a rich array of opportunities in fields as disparate as medicine,manufacturing, and the media as well as the computer industry.Graduates come away with confidence that they can specify, design, andbuild large software systems; analyze the effectiveness of computingtechniques for a specific problem; and work effectively in problem-solving teams. The master of arts (MA) and master of science (MS)degree programs prepare students for higher-level positions in the areasdescribed above as well as for teaching positions in community colleges.The PhD degree program trains students as scientists for advancedresearch in specialized areas of computer science and for teaching inuniversities.FacultyZena M.

It is concerned with thescientific understanding of human behavior as it relates to, and as aconsequence of, interaction within groups. The undergraduate programin the Department of Sociology provides a broad understanding of humansociety for students in every field and integrated programs for majors insociology.PreparationHigh school students planning to major in sociology should take coursesin history and social studies; in addition, a course in statistics shouldbe considered. Substantial work in English composition, mathematics,and second languages is also desirable. Two-year transfer students areadvised to come with a year’s work in introductory sociology courses aswell as courses that fulfill university group requirements.CareersRecent graduates with bachelor’s degrees in sociology are found inall the pursuits traditionally open to liberal-arts graduates—especiallysocial service, management, marketing, teaching, library, and research-statistics occupations in industries related to health, education, business,government, and the environment. Some graduates seek additionaltraining in graduate professional schools of social work, businessadministration, and law. A bachelor’s degree alone is seldom sufficient toallow a person to enter a professional career as a sociologist. Studentswho seek careers as social scientists enter graduate programs insociology or related fields.CurriculumUndergraduate courses in sociology are offered at three levels. Coursesat the 200 level provide an introduction to the field. Basic courses areIntroduction to Sociology (3-1217Applications are accepted beginning September 15 for admission fallterm a year later.

The deadline for receipt of fallterm admission is February 1. In exceptional cases, students may beadmitted at other times of the year.The department strongly encourages applications from people ofall backgrounds, and is dedicated to fostering a diverse academicenvironment. This, we believe, will help prepare better future publicleaders.Master of Public Administration RequirementsCodeTitleCreditsCore Courses 13-5209; telephone 541-346-3206.Course Numbering System500–599Courses that offer graduate-level work in classes that may also includeundergraduate students.600–699Graduate courses for graduate students only.700–799Except in the School of Music and Dance, courses of a highly technicalnature that count toward a professional degree only, not towardadvanced academic degrees such as an MA, MS, or PhD. Both 600- and700-level courses with the MUP subject code denote graduate coursesthat apply toward advanced academic degrees in the School of Musicand Dance.503, 507, 508, 510, 601–610, 704–710Graduate and professional courses that may be repeated for credit underthe same number.General Requirements and PoliciesCourse Registration Requirements andLimitsA graduate student may register for up to 16 credits of graduate orundergraduate course work. Registration in excess of this level, up toa maximum of 18 credits, requires payment of additional fees for eachextra credit. During summer session, graduate students are limited to amaximum of 16 credits. Minimum registration is three graduate credits aterm.International students should request information from the Office ofInternational Affairs about Immigration and Naturalization Serviceregulations and minimum credit requirements.Graduate students working toward an advanced degree must be enrolledcontinuously until all degree requirements are completed (see ContinuousEnrollment (p. 941)). Furthermore, students who use faculty assistance,services, or facilities must register each term for at least 3 graduatecredits to compensate for usage. This includes students who are takingonly comprehensive or final examinations or presenting recitals orterminal projects.In the term in which a degree is granted, the student must register for atleast 3 graduate credits. If the student is completing a master’s degreethesis in this final term, registration must include at least 1 of the 3 creditsin Thesis (503). If a doctoral dissertation is being completed, registrationmust include at least 3 credits in Dissertation (603). Exceptions maybe made depending on the timing of the submission of the thesis ordissertation. See the Graduate School website for details.Students living elsewhere while writing a thesis or dissertation andsending chapters to an advisor for feedback must register for a minimumof 3 graduate credits a term; they should register for thesis or dissertationcredits.Various on- and off-campus agencies and offices have their own course-load requirements. For example, some agencies that offer studentloans set registration requirements. The Office of the Registrar can onlycertify the number of credits for which a student has officially registered.Because the minimum registration requirements for the GraduateSchool may not satisfy some agency requirements, it is the student’sresponsibility to register for the required number of credits.The University of Oregon            941Course Enrollment for Faculty and StaffMembersFaculty and staff members who want to take graduate courses shouldrefer to the Human Resources office for information about regulationsand fees.

Each student is encouraged to selecta faculty advisor in the first year. It is critical to the development of aworthwhile program that the advisor be familiar with and sympatheticto the student’s direction and capabilities. The importance of programplanning cannot be overemphasized.Major in ArtThe bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree with a major in art isa liberal arts degree focusing on studio art practice. The curriculum isdesigned to train students to think critically, communicate clearly, andwork creatively. Students develop an understanding of materials andtools, formal possibilities, technical skills, critical inquiry, and ways ofseeing, as well as fluency in visual languages and the articulation ofmeaning. They gain an understanding of the larger context of art throughcourses in art history and theory, opportunities to study abroad, andlectures by visiting artists.The curriculum includes course work in eight media areas—painting,sculpture, printmaking, digital media, photography, ceramics, fibers,and metalsmithing and jewelry. While all art majors share the basicrequirements such as the core foundations courses and art history,students have the flexibility to pursue more advanced course work in theareas of primary interest to them.The University of Oregon            645Application to the MajorStudents apply directly to the Department of Art for admission as majorsto the BA, BS, and fifth-year BFA degree programs.

Philosophy also strengthens the ability toreason, enlarges the imagination, and refines aesthetic sensitivity. Aphilosophical education thus offers excellent preparation for a broadrange of careers that require critical intelligence and creative problem-solving as well as oral and written communication skills.FacultySteven Brence, instructor (social and political philosophy, philosophy offilm, ethics).

Studentsplanning to specialize in biology should include in their high schoolpreparation as much mathematics, chemistry, and physics as possible.International baccalaureate and advanced placement course work andtesting are encouraged.Transfer StudentsStudents who intend to transfer as majors from a community collegeor four-year institution should carefully plan the course work they takebefore transferring. Students who transfer after one year of collegeshould have completed a year of college-level mathematics and generalchemistry with laboratories. Satisfactory completion of a yearlong biologymajor’s introductory sequence that includes laboratories and featuresstrong components of genetics, evolution, and physiology, most oftenenables transfer students to earn credit for three of four courses in theGeneral Biology sequence. If this is the case, to complete the 200-level, lower-division biology requirement, students must successfullycomplete (P or C– or better) General Biology IV: Mechanisms ().Either sequence is appropriate for students with interests in any areaof biology. Students should consult the department website or visit theBiology and General Science Advising Center to seek advice on whichThe University of Oregon            77sequence is most appropriate for them, and for the most up-to-dateinformation.CareersThe biology major prepares students for many outstanding fields. Biologyprofessions have been ranked among the top ten jobs in the UnitedStates for more than 20 years.Many graduates have gone on to top US and international schools inmedicine, dentistry, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, optometry, physicaltherapy, nursing, and teacher education. Others have pursued PhD andMS degrees in molecular biology, neuroscience, ecology and evolution,and marine biology, or have found employment with governmentagencies, private industry, or nonprofit organizations. Selected job listingsare available online at uocareer.uoregon.edu, in the Biology and GeneralScience Advising Center, and in the Career Center, 244 Hendricks Hall.Biology majors are encouraged to become involved in a variety oflearning experiences beyond their college course work. More than two-thirds of our students are actively involved in research, and many assistwith tutoring or teaching laboratories. Local, national, and internationalinternships are available for those interested in a wide variety of specialtyareas. Sample international programs established by the biology facultyin collaboration with Global Education Oregon, the UO's overseasprogram, include neotropical ecology in Ecuador, tropical marine biologyin Panama, and tropical diseases and service learning placements inGhana.Major RequirementsA major in biology or marine biology leads to a bachelor of science (BS)or a bachelor of arts (BA) degree. More than 95 percent of biology andmarine biology majors seek the bachelor of science (BS) degree. The BArequires completion of the foreign-language requirement, while those withdouble majors or those emphasizing languages may choose to pursue abachelor of arts (BA) degree.Bachelor of Arts Degree Requirements: BiologyCodeTitleCreditsCore CoursesMath 18Honors Biology III: Evolution, Diversity andEcologyUpper-Division Biology Courses 116Total Credits28-311No more than 4 credits from General Biology III: Populationsor Honors Biology III: Evolution,Diversity and Ecology4General education course in arts and letters or socialscience8The University of Oregon            83Elective or general education course that also satisfiesa multicultural requirement4Credits16Total Credits48CourseTitleCreditsMilestonesThird YearFallGeneral Biology III: Populationsor Honors Biology III: Evolution,Diversity and Ecology4General education courses in arts and letters or socialscience8Elective or general education course that also satisfiesa multicultural requirement4Credits16Summer.Prereq: .Prereq: .

Doe and Terry Takahashi, Faculty Codirectors541-346-4556Institute of Neuroscience222 Huestis Hall1254 University of OregonEugene, Oregon 97403-1254Graduate StudiesNeuroscience is the interdisciplinary study of neural function,development, and behavior. At the University of Oregon, the graduatetraining program in neuroscience is centered in the Institute ofNeuroscience. Participating faculty members are drawn from theDepartments of Biology, Human Physiology, and Psychology.CurriculumFirst-year graduate students take one of two core sequences:1.cellular, systems, and cognitive neuroscience2.developmental, molecular, and genetic neuroscienceThe core sequences are taught cooperatively by the faculty. Moststudents also take elective courses in a variety of subjects.Faculty-Student SeminarsFaculty members and graduate students participate in weekly informalseminars that feature lively discussion of research papers in specificareas of neuroscience. Students and faculty members also participate inthe neuroscience seminar, a weekly series featuring visiting scientists.The purpose of the neuroscience seminar is to keep both the faculty andstudents abreast of current developments in this broad field.ResearchStudents are encouraged to participate in laboratory research from thevery beginning of their graduate training. A laboratory rotation programis directed toward this objective. In the rotation program, new studentstake part in the activities of a different laboratory group during each of thethree terms of the first year. Participation may include a research project,ongoing experiments, or other activities. This program allows students tolearn firsthand about different approaches to the study of neurosciencebefore choosing an area of concentration.420         Pacific Island StudiesDoctoral StudyStudents who want to enter the neuroscience program should apply tothe PhD program of a participating department and indicate their interestin neuroscience. Typically, students interested in cognitive neuroscienceapply to the psychology department; students interested in molecular,cellular, developmental, or systems neuroscience apply to the biologydepartment. Such applications are reviewed by the neuroscience facultyas well as the departmental admission committee. Answers to specificquestions about prerequisites and deadlines may be obtained by writingdirectly to one of the participating departments, University of Oregon,Eugene, Oregon 97403. Additional information about the Institute ofNeuroscience may be obtained from the institute website.

WGS 422S,"exuality Studies: [Topic]4The University of Oregon            51College of Arts andSciencesW. Andrew Marcus, Tykeson Dean of Arts and Sciences541-346-3902114 Friendly HallThe College of Arts and Sciences is the academic and intellectual hub ofthe University of Oregon, providing a core liberal arts curriculum to thevast majority of UO undergraduates—even those who will go on to earn adegree in one of the professional schools such as journalism or business.The University of Oregon was founded in 1876 on a liberal artscurriculum, which has evolved over time to meet the needs ofcontemporary students. Owing to the breadth and depth of the curriculumprovided by the College of Arts and Sciences, the University of Oregonis known as the premier liberal arts institution among the state’s publicuniversities.The fundamental academic mission of the college is to foster a solid andbroad general education, which includes the cultivation of quantitative,analytical, and communication skills; an understanding of social andintellectual history; an appreciation of literary and artistic expression; andhabits of creative and critical thinking.Building on its foundational undergraduate curriculum, the college offers50 major degree programs in the humanities, social sciences, and naturalsciences. Moreover, the College of Arts and Sciences is the heart ofthe university’s research enterprise. The college has almost 900 facultymembers, most of whom are engaged in active research programsand make original contributions to their respective fields of knowledge.Because of this, students have the opportunity to learn from leadingresearchers while receiving a liberal education that prepares them to besuccessful global citizens in the 21st century.Liberal EducationSocial, political, and economic change is accelerating at a phenomenalpace. Many careers exist today that did not exist 10 or even five yearsago, and the US Department of Labor predicts that young people todaywill have had 10 to 14 jobs by the time they are 38 years old. Those bestprepared for the future will be those who have developed a capacity forresourcefulness, judgment, analysis, leadership, clear communication,and an informed global perspective—in other words, the skills andknowledge that come from a liberal arts education.Even students who plan to move into specialized postgraduate careerswill benefit from an educational foundation that emphasizes how values,history, and context combine with creative thought and informed inquiryto determine the best way forward, in both professional and civic life.Thus a liberal arts education provides an essential framework for alifetime of work and growth in a world where many professions areundergoing profound, sweeping transformations.Academic ProgramsThe College of Arts and Sciences offers numerous disciplinary andinterdisciplinary degree programs and majors, a varied selection ofminors, and several certificates. These are described in detail in thepages that follow. As part of the requirements for graduation fromthe University of Oregon, every student undertakes in-depth study inan area of specialization that is the student’s major. Many studentsfind it advantageous to complete a minor or certificate in an area ofspecialization that complements the major. Some minor programs offer astudent whose major is in the College of Arts and Sciences the chance togain expertise in subjects offered by a professional school.Preparatory ProgramsThe college has preparatory programs for professional specializations.Information about these programs—those offered by the College of Artsand Sciences and those offered elsewhere in the university—is in theAcademic Resources section of this catalog.Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesThe University of Oregon is smaller than most public research universitiesbecause it does not have schools of medicine, agriculture, public health,engineering, or veterinary medicine. This means that it can offer alearning environment scaled for faculty-student interaction that is morelike a private liberal arts college than a large research institution.Undergraduate students are encouraged to participate in faculty researchprojects. Arrangements must be made with the individual faculty memberand the department.Opportunities are plentiful: last year, almost 800 undergraduates enrolledin research credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences. In addition,more than 20 departments in the College of Arts and Sciences offer anhonors program with an undergraduate research thesis requirement.AdvisingStudents who have declared a major, or who are premajors in a particularfield, plan their programs with advisors in their major departments. Majorsshould be chosen by the middle of the sophomore year. Many enteringfreshmen—and some students at more advanced stages—have notdecided on a major or even the general direction of their academic work.These exploring students are assigned academic advisors by the directorof college advising and the Office of Academic Advising.Preparation for Kindergarten throughSecondary School Teaching CareersStudents who complete a degree in a College of Arts and Sciencesdepartment are eligible to apply to the College of Education’s fifth-yearlicensure programs in middle-secondary and elementary teaching.

Although the courses deal with a variety of linguistictopics, three facets of linguistics are strongly emphasized in the graduateprogram:1.A pragmatic approach to the study of language structure and use,variation and change, and acquisition and learning2.An empirical, live-data, fieldwork, experimental, and cross-linguisticapproach to the methodology of linguistic research3.Interdisciplinary emphasis on the place of human language in itswider natural contextThe University of Oregon            371Advising and Review PracticesGraduate students meet regularly with the departmental director ofgraduate studies. In addition, students are assigned a faculty member toadvise them in the areas of their academic interest. The faculty reviewsthe performance of each graduate student at the end of each academicterm. In case a student falls below what the faculty considers minimalstandards of performance, a representative of the faculty notifies thestudent and suggests appropriate remedial steps.Master of ArtsFor those who intend to complete the PhD, the MA is not necessary andmay delay completion of the advanced degree. While not necessary, theoption of completing a terminal theoretical MA may be appropriate forsome whose goals are, for example, professional work in a languagecommunity. Prospective students who are unsure which program wouldbe appropriate are encouraged to consult with the department's directorof graduate studies.PrerequisitesStudents may be required to take and pass (with grades of B– or better)certain prerequisite courses, typically an introductory course, such asMorphology and Syntax ("

Students may enhance majors in other departmentswith a minor in East Asian studies, South Asian studies, or SoutheastAsian studies.Students who major in Asian studies often complement their course workwith a year or more of residence in Asia or a double major to combine aprofession with their area of expertise. Job possibilities are increasing insuch fields as business, journalism, government, and education. Manystudents go on to graduate studies.The curriculum includes courses in anthropology, art history, dance,ethnic studies, film, geography, history, international studies, linguistics,political science, religious studies, and Chinese, Japanese, and Koreanlanguage and literature. The program is administered by the Asianstudies committee, which is composed of faculty members with Asianspecializations.Declaring a MajorTo be accepted into the Asian studies major, a student must requestacceptance as a major in the Asian studies office before attaining seniorstatus. Depending on interests and career objectives, students areencouraged to discuss with their advisors or the program director theadvisability of pursuing a second major in a supporting discipline orpreprofessional program.Major RequirementsThe major in Asian studies offers•strong training in at least one Asian language (Chinese, Japanese, orKorean)•knowledge of the histories and cultures of the societies in which thatlanguage is used•a sense of how academic disciplines contribute to interdisciplinarystudy•a knowledge of transnational Asia beyond the primary language andcivilization focus listed aboveBachelor of Arts Degree RequirementsStudents must complete 48 credits as specified below. As many as 8 ofthese credits may be taken pass/no pass; at least 40 of the 48 creditsmust be chosen at the 300 level or above. All other courses used tosatisfy major requirements must be taken for letter grades and passedwith grades of C– or better.

They do not, however, require specific undergraduate majorsor prescribe a specific prelegal curriculum. Law schools suggest thatprospective students choose majors that provide education in broadcultural fields, which orient students to the general societal frameworkwithin which our legal system has developed.Whatever the undergraduate major, prelaw students should placeconsiderable emphasis on the development of skills in Englishcomposition and communication and on acquiring the ability to read withunderstanding, to think logically, and to perform research and analysiscompetently. Many law schools advise against a large concentration ofcourses in vocational training.The following courses would be appropriate. They are not required foradmission, nor do they substitute for a broad, well-developed educationalbackground.•College Composition I ("

About 30 percent of students whoearn an undergraduate degree continue their studies in a graduatedegree program, leading to a career in teaching or research or bothat a university, at a government laboratory, or in industry. In addition,a degree in physics is good preparation for a career in business.Students who have demonstrated their ability with a good record in anundergraduate physics program are generally considered very favorablyfor admission to medical and other professional schools.Major RequirementsThe major in physics leads to a bachelor of arts (BA) or a bachelor ofscience degree (BS). Complete requirements are listed under Bachelor’sDegree Requirements. The bachelor of arts degree has a second-language requirement. Knowledge of a language other than English isrecommended for students planning graduate study in physics.Required courses must be taken for letter grades and a grade pointaverage of 2.00 (mid-C) or better must be earned in these courses.Courses beyond the minimum requirement may be taken pass/no pass(P/N). At least 20 of the upper-division credits must be completed inresidence at the University of Oregon. Exceptions to these requirementsmust be approved by the physics director of undergraduate studies.Undergraduate research is strongly encouraged.

At least 24 upper-division sciencecredits must be completed at the University of Oregon to meet thegeneral science residency requirement.Upper-division courses may be selected from the general science website(http://gensci.uoregon.edu).Honors ProgramStudents preparing to graduate with honors in general science shouldnotify the program director no later than the first term of the senior year.Honors in general science centers on a thesis, which is the culmination ofresearch conducted under the direction of a faculty advisor. The advisordoes not need to be a member of the general science committee.To graduate with honors, students must have at least a 3.50 overallgrade point average and a GPA of 3.50 or better in the sciences. Inaddition, they must complete 9 credits of Research (401) or Thesis (403)or both in the appropriate department. These credits must be distributedover at least two terms and cannot be used to fulfill emphasis-arearequirements.Upon approval of the thesis by the advisor and the program director,honors in general sciences are awarded.For guidelines and calendar, see a general science program director.Program PlanningInformation about program planning and detailed sample programs areavailable in the General Science Program office. Prehealth sciencestudents who choose the general science major should design theirprograms to meet the admission requirements of the professionalschool of their choice.

Students interested inteaching general science in middle school and junior high school shouldbe aware that the integrated science endorsement requires broaderpreparation than the minimum requirements for the general sciencemajor. The College of Education offers a fifth-year program for middle-secondary teaching licensure in science. See the College of Education(p. 727) section of this catalog.Four-Year Degree PlanThe degree plan shown is only a sample of how students may completetheir degrees in four years.

The program offers students a variety of options depending ontheir interests. For the career-minded student, it provides career trainingcombined with the analytical skills of a liberal arts education. For theintellectually curious student, it offers the study of particular themesacross several social science disciplines. For the student having difficultychoosing a major, general social science offers a curriculum acrossseveral departments.Undergraduate StudiesThe program has four concentrations or tracks. Each concentrationhas its own set of core courses and then provides a number of electivecourses from various departments. Major requirements for each of thefour concentrations may be found on the program website.Applied Economics, Business, and SocietyThis track combines technical training in business with the analyticaltraining of the liberal arts. It draws heavily from courses in the businesscollege and the economics department to offer specific business skillswhile exploring how business functions in society, on the national level,and in the global context. This concentration is designed specifically forstudents who plan to work in business or to pursue a master of businessadministration degree.Crime, Law, and SocietyThis track provides broad exposure to problems that confront societyon the causes and consequences of, and policies on, crime, offeringpreparation for students with an interest in criminology, law practice, lawenforcement, or social services.Globalization, Environment, and PolicyThis track focuses on broad social-political and environmental issues atthe regional, national, and global levels, as well as the policy planningrequired to meet these issues within an interdisciplinary context. Theglobalization concentration provides training for students planning to workin green industry, government, NGOs, and environmental organizations.In addition, the track prepares students to earn graduate degrees inplanning, public management, policy studies, or other applied socialsciences with a global emphasis.The University of Oregon            277Social Studies TeachingThis track prepares students with the course requirements for admissionto the graduate teacher licensure program at the University of Oregon—UO Teach. This concentration does not, in and of itself, lead to a teachinglicense; rather, it provides a well-defined content so that students areprepared to enroll in a graduate program to become licensed to teachsocial studies at the middle or high school level.General social science majors are encouraged to consult with theiradvisors at least once a year to ensure their remaining course work isstructured to meet all the requirements for the major. Students shouldnotify the General Social Science Program office of their intention tograduate at least one term before the proposed graduation date.Four-Year Degree PlanThe degree plan shown is only a sample of how students may completetheir degrees in four years.

Many important advances inchemistry occur at the junctions of classically defined divisions of science.Collaborative interaction between these divisions is fostered throughinterdisciplinary research institutes. Chemical scientists may be interestedin the Institute of Molecular Biology, the Institute of Theoretical Science,the Materials Science Institute, the Oregon Center for Optics, and theprograms in cell biology and in molecular synthesis, structure, anddynamics.First-year students are offered financial assistance through graduateemployee (GE) opportunities. Research assistantships are typicallyavailable for students with advanced standing. These researchappointments are funded through grants to the university by federalagencies and private (industrial) sources for support of the basic researchprograms in the department. Students are selected for these positionsbased on their interest in a particular research area and by mutualagreement of the student and the faculty member directing the work.An illustrated publication, University of Oregon Doctoral Programin Chemistry, may be requested from the department. The bookletpresents information about the program, facilities, financial support,faculty members and their individual research interests, housing, andthe local environment. People who request the booklet also receiveinformation about admission and application forms for admission and GEopportunities.Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, CellBiologyOne of the most active areas of research is the study of the molecularbases of cell function, including synthesis of macromolecules, regulationof gene expression, development, cell movement, and the structureand function of biological membranes. Research in these areas hasbeen fostered by close collaboration among biologists, chemists, andphysicists. The interdisciplinary nature of these programs has beengreatly strengthened by the Institute of Molecular Biology and theprogram in cell biology. Eight members of the chemistry departmentare affiliated with these programs. Entering graduate students are in anexcellent position to take advantage of the molecular-oriented avenues tostudy biological problems.Biophysical ChemistryBiophysical chemistry provides close collaboration and educationalinteraction among faculty members and students. Research groupsthat are developing and applying physical methods work closely withmolecular and cellular biologists, neurobiologists, biochemists, andsynthetic organic chemists. Most of the research programs in biophysicalchemistry are interdisciplinary.Another area of general interest is the nature of the excited electronicstates of biopolymer components. This includes the use of the opticalproperties of biopolymers, such as their circular dichroism, as a probe oftheir conformational state; the relationship of excited state conformationchanges to their resonance Raman spectra; and a fundamental interest inthe nature of excited states.Materials ScienceThe discipline of materials science seeks to understand the structures,properties, and structure-property relationships of condensed phasematerials. It is by nature interdisciplinary, combining expertise from thefields of chemistry, physics, geology, and molecular biology. Most areasof chemistry can make an important contribution to materials science inthe synthesis and characterization of various materials. Here the wordmaterials generally means bulk crystalline solids but also includes low-dimensional materials such as thin solid films or nanoscopic "wires"as well as amorphous solids and some aspects of liquids. Much ofthe excitement of the research in this area derives from the discoveryand the improved understanding of new materials that have potentialtechnological applications.The Materials Science Institute was created to foster collaboration amongthe materials-oriented research groups at the University of Oregon.Members of the institute are active in the study of the structure, reactivity,and thermodynamics of materials in addition to the characterizationof their electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. The chemistryand physics departments, dominant members of the institute, offercourses and seminars on the chemistry and physics of materials tofoster the educational and research aspects of materials science. Thelist of active research topics includes the application of novel syntheticstrategies toward the preparation of metastable phases (including theuse of thin-film superlattice composites, sol-gel synthesis, self-assembly,and electron beam lithography), ultra-high vacuum surface science,laser-induced dynamics at surfaces, nonlinear optics of interfaces,characterization of electronic materials and devices, studies on theproperties of amorphous and glassy materials, quantum size effectsand fundamental limits of microelectronic devices, scanning force andscanning tunneling microscopy of modified surfaces and biologicalmolecules, and electron transport across protein assemblies andbiotechnological materials. Sharing of facilities and expertise amongthe various research groups is an important and valued aspect of theMaterials Science Institute. Collaboration between institute membersand industrial and national research laboratories is also an importantdimension of the program. See also Materials Science Institute in theResearch Institutes and Centers section of this catalog.Organic, Bioorganic, Inorganic,Organometallic, and Materials ChemistryThe synthesis of new chemical substances and the study of theirfundamental chemical and physical properties is at the heart of organic,bioorganic, organometallic, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Researchand teaching in these traditionally distinct subareas is unified through asingle, cohesive organic-inorganic area in the chemistry department.Undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoralresearchers in organic-inorganic chemistry enjoy an especially broadeducation emphasizing the fundamental aspects of chemical synthesis,structural characterization, and mechanisms of chemical reactionsThe University of Oregon            117and processes. Formal course work is organized around theseinterdisciplinary themes. Many research projects are interdisciplinary.Weekly organic-inorganic seminars cover recent advances in organic,organometallic, inorganic, and materials research. Of foremostimportance is the contiguous location of research laboratories. Thisproximity results in an open and active atmosphere that encouragesspontaneous discussions of day-to-day research activities and problems,providing a chemical education unsurpassed by any textbook or formalcourse.Organic-inorganic researchers have direct access to state-of-the-art instrumentation in the shared organic-inorganic instrumentationfacility adjoining the research laboratories. Most faculty members in thisarea have varied research interests and expertise. Collaboration withresearchers working in physics, materials science, biochemistry, andmedicinal chemistry enhances the program.Physical ChemistryPhysical chemistry focuses on understanding the physical basis ofchemical phenomena. This goal is pursued through the concerted effortsof experimentalists and theorists. While experimentalists design and carryout laboratory investigations of chemical systems, theorists conceiveand develop theoretical tools to explain and predict system properties.Ultimately, physical chemistry is about understanding the mysteriesof chemical phenomena at a deep, fundamental level. The disciplinedraws from and contributes to many areas of chemistry, physics, biology,materials science, engineering, and mathematics.At the University of Oregon, research in physical chemistry focuses on avariety of topics.Experimental spectroscopy includes pulsed laser techniques to probethe molecular structure at wet interfaces; the development of newoptical techniques to study the motions of intracellular species andmacromolecules in liquids; and novel ultrafast, nonlinear spectroscopicmethods to study the dynamics of excited states in molecules.On the theoretical front, topics of interest include dynamics of highlyexcited molecules using quantum and semiclassical techniques, thedevelopment of a formal description of wave-packet interferometry,elucidation of molecular structure through theoretical studies of electronicpotential energy surfaces, and theoretical statistical mechanics andsimulation.Much work at Oregon combines frontier experimental and theoreticalapproaches in tandem on particular topics. Theoretical and experimentalstudies in statistical mechanics concentrate on soft condensed matterand complex fluids. Another focus is quantum control using coherent andultrafast laser pulses, pursued along both experimental and theoreticallines.The physics of chemical systems at interfaces includes spectroscopicstudies of organic, inorganic, and biomolecules at surfaces and interfacesas well as electrochemical and electrical investigations of charge transferat molecular or nanoparticle-based semiconducting interfaces.The research on semiconductor interfaces aims at identifying andcontrolling novel systems that enhance or mimic the behavior ofconventional semiconductor interfaces.Industrial Internships for Master’s Degrees inChemistryThese internships, sponsored by the Materials Science Institute, aredescribed in the Research Centers and Institutes (p. 950) section of thiscatalog.

Because cinema isinherently multidisciplinary, courses for the major span the College of Artsand Sciences, the College of Design, and the School of Journalism andCommunication, and include a diverse array of courses in the history,theory, and aesthetics of cinema as well as in digital production. Thiscollaboration is unique to Oregon: cinema studies majors take theircourses across three different schools rather than from one departmentor program within one school, learning to understand the medium from avariety of disciplinary angles and perspectives.The bachelor of arts in cinema studies provides its graduates with asound foundation for entering their chosen professions or continuing theireducation in graduate school. It also gives them the critical and analyticskills to adapt to the changes that are likely to occur in their professionsthroughout their lifetimes.Students in the major are encouraged to study overseas in programsthat immerse them in different cultures and languages, including theprogram's own summer program in Dublin, Ireland, at the NationalFilm School of Ireland, housed in the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art,Design, and Technology. Students are also encouraged to work withthe program's staff to seek internships in their chosen areas of potentialcareer interest and expertise.FacultyPeter Alilunas, assistant professor (cinema studies).

The department offers bachelorThe University of Oregon            127of arts and master of arts degrees in classics, and minors in classicalcivilization, Greek, and Latin.The undergraduate’s primary aim in studying classics at the university isto learn Greek or Latin (or both) well enough to read the ancient authorsin their original languages.Students may also study the archaeology of the ancient Mediterraneanworld. Through the study of classical archaeology, students acquire abroad understanding of Greek and Roman sites and material culture.Although grounded in the study of Greek and Roman buildings, tools, andobjects, the courses stress the cross-cultural influences and interactionsthat informed these materials as well.Through the study of classical literature in the original language and inEnglish translation, and through the study of other areas encompassedby the classics, such as ancient history, philosophy, art history,mythology, and rhetoric, a student gains an understanding of the cultureand ideals of the classical world and their influence on the languages andinstitutions of Western civilization.Members of the classics faculty have a broad range of researchand teaching specialties, including Greek poetry and prose, Romanpoetry and prose, ancient philosophy and science, and classicalarchaeology, and foster close interdisciplinary ties with the faculty ofseveral departments, including anthropology, art history, English, history,and philosophy.Students who intend to major in classics should begin the study ofone or both of the classical languages as early as possible in theirundergraduate careers.CareersA bachelor’s degree in classics prepares students for entry into graduateprograms in classics, linguistics, comparative literature, ancient history,and archaeology, eventually leading to careers in college teaching,fieldwork, or the editorial professions.Many prestigious professional schools look upon broad and thoroughschooling in the humanities with greater favor than upon narrowpreprofessional undergraduate training. Accordingly, students graduatingfrom classics departments throughout the country have had notablesuccess in schools of law, medicine, and business.FacultyP.

Zimmer, Department Head541-346-3656210 Lawrence Hall1206 University of OregonEugene, Oregon 97403-1206The Department of Interior Architecture provides a comprehensiveprofessional design education within a unique interdisciplinary structure.By integrating subject-area course work with studio design exploration,the program prepares students to act as independent problem-solversand valuable design-team members.Shared course work with architecture in the early stages of theundergraduate or graduate curricula provides an interdisciplinary contextfor study and learning, leading to advanced courses and studies thatexplore theory, technology, and practice.Central to the department is the design studio, where students gainexperience with the design of interior spaces and elements and focus onthe issues and conditions related to adapting existing sites and buildings.Topical intermediate studios concentrate on specific design issues,human factors, and building types. Specialized intermediate studiosfocus on the programming, design, and fabrication of furniture, and onconstruction documents that illustrate a small design project. A finalindependent two-term comprehensive project caps the design studioexperience.PreparationHigh school and college students interested in interior architecture shouldprepare themselves by taking courses in the following subjects:1.Fine arts2.Social sciences3.Sciences4.HumanitiesStudents are encouraged to travel in order to broaden their experiencesrelated to environmental design.Design CampThe College of Design offers a summer career exploration program forcollege-bound students at the school’s facilities in the White Stag Blockin downtown Portland. Students explore architecture, product design,and the digital arts in the city and in the studio. Information about DesignCamp (https://aaa.uoregon.edu/portland/design-camp-2014) may beobtained on the website or by calling the College of Design in Portland.CareersMost students prepare for entering professional practice with architectureand interior design firms. Other opportunities exist in related areas suchas lighting design, furniture design, facilities and space planning, sales orproduct marketing, branding and environmental design, exhibition design,and other activities related to the designed environment.AccreditationUndergraduate and graduate professional-degree curricula ininterior architecture are accredited by the Council for Interior DesignAccreditation (CIDA). At the University of Oregon, the bachelor of interiorarchitecture and the master of interior architecture degree programsare accredited by CIDA. The postprofessional master of science ininterior architecture (MS) program is not accredited. Admission tothe MS program is restricted to applicants who already hold a CIDA-accredited degree or the international equivalent. The interior architecturedepartment is also accredited by the National Association of Schools ofArt and Design (NASAD).Internship, Certification, and LicensureState laws governing interior design registration and licensure varywidely. In those states that have adopted legislation, a professional682         Interior Architecturedegree from a CIDA-accredited program is the preferred prerequisite.Candidates must pass an examination established by the NationalCouncil of Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) to become licensed asinterior designers in those states with licensing or certification. Rules varyfrom state to state but typically two years of professional experience arerequired prior to taking the exam. Students should visit the websites ofthe CIDA, NASAD, or NCIDQ for further information about accreditationand licensure.The Interior Architecture CurriculumThe professional curriculum in interior architecture has two principalobjectives:1.Broad inquiry into the integrative nature of environmental design2.A comprehensive professional education that develops the ability todesign interior environments ranging from intimate personal spacesto large-scale facilities in a variety of site contextsCurriculum requirements are published in the UO Catalog and in thedepartment’s Advising Handbook, which includes sample coursesequences, grading policies, an explanation of how student progress ismonitored through the program, and other advising information. Eachstudent is assigned a faculty advisor and encouraged to consult thatadvisor for specific information. In addition, a departmental advisor isavailable for degree checks and other academic advising.Professional CurriculumThe professional curriculum for the bachelor of interior architectureprogram and the master of interior architecture program include requireddesign studios, subject area courses, and professional electives.Architectural and Interior Design StudiosThe architectural and interior design studios are social and interactiveenvironments where students work cooperatively with their peersunder the guidance of faculty members with frequent input frompracticing interior designers, architects, and related-field experts aswell as representatives of communities served by the studio’s designexplorations. Students learn to respond to complex environmental andcultural contexts through design studio projects that explore interiorspace within a variety of site contexts. Introductory studios emphasizecreativity, design communication skills, and critical thinking fundamentalto the design process; intermediate studios emphasize integration ofinterior architecture subjects with critical design issues; advanced studiosemphasize the comprehensive integration of these elements. Studentperformance in all design studios is graded on a pass/no pass basis andevaluated through written evaluations and exit interviews with facultymembers.Interior Architecture SubjectsSubject area course work develops theory, knowledge, and skills ininterior architecture and related design disciplines, with an emphasis onlearning interior architecture content in the context of design. This coursework develops design skills and examines the influences of place, humanactivity, spatial order, structure, construction, environmental control,professional practice, and history on the practice of interior design.Residence RequirementsFor transfer students to earn the bachelor of interior architecture (BIArch)or professional master of interior architecture (MIArch) degree, thefollowing minimum course work must be successfully completed inresidence:CodeTitleCredits"

Calhoon, Department Head541-346-0934541-346-3240 fax313 Villard Hall5242 University of OregonEugene, Oregon 97403-5242complit@uoregon.eduThe University of Oregon offers major programs in comparative literatureleading to the bachelor of arts (BA), master of arts (MA), and doctorof philosophy (PhD) degrees. In addition, a minor program has beenrecently established.Inherently interdisciplinary, comparative literature begins with theinsistence that any artifact of culture—be it a canvas, a poem, a film,or a novel—requires active attention and engagement. At the sametime, where the national literatures designate their subjects by languageor nation, comparative literature allows a pluralistic approach thatbridges linguistic and cultural boundaries. Closely allied with literaryand critical theory as well as with contemporary trends in globalizationstudies and cultural studies, comparative literature nonetheless can bedefined neither in terms of a specific methodology nor a specific canonof texts. What defines comparative literature is its open-ended spirit ofinquiry. Students of comparative literature create their subject matter bydetermining the meaning and method of their comparative approach.Oregon’s graduate program, established in 1962, has an internationalreputation. It is the home of the principal journal in the field, ComparativeLiterature, and is closely involved with the leading national organization,the American Comparative Literature Association.The department maintains an active schedule of lecture series, seminars,and workshops. Library holdings, which are strong in all areas of researchin literature, include an outstanding collection of journals, many of whichcome to the library in exchange for Comparative Literature.FacultyMichael Allan, associate professor (Arabic and Francophone literature,postcolonial studies, cinema).

Wojcik, EnglishRocio Zambrana, philosophy•Bachelor of Arts•MinorUndergraduate StudiesThe undergraduate program offers a unique major that cuts acrossdisciplines, teaches critical skills, and provides an intellectuallychallenging curriculum while preparing students for possible careers inthe media, law, government, business, or teaching. Students with a goodbackground in one or more languages other than English find that theprogram gives them the opportunity to study literature and related culturalproductions, including canonical and emerging writings, in a variety ofhistorical and theoretical perspectives.The program combines maximum flexibility with a rigorous grounding inthe basics of literary theory and cultural studies. Based on their interests,majors choose one of two emphases: language and culture or disciplinesin dialogue. In the first, students develop proficiency in two national-linguistic traditions. In the second, students explore links between asingle national-linguistic tradition and a nonliterary field. Both emphasesare ideally suited to students considering either a double-major or amajor and a minor: they can combine their multiple interests into a singleprogram of study.A carefully designed core curriculum takes students through the basicsof comparative literature as a discipline. Course work culminates withCapstone Seminar ("
COLT 415,"). Many comparative literature studentsuse this seminar to develop a BA honors thesis project (see Honors inComparative Literature below).Emphases within the MajorBecause there are many different ways of thinking about literature froma comparative perspective, two emphases within the major are offered.One emphasis, language and culture, features comparative study across140         Comparative Literaturedifferent national-linguistic traditions. This emphasis is recommendedfor students who want to study abroad, attend graduate school incomparative literature, or want to gain an in-depth understanding of oneor more foreign cultures. A second emphasis, disciplines in dialogue,allows students to combine literary study with work in a nonliterarydiscipline. This emphasis offers an alternative for students consideringa double major in literature and a nonliterary field. It is also well-suitedto students who want to combine literary study with creative writing,performance, or the visual arts.Language and Culture EmphasisStudents in this emphasis designate two national-linguistic traditions(e.g., Spanish and German; English and Japanese; French andRussian). In addition, the language chosen to fulfill the foreign languagerequirement should coincide with one of these national-linguistictraditions.Disciplines in Dialogue EmphasisStudents in this emphasis designate one national-linguistic tradition andone other disciplinary focus (e.g., creative writing, philosophy, cinemastudies, psychology, art history). Courses taken in this disciplinary focusmay be spread out across several subject codes, with the approval ofthe director of undergraduate studies. Students are strongly advised tocomplete their foreign language requirement in a language relevant eitherto their national-linguistic tradition or to their disciplinary focus.Bachelor of Arts Degree RequirementsThe comparative study of culture entails the acquisition of readingcompetence in at least one language other than English. Comparativeliterature majors must complete at least one year of upper-divisiontraining in a language other than English. For students working in French,German, Italian, or Spanish, a third year entails the study of literature.Appropriate courses include, for example, French Survey: Medieval andRenaissance (.

To thrive professionally, everyscholar in the discipline must be closely trained in a primary nationalliterature, proficient in at least three languages, and attuned to theimportance of philology, bibliography, and linguistic training. At thesame time, a commitment to comparative study requires a firm graspof translation among languages and media and the history of readingpractices, as well as aesthetic and cultural theory.Students are admitted to the graduate program with the expectationthat they will work toward the PhD degree. At present the Departmentof Comparative Literature does not offer a terminal master’s degree.Instead, students become eligible for the MA on passing their PhDqualifying exams.AdmissionA complete application for admission includes the application form,a transcript of college- and graduate-level work, three letters ofrecommendation, a statement of purpose, and a 10- to 20-pagesample in English of critical writing about literature. Graduate RecordExamination scores are not required but are highly recommended. Theapplication deadline is January 15 for entrance the following fall term.Application information and forms can be obtained from the departmentwebsite.Candidates for admission typically have an undergraduate majorin one literature and competence in two of the following languagesthat are taught at the University of Oregon: Arabic, Chinese, French,German, Greek (classical), Hebrew (biblical), Italian, Japanese, Korean,Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Under specialcircumstances, arrangements may be made with the director of graduatestudies to study other literatures.Overview of RequirementsWithin their first three years of graduate study, students must completethe language requirement, six foundation courses, at least five coursesin the primary field, and at least four courses in the secondary field. Inaddition, students select at least three elective courses in consultationwith their faculty advisors; these courses may be tangential to theirmain research interests or distributed according to those interests. Thefoundation courses include Graduate Studies in Translation ("
COLT 403,") duringwinter of senior year. The thesis is completed under the supervisionof the thesis advisor, and must be submitted to both the advisor and asecond reader by the fifth week of spring term. The thesis must thenbe approved by the advisor and second faculty member after a formalpresentation. Both thesis advisor and second reader should be chosenfrom the comparative literature faculty or participating faculty.The University of Oregon            141Minor RequirementsThe comparative literature minor offers an opportunity for students topursue an interest in world literature and film without advanced languagestudy.CodeTitleCredits.

A satisfactory prospectus conversation is required foradvancement to candidacy. The approximate time from completion ofcourse work to advancement is one year. Typically, the dissertation iscompleted within two years of advancing to candidacy.Foundation CoursesThe graduate program provides a solid foundation in theoretical andhistorical methods integral to comparative literature and relevant toworking across national literary traditions, historical periods, theoreticalparadigms, and media. Through these courses, students are expectedto acquire a comprehensive understanding of scholarly method,encountering not only contemporary texts and theorists but also thehistory of the field, including the central controversies, crucial debates,and cultural contexts that have shaped its development. The studentmust complete six graduate-level foundation courses; these coursesare Graduate Studies in Translation (), and twoothers selected from among the COLT graduate course offerings.Primary FieldThe majority of comparative literature graduates are hired to teach innational literature departments and not in interdisciplinary programs. Forthis reason it is crucial that students develop a primary research field thatis based either in a single national literature (e.g., Japanese literature)or in a single linguistic-cultural tradition that crosses national boundaries(e.g., Latin American literature). Depending on the relative breadthof a student’s prior training, the primary field may be further delimitedaccording to a period (e.g., postwar Japan) or a genre (e.g., Germandrama) or even an artistic movement (e.g., French postmodernism).The student must complete five graduate-level courses in the primaryfield; at least three of the courses should share the same departmentsubject code.Secondary FieldThis field complements the research within the primary field, either byproviding counterpoint or a needed context. There are three ways todefine one’s secondary field. Most commonly, it represents a secondnational literature (e.g., Spanish literature) or a linguistic-cultural traditionthat crosses national boundaries (e.g., Latin American literature). Inaddition, where two or more national-linguistic traditions share a commonliterary history—for example, within a given region or artistic movement—the secondary field may be defined in comparative terms (e.g., theContinental Renaissance, Caribbean literature, or East Asian film).Finally, the secondary field can eschew literary categories altogetherin order to represent an alternative disciplinary focus (e.g., religiousstudies).At least four graduate-level courses must be taken in the secondaryfield. Three of them should share the same department subject code. Atthe discretion of the director of graduate studies, the three courses withshared subject code may be spread out over the secondary, foundation,and elective fields.ElectivesThree of the program’s required 18 graduate-level courses are electivesand should be chosen in consultation with an advisor. The electives maycover a wide range of interests or may be carefully distributed among thethree research fields to fill gaps or achieve greater depth. Some studentsmay wish to devote their electives to a fourth field of research (e.g., athird national literature). Students hoping to pursue this option are urgedto meet with the director of graduate studies as soon as possible.Language RequirementWork in at least three languages is expected at all phases of theprogram, from course work to the dissertation. The language requirementaddresses this expectation by ensuring both linguistic proficiency and aminimum level of graduate course work in all three languages. Studentsare required to complete graduate-level work in their languages. Thefollowing guidelines apply: (1) at least two graduate courses must betaken in each language to meet this requirement and should ideally betaught by a specialist in the target language; (2) the seminar paper foreach course should demonstrate competency dealing with the targetlanguage and should be suitable for publication in the national literaturefield. The seminar paper for each of the two non-English languages mustbe submitted to the department at the end of the course for approval. Thelanguage requirement must be satisfied by the end of the third year.Timetable from Entrance to ExaminationsAdvisorsDuring their first two terms of study (fall and winter), students are advisedby the director of graduate studies. By Monday of week two of the thirdterm, each student formally identifies an interim advisor—a facultymember who agrees to mentor the student through the completion of thefirst-year conversation and the first two terms of the second year.By Monday of week two of the spring term of the second year, thestudent will have chosen his or her advisor of record. This advisor, whowill be competent in the student’s primary research interests, will mentorthe student through the second-year review and the third year of study.First YearFirst-Year StatementBy Friday of week four of spring term, first-year students, in consultationwith their interim advisors, submit a two- to three-page statement ofpurpose. It should identify and justify the primary and secondary fieldsthe student intends to pursue—the general fields of study that formthe backbone of a scholar’s research profile. It should also clarify therelationship between the students’ research languages and researchfields, and indicate what linguistic study is necessary to complete theproposed course of study.First-Year ConversationIn week six or seven of spring term, the first-year student, his orher interim advisor, the director of graduate studies, and one othercomparative literature faculty member meet for a conversation aboutthe first-year statement. They evaluate the student’s progress to date,including course work and language examinations, discuss the intendedfields, and offer guidance for the remaining two years leading to thequalifying examination. With their approval of the statement and thestudent’s general plan, as well as successful completion of all first-144         Comparative Literatureyear course work with a GPA of 3.50, the student may proceed to thesecond year. A brief memo written by the student that summarizes theconversation is due to the department by Wednesday of week eight.Second YearThird-Year ArticleDuring the second year, as part of preparation for publication in the field,students are required to begin expanding a seminar paper into an articlefor submission to a journal. Workshops are held to prepare studentsto write an article and select an appropriate publication venue. Thisprocess is meant to provide step-by-step guidance in publishing beforethe student advances to candidacy.Second-Year ReviewBy Monday of week two in spring term of the second year, a studentwill have chosen the advisor of record. In consultation with that advisor,the student must write a careful self-review of his or her progress todate. The review should revisit both the first-year statement and thereport of the first-year conversation. In particular, any recommendationsmade by the first-year conversation committee should be assessed:how were these recommendations pursued and with what result? Thedesignation of the three research fields should also be addressed, alongwith any shifts in focus that have proved necessary or desirable. Thereview should explain what course work remains to be completed, and,where appropriate, should outline a plan for the completion of that work.Any problems in performance or concerns about timely progress shouldalso be addressed. The second-year review must be approved by theadvisor of record and submitted by Monday of week eight of spring term.The graduate committee reviews these reports, and small revisions andclarifications may be required before they approve the document. Withapproval of the review and completion of all second-year course workwith a GPA of 3.50, the student may proceed to the third year.Third YearThird-Year ArticleDuring the first term of the third year, the student will finalize the third-year article in consultation with an advisor in preparation for submittingit for peer review. By Friday of week ten of fall term of the third year, thestudent will submit this article to the department along with a cover letteraddressed to an appropriate journal.Completion of Course Work and Language RequirementThe program is designed so that students may complete all course workand language requirements by the end of their third year. By Friday ofweek nine of spring term of the third year, students submit the coursework and language requirement completion form for approval by thedirector of graduate studies and the graduate committee.PhD Degree RequirementsCodeTitleCreditsFoundation CoursesSix foundation courses: the four listed below and two othergraduate COLT courses..

Of these three, one represents the student’sprimary field of research (commonly the advisor of record), anotherrepresents the secondary field, and a third member is designated thecommittee chair. The third member also serves as chief mentor forthe student’s foundation field, advising him or her on the reading listinclusions from that field. All members must sign an agreement formto participate in the exam committee, and all must approve the examstatement and reading list. By Monday of week two in spring termof the third year, students must submit their examination committeemembership to the department. Students who have chosen an additionalfourth field of research may choose to be tested in that field as well. Thelogistics of this option should be pursued with the director of graduatestudies as early in the process as possible. The examination committeemembership must be approved by the director of graduate studies.Examination Statement and Reading ListIn consultation with the exam committee members, each studentdetermines his or her examination fields. These fields correspond tothe primary, secondary, and foundation research fields, but are usuallynarrower and more specialized in scope. Students then devise a readinglist covering each field. Each list should include approximately fifteento twenty primary items (an item is an author and a work or works thatrepresent the author’s perspective as a whole). Each field list should alsoinclude a separate sublist of pertinent critical-secondary works. Examcommittee members can provide assistance in choosing the works on thislist.Students must also compose a six- to eight-page statement that definesthe student’s core interests, defends the examination fields, clarifiesthe scope of the reading list, and offers some indication of the futuredissertation project and career aspirations for which this reading listprovides the necessary comprehensive background and preparation.After being approved by all the examiners, the exam statement andreading list are submitted to the department by the end of week nine inspring term of the third year. Prior to final approval, the exam statementand reading list are reviewed by the graduate committee, which mayhave additional recommendations and queries. Occasionally, theserecommendations may be substantive enough to require additions toor deletions from the list and a resubmission process. Changes to thestatement and list may be made no later than four weeks prior to theThe University of Oregon            145first written exam and must be approved by both the director of graduatestudies and the examination committee members.When the graduate committee and director of graduate studies haveapproved the Course Work and Language Requirements CompletionForm and the exam statement and reading list, the student may proceedwith the examination process.Overview of Fourth YearThe fourth year is dedicated to completing the doctoral examinationsand writing the dissertation prospectus. Typically, students preparefor the exams over the summer and early fall, sit for the written andoral exams by the end of fall term, and complete the prospectus by themiddle of spring term. The prospectus conversation must be held by thebeginning of week 10 of spring term in the fourth year, so that studentsmay advance to candidacy in a timely manner at the end of spring term.Written ExaminationIn this phase, students compose three essays over three 24-hourperiods spread out over three weeks (weeks five, six, and seven offall term in the fourth year). The first essay covers the primary field,with questions submitted by the examiner representing that field; thesecond covers the secondary field in the same manner; the third essayis comparative, addressing texts from both the primary and secondaryfields, with questions submitted by all three examiners. For the primaryand secondary field exams, students choose between two questions; forthe comparative exam, they choose one of three questions. No examwill cover the foundation field. Instead, the examiners will explore the fullgamut of the student’s reading list with questions designed to ascertainthe student’s mastery of his or her methods as applied to the primary andsecondary fields.The three examiners all grade and comment on the comparative essayand read the field exams. The two field exams are graded separatelyand commented upon by the responsible examiners, except in the caseof a failing grade. In this circumstance, the student’s essay is gradedby the other two examiners, as well. If two out of three examiners failan essay, the student may retake the exam in that area in the followingterm. The exam may be retaken no more than once. If more than oneof the student’s essays fails, or if the student fails a retake exam, he orshe does not proceed to candidacy, but may be eligible for a terminalmaster’s degree. Grades for these exams are high pass, pass, or nopass. Students learn their exam results in week nine of fall term—that is,two weeks after completion of the final essay.Oral ExaminationThe oral examination is scheduled during week 10 or 11 of fall term; itis proctored by the exam committee chair and is usually two hours inlength. The committee and the student revisit the written examinations,discussing areas of strength and weakness. In addition, the examinersmay explore the student’s expertise more deeply by asking questionsabout reading list materials not covered during the written exams.While no grade is assigned for performance on the oral exam, thecommittee may determine recommendations and even requirements forfuture study, including retaking the oral examination. Recommendationsare communicated in person to the student at the conclusion of the examand in writing to the director of graduate studies as part of the committeechair’s report on the exam. If substantive requirements or concerns havebeen articulated, the director of graduate studies will determine anyofficial course of action to be taken.For students who have failed one or more parts of the written exam,no oral examination will be held; instead, the time designated for theoral exam will be dedicated to a meeting with the student, the examcommittee, and the director of graduate studies. Participants review theexam performance, discuss a possible retake exam, and/or review theadvisability of a terminal master’s degree.Prospectus and Doctoral CandidacyBy Friday of week five of winter term in the fourth year, the studentmust designate a dissertation committee, including the dissertationchair and outside reader. The director of graduate studies must approvethis committee. For details concerning faculty eligibility, studentsshould refer to the Graduate School’s Dissertation Committee Policy atgradschool.uoregon.edu/committee-policy.Committee members should be consulted during the process of writingthe dissertation prospectus. A first draft of the prospectus should besubmitted to the members of the dissertation committee by Friday ofweek 10 of winter term. A completed draft of the prospectus, approvedby all four committee members, must be submitted by Friday of weekfive of spring term in the fourth year. After final approval from the directorof graduate studies, the prospectus conversation is scheduled betweenweeks seven and nine of spring term.A prospectus is not a first dissertation chapter; it is a snapshot of thedissertation project as envisioned by the student, prior to the completionof the bulk of his or her research. The prospectus is typically 10 to 15pages in length. It should include a clear, concise examination of theproblem to be studied, along with a compelling sense of the larger issuesat stake in the project, both for the immediate topic and for the field atlarge. In addition, the prospectus should provide a clear vision of theproject’s trajectory: a narrative account of the dissertation’s structure, anoutline of chapters, and a justification for the particular authors and textsto be examined. A substantial research bibliography should be appended.Prospectus ConversationThe prospectus conversation is scheduled between weeks seven andnine of spring term in the fourth year. This conversation, which includesthe members of the dissertation committee, is facilitated by the committeechair and helps to develop the student’s plans for the dissertation.Areas of strength and weakness in the project are discussed, andspecific recommendations about structure, bibliography, and method arepresented. After successful completion of this conversation, and withapproval of the director of graduate studies and the graduate committee,the student advances to candidacy.DissertationThe dissertation, which is defended in a final oral presentation, is typicallycompleted within two years of advancement to candidacy. Dissertationsin a discipline such as comparative literature can hardly be said to followexact specifications, but as a general principle any such project shouldinvolve at least two authors, works, and national literatures, and anexplicit methodological orientation.Courses"

Tucker, psychology•Bachelor of Arts•Bachelor of Science•Computer and Information Science Minor•Computer Information Technology MinorUndergraduate StudiesThe Department of Computer and Information Science offers a major anda minor in computer and information science, a major in mathematics andcomputer science, and a minor in computer information technology.The computer and information science major is intended for studentswho want to study computers and computation with strong mathematicaland scientific foundations. The mathematics and computer sciencemajor emphasizes formal and abstract problem solving complementedby computational methods and computer technologies. This program,administered jointly with the Department of Mathematics, is described inthe Mathematics and Computer Science section of this catalog. Both ofthese majors lead to the bachelor of arts (BA) or bachelor of science (BS)degrees.Students majoring in computer and information science may choose tofocus their studies in one of several areas of specialization, or tracks,which build on the standard CIS core requirements. Each track specifiesa set of coordinated choices for fulfilling upper-division computer scienceand other elective requirements. Students interested in specializing in atrack should contact their advisor as early as possible. Current computerscience tracks include foundations, software development, computernetworks, database and informatics, multimedia, business informationsystems, computational science, and security.PreparationHigh school students who plan to major in computer and informationscience should pursue a strong academic program, including substantialwork in mathematics, the sciences, and writing. Courses in algebra,geometry, trigonometry, and more advanced topics should be included.Courses in computer programming or computer technology are usefulbut not required. Upon arrival at the university, students should consultwith a CIS advisor to determine the entry-level course best suited to thestudent’s background.150         Computer and Information ScienceTransfer and Second Baccalaureate StudentsTransfer and second baccalaureate students should consult the onlineInteractive Transfer Catalog as well as a CIS advisor to determinewhether computer science, mathematics, and science courses they havetaken fulfill the major requirements. Completing only general-universityrequirements prior to transferring to the University of Oregon will not besufficient preparation to complete a CIS degree in two years.Students attending community college in Oregon are encouraged toobtain the associate of arts Oregon transfer degree or the associate ofscience Oregon transfer degree in computer science before enteringthe University of Oregon. While earning this degree, community collegetransfer students should take discrete mathematics and computerscience. In addition, calculus and laboratory science are recommended.Bachelor of Arts Degree RequirementsTo earn a BA in computer and information science, majors must completethe requirements for a BS in addition to demonstrating proficiency ina second language. Computer and information science majors mustcomplete at least 60 credits of CIS courses, of which 24 must be earnedin residence at the University of Oregon. In addition, majors mustcomplete 28 credits in mathematics, 12 credits in the sciences, and 4credits of technical or business writing. The specific requirements forthe CIS major fall into five categories: core courses, track and electivecourses, mathematics, writing, and science.Computer Science I ("

It isa degree reserved for students who demonstrate a comprehensiveunderstanding of computer science and an ability to do creative research.Each PhD student produces a significant piece of original research,presented in a written dissertation and defended in an oral examination.The PhD program is structured to facilitate the process of learning howto do research. Students begin by taking required courses to build afoundation of knowledge that is essential for advanced research. Earlyin the program the student gains research experience by undertakinga directed research project under the close supervision of a facultymember and the scrutiny of a faculty committee. In the later stagesof the program, students take fewer courses and spend most of theirtime exploring their dissertation area to learn how to identify and solveopen problems. The final steps are to propose an independent researchproject, do the research, and write and defend a dissertation.The University of Oregon            159AdmissionApplication materials should be submitted by December 15 for thefollowing fall term.

After candidacy, PhDstudents are encouraged to continue participation in 600-level coursesDirected Research ProjectComplete a directed research project, which is supervised by a facultymember and evaluated by a faculty committee. The research projectcomprises the following:1.The definition and expected results of the project in the form of aDirected Research Project Contract2.Delivery of the materials constituting the results of the project andoral presentation of the results3.A private oral examination by the committee membersStatus ChangePhD candidates are admitted conditionally. Successful completion ofthe directed research project leads to a change in the student’s doctoralstatus from conditional to unconditional.Dissertation Advisory CommitteeAfter successfully completing the directed research project, PhD studentsform a Dissertation Advisory Committee chaired by their researchadvisor. The main role of the committee is to advise the student betweencompletion of the research project and mounting the dissertation defense.The committee takes primary responsibility for evaluating studentprogress. In addition, it approves the plan for the area examination,which in turn is approved by the graduate education committee. See thegraduate coordinator for further instructions.Area ExaminationThe student chooses an area of research and works closely with anadvisor to learn the area in depth by surveying the current researchand learning research methods, significant achievements, and howto pose and solve problems. The student gradually assumes a moreindependent role and prepares for the area examination, which testsdepth of knowledge in the research area. The examination contains thefollowing:1.A survey of the area in the form of a position paper and an annotatedbibliography2.A public presentation of the position paper3.A private oral examination by committee membersAdvancement to CandidacyAfter the area examination, the committee decides whether the studentis ready for independent research work; if so, the student is advanced tocandidacy.Dissertation and DefenseIdentify a significant unsolved research problem and submit a writtendissertation proposal to the dissertation committee. The dissertationcommittee, comprising three department members and one memberfrom an outside department, is approved by the graduate educationcommittee. In addition to these four, the dissertation committee oftenincludes a fifth examiner. This outside examiner should be a leadingresearcher in the candidate’s field who is not at the University of Oregon.The outside member should be selected a year before the candidate’sdissertation defense, and no later than six months before.The student submits a written dissertation proposal to the committee forapproval, and the proposal is then submitted to the graduate educationcommittee. The proposal presents the research problems to be tackled,related research, methodology, anticipated results, and work plan. Thecommittee may request an oral presentation, similar to the area exam,which allows the student to explain and answer question about theproposed research. The student then carries out the research.The final stage is writing a dissertation and defending it in a public forumby presenting the research and answering questions about the methodsand results. The dissertation committee may accept the dissertation,request small changes, or require the student to make substantialchanges and schedule another defense160         Computer and Information ScienceGraduate School RequirementsPhD students must meet the requirements set by the Graduate School aslisted in that section of this catalogResearch AreasIt is important that a PhD student be able to work effectively with at leastone dissertation advisor.

Geology applies all the basic sciences—biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics—to understanding earthprocesses in the historical context of geologic time. It is a science thatexplores problems by combining field investigations with laboratoryexperiments and theoretical studies.The University of Oregon            167Geology also addresses many natural hazards—earthquakes, flooding,and volcanic eruptions—that affect humans. It addresses the impactof humans on the earth’s surface environment, where we pollute riversand ground water, cause rapid erosion and landslides, or attempt to re-engineer rivers and shorelines.PreparationHigh school students planning to major in geological sciences shouldinclude in their high school program as much mathematics and science(physics, chemistry, biology, or earth science) as possible.Students who transfer to the department after two years of college workelsewhere should have completed a year of general chemistry, a year ofgeneral physics, and two quarters or a semester of calculus. A year ofgeneral geology with laboratory is recommended.CareersStudents with a degree in earth sciences are qualified for employment ina broad range of careers: geotechnical and environmental consultants;K–12 school teachers (with an additional teaching certificate); laboratorytechnicians; professional geologists, geophysicists, or geochemists;and positions in the petroleum and mining industries or in state andfederal agencies such as the United States Geological Survey or theEnvironmental Protection Agency. The current climate for employmentin the earth sciences is good. Geoscience jobs require skills in criticalthinking and problem solving, quantitative analysis, oral and writtencommunication, and team work. The Department of Earth Sciencescurriculum emphasizes these skills.Geological Sciences CurriculumThe Department of Earth Sciences offers a bachelor of science (BS) or abachelor of arts (BA) degree with a major in earth sciences.Major TracksEarth science is an unusually broad subject. It addresses everything fromthe chemical processes that make rocks and minerals to the physicsbehind plate tectonics and the travel of earthquake waves through theplanet. It explores the history of the evolution of life revealed in fossils,and it probes the earth processes that affect how humans can survive onthe surface of the planet. To address this breadth, the department offersfour curricular tracks for a major in earth sciences: geology, geophysics,environmental geoscience, and paleontology.All of the tracks require a common core of general chemistry,calculus, general geology, and physics, except that paleontology- andenvironmental geoscience–track students may take two terms of biologyin place of two terms of physics. Beyond the core, each track requirescertain additional courses and a selection of electives.Undergraduate ResearchAs many as 4 credits of research can be counted toward electives in anyof the tracks. To receive such credit, students must•submit a short letter, approved by the faculty research advisor andaddressed to the head undergraduate advisor in earth sciences,stating the nature of the research and asserting that there is facultysupervision•submit a final written report to the faculty advisor describing theresults of the researchStudents may earn credit in this category by registering for any of thefollowing:CodeTitleCredits"

Course work is designed to meet individual needs, andstudents may pursue independent research in geobiology, geochemistry,geodesy, geomechanics, geomorphology, geophysics, mineralogy,petrology, volcanology, paleontology, stratigraphy, sedimentarypetrology, structural geology, and ore deposit geology. The master’sdegree program requires two years or more for completion.Admission to the graduate program is competitive and based onacademic records, scores on the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE),and letters of recommendation. Nonnative speakers of English must alsosubmit scores for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)and the Test of Spoken English (TSE). Applications are welcome fromstudents who are interested in using their background in related fields,such as physics, chemistry, and biology, to solve geologic or geophysicalproblems.Graduate students are advised by a guidance committee consisting ofthree faculty members. This committee meets with each student shortlyafter he or she arrives on campus and as often thereafter as necessaryfor planning purposes.RequirementsBasic university requirements for graduate degrees are described in theGraduate School (p. 937) section of this catalog. The department setsadditional examination, course work, seminar, and thesis requirements.Applicants should read the Guide to Graduate Study on the departmentwebsite (http://earthsciences.uoregon.edu/graduate-program) or write tothe Department of Earth Sciences for details.ProgramsGraduate study in earth sciences is offered in five broad areas:1.volcanology-petrology-geochemistry2.stratigraphy–surface processes3.paleontology-paleopedology-geobiology4.structural geology–geophysics5.economic geology (mineral deposits)Volcanology-Petrology-GeochemistryThe department has excellent analytical and other research facilitiesfor studies in these subdisciplines, and the volcanic and metamorphicterrane of the Northwest offers unsurpassed opportunities for fieldstudies. Active research programs are diverse and include studies oferuption dynamics, magma volatile inventories, and magma rheology;experimental studies of igneous phase equilibria and trace elementpartitioning; calculations of multicomponent equilibria in aqueous systemsand volcanic gases; and studies of igneous protogenesis.Stratigraphy–Surface ProcessesThe stratigraphic record of tectonically active sedimentary basinsindicates the dynamic interactions among basin subsidence, sedimentinput from eroding sources, evolution of depositional systems, and activefaulting and folding that govern these processes. Research in this areacombines field-based stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and geomorphicanalysis with provenance studies and concepts derived from theoreticalmodels to decipher the complex structural and climatic controls on thefilling histories of active basins.Surface processes regulate how tectonics and climate affect landscapeevolution. Field observations, numerical simulations, topographicanalyses, and experimental facilities are used to study sedimenttransport processes over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Projectsincorporate links between active tectonics and structural geology, biology,geomechanics, and surface processes to address problems such aslandsliding and hill-slope evolution, biological contributions to soil creepand landscape lowering, and the geomorphic implications of seismic-induced landsliding.Paleontology-Paleopedology-GeobiologyStudies of fossil soils, plants, and vertebrates aim to reconstruct life onland and its role in global change. Global changes of interest includeNeogene paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of ape and humanevolution in East Africa, environmental effects of terminal Cretaceousimpact and dinosaur extinction in Montana, consequences of massextinction and methane clathrate degassing at the Permian-Triassicboundary, and the effect of early land plants and forests on weatheringand atmospheric composition during the early Paleozoic.184         Earth SciencesGeobiology focuses on the interaction of microorganisms with thegeologic environment and the ways life forms affect geological processes,such as weathering and mineralization.Structural Geology–GeophysicsGraduate work in the structural geology–geophysics area involves thestudy of the earth’s dynamic processes.Seismic imaging techniques using regional arrays provide toolsfor understanding regional tectonics. Studies of upper-mantle andlithospheric structure beneath the Rocky Mountains and in the PacificNorthwest subduction zone are providing essential constraints,unavailable from surface geology, for detailed dynamical models of plate-lithospheric deformation.Structural geology focuses on applying modern field and analyticaltechniques to solving problems in Cenozoic tectonics and active faulting.Detailed field mapping, trench logging, and geomorphic analysis arecombined with seismic array data, land- and space-based geodetic data,and theoretical modeling to address problems including Oregon’s Basinand Range province and coastal deformation, active tectonics of the SanAndreas Fault system, and seismic risk along the Pacific margin of theUnited States and southeast and central Asia.Geophysical experiments conducted at sea investigate the nature ofsea-floor spreading including the segregation, transport, and storageof melt; the rifting of oceanic lithosphere; and the spatial and temporalconnectivity between magmatic, tectonic, and hydrothermal processes.Mineral DepositsCurrent research on ore deposits includes studies of porphyry copperdeposits, epithermal veins, and active geothermal systems. Theseprojects combine field mapping, petrography, and chemical analyseswith theoretical chemical modeling of processes of ore fluid generation,alteration, and mineralization.Related Research ActivitiesThe Condon Collection of Fossils at the Museum of Natural andCultural History maintains strong ties to the Department of EarthSciences. Two geology professors are curators of the collection, andpaleontology undergraduate and graduate students are often employedas assistants. The Condon Collection contains 60,000 specimens,including invertebrate and vertebrate fossils, paleobotanical remains, andan extensive collection of modern animals that are available to interestedresearchers for study.Research FacilitiesStudents may use a variety of analytical facilities and equipment includinga three-component broadband (0.03–50Hz) seismic array, an electronmicroprobe, a scanning electron microscope with image analysis, x-raydiffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, stable isotope mass spectroscopy, and ageobiology laboratory.An experimental petrology laboratory covers a range of crustaltemperatures and pressures and includes equipment for doingexperiments in controlled atmospheres. Two piston-cylinder apparatuswith pressure-temperature capability to 35 kilobars and 1,500° C maybe used to study crystalline, partially molten, and molten silicates undermantlelike conditions.Computers are used for much of the research in the department includingacquisition and processing of seismic and gravity data and numericalmodeling of geophysical processes and geochemical reactions. Ageochemistry laboratory is equipped with sophisticated computerprograms for thermodynamic calculations of gas-liquid-solid equilibriaand reaction processes important in metamorphic, volcanic gas,hydrothermal, and diagenetic systems. The Internet can be accessedthrough the UONet fiber-optic link. A student computer facility, equippedwith PC and Macintosh computers and laser printers, is also connected tothe networks.The sedimentological and paleontological laboratories have, in additionto standard laboratory equipment, an electronic particle-size analyzer,an x-radiography unit, photomicroscopes, a Leitz Aristophot unit, afully maintained catalog of foraminifera, an acid room, and a conodont-processing laboratory.Financial Aid for Graduate StudentsMost of the department’s graduate students are fully supportedthrough teaching and research assistantships. More informationabout financial assistance and department policies for awarding andrenewing teaching and research fellowships may be obtained byreading the Guide to Graduate Study on the department website (http://earthsciences.uoregon.edu/graduate-program) or by writing to thedepartment.Courses"

The examination and degree-granting process differs forterminal MA students and for students who apply for continued study inthe university’s PhD program (see below).Terminal MA Students in Japanese StudiesThose students who are not planning to go on to the PhD mustsuccessfully pass a two-part written examination based on thefollowing reading list:1.Approximately 20 works of Japanese literature and/or Japanese film,which should provide comprehensive coverage of major periods,writers, and genres of Japanese literature and/or film. The student'sadvisor will provide a model reading list.2.Approximately 10 works of general theory and criticism, based onthe student's specialized area, which can be outside the area ofJapanese studies.3.Approximately 10 works in a specialized area of the student's ownchoosing.The first part of the exam shall include questions pertaining to broadissues in the field of Japanese literature and film deriving from sectionone of the student’s reading list. The second part of the exam, to beadministered a week later, shall cover more specialized questionsderiving from sections two and three of the student’s reading list. Thestudent shall have forty-eight hours for each part to produce the finaltyped, double-spaced exams of approximately ten to twelve pages each.The faculty committee administering the examination shall determinewhether the student has successfully fulfilled the requirements for the MAdegree, and shall confer one of the following grades: distinction, clearpass, marginal pass, or failure. Should the advisor determine that thecandidate has not been successful, he or she may recommend that thestudent be given one additional opportunity to pass the exam during thenext academic term.Consulting the advisor, the student can complete an MA thesis insteadof passing a comprehensive examination at the end of study.

The advisoris expected to return comments within two weeks. Then, a continuingdialogue ensues between the student and advisor until the manuscript isconsidered complete. If approval is not obtained at this point, there is noguarantee that the student will be able to graduate that term.The student submits a clean copy of the thesis or project to the advisorand committee members either two weeks before defense or four weeksbefore the filing date for an approved thesis as published by the GraduateSchool.Master of Arts in East Asian Languagesand Literatures, Linguistics and LanguagePedagogyThis MA program offers a complete East Asian linguistics and pedagogyprogram, covering Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

CHN 603D,"issertation"
JPN 603D,"issertationOther electives may be taken in linguistics, language teachingspecialization, or psychology in consultation with an advisor.Students in the PhD track must successfully complete a comprehensiveexamination and prospectus defense (culture students) or qualifyingpaper (linguistics students) to advance to candidacy (all but dissertation)status. By the end of their second year in the program (at the very latest),each student should identify a committee of three faculty members whowill oversee their training for the comprehensive examination. Since eachperson’s needs and interests may be different, students are expected towork closely with their primary advisor at all stages of the process.Comprehensive ExaminationThe goal of the comprehensive examination is to ensure that studentshave received training broad enough to qualify as a teacher beyondthe narrow research focus of their dissertation. The comprehensiveexamination is composed of a written and an oral component.The University of Oregon            205In conjunction with their primary advisor, students choose three fields, amajor field and two minor fields, each to be advised by a faculty memberin that area. Cultural fields may be determined by genre, time period,or methodology; linguistic fields may be determined by theoreticalorientation, language orientation, and methodology. In conjunctionwith their advisors, students develop a reading list of twenty to fortyitems for each field. For culture students, these items may include bothprimary and secondary texts; the composition of each reading list willbe tailored to the individual student’s needs. It is expected that readinglists will develop organically from graduate seminars and readings andconferences.For each field, the student will submit a comprehensive examinationpaper. The papers may be developed from a term paper written for aseminar or written for the sake of the examination, as determined by theadvisor. These comprehensive examination papers should demonstratethe student’s broad knowledge of a field. Ideally, for the major field, thispaper will be the basis for a dissertation chapter. In some instances,students may be asked to develop a syllabus rather than write a researchpaper.Advisors have two weeks to read and approve each comprehensiveexamination paper. After the three comprehensive examination papershave been approved by the field examiner and the primary advisor, thestudent schedules an oral examination. The oral examination (one to twohours in duration) is an opportunity for the three examiners to engage thestudent in an in-depth conversation about the items on the reading lists.The goal of the oral examination is to ensure that students have enoughfamiliarity with both the critical and primary works in the field to teach atthe postsecondary level. The oral examination is not open to the public.Both parts of the comprehensive examination should be completed bythe end of the student’s third year in the program. It is at the discretion ofthe committee to determine if students should have a second opportunityto sit for an oral examination if the first attempt is not successful. Atthe discretion of the committee, those students whose performance isdeemed unsatisfactory may be granted a terminal MA.Prospectus (Culture Track)Before scheduling the prospectus defense, students need to notify thegraduate secretary of the membership of their dissertation committee(three faculty members from the department and one from anotherdepartment). The prospectus defense is the first meeting of the entiredissertation committee to provide feedback on the dissertation researchproject. The prospectus, a document of twenty to thirty pages, shouldintroduce the research question, the methodology, and a basic outline ofthe dissertation; a bibliography is required. Once the advisors approvea draft of the dissertation prospectus, certifying that in their opinion theproject is well-conceived and viable, the student schedules a meeting ofthe entire committee. A defense is an opportunity for the committee toask questions and provide advice and direction for the research project.The prospectus defense is public.In order to leave enough time for the dissertation research and writing,the prospectus defense should take place during the third year of studyand no later than the winter term of the fourth year. Students who areunable to complete a viable prospectus by spring of their fourth year inthe program will be granted a terminal MA.Qualifying Paper (Linguistics Track)As the equivalent of the prospectus defense for culture track students,linguistics students are expected to produce an original publishablepaper, of substantial length and quality, in a subfield of linguistics. Thisqualifying paper should demonstrate the student's ability to carry out anempirical study and write an analytical research paper. The unmodifiedMA thesis cannot serve this purpose.A committee consisting of the advisor and a second faculty memberfamiliar with the subfield will referee the qualifying paper. The studentmay be asked to revise the qualifying paper before it is accepted assatisfactory work. Upon documented completion of the paper, the studentneeds to identify a dissertation committee (three faculty membersfrom the department and one from another department) and notify thegraduate secretary. The student then confirms the dissertation topicand presents a prospectus constituting a short abstract detailing theirresearch topic. This should be done within one term of completing thequalifying paper. After the prospectus has been approved, the student willadvance to candidacy.To leave enough time for the dissertation research and writing, thequalifying paper and prospectus should be completed during the thirdyear of study and no later than the winter term of the fourth year.Students who are unable to complete a viable qualifying paper by springof their fourth year in the program will be granted a terminal MA.Program GoalsThe comprehensive examination is distinct from the dissertationprospectus or qualifying paper. The comprehensive examination papersand oral examination involve general preparation and give the student anopportunity to show broad knowledge of a field. The prospectus defensefor culture-track students is more narrowly focused on the dissertationproject and demonstrates the student's ability to identify and define aresearch project. Similarly, the qualifying paper for linguistics students isfocused on the student's main research area and demonstrates the abilityto undertake a research project. The comprehensive examination andprospectus defense or qualifying paper enable students to demonstratethat they can be successful as teachers and researchers. Studentswill advance to ABD (all but dissertation) status after the successfulcompletion of both the comprehensive examination and the prospectusdefense or qualifying paper, in addition to the completion of all requiredcourse work.DissertationA dissertation committee is formed at least one month before theprospectus is presented for review and approval. This committee advisesthe student on writing the dissertation and approves the completeddissertation.Students who have taken an MA comprehensive exam in Japanesestudies do not need to take a PhD comprehensive exam. However, theyneed to defend their dissertation prospectus within one academic termafter the completion of doctoral course work.Courses"

The discipline is divided into two general areas—microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics exploresquestions about the way society allocates resources; it applies topublic policy in such areas as urban, industrial organization, and laboreconomics. Macroeconomics considers such questions as the causes ofinflation and unemployment; it applies to such areas as monetary policy,development and international economics.FacultyBruce A.

Its lower-division courses provide training in writing andintroduce the student to literature as a humanistic discipline. Its upper-division courses emphasize the humanistic values that emerge fromstudying literature and allied disciplines analytically and in depth.CareersThe study of English opens doors to many careers. All fields ofendeavor place high value on the ability to read intelligently and towrite clearly. The English major may lead most directly to careers ineducation, journalism, or communications; it is also highly regarded asundergraduate training for law, government, social work, communityservice, and business. Indeed, the ability to handle the languagewith clarity and cogency is the skill most frequently cited by businessprofessionals as desirable. A major in English, with judiciously selectedelectives, prepares students not only to find that essential first job butalso to possess the breadth of outlook and depth of perspective thatbecome increasingly important in subsequent phases of their careers.A student preparing for graduate study in English should construct anappropriate course of undergraduate study in consultation with a facultyadvisor.Expository WritingThe English department offers required and elective courses in expositorywriting for all university students to help them improve their ability towrite clearly and effectively.

Aminor in environmental studies is also offered.Both majors provide a broad, solid, interdisciplinary perspective on therelationship between humans and nature. Their goals are to developawareness of environmental issues and to develop an understanding ofthe nature and scope of the forces underlying environmental problems,the various approaches used to bring environmental problems to thepublic’s attention, and the methods and approaches used to solve theseproblems.Majors gain an appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature ofenvironmental studies, and they master content and skills associated witha number of different disciplines.Majors and minors have considerable latitude in designing a course ofstudy that combines theory and practice, invites active participation, andfits specific interests, needs, and aptitudes. The majors, which provide awell-rounded basic education, prepare students for entry-level positionsin business, government, nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations,and for a variety of graduate and professional degree programs. Studentsare encouraged to take advantage of career planning services offered bythe Career Center.The environmental studies major focuses on social sciences, policystudies, the humanities, and sustainable design. It is designed forstudents who are interested in such areas as environmental policy,planning, ethics or philosophy, ecocriticism, ecofeminism, environmentaljustice, sustainable development, international environmental issues, orsocial theory and the environment.The environmental science major is designed for students who wantto focus on scientific careers in conservation biology, climate science,pollution prevention and abatement, or ecosystem protection, restoration,and management.Students should plan their programs early in their undergraduate careerswith the aid of an environmental studies academic advisor. Majors areurged to consider completing a second major or a minor in a related field.The program offers drop-in student advising in the main office.Up-to-date information, major requirements sheets, and tip sheets areavailable in the program office and on the website.Major RequirementsThe environmental studies curriculum is designed to provide a solidfoundation in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities; to build onthese foundations in advanced course work in a variety of disciplines; todevelop the skills necessary to study human-environment interactions;and to encourage participation in experiential learning activities that helpstudents prepare for active participation in the work force and in local and244         Environmental Studiesglobal communities. Students should have a strong foundation in writtenand verbal skills.Courses applied to the major, except environmental studies coursesnumbered 401 through 409, must be taken for letter grades and passedwith grades of C– or better. As many as four upper-division courses maybe used to fulfill requirements of another major. At least 24 credits mustbe taken at the University of Oregon.Bachelor of Arts in Environmental StudiesUpper-division credit may be earned through course work or through acombination of course work and an honors thesis. Major requirementssheets containing detailed information about specific courses that meetthe major requirements are available on the program website (http://envs.uoregon.edu/undergrad/envsfocus), in the program office, or froman environmental studies advisor.CodeTitleCreditsLower-Division Core Courses"

Students learn professional research,writing, and presentation skills as they develop a network of professionalrelationships in the region. Participants make a two- or three-termcommitment, for which they earn 8–12 upper-division credits. Thesecredits satisfy upper-division requirements for the environmental studiesand environmental science majors.InternshipsBy offering academic credit for environmentally focused work experience,the internship program allows students to connect their academic studieswith practical applications. Internship positions must involve significantwork with an environmental focus. Potential internship sponsors includepublic interest nonprofits, government agencies, and private corporations.Students are expected to be self-motivated and arrange their ownpositions in their areas of particular interest. However, if a studentneeds assistance finding an appropriate position program, the internshipcoordinator can help identify potential opportunities.

As an element ofAmerican identity that cuts across disciplinary categories, race andethnicity require a mode of study that draws on the humanities and thesocial sciences as well as interdisciplinary sources such as culturalstudies.Ethnic studies scholars investigate race and racism, historical andcontemporary manifestations of white supremacy and domination,analyzing how such systems of domination have created, and continueto create, social injustice. While the social construction of race in theUnited States is at the center of traditional ethnic studies, it is impossibleto discuss racial dynamics without also paying significant attention toissues of gender, class, and sexuality, in addition to studies of indigenouscommunities, immigration, transnational migration, and the diasporicformations resulting from the slave trade, indentured labor, colonialism,postcolonialism, imperialism, and globalization.Ethnic studies courses that satisfy university general-educationrequirements are listed under Group Requirements and MulticulturalRequirement in the Bachelor's Degree Requirements section of thiscatalog.FacultyCharise L.

Manyexciting areas of scientific inquiry, such as bioinformatics, neuroscience,environmental science, and biophysical science, require broad sciencebackgrounds and encompass several disciplines. Students planningtechnical careers in one of these areas or careers in the health sciences,in science education, or in a science-related business or social servicemight be best served by a well-designed multidisciplinary scienceprogram.One strength of the General Science Program is its flexibility. To exploitthat strength, students need to design their programs carefully, consultingfrequently with the general science director. Course sequences thatmeet requirements for professional schools and training programsshould be selected in consultation with the program director or universityadvisors that specialize in the specific area (for example the HealthProfessions Program advisors). Students should seek assistance inprogram planning when they identify or change career goals, becausesuccessful application to professional schools and training programs mayrequire completion of additional courses beyond those required for thegeneral science major.Examples of cross-disciplinary fields, and the subject-matter areas thatmight be combined in designing a program, are given below:•Animal behavior and ethology—anthropology, biology, psychology•Biophysical sciences—biology, chemistry, human physiology,physics•Cognitive sciences—computer and information science,mathematics, psychology•Environmental sciences—biology, chemistry, earth sciences,geography, physics•Neurosciences—biology, chemistry, psychologyGeneral science majors are encouraged to consult with the programdirector during their junior year to ensure that their remaining course workis structured to meet all the requirements for the major. Students shouldnotify the General Science Program office of their intention to graduate atleast one term before the proposed graduation date.PreparationHigh school students planning to major in general science should takeas much mathematics as possible, including two years of algebra andtrigonometry. They should also take science courses in their areas ofinterest. Students planning to transfer into the General Science Programafter two years at a community college or at another college or universityshould complete courses equivalent to the lower-division requirementslisted in this catalog and as many of the university’s general-educationrequirements for a bachelor’s degree as possible. Acceptance oftransfer courses and credits is determined by evaluators in the Office ofAdmissions in consultation with departmental advisors.Upon admission, transfer students should consult with the generalscience director in the program office.CareersThrough the General Science Program, prehealth science studentspreparing for careers in medicine, dentistry, or related fields can meetprofessional school admission requirements. General science, whencombined with a minor or a second major, can work well for studentsplanning careers in science-related business, public relations, and humanservices.•Bachelor of Arts•Bachelor of ScienceUndergraduate StudiesBachelor of Arts Degree RequirementsCodeTitleCreditsLower Division 144-56"

Thecomprehensive exam is an opportunity to demonstrate that the student•can articulate core areas of expertise and situate the student’s overallresearch agenda in relation to these areas of expertise•understands and can defend major theoretical and methodologicalissues in these core research and teaching areas•has a sense of where those theories and methods stand in relation tomajor themes in contemporary and interdisciplinary scholarshipPhD students develop their own questions. These questions should focuson the three areas of expertise as identified in consultation between thestudent and advisor. At least three questions should be developed foreach of the three areas. The committee may ask for more than three.At this point, the committee selects four examination questions. Thecommittee may constrain, expand, or otherwise edit any of the student-written questions. The student has two weeks to write the responses(four to five pages to each question). Approximately one to three weeksafter turning in the written responses, the student defends the responsesorally. Please see the geography department's Graduate ProgramHandbook for additional details.Within nine months of completing the comprehensive examination, thestudent must present a dissertation proposal for approval by the student’sdissertation committee. The completed dissertation, the capstone ofthe doctoral program, presents the results of substantive and originalresearch on a significant geographic problem. It is defended in a publicoral presentation.Courses"

Theprogram also offers the doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree in German,for which applicants may apply either with a BA or an MA already earned.The requirements for the PhD include one year of graded course workpast the MA level and a written dissertation. The MA degree preparesstudents for teaching German language and culture up through thesecondary-school level (in conjunction with teacher certification), whilethe PhD degree, as the highest degree in the field, is generally expectedfor an academic career involving both research and teaching.The graduate curriculum acquaints students with the history of Germanletters (with a primary focus on modernity since the enlightenment),places this history in a European context, and provides tools for a criticalanalysis of the literary, theoretical, and cinematic discourses involved.The program encourages comparative, theoretically oriented work.Core CurriculumStudents take one course each term. These courses are groupedaccording to common themes to give the program a topical andcritical coherence. Core courses are paired with seminars of relatedor complementary content, and students are encouraged to exploreconnections between courses.In the first year, core courses address a specific genre (narrative, drama,and lyric). While their content may vary with the instructor, they are306         German and Scandinavianintended to present in general terms the history of the genre itself and ofcritical thinking about that genre. In the second year, core courses haveless traditional themes and present a broader concept of textuality.CodeTitleCredits"

As a discipline, it connects science, medicine, and health, andcreates a framework for understanding how the human body adapts tostresses, physical activity, and disease.Human physiology and anatomy are closely related—anatomy isthe study of form, physiology is the study of function, and form andfunction are intrinsically linked. The study of human physiologyintegrates knowledge across many levels, including biochemistry, cellphysiology, and organ systems. Contemporary research in humanphysiology explores new ways to maintain or improve the quality oflife, the development of new medical therapies and interventions, andthe unanswered questions about how the human body works. TheDepartment of Human Physiology serves its students by providing strongtraining in human physiology and anatomy to prepare them for careers inmedicine, allied health professions, and biomedical research.FacultyDamien Callahan, assistant professor.

Majorscomplete sequences in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, inaddition to upper-level course work in human physiology.PreparationHigh school preparation should include a strong background in chemistry,biology, mathematics, and physics. Students involved in AdvancedPlacement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs cancomplete some lower division requirements by earning sufficient testscores. However, some graduate degree programs may require studentsto complete these courses at the collegiate level.Transfer StudentsBefore transferring, students should complete as many general-educationrequirements and lower-division major requirements as possible,including general chemistry, general biology, general physics, andmathematics. Students should ensure that courses transfer specificallyas required sequences. The University’s Transfer Course Equivalency(http://registrar.uoregon.edu/transfer-students) tool is a helpful resource.The anatomy and physiology sequence ("

The MCRPdegree is accredited nationally by the Planning Accreditation Board.The MPA is accredited nationally by the Network of Schools of PublicPolicy, Affairs, and Administration. The department also offers a 24-creditgraduate certificate in nonprofit management.The interdisciplinary and eclectic fields of planning, public policy, andpublic and nonprofit management are concerned with systematicallyshaping the future. Professionals in the field are involved in analysis,preparation of recommendations, and implementation of policies andprograms that affect public facilities and services and the quality ofcommunity life. These professionals assume responsibility for planning,policy, and management in community and regional development,natural resources, economic development, social sciences, land use,transportation, arts, and other fields.Planning, public policy, and public and nonprofit management graduateshave a comprehensive understanding of economic, environmental, fiscal,physical, political, and social characteristics of a community. Graduatesare expected to provide leadership and to otherwise participate effectivelyin efforts to enhance the capacity of communities to deal creatively withchange.Financial AidApproximately 40 percent of the department’s students receive somefinancial assistance (e.g., graduate employment, work-study assistance,or research stipends). Graduate employment positions (GE) are offeredto approximately 20 students each year. Each fellowship includes astipend and a waiver of tuition and fees for one or more terms. Graduatestudents also may work on planning and public policy projects throughthe Community Planning Workshop. Each year, five to 15 studentsreceive stipends for research on contracts developed and administeredin the workshop. Research and GE appointments typically are not offereduntil the student has been in a PPPM program for at least one term.Graduate students are eligible for fellowship awards granted by federalagencies and privately endowed foundations and loans from universityand federal student loan programs. Information about grants andloans may be obtained from the Office of Student Financial Aid andScholarships.Applicants to PPPM programs are strongly urged to apply for universityfinancial assistance before February of the year of application in orderto be eligible for work-study and other assistance offered by the studentfinancial aid office.The University of Oregon offers Diversity Excellence Scholarshipsfor graduate students who are United States citizens orpermanent residents. For more information, visit the Center forMulticultural Academic Excellence (http://financialaid.uoregon.edu/diversity_excellence_scholarship) website.Community and Regional PlanningThe master of community and regional planning (MCRP) programtrains policy-oriented planners for leadership positions in planning andplanning-related organizations. The field of planning is concerned withrational and sensitive guidance of community and regional change.Planners are responsible for identifying and clarifying the nature andeffect of planning problems, formulating potential solutions to theseproblems, and assisting in the implementation of alternative policies.To realize these objectives, the planner must draw on the skills andinsights of many professions and disciplines. The planner must havea basic understanding of the cultural, economic, social, political, andphysical characteristics of a community.Entering students should be prepared to become involved in andcommitted to resolving important social, economic, environmental,political, and cultural problems. Courses in and outside the departmentprovide students with an integrated understanding of planning, publicpolicy, and public management as well as specific skills needed for achosen professional area.Oregon is an especially fruitful laboratory in which to study planning.The state has an international reputation as a source of innovativeapproaches to addressing planning issues.Students select a set of courses in consultation with their advisors thatfocus their elective work on an area of special interest. The programhas exceptional strengths in community and regional development,environmental planning, land use and sustainable development, andsocial planning. In addition, the department’s strengths in nonprofitmanagement, local government management, and budget and financeare of interest to many students in the field of planning.The program has strong ties with other programs on campus.

Nomore than three courses may count for both the global health minor andthe student’s major field of study. Twenty credits toward the minor andall upper-division courses must be taken in residence at the University ofOregon. Course work within the minor, including the field experience orinternship, must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a grace of C–or better.Minor in International StudiesThe international studies minor provides students with the opportunityto add a global health perspective to any major, in addition to providinga solid grounding in intercultural communication and the foundationsof global citizenship. Students are able to tailor course work to theirown professional and personal objectives, so the minor is a suitablecomplement to a BA or BS degree in any school or department.354         International StudiesInternational studies minors must complete 24 international studies(subject code INTL) course credits, 12 of which must be upper division,with a grade of C– or better or P. Course selection is up to the individualstudent, but for advising purposes optional, nonrigid tracks are suggestedfor students coming from different majors, tracks that can especiallycomplement particular career goals. Student may elect up to 12 lower-division credits, which share a common purpose of fostering criticaland cross-cultural thinking as well as encouraging students to seek outand understand diverse perspectives and ways of approaching andcommunicating about current global issues. The 12 required upper-division credits allow a deeper investigation of issues, regions, andcultures and also hone skills in research, effective writing, and oralpresentation to address rapidly changing and complex current and futureissues.Four-Year Degree PlanThe degree plan shown is only a sample of how students may completetheir degrees in four years. There are alternative ways. Students shouldconsult their advisor to determine the best path for them.Bachelor of Arts in International StudiesBelow is an example of how to complete a BA in international studieswith a diplomacy and international relations professional concentrationand a Middle East geographic focus. Since the major offers 16 optionsfor professional concentration areas and seven different geographicfocus regions, with a wide variety of courses that can count toward eachconcentration, there are innumerable paths through the internationalstudies major.This degree plan is for general planning purposes only and, due tothe interdisciplinary nature of the major, it is imperative that studentsspeak with advisors to determine which courses would best match theirpersonal, professional, and academic goals.CourseTitleCreditsMilestonesFirst YearFall"

The University of Oregon offers formal coursesin a number of European and non-European languages. Students alsomay study languages through self-instruction at the Yamada LanguageCenter. International students whose high school or university instructionwas not in English demonstrate proficiency in English as a secondlanguage through completion of the master’s degree requirements. It isrecommended that international students study a language from theirgeographic focus.Supervised Field Internship or Field ResearchThe program assists students in locating internships or researchopportunities and securing funding. International students may do theirinternship or research in the United States. Students are responsiblefor obtaining funding for the costs or for otherwise paying the costs intheir entirety. Many graduate students in the program have competedsuccessfully for funding to support internship and research experiences.The international studies faculty expects students to gain the followingfrom the internship or research experience:1.a reasonably in-depth experience in a culture other than the student’sown2.greater fluency in the language of the culture in which the internshipor research takes place3.knowledge and experience useful to the career goals of the internMaster of Arts ProjectEach student must prepare an MA project, usually in the form of athesis or capstone project.

The primary aim of linguistics asa science is to study the use and organization of human language incoding and communicating knowledge. Although linguists may studyspecific facts of many languages, they do so to gain insight into theproperties and processes common to all languages. Such commonfeatures may in turn reflect universals of human cognitive, cultural, andsocial organization.Language occupies a central position in the human universe, so muchso that it is often cited as a major criterion for defining humanity. Itsuse in the coding and processing of knowledge makes it relevant topsychology. As a tool of reasoning, it verges on logic and philosophy. Asa computational system, it relates to computer science and language-data processing. As a repository of one’s cultural worldview, it is a part ofanthropology. As an instrument of social intercourse and a mark of socialidentity, it interacts with sociology. As a biological subsystem lodgedin the brain, it is highly relevant to neurology. As the primary vehicle oflearning and maturation, it is important for education. As an expressivemedium, it is the crux of literature and rhetoric.CareersTo gain understanding into the complexities of human language isthus to gain entrance into numerous fields of academic investigationand practical use. Indeed, computer programmers, conflict mediators,cryptologists, elementary school teachers, language teachers, lawyers,psychiatrists, speech therapists, and translators all depend heavily onunderstanding the nature and use of language.The BA degree in linguistics provides a solid foundation for graduatestudies in anthropology, communication, communication disorders andsciences, computer-science education, journalism, law, linguistics,literature and languages, philosophy, psychology, or sociology. It offers astrong entry into the applied fields listed above.AdvisingUndergraduate majors should consult one of the departmentalundergraduate advisors each term about their study program.Bachelor of Arts Degree RequirementsCodeTitleCreditsCore Courses"

MATH 607,"). Each student, upon enteringthe graduate degree program in mathematics, reviews previous studiesand objectives with the graduate advising committee. Based on thisconsultation, conditional admission to the master’s degree program or thepre-PhD program is granted. A student in the pre-PhD program may alsobe a candidate for the master’s degree.Pre-PhD ProgramTo be admitted to the pre-PhD program, an entering graduate studentmust have completed a course of study equivalent to the graduatepreparatory bachelor’s degree program described above. Other studentsare placed in the master’s degree program and may apply for admissionto the pre-PhD program following a year of graduate study. Studentsin the pre-PhD program must take the qualifying examination by thebeginning of their third year, during the week before classes begin fallterm. It consists of examinations on two basic 600-level graduate coursesequences, one each from two of the following three categories:1.algebra2.analysis and probability3.topology and geometryPhD ProgramAdmission to the PhD program is based on the following criteria:•satisfactory performance on the qualifying examination•completion of three courses at a level commensurate with studytoward a PhD•satisfactory performance in seminars or other courses taken as a partof the pre-PhD or PhD program.Students who are not admitted to the PhD program because ofunsatisfactory performance on the fall-term qualifying examination mayretake the examination at the beginning of winter term.A student in the PhD program is advanced to candidacy after passing alanguage examination and the comprehensive examination. To completethe requirements for the PhD, candidates must submit a dissertation,have it read and approved by a dissertation committee, and defend itorally in a formal public meeting.Language RequirementThe department expects PhD candidates to be able to read mathematicalmaterial in a second language selected from French, German, andRussian. Other languages are acceptable in certain fields. To fulfill thelanguage requirement, the student must meet with a faculty member—adoctoral advisor or a member of the PhD committee—to obtain advice fora suitable paper or book. The paper or book should be written in French,German, or Russian and have mathematical material beneficial to thestudent’s area of study. After reading, translating, and understanding thematerial, the student meets with the faculty member again. The facultymember determines whether the student understands the material.394         MathematicsIf satisfied, the faculty member deems the requirement met and thedecision is added in writing to the student’s record.Comprehensive ExaminationThis oral examination emphasizes the basic material in the student’sgeneral area of interest. A student is expected to take this examination bythe end of the second academic year in the PhD program. To be eligibleto take this examination, a student must have completed the languageexamination and nearly all the course work needed for the PhD.DissertationPhD candidates in mathematics must submit a dissertation containingsubstantial original work in mathematics. Requirements for final defenseof the dissertation are those of the Graduate School.Courses. Seminar: [Topic]. 1-5 Credits.Repeatable.

Wilson, AdvisorsThe undergraduate major in mathematics and computer science leadsto a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree. The major combineselements of the mathematics and computer and information sciencecurricula into a four-year program that offers an alternative to theundergraduate degree programs in either field. It serves students whowant knowledge in both fields but are not ready to specialize in either.The courses selected for the program provide a solid foundation forprofessional work or for advanced study.The program is designed to develop team players for information-based occupations. Its graduates have the tools to analyze complexproblems and compute the answers to them. Consistent with its emphasison teamwork and communication, the program requires college-levelexposure to an additional scientific field and an upper-division writingcourse.Students with strong mathematics backgrounds in high school arefrequently advised to major in computer science at the university, oftenwithout a clear idea of what the field of study is actually like. The jointmajor program offers such students the chance to experiment withcomputer science while retaining the anchor to mathematics. It alsoallows students the possibility of changing easily to the single-majorprogram in either mathematics or CIS with no loss of credit and, at leastthrough the junior year, without jeopardizing degree completion in fouryears.CareersGraduates with this major can enter industrial positions that requirecomputer science skills and mathematical problem-solving ability.They are particularly well suited for positions in the high-performancecomputing industry, developing the software tools for large-scale scientificcomputation. The combination of mathematics and computer scienceforms an excellent professional background for secondary-schoolmathematics teachers, and the major program also provides a solidfoundation for actuarial, financial, and related professions. Graduates arealso prepared to enter advanced programs of study in either mathematicsor computer science, or in applied areas such as biological computationalscience.PreparationA high school student planning to major in mathematics and computerscience should pursue a strong academic program with four years ofmathematics. Courses in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and moreadvanced topics should be included. Experience preparing substantialwritten reports is highly desirable.Transfer StudentsCollege transfer students who have completed a year of calculus shouldbe able to fit the remaining mathematics courses for the degree into justtwo years, provided that they have already completed the bulk of theirgeneral-education requirements before they transfer.Transfer students should call or write to the Department of Computer andInformation Science to determine whether computer courses they havetaken can be counted toward the joint major requirements. Sequentialsubjects such as mathematics and computer science typically requireseveral years to progress from introductory to senior-level courses. Thejoint program lets students move forward in both fields at once withlimited prerequisites, making it relatively accessible to transfer studentsand to students who change from other major programs. Students whowant to pursue the material in greater depth need to consider prerequisitepaths carefully.Students attending community college in Oregon are encouraged toobtain the Associate of Arts Oregon Transfer degree before enteringthe University of Oregon. While earning this degree, community collegetransfer students should take as much discrete mathematics, calculus,400         Mathematics and Computer Scienceand computer science as possible, and also try to complete the sciencerequirement for the major. The associate degree does not automaticallysatisfy the science requirement for this major.Faculties and FacilitiesThe faculties and facilities in both the mathematics and the computerand information science departments are available to students in thecombined major program. For detailed descriptions, see those sections ofthis catalog. Information is also available online.Honors ProgramBoth of the cooperating departments offer departmental honors programsto their undergraduate majors. After obtaining advance approval fromboth of their advisors, students in the joint degree program are eligibleto attain honors in mathematics and computer science by meeting thehonors requirements of either department, including writing a thesis.Preparation for Kindergarten throughSecondary School Teaching CareersThe College of Education offers a fifth-year program for middle-secondarylicensure in mathematics and for elementary teaching. More informationis available from the mathematics department’s advisors; see also theCollege of Education section of this catalog.MinorMinors are offered by the Department of Mathematics and theDepartment of Computer and Information Science. There is no joint minorin mathematics and computer science.•Bachelor of Arts•Bachelor of ScienceUndergraduate StudiesBachelor of Arts Degree RequirementsTo earn a bachelor of arts (BA) in mathematics and computer science(MACS), majors must complete the requirements for a bachelor ofscience (BS) in addition to demonstrating proficiency in a secondlanguage.The requirements for the MACS major fall into four categories:mathematics, computer science, writing, and science, with 44 creditstaken in mathematics, 40 credits in computer science, and 16 credits(science and writing) in other departments.Computer Science I (.

Shoemaker, Program Director311 Susan Campbell HallMedieval studies, an interdisciplinary undergraduate program, integratesvarious approaches to the Middle Ages by medievalists in severaldepartments. Medieval studies provides an excellent general educationor a solid base for graduate work in a more specialized area. Studyabroad is strongly encouraged.Medieval studies concentrates on the period from 300 to 1500, combiningcourses in art and architecture, history, language, literature, music,philosophy, and religion. A typical course of study includes diverse topicssuch as the Bible, the early Church, Byzantium, Islam, the Vikings, theCrusades, women in the Middle Ages, mysticism, romance, the Gothiccathedral, Chaucer, Dante, and medieval China and Japan. The programaims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the medieval worldviewin Europe and beyond, and the origins of the modern world.Participating FacultyIna Asim, historyJudith R.

See the program website for more information.414         Medieval StudiesHonors in Medieval StudiesA degree with honors in medieval studies allows a student to focus on anarea of concentration in a written thesis. Requirements are as follows:1.Satisfaction of the requirements for the major2.A grade point average of 3.50 or better in courses taken to meet theupper-division requirements of the major. A minimum cumulative UOgrade point average of 3.003.A prospectus for the thesis approved by both the thesis director andthe program director. The prospectus must be submitted no laterthan week seven of the term before the student plans to complete thehonors project. When the prospectus has been approved, the studentand thesis director will agree on a schedule of submission of work4.A senior thesis of substantial quality, representing new orsubstantially new work beyond any project or paper submitted withinother university courses, approved by the thesis director and at leastone other member of the medieval studies participating faculty. Thethesis must be complete and ready for public presentation no laterthan week seven of the fall, winter, or spring term5.A presentation of the project. The student presents the honorsproject to students and faculty members and participates in an opendiscussion of the project with the audience. Presentations typicallyoccur in weeks seven through ten of fall, winter, or spring terms andare arranged in consultation with both the director of the MedievalStudies Program and the student’s thesis advisor6.Honors in medieval studies are not given for substantially thesame project or paper submitted for honors to any other unit in theuniversity.

Academically, the central goal of the minor in NativeAmerican studies is to inform students about the unique place of tribesin the state-tribal-federal intergovernmental matrix and about themyriad distinct issues native peoples of the United States face, fromlanguage and cultural protection to environmental issues to economicdevelopment and tribal sovereignty. In a state with nine federallyrecognized indigenous nations and a Native American population 50percent higher proportionally than the national average, this is criticalinformation for future leaders in all fields.Undergraduate StudiesStudents may earn a minor in Native American studies. The primary goalof the minor is to help students understand contemporary and historicnative lives through attention to the politics, cultures, identities, andpractices of Native American and indigenous peoples. A secondarygoal of the program is to encourage student awareness of the ethnicand cultural dimensions and applications of other major fields. Studentsof literature, social sciences, education, urban planning, art history,humanities, international studies—to name only a few—find that relatedNative American studies courses can enrich their academic programs.Courses applied to a minor in Native American studies may be used tosatisfy major or minor requirements for other programs.Specific details and course approvals must be obtained from the NativeAmerican Studies Program.Requirements for the MinorThe Native American studies minor requires 28 credits. At least 16 creditsmust be taken in residence at the University of Oregon. Up to 4 creditsmay be counted toward the minor from a list of related courses thatfall outside the core of Native American studies but that focus on otherissues closely related to the field. Courses must be taken for a grade, andgrades must be mid-C or higher to count toward the minor. The courseload is distributed as follows:CodeTitleCredits. Multicultural Theater: [Topic]. 4 Credits.Origins and development of contributions in theater and drama by variouscultures including Latino, Chicano, African American, Asian American,and Native American.

The University of Oregon’slong-standing educational and scholarly interest in the Pacific islands,involving active researchers and teachers in many fields, was formalizedas a program committee in 1987 and it has worked since to coordinateinstructional, research, and exchange programs related to the islands.The program emphasizes interdisciplinary perspectives essential forunderstanding natural and cultural environments, cultural history andchange, and educational and contemporary socioeconomic issues in thePacific.Courses about the Pacific cover a range of topics. Students can enrollin undergraduate courses and advanced degree programs in variousdepartments and through the Asian Studies Program. Students mayalso work with committee members from Pacific island studies toward anInterdisciplinary Studies: Individualized Program master’s degree (MA orMS). Information is available in the Graduate School (p. 937) section ofthis catalog.The Pacific island studies faculty participates in the Asian studies BAand MA degree programs by teaching courses that may be used tosatisfy degree requirements (e.g., in developing a secondary cultural orgeographical area with Southeast Asia). Undergraduate- and graduate-level courses are available in anthropology and archaeology, arthistory, biology, earth sciences, international studies, ethnic studies,and sociology. A small number of courses focus solely on the PacificIslands, but a broader range includes ones related to islands and coastalcommunities.The Pacific Islands Archaeological Project, directed by William S. Ayresand Scott Fitzpatrick, offers students opportunities to participate inarchaeological and anthropological study in the Pacific. Members of theanthropology faculty offer a field school in archaeology.Training in selected Pacific island languages is possible throughindividual study using tutors and materials developed for use at theYamada Language Center.

Current researchareas include astronomy and astrophysics, biophysics, condensed matterphysics, elementary particle physics, and optical physics.The interdisciplinary Institute of Theoretical Science houses theoreticalresearch in some of the above areas as well as in areas of overlapbetween chemistry and physics.The Center for High Energy Physics conducts research in particlephysics, much of it in laboratories outside Oregon.The Materials Science Institute and the Oregon Center for Optics providefacilities, support, and research guidance for graduate students andpostdoctoral fellows in the interdisciplinary application of concepts andtechniques from both physics and chemistry to understanding physicalsystems.Cooperative programs of study are possible in molecular biology throughthe Institute of Molecular Biology.Pine Mountain ObservatoryPine Mountain Observatory, operated by the Department of Physics forresearch and advanced instruction in astronomy, is located thirty milessoutheast of Bend, Oregon, off Highway 20 near Millican, at an altitudeThe University of Oregon            447of 6,300 feet above sea level. The observatory has three telescopes—fifteen inches, twenty-four inches, and thirty-two inches in diameter—thelargest governed by computer. All are Cassegrain reflectors. A wide-fieldCCD camera is available on the thirty-two-inch telescope. The site has anastronomers’ residence building and a caretaker’s house. Professionalastronomical research is in progress at the observatory on every partiallyor totally clear night of the year, and the site is staffed year round.Admission and Financial AidFor admission to graduate study, a bachelor’s degree in physics or arelated area is required with a minimum undergraduate grade pointaverage (GPA) of 3.00 (B) in advanced physics and mathematicscourses. Submission of scores on the Graduate Record Examinations(GRE), including the physics test, is required. Students from non-English-speaking countries must demonstrate proficiency in Englishby submitting scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). Information about the department and the Graduate AdmissionApplication are available through the department’s website.Financial aid in the form of graduate employee (GE) opportunities orresearch fellowships is available on a competitive basis to PhD students.GEs require approximately sixteen hours of work a week and providea stipend and tuition waiver. New students are typically eligible only forteaching fellowships.The sequential nature of most physics courses makes it difficult to begingraduate study in terms other than Fall. Furthermore, financial aid isusually available only to students who begin their studies in the Fall.To ensure equal consideration for fall term admission, the deadlinefor applications for financial aid is January 15. Late applications foradmission may be considered until July 15.Degree RequirementsEntering students should consult closely with their assigned advisors.Students showing a lack of preparation are advised to take the necessaryundergraduate courses in order to remedy their deficiencies.Students should consult the Graduate School section of this catalog forgeneral university admission and degree requirements. Departmentalrequirements, outlined in a handbook for incoming students that isavailable in the department office and online, are summarized below.Industrial Internships and the AppliedPhysics Master’s DegreeThe department offers a traditional master’s as well as an internship-based master’s program in applied physics, designed to serve physicsstudents whose primary interests lie in applied research and developmentrather than in basic research. The Master’s Industrial Internship Programincludes course work, professional development, and a nine-monthpaid internship that helps prepare physicists for a career in industry orgovernment labs. The internship salary helps offset the cost of tuitionfor students in this program; the traditional master’s program does notinclude financial support.Master of Science: Applied PhysicsCodeTitleCredits500- or 600-level courses 124Industrial internship10Additional graduate-level physics courses11-19Total Credits45-531At least 9 credits of 600-level courses are required.Additional RequirementsFor a student to be in good academic standing, the cumulative GPA ofthe graded-credit total must be 3.00 or better.Graduate School requirements, including time limits, must be satisfied.The applied physics master of science (MS) degree requires thecompletion of 54 total credits—24 graded credits at the 500 level orhigher and 30 internship research credits. The internship requirementmust be fulfilled through the industrial internship program. Internshipcredits are taken pass/no pass. A student who is working full-time as anintern typically earns 10 credits each term.Graded credits must be selected from an approved departmental list.The table below highlights courses commonly taken by students inthe Master’s Industrial Internship Program. Other 600-level physicscourses qualify, but may require additional prerequisites. Some graduate-level courses in chemistry may qualify. Other courses may be added orsubstituted with the approval of the applied physics program advisor.CodeTitleCredits"

Forundergraduates, three 100-level courses cover foundational knowledgeand skills, and six 200-level courses serve as “gateways” to career pathsthat organize the upper-division curriculum: public policy and politicalaction; politics, law, and justice; politics of business; global engagement;sustainability, development, and social action; and ethics, identity,and society. For graduate study, the department offers training in sixtraditional subfields of political science, each with their own designatedfaculty members: comparative politics, formal theory and methodology,international relations, public policy, political theory, and United Statespolitics. Faculty members employ varied theoretical and methodologicalapproaches but share the pursuit of answers to questions with real-worldimplications.CareersAn undergraduate degree in political science provides a strongfoundation for any number of career choices. The program has beendesigned to develop in students a concrete set skills—critical thinking,analytical abilities, writing proficiency, and precise communication.Majors are encouraged to select course work that aligns with their careergoals. Students begin with a 200-level introductory course, then developand refine skills in upper-division courses.The department offers credit for internships related to political scienceand a workshop to explore and prepare students for the job market. Formore information, visit polisci.uoregon.edu/internship-careers.Political science graduates may also continue on to graduateeducation, especially in the fields of law, international studies, businessadministration, or advanced studies in political science.FacultyYvette Alex-Assensoh, professor (immigration, racial politics): vicepresident for equity and inclusion.

Students are encouraged to gain additionalresearch experience through research assistant positions in faculty labsand the undergraduate honors thesis program. The psychology majoraffords students great flexibility in selecting upper-division courses to fitindividual goals and interests. Classroom and internship opportunities areenriched by numerous faculty research programs that range in levels ofanalysis and intellectual focus. An undergraduate degree in psychologyprovides the background for a broad range of careers, including socialservices, education, law, or graduate programs in psychology.PreparationHigh school preparation should include courses in social sciences aswell as the natural sciences (physics, biology, chemistry). Language andmathematical skills are also highly desirable. In general, the broad liberal-arts training that prepares students for college studies is appropriate formajoring in psychology at the university.CareersSome students major in psychology to prepare for graduate trainingand careers in related fields such as personnel relations, vocationaland personal counseling, medicine and dentistry, social and case work,marketing, administration, the legal profession, or counseling in the publicschools. Others prepare for careers as academic psychologists (teachingand research), clinical psychologists (mental health centers, institutions,and private practice), industrial and organizational psychologists, andgovernment psychologists (testing, research, and administration).Career information is also available on the American PsychologicalAssociation website.Review of CoursesLower-Division CoursesAmong lower-division courses, psychology is introduced as a socialscience by the following courses:CodeTitleCredits"

Doctoral students receive training in infant,child, and adult psychopathology; culture and diversity; infant, child,family, and adult assessment; and neuropsychology. All practicums andclinical training experiences have a strong focus on evidence-basedtreatments. Students receive training in the clinical techniques andpractices as well as the methodology for development, implementation,and evaluation of these interventions. Both psychotherapeuticinterventions and prevention programs are included in the training.The major goal of doctoral training is to support promising doctoralstudents in developing careers as scientist-practitioners. Studentsinterested primarily in clinical practice would most likely prefer a programless research-oriented than the Oregon Clinical Psychology TrainingProgram.The research and clinical opportunities available to doctoral studentsdepend on current activities of the clinical and departmental faculty, andmay also encompass ongoing projects in research institutes locatedin the Eugene community that are affiliated with the clinical program.The University of Oregon            471These institutions include the Oregon Research Institute, Oregon SocialLearning Center, Decision Research, and Electrical Geodesics.Members of the clinical faculty and other instructors with clinical interestshave ongoing research in several areas, including the neurobiologyof early stress, brain development and neural plasticity, behaviorand molecular genetics, infant mental health, emotion and attention,prevention science, school readiness, child welfare system research,pubertal development and the transition to adolescence, depression,anxiety, personality measurement and theory, cognitive therapy, childand family assessment, social and emotional adjustment of children andadolescents, drug and alcohol abuse, cross-cultural psychology, sexualaggression, interpersonal violence, child abuse, institutional betrayal, andtraumatic stress.The department places a particularly high priority on translationalresearch, encouraging multidisciplinary collaborations with colleaguesfrom other areas of psychology and other academic departments.Currently, faculty research is funded by the National Science Foundation,National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Drug Abuse,National Institute on Child Health and Development, and the Institute ofEducation Sciences.Additional information regarding course requirements for clinical studentsis provided in the Guide to the Clinical Program and the Doctoral StudentHandbook, located on the department website.Cognitive Psychology and CognitiveNeuroscienceThe Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon has played animportant role in the development of the field of cognitive neuroscience,and current researchers are continuing that tradition. Research areasinclude the cognitive and neural basis of perception, visual cognition,selective attention, working memory, long-term memory, executivecontrol, action, language processing, and brain plasticity. Also underinvestigation are how these processes are altered by development inimpoverished environments, aging, traumatic brain injury, autism, andother conditions. Studies employ a wide range of methods, includingbehavioral experiments, analyses of individual differences, functionalimaging, electrophysiology, and transcranial magnetic and direct currentstimulation.The research efforts of the cognitive neuroscience laboratories benefitfrom the collaborative atmosphere at the University of Oregon, both withinpsychology and across other departments, allowing for an exploration ofcognitive processes at many levels of analysis. Labs are located withinthe state-of-the-art facilities of the Robert and Beverly Lewis IntegrativeScience Building, in close proximity to the many other labs of the Instituteof Neuroscience (http://www.neuro.uoregon.edu). The building alsohouses the Lewis Center for Neuroimaging (http://lcni.uoregon.edu), aresearch-dedicated facility with a 3T MRI scanner that supports ongoingresearch and training with functional and structural magnetic resonanceimaging.One of the most important aspects of the cognitive neurosciencegraduate program is its informal atmosphere. At the same time, thereis an emphasis on the development of imagination and intellectualindependence. Students are encouraged to explore their research ideasfrom many different perspectives, with the assistance of the expertisefrom researchers in several labs within the Department of Psychologyand the Institute of Neuroscience.Developmental PsychologyThe Department of Psychology has recently expanded the scope ofits developmental psychology program with the addition of new facultymembers and new emphases in the graduate curriculum. The departmentoffers extensive coverage of development during infancy, childhood,and adolescence, with some additional interest in aging. Several areasof research are strongly represented, including cognitive development,socio-emotional development, developmental psychopathology, anddevelopmental social and affective neuroscience.Several exciting clusters of expertise exist within these broad areas.Research on theory of mind and perspective-taking as well asimagination and creativity links to research on the development ofexecutive functioning and self-regulation. This cluster also dovetailswith research on self-evaluation; affective and appetitive motivations,and decision-making. Yet another active area of work looks at infantprocessing of action, language, and the statistical and temporalproperties of everyday visual and linguistic environments. In addition,many researchers share a strong interest in social contextual effects oninfant, child, and adolescent well-being, ranging from the small-scale(familial and peer influences, early adversity) to the large (cultural andglobal contexts of development).Members of the developmental psychology faculty also have strongcollaborative links with the Oregon Social Learning Center (http://www.oslc.org), Prevention Science Institute (http://psi.uoregon.edu),Oregon Research Institute (http://www.ori.org), and the interdisciplinaryInstitute of Cognitive and Decision Sciences (http://icds.uoregon.edu).Current and previous funding sources for the faculty and students indevelopmental psychology include the National Science Foundation,the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Eunice Kennedy ShriverNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the NationalInstitute of Mental Health, and the Oregon Medical Research Foundation.Graduates from the program have risen to faculty and postdoctoralpositions at the University of Minnesota, Swarthmore College, Queen'sUniversity, Vanderbilt University, the University of California at Davis, theUniversity of Michigan, Hamilton College, the University of Utah, OregonHealth and Science University, the University of Oregon, and BrownUniversity, among others.Social and Personality PsychologyResearch in social and personality psychology at the University ofOregon reflects an intellectually diverse approach to understandingintrapersonal and interpersonal processes and individual differences. Theprogram concentrates on high-quality research and training combinedwith substantive and methodological breadth. Faculty members conductresearch spanning a broad spectrum of human behavior using innovativeapproaches. Areas of particular focus include•Emotion and motivation—emotion regulation, social functions ofemotions, self-regulation, goal pursuit, stress and physiology•Self- and social cognition—self-perception and interpersonalperception, perspective-taking and empathy, self-other comparisons•Groups, networks, and organizations—status hierarchies, socialpower, psychology of war and sociopolitical violence, groupdynamics, online social networks•Culture, values, and worldviews—moral psychology, culture andbelief systems, psychology of religion•Personality structure and development—structure of personalityattributes, culture and personality description, lifespan development472         Psychology•Decision-making and risk perception—neuroeconomics andvaluation, social and financial decision-making, decision-making inapplied contexts (e.g., legal, aviation, risk assessment)Research in these areas draws upon a wide range of methods,including dyadic and group methods, psychophysiology, neuroimaging,neuroendocrinology, experience sampling, longitudinal studies, surveys,computational methods, and field studies. Students have the opportunityto develop their skills through course work and through collaboration withfaculty mentors.Training in the program exposes students to a wide range oftopics through small seminars, lab meetings, and a variety of otheropportunities. Students often work with multiple instructors andresearchers, including faculty members from other areas of psychology,from other departments and units on campus, and from other institutions.Students may flexibly tailor their own graduate program under theguidance of faculty advisors, making the social and personalitypsychology program a distinctive training experience for each graduatestudent.Courses"

The Department of Romance Languages stronglyencourages students to participate in one of the numerous study-abroad programs that the UO offers. Visit the department website (http://rl.uoregon.edu/study-abroad) for more information.The department sponsors programs for the study of French, Italian,Portuguese, and Spanish languages and cultures. Students live, study,and travel in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, in countries such asArgentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, France, Italy, Mexico, Morocco,Peru, Senegal, and Spain. Cosponsoring programs include IE3 Global,the Council on International Educational Exchange, the School forInternational Training, and the National Student Exchange.To ensure success in goals of language and cultural study, majors andminors in the department need to identify the program that best fits theiracademic requirements, financial situation, and personal interests. Thelist of programs posted on the department website is recommendedbased on their outstanding academic, linguistic, and cultural opportunitiesand strong on-site support.Before traveling abroad, students should consult their assigned majoror minor advisor about the selection of a program and the courses to betaken within that program.Tips for Selecting a Study-Abroad Program•Choose a program that offers a maximum of immersion (e.g., livingwith host families or local students, course work entirely in the targetlanguage, direct university enrollment opportunities)•Longer programs offer you more opportunity to acclimate to thelanguage, to be more fully immersed in the local culture, and to formmeaningful relationships with people from the host country•Courses in which the readings and lectures are in English do notcount toward majors or minors in the Department of RomanceLanguages or the UO bachelor of arts second-language requirement•Students in all UO overseas study programs enroll in courses withsubject codes that are unique to individual programs. Special coursenumbers are reserved for overseas study. Advisors can help studentsdetermine course equivalencies to maximize the credits applied torequirements for the degree•The department offers scholarships to help students with travelexpenses for language learning and research projects. For moreinformation, visit the scholarships page (http://rl.uoregon.edu/scholarships).For additional information and to obtain applications for specificprograms, contact the Office of International Affairs at (541) 346-3206.For questions on applying study-abroad credit to majors or minors,students should visit their assigned departmental advisor.Cultural Ambassador Program in SpainThe Ministry of Education of Spain offers more than 1,200 openings forU.S. and Canadian language and culture assistants (termed “culturalambassadors”). The positions are offered in Spain’s equivalent of the K–12 school system of public education.Teaching Assistant Program in FranceThis program is coordinated by the French Embassy and offers 1,500positions for native English speakers with a demonstrated knowledgeof French to teach and its overseas department in France, to assistFrench teachers with English courses for a period of six to nine months,or both.

This is an excellent opportunity forgraduating seniors with interest in education and experience abroad. Itis open to United States citizens or permanent residents under 29 yearsof age with a demonstrated knowledge of French—not just majors orminors. The Department of Romance Languages does not administerthe program, but simply offers guidance to interested students, and givesinformation and advice on the application process and on the programitself.Kindergarten through Secondary SchoolTeaching CareersStudents who complete a degree with a major in French, Spanish, orRomance languages are eligible to apply for the College of Education’sfifth-year licensure program in middle-secondary teaching.

The second exam consists of a detailed analysis of a short textin two parts: a close reading of the text and a consideration of the textin its social, historical, cultural, and/or literary contexts. The student, inconsultation with the examination committee, chooses in which of the fourperiods this second exam is done.The exams for the Romance languages MA are similar to those forFrench, Italian and Spanish. However, in the first exam students areasked to draw on examples from both their major and minor literatures intheir answer to at least one of the questions. They are encouraged (butnot required) to refer to both literatures in their answers to the other threeshort questions.The graduate secretary informs the students and the examinationcommittee members of the scheduled exam date.Examination CommitteeBy the sixth week of fall term in the second year, students submit totheir advisors and to the director of graduate studies an MA ExaminationCommittee form with the names of faculty members suggested to coverother examination periods and signed by the committee chair.By the end of the tenth week of fall term in the second year, studentssubmit a preliminary examination reading list of literary works on whichto be examined to the members of their exam committees and to thedirector of graduate studies.Examination Reading ListStudents construct a reading list, drawn up in consultation with the examcommittee, using the departmental reading list and the syllabuses andbibliographies of the seminars they have taken, as well as the summerreading done in preparation for the fall forum.For students studying for the MA in French, Italian, or Spanish, thereading list consists of at least ten items in each of the four periods,drawn up in consultation with the exam committee. Of the ten works ineach period, at least five must be chosen from the departmental readinglist. The other works can be suggested by the student, based on his orher own interests and readings.For students studying for the MA in Romance languages, the readinglist consists of at least twelve items in each of the four periods: eight inthe major language and four in the minor. Of the eight works in the majorlanguage, at least four must be chosen from the departmental readinglist; all texts in the minor language must be chosen from the departmentalreading list.The examination reading list also contains two additional secondaryreadings (usually literary histories or general literary surveys) that coverthe four periods, also drawn from the departmental reading list.The final version of the examination reading list must be approved andsigned by the student’s exam committee and filed with the graduatesecretary by the end of winter term of the second year. Students areresponsible for distributing the approved reading list to the MA committeemembers as soon as the list is approved.Examination QuestionsIn all fields, one of the two exams must be answered in the candidate’smajor language; the other can be written in the major language or inEnglish. Choice of language is to be determined in consultation with thecommittee chair.The four members of the MA exam committee work together to preparethe questions for the candidate. The exam committee chair is responsiblefor collecting questions from the committee members and submittingthem to the graduate secretary. On the first exam, the candidate answersfour questions, choosing between two questions in each of four periods.On the second exam, the candidate chooses between two possibleselections for the close reading analysis. The four members read andgrade both exams and come to an agreement on the final grade to besubmitted for each exam. The committee chair moderates this discussion,submits the grades to the graduate secretary, and communicates theresults to the candidate. The student passes when the average grade foreach exam is satisfactory (low pass, pass or high pass).The master’s examination is a closed book exam and therefore withoutfootnotes or a bibliography. The exam must be typed using a twelve-pointfont, double-spaced.Students who fail the master of arts examination in whole or in part willbe allowed to take it over (in whole or in part) once. They are encouragedto do so during the course of the following term (usually the summersession) and no later than six months after failing. If they fail again, theyare disqualified.Research: [Topic] ("

Beforethe end of the term preceding the Reading and Conference course, thestudent prepares a project proposal and submits it to the faculty memberwith whom he or she wants to work. The project proposal should includea statement of the problem the student wants to explore and a tentativereading list of primary and secondary sources.

The purpose of thisrequired independent reading course is to motivate students to beginreading during the summer following their first year in the MA program inpreparation for the exams that will take place in the spring term of theirsecond year.During the spring term of the first year of the MA program, studentspresent to their advisors a reading list of eight to ten works to be studiedduring the summer. The books must belong to no more than two ofthe periods defined by the MA program, and five of the books must be496         Romance Languagestaken from the departmental reading list. At least one of the texts shouldbe a literary history or a similar text about the period. This approvedlist (signed by the faculty advisor) will be submitted to the director ofgraduate studies before the end of the spring term.In fall term, students will register for a 2-credit, graded Reading andConference course with the director of graduate studies as the instructorof record.In the third week of the fall term of the second year, students presentthe findings of their summer study in a public forum. This one-day forumis organized as a professional meeting, with a chair for each session, adiscussion following the presentations, and refreshments. Most Romancelanguage faculty members are present during these presentations, aswell as all MA students.Presentations are fifteen minutes long and delivered in English.Presentations focus on the main themes that students have exploredin their readings. Students should be able to discuss both literarytechniques and historical context of the period selected, providingexamples from the books they have read. Plot summaries should beavoided.At the end of the presentations, the faculty members meet to evaluatethe presentations. On satisfactory completion of this exercise, studentsreceive 2 graded credits for the course. If the faculty members findthat a presentation was deficient, they recommend that the student dosupervised reading with the faculty specialist in the period before beingassigned a grade and receiving course credit.IncompletesIncompletes are strongly discouraged. However, students who findit necessary to ask for an incomplete are urged to complete theirincompletes as rapidly as possible. Agreements for obtaining andcompleting incompletes must be filed with the department. Graduatestudents must convert a graduate course incomplete into a passinggrade within one calendar year of the assignment of the incomplete.Any student who has more than 5 credits of incompletes is makingunsatisfactory progress toward the degree.Doctor of PhilosophyThe PhD program in Romance languages is designed to provide•a thorough familiarity with several fields (e.g., a movement, a genre, aperiod, or a literary problem)•the opportunity to situate the student’s special interests in the widercontext of Romance languages and literatures as well as in thecontext of trends inside and outside Western European culture•the tools necessary to engage literary issues at a high level•the ability to examine new and challenging literary or theoreticalperspectivesStudents who enter the PhD program with no knowledge of a secondRomance language are required to start learning one as soon as possibleduring their graduate studies.The PhD program has five components: course work, comprehensiveexamination, dissertation prospectus, original dissertation, and final oraldefense.Course WorkThe PhD degree requires a total of 84 graduate-level credits—32 creditsin addition to the 52 required for the master’s degree. Course workapplied to the degree must be taken for letter grades, and a grade pointaverage (GPA) of 3.00 or better must be maintained.Students must complete at least 21 graduate seminars in the department(at least 84 credits in all) beyond the bachelor’s degree. PhD studentsmust thus take at least 8 graduate courses (32 credits) beyond the13 courses (52 credits) required for the master’s. Only one of these8 courses (4 credits) may be satisfied in the form of a Reading andConference course (Reading and Conference: [Topic] (. Reading and Conference: [Topic]. 1-6 Credits.Repeatable."
SPAN 605,")).Of the twenty-one courses (84 credits), three (12 credits) must be takenin a second Romance language.As many as three of the twenty-one courses (12 of the 84 credits) may betaken outside the department, with the authorization of the advisor, andprovided that the courses bear directly on the student’s program of study.Doctoral students are also strongly encouraged to take RomanceLanguages Colloquium: [Topic] (. Reading and Conference: [Topic]. 1-6 Credits.Repeatable."
RL 623,") for at least two credits.Colloquium may either be taken as a 2-credit pass/no pass course(in which case it does not count toward the 52 credits required for thedegree) or as a 4-credit graded course.Students with an MA in French, Italian, Spanish, or Romance languagesfrom the University of Oregon may count a maximum of two graduatecourses completed during the MA program toward PhD courserequirements, provided that these courses were not used to fulfill MArequirements.Graduate students with an MA in French, Italian, Spanish, or Romancelanguages from another institution must take a minimum of 40 creditsin the Department of Romance Languages. The department’s graduatecommittee evaluates previous graduate course work and determineswhether additional work is necessary to fill any gaps in a student’spreparation. This may result in a student having to take more than 40credits at the University of Oregon—up to a maximum of 68 credits. If thecandidate is found to be seriously deficient or if the master’s degree isin a field other than Romance languages, the graduate committee mayadmit the student into the master’s program. In this case, the studentmay submit a petition to the committee to transfer a maximum of threecourses toward the twelve courses required for the MA This petition maybe submitted after the student has completed four graduate-level courseswith grades of mid-B or better in the Romance languages master’sprogram.Comprehensive ExaminationStudents entering the PhD program should develop, as soon as possiblebut no later than the third term of course work beyond the master’sdegree, a field of interest that forms the basis of their research forthe PhD comprehensive examination and ideally for the dissertation.This field of interest usually emerges from the selected courses andshapes the areas of concentration represented on the comprehensiveexamination.The comprehensive examination consists of two written examinationsand an oral examination. Each written examination covers a subfield thatpertains to the student’s field of interest. The subfields should be definedand prepared with three members of the Romance languages facultywho constitute the PhD examination committee. One of these facultymembers should represent the student’s second Romance language. Afourth member may be added from another department. In consultationThe University of Oregon            497with the members of the examination committee, the student creates areading list for each of the subfields. The reading list must be approvedby the examination committee no later than four weeks before the date ofthe exam. Student are responsible for distributing the reading list to thecommittee members of the examination committee as soon as the list isapproved.The written examinations take the form of two essays that respond toquestions formulated by members of the PhD examination committee.Each written examination covers one of the subfields and is a maximumof twenty double-spaced, typed pages in length. The student has twoweeks to write each of the two essays.Two weeks after the successful completion of the written essays, thestudent takes an oral examination. The oral examination attempts tointegrate the subfields addressed in the written examinations with theother facets of the student’s declared field of interest. In a two-hourconversation, the candidate and the committee members examine andelaborate on ways in which the written essays help to define a projectwithin the student’s field of interest.Typically undertaken during the fifth term of study following the master’sdegree, the comprehensive examination should result in clarification ofthe dissertation’s subject matter and possible approaches to it. The examshould, in other words, yield at least a tentative dissertation topic.A student who fails the PhD examination in whole or in part will beallowed to take it over (in whole or in part) once. The student isencouraged to do so no later than six months after failing. A secondfailure results in disqualification.It is the student’s responsibility to schedule both the written and oralportions of the comprehensive examination.With the successful completion of the PhD comprehensive exam, thestudent will advance to candidacy and begin preparing the dissertationprospectus.Dissertation ProspectusThe prospectus, typically completed during the sixth term of studyfollowing the master’s degree, defines the scope of the dissertation anddemonstrates the originality of the project. It consists of an eight- to ten-page description of the proposed dissertation project and a substantialresearch bibliography of primary and secondary material.Students are responsible for putting together a dissertation committee,which typically consists of four members: one director and two readersfrom the Department of Romance Languages, and one reader fromanother department. A student may also choose to have two codirectorsin the Department of Romance Languages (plus two further members ofthe department).When the student has a solid draft of the prospectus, she or heschedules a meeting with the dissertation committee members fora presentation and discussion of the prospectus. Following thisconversation, the student will make final revisions to the prospectus.Once the committee has given its final approval, the student submits theprospectus to the department for filing.Students are reminded that they must have a dissertation committee inplace and proper documents filed with the Graduate School six monthsbefore the dissertation defense.Any student making significant changes to the dissertation project afterthe final approval of the prospectus must schedule a meeting with thedissertation committee before proceeding.DissertationThe dissertation constitutes an original and valuable contribution toscholarship in the student’s field of interest. It should be characterized bymature literary interpretation, informed and reasoned argument, and anawareness of the means and goals of research.It is the student’s responsibility to ascertain the rules and deadlinesof the Graduate School for proper filing of the dissertation. Studentsare strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the stringentformatting and structure guidelines for the dissertation provided by theGraduate School (available online).A final copy of the dissertation must be distributed to the dissertationcommittee for final approval at least three weeks before the dissertationdefense.Final Oral DefenseWhen all members of the dissertation committee have approved thedissertation, a final public oral presentation and defense of the work isheld.FundingAll post-MA work, including the dissertation, is typically completed in fourto five years of study. PhD students making satisfactory progress towardthe degree are eligible for funding packages in the form of graduateemployee (GE) opportunities. These fellowships include stipendsfor teaching, as well as tuition waivers. Satisfactory progress entailscompleting all courses taken for credit with a grade of mid-B or better;passing the PhD comprehensive examination; timely submission of anacceptable dissertation prospectus; and regular and timely progress onthe dissertation itself.Courses.

Settled over a territory that spans half the earth’stime zones, these peoples have created a complex mosaic of cultures,expressed in literature and art as well as in institutions and social forms.Over the centuries, these lands have come under the sway of severalgreat world-historical civilizations and empires: the Byzantine, Mongolian,Ottoman Turkish, Holy Roman, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Soviet.These lands have felt the influence of Orthodox Christianity, Catholicism,Protestantism, Judaism, Islam, and Communism. At the intersection ofmany powerful forces, these lands experience the historical drama ofwhat some call "modernization" with its challenge to customary ways oflife. Yet, after centuries of massive transplantation and transformation,national and ethnic heritages survive. Customary ways and native self-consciousness, more diverse than anywhere else on the globe, expressthemselves with new vigor.Visiting Faculty MembersThe program sponsors extended stays by visiting Fulbright andInternational Research and Exchange Board scholars from Russia andEastern Europe.Overseas StudyQualified students of Russian may spend a summer, semester, oracademic year in the Commonwealth of Independent States—in theCouncil on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) CooperativeRussian Language Program, of which the University of Oregon is anaffiliate.

The committeeis a focal point for faculty members and students who want to teach ortake courses related to Scandinavia or to do research on Scandinaviancountries. Students can earn a minor in Scandinavian or a major inGerman with a focus on Scandinavian. Both academic programs aredescribed in the German and Scandinavian section of this catalog.Overseas StudyStudents in all University of Oregon overseas study programs enrollin courses with subject codes that are unique to individual programs.Special course numbers are reserved for overseas study. SeeInternational Affairs in the Academic Resources section of this catalog.The university has student exchange programs with the University ofAalborg, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark’s International StudyProgram in Copenhagen, the University of Tampere in Finland, theUniversities of Bergen and Oslo in Norway, and the University of Uppsalain Sweden. Area-studies courses not offered by the university can oftenbe taken at one of the Nordic universities. The courses may be appliedto the Scandinavian minor or the German and Scandinavian focus of theGerman major.Committee members have close ties to the information services of Nordicgovernments. As a result, books, periodicals, and newspapers regularlyarrive from Nordic countries.CurriculumCourses appropriate for Scandinavian studies have been offered inanthropology, comparative literature, English, German and Scandinavian,political science, sociology, and other departments.

The wide range of courses explores theintersections of gender, race, class, and sexuality; the institutionalstructures that have an impact on women’s and men’s lives; and thebroad range of feminist theory that seeks to explain and influencewomen’s status in society.

Within this broad purpose,architectural study and practice include the tasks of providing shelterand environmental protection, providing appropriate settings for humanactivities, and creating forms that are aesthetically pleasing andsupportive of social well-being. In the context of rapid urbanization,climate change, transforming economies, emerging technologies, growinginequalities, and other challenges, the potential impact and value ofarchitectural design has never been greater.The Department of Architecture includes the Interior ArchitectureProgram (p. 681) and maintains close ties with other departmentsin the College of Design. Architecture faculty members believe thatthe interdisciplinary cooperation of environmentally concerned fields isimportant to the study of architecture and continually seek new ways tolearn from one another.A central part of architectural education is the design studio, wherestudents learn by doing through experience with the design of buildings.This kind of learning is demanding, and students are expected to becommitted and able to work independently and responsibly towardprogram and course objectives. In the design studio, continuousevaluation and response are the basic learning modes.The department sets high standards for student performance. Advancedstudents often work together in courses and as collaborators with facultymembers in research investigations through independent-study courses.PreparationArchitecture is an inclusive art, bringing together a variety of disciplines.Students should prepare themselves in the following fields:1.Social sciences2.Natural sciences3.Humanities4.Fine artsStudents are also encouraged to travel and broaden their experiencesrelated to environmental design.Design CampThe College of Design offers a summer career exploration program forcollege-bound students at the school’s facilities in the White Stag Blockin downtown Portland. Students explore architecture, product design,and the digital arts in the city and in the studio. Information about DesignCamp may be obtained on the website or by calling the College of Designin Portland.Guest Instructors, Lecturers, and CriticsThe Department of Architecture has an extensive program of visitinginstructors, lecturers, and critics who are brought to the school eachyear. The program includes the Pietro Belluschi Distinguished VisitingProfessor in Architectural Design.CareersAlthough most students prepare for professional registration andinternship with practicing architects, others choose careers in allied fieldssuch as construction management, environmental policy development,urban and community planning, architectural programming, and facilitiesmanagement.AccreditationIn the United States, most state registration boards require a degreefrom an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite forlicensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), whichis the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degreeprograms in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the bachelorof architecture, the master of architecture, and the doctor of architecture.Doctor of architecture and master of architecture degree programs mayconsist of a preprofessional undergraduate degree and a professionalgraduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accreditedprofessional education. However, the preprofessional degree is not, byitself, recognized as an accredited degree.At the University of Oregon, both the bachelor of architecture (BArch) andthe master of architecture (MArch) degree programs are accredited byNAAB. The next accreditation review for these programs is 2021.The postprofessional master of science in architecture (MS) degreeprogram and the PhD degree program are not accredited. Admissionto these programs is restricted to applicants who already hold a NAAB-accredited degree or the international equivalent.The Architecture CurriculumThe professional curriculum in architecture has two principal objectives:1.broad inquiry into the integrative nature of environmental design and2.a comprehensive professional education that develops the ability todesign built environments ranging from intimate personal spaces tocities.Curriculum requirements are published in the UO Catalog and in thedepartment’s online curriculum guides, which include sample coursesequences. Grading policies, an explanation of how students’ progressis monitored through the program, and other advising information isavailable through the online Student Handbook. Academic advising isoffered through the College of Design's Student Services and the Schoolof Architecture and Environment’s professional advisor. Students areencouraged to consult their advisor for specific information.The University of Oregon            631Professional CurriculumThe professional curriculum of the bachelor of architecture (BArch)program and the master of architecture (MArch) programs, Track I andTrack II, include required architectural design studios and architecturalsubject courses. In addition, each program's curriculum is supplementedby professional electives.Architectural DesignThe architectural design studio is a social and interactive workplacewhere students work cooperatively with their peers under the guidanceof faculty members with frequent input from practicing architects andexperts as well as representatives of communities served by the studio’sdesign explorations. Through design projects, students learn to respondto complex environmental and cultural contexts through the explorationof architectural form. Introductory studios emphasize creativity, designcommunication skills, and critical thinking fundamental to the designprocess; intermediate studios emphasize integration of architecturalsubjects with design; advanced studios emphasize comprehensiveintegration of these elements. Student performance in all design studiosis graded on a pass/no pass basis and evaluated through final reviews,written evaluations, and exit interviews with faculty members.Design credit may be earned only through participation in design studios.BArch and MArch Track I students are required to complete 64 designstudio credits. MArch Track II students are required to complete 40design studio credits.Architectural SubjectsSubject courses develop theory, knowledge, and skills in architecture andrelated disciplines, with an emphasis on learning architectural subjectsin the context of design. This course work develops design skills andexamines the influences of place, human activity, spatial order, structure,construction, environmental control, professional practice, and history onthe practice of architecture.Residence RequirementsFor transfer students to earn the bachelor of architecture or masterof architecture degree, the following minimum course work must besuccessfully completed in residence:CodeTitleCredits"

Undergraduate studentsshould contact the UO admissions office to learn how withdrawal from theuniversity affects residency status.Departmental PolicyUndergraduate and graduate students may interrupt the course of studyfor various reasons. In order for the department to plan for maximumuse of resources, students must file a leave-of-absence form with thedepartment indicating the expected date of return. Leave-of-absencestatus is renewable. Undergraduates may accumulate up to a total oftwo years of leave; they must file a departmental leave-of-absenceagreement and submit a reenrollment card to the Office of the Registrar.Graduate students may accumulate up to a total of one year of leave;they must file a Graduate School leave-of-absence form, available online,and a departmental agreement, available on the department website. Ifthe limits on accumulated leave are exceeded or the leave-of-absenceterms of agreement are not met, major status may be revoked. Studentswho do not file a leave-of-absence agreement form with the departmentcannot be guaranteed access to design studio courses the year theyreturn.Computer Literacy RequirementIntroductory architecture courses presume knowledge of computeroperations, general-use software, and Internet communications. Studentslacking preparation may draw on resources at the College of DesignTechnology Services, the University Teaching and Learning Center, theLibrary and Learning Commons, or Information Technology services. Bythe end of their first year in the bachelor’s or master’s program, studentsare expected to have achieved basic literacy in computer graphics as anintegrated tool for architectural design—diagramming, two-dimensionaldrawing, image processing, three-dimensional modeling, accurate suncasting, parametric modeling, and presentation methods. Students musthave an awareness of building information modeling, digital fabrication,building performance analysis software, and geographic informationsystems.Students are required to have a high-speed laptop computer and aspecified complement of software.

Applicants must make an appointment with the architecture advisorto discuss their plan of study. Because the department’s first obligation isto its majors, it cannot guarantee availability of courses for minors. Minorsmay register if space is available after the needs of majors have beenmet. Space for enrollment in the minor program is limited.Undergraduate AdmissionInterest in the program exceeds the capacity of the department.Approximately equal numbers of first-year and transfer (includingchange-of-major) applicants are admitted to the first year of the bachelorof architecture program each year. A smaller number of applicantsfrom other NAAB-accredited or recognized programs are admittedas advanced transfer students. Prospective students should reviewapplication requirements posted online during the fall, well beforeapplication deadlines (see Application Deadlines in the Admissionssection of this catalog). January 15 is the deadline for completion of both636         Architecturethe department and university applications. Admission notices for fall termare e-mailed around April 1.Admission to the BArch major program is through a selective review thatfocuses on three attributes: creative potential, academic capability, andpotential for contribution to the program through diversity of background,experience, maturity, or demonstrated motivation. Students are expectedto submit specific materials supporting each of these attributes (academicrecords, essays, recommendations, and a portfolio of creative work).Applicants need not have prior course work in building design, but theyare encouraged to seek a broad foundation in the visual arts (e.g.,drawing, painting, sculpture, graphic design). Experience with crafts andconstruction may also demonstrate evidence of creative potential.Prospective applicants may find information about the programand application requirements on the department website (http://architecture.uoregon.edu).•Master of Architecture (p. 636)•Master of Science (p. 637)•Doctor of Philosophy (p. 638)•Certificate in Ecological Design (p. 639)•Certificate in Technical Teaching in Architecture (p. 639)Graduate StudiesThere are three graduate degree programs in architecture: theprofessional master of architecture (MArch) degree, the postprofessionalmaster of science in architecture (MS) degree, and the doctor ofphilosophy (PhD) degree. Graduate certificate programs (http://architecture.uoregon.edu/programs/certificates) sponsored by thedepartment include ecological design, museum studies, new mediaand culture, Oregon leadership in sustainability, and technical teachingin architecture. Students interested in pursuing a concurrent master'sdegree in interior architecture (http://architecture.uoregon.edu/programs/concurrent) may find information about the combineddegree requirements and application procedures on the Department ofArchitecture website.Students enrolled in the master of science degree program must takea minimum of 45 graduate credits, of which 30 must be in architectureand 9 must be at the 600 level. The PhD degree program consists ofa minimum of 66 graduate-level credits, including at least 50 credits inthe Department of Architecture. These degree programs do not havea graded-credit requirement, although students who enroll for gradedcredits must maintain a 3.00 minimum GPA. Additional requirements foreach program are listed below.Professional Master of Architecture DegreeRequirementsThe professional, NAAB-accredited master of architecture (MArch)degree program prepares students for careers in architectural practiceand careers in allied professions that contribute to shaping the builtenvironment.The department offers two tracks of study, both of which lead to theMArch degree. Track I typically takes ten terms to complete and requires144 credits. Track II is a six-term advanced placement program thatrequires approximately 87 credits (the exact number determined onthe basis of individual evaluation of prior course work at the time ofadmission).Track I students typically complete all or most of the MArch degreeprogram requirements at the University of Oregon, and begin the programthe summer before their first full academic year of study. Students withbachelor’s degrees (BA, BS) other than a preprofessional degree inarchitecture must apply to the Track I program.Students with degrees in related design disciplines (e.g., landscapearchitecture, interior architecture, environmental design, or architecturedegrees from programs at schools that are not accredited) may be givenadvanced standing, up to a maximum of three terms of studio credit forequivalent prior studio work. Track I students may apply to transfer toPortland after completing the introductory design studio sequence inEugene.Track II is for applicants who have a four-year preprofessional degreein architecture from an institution where the four-year degree is part ofa “four plus two” NAAB-accredited degree program. Students admittedinto Track II begin their studies fall term. Applicants who have a four-year preprofessional degree in an environmental design disciplineand an equivalent amount of professional studio and course workmay be considered for Track II. Track II students must fulfill the sameprofessional curriculum requirements as the Track I program, but areadmitted with advanced standing in studio and subject-area courses. Theextent of this advanced standing is determined by the department beforebeginning the program. This preliminary evaluation of course waivers isprovisional, pending satisfactory completion of three terms in residence.MArch Track ICodeTitleCreditsIntroductory Architectural Design Studiosnvironmental Control Systems II4nvironmental Control Systems II4Social sciencecourse4SummerOptional studio in Eugene, Portland, or abroadThird YearFall"

Prospective doctoral students must have earned aprofessional master of architecture degree, a postprofessional graduatedegree in architecture, or a professional degree in architecture and agraduate degree in a related field.Students admitted to the program must already hold either a master’sdegree in architecture from an accredited program or have an accreditedprofessional degree in architecture and a master’s degree in a relatedfield. A current architectural license and design practice may be applied inlieu of a professional degree in architecture; however, a master’s degreein a related field would still be required in this scenario.Prospective applicants may find information about the programand application requirements on the department website (https://archenvironment.uoregon.edu/architecture/apply/phd).Graduate Employee and ResearchAppointmentsA number of graduate employee teaching or research fellowships (GEs)are available to well-qualified graduate students. MS or MArch TrackII applicants with previous education in architecture or an allied fieldare encouraged to apply for GE positions. MArch Track I students aretypically selected in the second or third year of their degree program.Information about the GE application process is available on thedepartment and Graduate School websites.•Certificate in Museum Studies•Certificate in New Media and CultureCertificate in Ecological DesignThe certificate in ecological design is an interdisciplinary program focusedon the development of a practical framework for the integration of thebuilt environment with local and regional natural systems. It is availableto all graduate students within the College of Design. Participatingstudents develop an in-depth understanding of the relationships betweenecological processes, issues of cultural and social sustainability, andurban development and form, as well as how allied design and planningdisciplines approach these relationships.Students must complete a minimum of 24 credits in approved ecologicaldesign subject courses. Of these, 11–12 credits must come from a listof foundation courses; 12–13 additional credits are selected by studentsfrom a list of approved electives. A maximum of 12 credits may becounted for both the certificate and a graduate degree program, butrequired courses for the degree will not satisfy certificate electives.For most architecture and interior architecture students, this certificaterequires 12 credits in addition to their degree requirements. Somestudents may need to complete prerequisites to develop subjectproficiency for approved electives. More information on courserequirements and application to the certificate program may be foundonline, aaa.uoregon.edu/certificates/ecological-design.Certificate in Technical Teaching inArchitectureThe Technical Teaching Certificate program prepares graduate studentsin the fields of architecture and interior architecture for teaching positionson building technology in academic and professional settings. Buildingtechnology includes subjects such as structural design, constructionmaterials and processes, and environmental control systems. Studentsinvestigate curricula, tools, and strategies for teaching and concentrateon improving their comprehensive knowledge of the technical subjects.It is designed for graduate students enrolled in the postprofessionalMS programs in architecture and interior architecture, but graduatestudents in the professional MArch Track I and II programs may apply.Individuals who hold a master’s degree and at least one professionaldegree in architecture or interior architecture may apply to this certificateprogram without being concurrently enrolled in a master’s program at theUniversity of Oregon.Certificate candidates must demonstrate advanced proficiency in at leastone technical subject area (structures, construction, or environmentalcontrol) and have the background necessary to teach at the introductorylevel in the other two. This requirement may be fulfilled by submittinga portfolio documenting professional experience or prior course workto the technology faculty, or it can be met by completing a sequenceof advanced courses. A minimum of 24 credits is required for thecertificate. A maximum of 12 credits may be counted for both thecertificate and a graduate degree program, but required courses for thedegree will not satisfy certificate electives.

The department encourages breadth and interdisciplinaryinvestigation, as well as depth and discipline within media, emphasizingthe development of the material skills and understanding of art-makingprocesses as well as a conceptual and critical understanding of thecontext of art. As actively practicing artists themselves, faculty membersoffer students an introduction to the compelling challenges, questions,and rewards of artistic practice.Three bachelor’s degrees are offered by the department. A four-yearprogram leads to the bachelor of arts (BA) or bachelor of science (BS)degree with a major in art or art and technology. The professionalbaccalaureate degree, the bachelor of fine arts (BFA), requires anadditional fifth year of studio-intensive work. Students major in art,ceramics, art and technology, fibers, metalsmithing and jewelry, painting,photography, printmaking, or sculpture. At the graduate level, the masterof fine arts (MFA) is the terminal professional degree in art.In addition, students may access art studio offerings as nonmajors,provided they complete the appropriate course prerequisites. Thedepartment offers two courses that serve the larger university communityas arts-and-letters group-satisfying courses.Arts and Letters Group CoursesCodeTitleCredits"

withconcentrations in ceramics, digital arts, fibers, metalsmithing and jewelry,painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture.The University of Oregon            657The graduate program seeks to prepare students for serious artisticpractice. The objectives for students are not only to arrive at anaccomplished body of work, but also to develop the practices and critical-thinking skills necessary to develop and sustain the work beyond school.The program focuses on individual studio practice, the cultivation of avisual language, material process, and conceptual approach relevantto each student’s intentions and sensibility. Students are challenged todevise strategies of experimentation and research and to cultivate anability to articulate ideas and critical responses to work. As part of a largercommunity, students are expected to have a significant understanding ofthe historical frameworks and the contemporary discourse of art.The MFA curriculum is designed to provide both interdisciplinarydiscourse and disciplinary depth. MFA students have much of theircourse work in common through classes such as Graduate Critique("

The culturaland theoretical context in which they were developed is addressed, asis the impact of time upon their materials, meanings, and needs. Thetechnologies, interpretations, and means for sustaining the presence ofhistoric places in the future are also emphasized.Students gain an understanding of historic resources and the processesfor their preservation. This includes core courses in research methods,preservation history and theory, architectural history, and the economic,legal, and administrative processes of preservation. Students choosefrom three focal areas:1.sustainable preservation theory, design, and technology2.cultural resource management3.resource identification and evaluationOther focal areas are feasible but must be approved in advance by thesubmission of a curriculum plan by the student by the second term of thestudent’s first year.Courses are augmented by fieldwork in the urban, suburban, andrural areas of the region. Oregon contains Native American sites, ruralbuildings and landscapes developed by U.S. and European immigrantpioneers from the 1830s, as well as urban development since the 1840s.More recent transformations of the landscape by various ethnic groupsand technological innovations are also explored. Extensive instructionaluse of the region takes place through an emphasis on the cultural andtechnical aspects of vernacular resources, field trips, participation inprojects at the university, and through local community groups. Thereis also frequent involvement with the area’s professionals, officials, andagencies concerned with historic resources.Recent opportunities for experience include window restoration andtraditional earth construction workshops, documentation for a HistoricAmerican Buildings Survey for the Alaska Regional Office of the NationalPark Service, U.S. Department of the Interior; a preservation fieldguide for the community of Ebey’s Landing National Historical Reserve;a condition assessment and stabilization of Gilbert’s Cabin in NorthCascades National Park; a condition assessment of Frank Lloyd Wright’sUsonian Gordon House in Silverton, Oregon; the documentation of theFinney House frontier cabin in Nevada City, Montana; the limestoneroof replacement on a late sixteenth-century stone cottage on the islandof Drvenik Veli, Croatia; and the reconstruction of the Ferry Houseporch in Ebey’s Landing National Historical Reserve, Whidbey Island,Washington.In addition to providing hands-on training in what might be consideredmainstream preservation activities, the program emphasizes theimportance of cultural conservation including issues of diversity, identity,and community development. This includes a concern not only for howvarious ethnic groups shaped buildings and landscapes in the distantpast, but how similar settings are reproduced by cultural groups inthe present. Individual research efforts by students are augmented byvisiting lecturers, such as those by Boyd Pratt, Jean Carroon, and GunnyHarboe.Beyond completing core and focal area courses, each student isrequired to complete individualized study, including reading and thesisresearch, a summer internship, and a thesis or terminal project. Someformer students have chosen to develop specialties and concurrentmaster’s degrees in closely related fields such as architecture, landscapearchitecture, and planning, public policy and management; othershave created more unique combinations with studies in museums,economic development, and Russian, East European, and Eurasianstudies. Besides encouraging students to develop an individualizedcourse of study, the program is characterized by students who exhibitself-motivation and individual initiative. These traits, which are notonly expected but are also necessary for successful completion of theprogram, contribute to the professional growth of students. Graduates ofthe Historic Preservation Program are employed in preservation-relatedfields over a wide geographic area. Some choose to pursue work in theprivate sector as specialists in architectural offices or as consultants.Others serve in the public sector with municipal planning departments,state historic preservation offices, or federal cultural resources divisions.Some graduates choose to work with nonprofit agencies, while othersselect careers in preservation and restoration.FacultyChristopher Bell, instructor (historic preservation).

The minor isparticularly well-suited for students studying anthropology, architecture,history, the history of art and architecture, landscape architecture, andplanning, public policy and management. Undergraduate students, nomatter their major, are eligible to enroll in the minor, however.The interdisciplinary minor in historic preservation requires a minimumof 27 credits as described below. The lowest accepted passing gradefor courses used to complete the undergraduate minor in historicpreservation is a C– or better. Some courses required for the minor areonly offered every other year.Minor ProgramCodeTitleCreditsCore Courses"

Applicants are notifiedwhen their applications have been approved. Because the department’sfirst obligation is to its majors, it cannot guarantee availability of coursesfor minors. Minors may register if space is available after the needs ofmajors have been met. Enrollment in the minor program is limited. If thedepartment is unable to accommodate additional minor students, it maysuspend admittance to the minor program until space becomes available.Undergraduate AdmissionGrounded in a unique multidisciplinary structure, the Department ofInterior Architecture offers a comprehensive accredited professionalinterior design curriculum. Students are prepared to act as independentinterior designers; collaborative experiences teach them to be valuableteam members in today’s complex and dynamic design atmosphere.Interest in the program exceeds the capacity of the department.Approximately equal numbers of first-year and transfer (includingchange-of-major) applicants are admitted to the first year of the bachelorof architecture program each year. A smaller number of applicantsfrom other CIDA-accredited or -recognized programs are admitted asadvanced transfer students. Prospective applicants to the BIArch degreeprogram or the minor in interior architecture may find information aboutthe program and application requirements on the department website.•Master of Interior Architecture (p. 685)•Master of Science in Interior Architecture (p. 687)Graduate StudiesThere are two graduate degree programs in interior architecture: theprofessional master of interior architecture (MIArch) degree and thepostprofessional master of science in interior architecture (MS) degree.Students interested in pursuing a concurrent master's degree inarchitecture and interior architecture may find information about thecombined program requirements and application procedures on theDepartment of Architecture website and the department advisinghandbook.Professional Master of Interior ArchitectureDegree RequirementsThe professional, CIDA-accredited master of interior architecture(MIArch) degree program prepares students for careers in interior designpractice and careers in allied professions that contribute to shaping thebuilt environment.The department offers two tracks of study.

Students admitted intoTrack II begin their studies fall term. Track II students must fulfill thesame professional curriculum requirements as those in the TrackI program, but are admitted with advanced standing in studio andsubject-area courses. Transfer credit may be given to students whohave had academic experience in an interior architecture or designprogram accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation, or anarchitecture program accredited by the National Architectural AccreditingBoard (NAAB). The extent of this advanced standing is determined inconsultation with the department academic advisor before beginning theprogram, and the student's advanced standing is reevaluated at intervals.This preliminary evaluation of transfer credit is provisional, pendingsatisfactory completion of three terms in residence.Track II students may receive credit for up to four previously taken designstudios and up to 50 credits of subject-area courses. Students usuallycomplete a minimum of six terms and the approximately 87 credits inresidence.Postprofessional Master of Science DegreeRequirementsThe postprofessional program is for individuals with an undergraduateprofessional degree in architecture or interior architecture. Thisdegree provides an opportunity for advanced study and contribution toknowledge in the field through the thesis. The course of study preparesstudents for careers in research, teaching, consulting, and furthergraduate study. Students also gain a greater understanding of therelationship between the discipline and the profession while workingclosely with faculty mentors helping to guide their individual research.Prospective applicants may find information about the program andapplication requirements on the department website.Graduate AdmissionAdmission to the professional MIArch and postprofessional MSgraduate degree programs is through a selective review that focuseson three attributes: creative capability, academic capability, andpotential contribution to the program through diversity of background,experience, or demonstrated motivation. Applications include a résumé,a biographical statement, a statement of interest in the field of interiorarchitecture, a portfolio of creative work, three letters of recommendation,and official transcripts from all postsecondary educational institutionsattended. Applicants must take the Graduate Record Examinations(GRE) so that the scores, a required component of the application, canbe reported by the application deadline. Applicants whose first languageis not English must also submit scores from the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL) of at least 575 (paper-based) or 90 (Internet-based). Applications must be postmarked by the first Monday afterJanuary 1 for applicants to be considered for admission the subsequentfall term (or summer session for MIArch students).

(1982)The date in parentheses at the end of each entry is the first year on theUniversity of Oregon faculty.•Bachelor of Landscape Architecture•MinorUndergraduate StudiesThe curriculum in landscape architecture leads to a professionaldegree of bachelor of landscape architecture (BLA). The five-yearprogram, accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board,combines general preparation in the arts and sciences with a focus onenvironmental-design studies. The program's goal is to produce a visuallyliterate, technically skilled, ecologically knowledgeable, and sociallyresponsible designer, planner, and graphic artist capable of playing acentral, professional role in the evolving landscape.In recognition of the integrated and comprehensive nature ofenvironmental design and planning, BLA students are encouraged topursue opportunities to collaborate on design and planning problems withstudents in architecture, art, community planning, and other disciplines.Curriculum OptionsThe curriculum is a well-defined, sequential path toward the degree.Electives vary according to the interests, goals, and experience of eachstudent and are chosen with the help of faculty advisors. Departmentalelectives reflect the need to provide a variety of environmental subjectsand to introduce the rapidly expanding number of career areas in theprofession. Program objectives provide a solid base of essential skills,tools, and knowledge in landscape design and planning. Programflexibility allows each student to emphasize such topics as ecologicalrestoration and design, sustainable cities and land systems, social justice,landscape aesthetics, natural resource analysis and planning, landconservation and development, urban design, restoration of waterways,renewal of agricultural lands, private and public agency professionalpractice, environmental impact assessment, landscape history andpreservation, and environmental design research methods.The undergraduate program balances exposure to the many facetsof landscape architecture with the expectation that growth andspecialization will occur at the graduate level and in professionalapprentice and internship programs.Curriculum StructureThe undergraduate curriculum consists of the following interrelated areas:•Design and planning•Subjects•ElectivesDesign and PlanningStudio courses focus on the development and communication ofsolutions to site, neighborhood, city, transportation, watershed, andregional environmental and social problems. Students work closelywith an instructor to analyze and create specific landscape design andplanning proposals. This area addresses the physical-spatial implicationsof planning and management policies, client needs, and programs.Tutorial studio work is the integrative heart of the curriculum. Thedepartment allocates substantial faculty resources to project-orientedinstruction and has a long history of success at design studio education.Regular faculty members offer or consult in studios and participate inthe midterms and weeklong end-of-term reviews of student work. Studioprojects typically increase in scale and complexity over the course of thedegree program. Students must take eight studios in this subject area.SubjectsSix subject areas are essential foundations for the planning anddesign program: landscape architecture technologies and professionalpractice, plant materials, landscape analysis and planning, the historyand theory of landscape architecture, urban design, and landscapearchitectural media. Required course work in history, theory, media, andtechnologies includes alternative choices to allow each student to tailoran individualized educational program with the help of an advisor.Six subject areas provide essential foundations for the design andplanning program: landscape architecture technology and professionalpractice; plant materials; landscape analysis and planning; history andtheory of landscape architecture; media; and landscape media andtechnologies workshops. Required course work in history, literature, andtheory and in media and technologies includes choices that allow eachstudent to tailor an individual educational program with the help of anadvisor.ElectivesThis area, which includes general university requirements, providesfor personal choice in selecting additional course work in landscapeThe University of Oregon            691architecture, architecture, art, planning, and more generally in arts andletters, social science, and science.PreparationStudents planning to major in landscape architecture should prepare bybeginning studies in the following areas:Environmental AwarenessCourses in ecology, biology, botany, geology, environmental science,and geography help begin the process of understanding the complexinterrelationships and interdependencies of people and the environment.Human BehaviorCourses in art history, anthropology, sociology, history, government,psychology, political science, cultural geography, and related subjectshelp explain human needs, values, attitudes, and activities and are usefulin preparing for the design of physical places.Visual Language SkillsCourses in drawing, painting, photography, film, design, art history, andrelated subjects help develop perceptual skills, cultural understanding,and the ability to explore and communicate ideas graphically.Bachelor of Landscape ArchitectureRequirementsRequirements for the BLA degree (including university requirements) total220 credits.

At the master’s level, the departmentmakes a distinction between first professional master’s students andpostprofessional master’s students. First professional master’s studentshold an undergraduate degree other than an accredited bachelor oflandscape architecture (BLA, BALA, or BSLA) and are working towardthe master of landscape architecture (MLA). Postprofessional master’sstudents hold an accredited bachelor of landscape architecture and areworking toward the completion of the advanced postprofessional MLAdegree. Students with an accredited bachelor or architecture (BArch) orother accredited professional environmental design degree often earn apostprofessional MLA with some additional requirements, or they mayopt to earn a first professional MLA degree with waivers of some courserequirements, decided on a case-by-case basis.Students may enroll in joint MLA degree programs with the master ofarchitecture (MArch) and master of community and regional planning(MCRP) programs with integrated and coordinated degree requirements.Arrangements may be made through academic advisors in the twodepartments.First Professional Master’s ProgramAlthough requirements and time to degree may vary with each student,the following options represent typical situations:Students with a Bachelor of Science inLandscape ArchitectureStudents entering with a four-year or nonaccredited degree in landscapearchitecture spend two to three years completing the first professionalMLA. The first year focuses on course work required for the degree. Thesecond year focuses on completing electives related to the master’sproject and the project or thesis itself.Students with Other DegreesStudents who have no background in landscape design and planningcan expect to spend a minimum of ten terms earning an accredited, firstprofessional MLA.The department recognizes that first professional master’s candidateshave extremely varied backgrounds and may have special requirements.Based on undergraduate courses, background in design-relateddisciplines, and work experience, these students may be exempt from alimited number of requirements. Students who want to replace or waiverequirements must show equivalent competency in those areas, typicallythrough course work or professional experience.Program Components of the FirstProfessional MLADesign and PlanningStudio courses focus on the development and communication ofsolutions to site, neighborhood, city, transportation, watershed, andregional environmental and social problems. Students work closelywith an instructor to analyze and create specific landscape design andplanning proposals. This area addresses the physical-spatial implicationsof planning and management policies, client needs, and programs.Tutorial studio work is the integrative heart of the curriculum. Thedepartment allocates substantial faculty resources to project-orientedinstruction and has a long history of design studio education. Regularfaculty members offer or consult in studios and participate in themidterms and weeklong end-of-term reviews of student work. Studioprojects typically increase in scale and complexity over the course of thedegree program. Students must take eight studios in this subject area.Subject CoursesSix subject areas provide essential foundations for the planning anddesign program: landscape architecture technology and professionalpractice; plant materials; landscape analysis and planning; history andtheory of landscape architecture; media; and landscape media andtechnologies workshops. Required course work in history, literature, andtheory and in media and technologies includes choices that allow eachThe University of Oregon            695student to tailor an individual educational program with the help of anadvisor.Research and Master’s ProjectStudents take two courses in research methods and project developmentand one mentored research development course. A faculty memberserves as a project chair. The MLA project is completed during thethird year for first-professional master's candidates during a two-termmaster's clinic studio. This independent project of high academicstandard presents original work that contributes to the body of knowledgein landscape architecture and/or demonstrates an advanced capacityto solve design and planning problems through critical inquiry andstrong problem-solving analysis. The topic may be selected from arange of theoretical to practical design issues. Projects must include awritten component, which sets out the problem, goals and objectives,methodology, findings, and conclusions of the project.Area of ConcentrationStudents take elective courses from any department at the university,selected with their advisors, to develop specialized knowledge and skillstypically related to the topic of their master’s project or thesis.The area of concentration courses represent a focused inquiry inadvanced topics that master’s students undertake while forming anddeveloping their master’s projects. When students begin the MLAprogram, they should consult their departmental advisor to begin planningtheir area of concentration course work and receive approval for courseselection. At the time when a student is assigned a master’s projectadvisor, responsibility for course approval shifts to this person. Atany time students may consult with other members of departmentalfaculty they feel could help them craft their area of concentration. To beapproved, an area of concentration must be graduate-level (a 500 or600 course number) and must be demonstrably related to the student'smaster's project topic and supportive of the project’s development.

The master's project or thesis and itsprerequisite master's research course sequence must also be completedfor a minimum of 22 credits.A central aspect of the postprofessional MLA program is the student’sconcentration on studies and original work in a focused area of landscapearchitecture such as design theory, landscape ecology, landscapehistory, urban design, and landscape planning. These areas are broadenough to include many particular research problems for master’sprojects and professional practice. While these concentration areas arenaturally related, each involves a different set of skills and understandingdeveloped through departmental courses and focused elective coursework outside the department. The five concentration areas describedbelow are those in which faculty members, due to their academictraining and professional and research experience, are best equipped forcollaboration with graduate students.Research and Master’s ProjectStudents take two courses in research methods and project developmentand one mentored research development course. A faculty memberserves as a project chair. The MLA project is completed during thesecond year for postprofessional master's candidates during a two-term master's clinic studio. This independent project of high academicstandard presents original work that contributes to the body of knowledgein landscape architecture and/or demonstrates an advanced capacityto solve design and planning problems through critical inquiry andstrong problem-solving analysis. The topic may be selected from arange of theoretical to practical design issues. Projects must include awritten component, which sets out the problem, goals and objectives,methodology, findings, and conclusions of the project.Area of ConcentrationThe area of concentration courses represent a focused inquiry inadvanced topics that master’s students undertake while forming anddeveloping their master’s projects. When students begin the MLAprogram, they should consult their departmental advisor to begin planningtheir area of concentration course work and receive approval for courseselection. At the time when a student is assigned a master’s projectadvisor, responsibility for course approval shifts to this person. Atany time students may consult with other members of departmentalfaculty they feel could help them craft their area of concentration. To beapproved, an area of concentration must be graduate-level (a 500 or600 course number) and must be demonstrably related to the student'smaster's project topic and supportive of the project’s development.

Entering students are urgedto satisfy this requirement before enrolling in the program.Students may file petitions to transfer up to 15 graduate credits takenprior to admission to the planning program. Such petitions must besubmitted during the first term in the program.712         Planning, Public Policy and ManagementJuniors and seniors who anticipate applying for admission areencouraged to seek advice at the department office.CareersGraduates with an MCRP degree find employment in public, private, andnonprofit sectors. In the public sector, three kinds of agencies providecareer opportunities: local land-use and zoning agencies; agencies forhousing, social services, community renewal, parks, transportation, andother community facilities; and agencies for economic developmentand natural resource management. In the private sector, graduates aretypically employed by consulting planners, private developers, and otherfirms requiring research and analysis skills. Graduates are also employedby such nonprofit organizations as environmental and advocacy groups,community development organizations, and research firms.Application ProceduresImportance is placed on the student’s preference for and ability toundertake self-directed educational activity.Because there are more than sixty-five accredited graduate programs inplanning in the United States, the department’s admissions committeeemphasizes the selection of candidates who present clear and specificreasons for choosing to pursue their graduate work in planning at theUniversity of Oregon.Application Materials1.Graduate Admission Application, available online—follow theinstructions on the department’s website2.A résumé3.A statement, prepared by the applicant, explaining why admissionto the UO planning program is sought and what the applicant’sexpectations are from the field4.At least three letters of recommendation from people familiar with theapplicant’s ability to pursue graduate-level studies in planning5.Transcripts from all the colleges and universities attended, includingevidence of completion of an undergraduate degree from anaccredited college or university6.Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores are optional.

Projects have received numerous state andnational awards.Nonprofit ManagementThe master of nonprofit management (MNM) is a professional degreedesigned to train students to lead nonprofit organizations. Due to thegrowth of the nonprofit sector over the past three decades in the US andthe growth of nongovernmental organizations internationally, the sectorhas professionalized. People currently working in the nonprofit sectorand others seeking to switch to or enter the nonprofit sector now seekmaster’s-level training to advance their careers, specializing specifically inthe administration of nonprofit organizations.Critical skills for nonprofit administration are common to all nonprofitfields, including handling financial management challenges and tax-exempt reporting structures, raising funds from individual donors andinstitutions, and managing a mission-oriented workforce.Unique Aspects of the ProgramThe program melds relevant best-practice elements from the businessand government sectors with the management imperatives of thenonprofit and philanthropic sectors. Woven into the course work areopportunities to obtain practical experience at nonprofit organizations, sothat participants in the program have significant administrative experienceupon graduating. Examples include the review and consultation portion ofthe Fundraising for Nonprofit Organizations ()—in which students consult on a topical issue for alocal government or nonprofit agency in Oregon.Students interested in a career in nonprofits can earn a certificatein nonprofit management concurrently with their master of publicadministration. The certificate program offers innovative courses includingone on board governance, in which students serve on a nonprofit board,and another on philanthropy, in which students award a $15,000 grantto a local agency. As an alternate, students may complete both the MPAand MNM degrees concurrently.

More options for course work may befound online (https://pppm.uoregon.edu/grad/master-of-nonprofit-management).Public AdministrationThe master of public administration (MPA) is a two-year program forpeople interested in public service careers that address the critical social,economic, and environmental issues of our time. The curriculum isdesigned to provide a combination of academic theory, analytic skills, andreal-world applications so that students become effective and creativeleaders in public service.A central focus of the program is to prepare students to becomeevidence-based policymakers, analysts, and managers. Evidence-based policymaking—the idea that the formulation of policy and itsimplementation should be based on evidence of effectiveness—hasgained widespread acceptance in the policy community, both in theUnited States and abroad, and requires a closer connection betweenresearch and practice. It requires that researchers ask policy-relevantquestions and conduct meaningful and timely analyses that supportthe decision-making process; conversely, it requires that policymakers,managers, and leaders think critically about research and integrateappropriate evidence in the implementation and formulation of policy andpractice.Recent graduates work as advisors, policy analysts, and strategicplanners in all levels of government, in Oregon, throughout the US,and around the globe. Their work addresses the full range of socialissues, from improving health-care access, increasing governmentefficiency, and responsiveness to creating new governmental structuresin developing democracies. Graduates also work in a broad range ofnonprofit organizations, for instance, as executive staff members in socialservice, arts, and environmental organizations.The State of Oregon is an exciting place to study public administration.As a "laboratory of democracy," it has a long and distinguished recordof policy innovation. Most recently, Oregon has been on the forefront ofadvances in land-use, health-care, and environmental policy.Unique Aspects of the ProgramThe size of the program means that master's students at the University ofOregon receive a tremendous amount of individual attention, particularlyin the second year when they conduct a team-based policy researchproject. The close, collegial working relationships between students andinstructors means that faculty members are often able to help studentsattain relevant alumni contacts, internships, and job opportunities.Since the department also houses a master’s degree programin community and regional planning (MCRP), master of publicadministration students benefit from additional faculty and planning-related course offerings. In particular, students are invited in their firstyear to enroll in a two-term, field-based course—Community PlanningWorkshop (ocial Enterprise"

A list of potential courses for each field of interest isavailable on the department’s website. Students who would like todevelop their own field of interest are able to do so in consultationwith a faculty advisor. Recent graduates have created customizedfields of interest in food sufficiency, health policy, and internationaldevelopment.3Completing an internship (3 credits) is highly recommended for allMPA students, and required for those with fewer than two years ofrelevant professional experience.The master of public administration (MPA) program provides studentswith two key opportunities to synthesize classroom learning and applytheir research skills to current policy and management issues. At thestart of the second year, students engage in a policy project intended tosimulate the real-world environment where analysts and managers aregiven short time frames to research a topic that they know little or nothingabout. Over forty-eight hours, students read relevant policy and researchdocuments, write a memo detailing the evidence base and key issues,and give an oral presentation. The project takes place the week beforefall courses begin, and incoming first-year students have the opportunityto view the presentations as part of their orientation to the program. Thiscomponent of the curriculum is a signature event and rite of passageeach fall.Students also enroll in a two-term project sequence that serves asthe synthesizing capstone of the curriculum. Over winter and springterms of the second year of study, students work on real-world orsimulated real-world projects that require conducting in-depth needsassessments, evaluations, cost-benefit analyses, or other appliedresearch. A faculty member works closely with student groups on theseprojects over the two terms. Past projects have included a survey fora state commission to gauge attitudes among key shareholders onpotential policy change, an analysis of administrative data on the impactof a postpolicy implementation on Oregonians, and an examination ofthree potential communities for a nonprofit’s expansion.Graduate Certificate in NonprofitManagementThe graduate certificate in nonprofit management prepares studentsfor leadership in the nonprofit sector. The focused curriculum developsspecific skills that are critical for success in managing nonprofitorganizations.Phenomenal growth in assets and activities of the nonprofit sector overthe past two decades have led to career opportunities in the manyareas of the nonprofit sector, including cultural and arts organizations,education, health care, human services, international development,and advocacy organizations. Nonprofit enterprise has broadened withdeveloping sources of funding, and the complexities of its managementrequire professional skills specific to the nonprofit sector.Nonprofit Management Graduate CertificateRequirementsCodeTitleCreditsCore Courses.

W. Kamphaus, Dean541-346-1601130 HEDCO Education Building1215 University of OregonEugene, Oregon 97403-1215Preparing Educators in the 21st CenturyThe College of Education’s academic majors are organized into fourdepartments: counseling psychology and human services; educationalmethodology, policy, and leadership; education studies; and specialeducation and clinical sciences.The college offers undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral degreesand preparation for licensure, programs that link instruction to currentresearch findings and pedagogical practices and to the needs of theeducational community, ensuring students are prepared for collaborativepractice in the field of education. Students become active learners asthey accumulate an understanding of disciplinary content and developprofessional knowledge and skills that prepare them for careers ineducation or the social services. Surveys of graduates from the Collegeof Education indicate that the overwhelming majority are successful insecuring employment or continuing their professional preparation in theirchosen field.With school, community, and clinical partners, the college’s nationallyprominent teaching and research faculty offers opportunities for studentpracticum and field-based experiences in professional settings whereeffective policy and practice is created and then implemented.Academic, research, and outreach service units provide integrated andcross-disciplinary learning experiences that help students acclimateto their professions, develop initial competence, acquire advancedproficiency, and become practicing professionals and scholars.The College of Education is ranked by US News and World Report asone of the nation’s top colleges of education (14th nationally in the 2018rankings). Its scholarship, teaching, and practical learning opportunitiesoffer students a respectful and affirming climate, a culture of belonging,and an inclusive learning environment.AdmissionThe College of Education follows university policy in its admissionprocedures as described in the Admissions and Graduate Schoolsections of this catalog. Students who transfer from other institutionsmust meet university entrance requirements. Programs in the Collegeof Education have additional requirements for admission and limits onthe number of students admitted to the major or licensure programs.Prospective students are urged to check admission requirements for theirdesired programs. Some require field placements in community settingsand require background checks as part of the admissions process.Financial AssistanceScholarshipsScholarships are available for undergraduate and graduate students.Application requirements and procedures may be requested fromAndrea Olson, Office of the Dean; telephone 541-346-5943; e-mailcoescholarships@uoregon.edu.Stipends and FellowshipsStipends and fellowships frequently are awarded to graduate students.Both forms of assistance may cover most of the cost of tuition andprovide a monthly cash payment. Information on graduate employeepositions is available on the college website.Information about financial assistance is listed in the application materialsfor each major and on the College of Education’s website. Applicationdeadlines should be followed to receive consideration for aid. Informationabout university scholarships and loan programs is available from theOffice of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships, 260 Oregon Hall.DismissalSome majors and specializations in the College of Education require fieldplacements in community settings such as public schools, communitypreschools, mental health clinics, correctional institutions, and welfareprograms. Many placements are with vulnerable groups such asyoung children, juvenile offenders, or individuals with disabilitiesor mental health, adjustment, or learning problems. During theseplacements students interact with professionals and often are recipientsof confidential or sensitive information. Consequently, it is imperativethat College of Education students adhere to high ethical and moralstandards. The University of Oregon and each major in the Collegeof Education has written ethical standards or a code of conduct for itsstudents. In an instance where evidence exists that a student may haveviolated the university’s conduct code or a program’s written ethicalstandards or code of conduct, the student will immediately be removedfrom the field placement until the matter is resolved. A student found tobe in violation may be terminated from the College of Education and notpermitted to reenter.Academic ProgramsAssociate Dean130 HEDCO Education BuildingThe College of Education offers accredited bachelor’s, master’s, anddoctoral degrees and professional-development programs. Often, inconcert with an academic degree, majors offer programs leading to statelicensure for employment in Oregon public schools. These licenses areconferred by the state Teacher Standards and Practices Commission(TSPC), the agency authorized by the Oregon Legislative Assemblyto issue licenses for teaching, personnel service, or administration inpublic schools. The TSPC issues appropriate licenses to applicants uponthe university’s recommendation that they have successfully completedthe relevant licensure program. The State of Oregon has reciprocaladministrative, teaching, and personnel service license agreements withmost other states and Puerto Rico. Students who receive a license fromthe State of Oregon will most likely find the application process for alicense in another state easier, especially if the licensing standards aresimilar. Information about licensure is available from the college’s studentacademic services.The following list enumerates the degree, licensure, and endorsementprograms offered by the College of Education.

However, the certificate may be of particular interest tothe journalism school’s graduate students.The certificate program is designed to provide students with the abilityto apply and teach both theoretical and applied ethical decision-makingstrategies covering a variety of media—from print and broadcastjournalism to advertising and public relations, including both messageconstruction and the multiple delivery systems associated with themodern mass media (print, broadcast, electronic, and digital).Students should be able to fulfill the program requirements within atwo-year period, normally in conjunction with their primary graduateemphasis.Communication Ethics Graduate CertificateRequirementsCodeTitleCreditsJ 644Philosophy of Communication4Select three of the following: 112J 512Issues in Communication Studies: [Topic]J 596Communication Ethics and Law: [Topic]J 646Political Economy of CommunicationJ 648Cultural Approaches to CommunicationJ 649International CommunicationApproved courses in other departments 28Other journalism or outside courses 3,44Total Credits281Students, particularly at the doctoral level, are encouraged to makethe 600-level courses a priority. The following list represents coursesthat have been identified as having a strong or exclusive focus incommunication ethics, including topics highly relevant to ethics study.•Issues in Communication Studies: [Topic] (J 512) (Communication andDemocracy)•Communication Ethics and Law: [Topic] (J 596) (Ethics of StrategicCommunication; Persuasion and Ethics; Photo Fiction; Visual Truth)•Political Economy of Communication (J 646)•Cultural Approaches to Communication (J 648)•International Communication (J 649)2Approved courses are decided in consultation with the student’scertificate advisor and are based on relevance to the particularinterest area of the student (e.g., political communication,environmental communication, philosophy). The advisor consults withthe course instructor before approving a course. Ultimately, programcoherence is gained through the core offerings in the school, but maybe greatly enhanced through careful choices of outside course work.In most cases, courses in the philosophy department are encouragedas outside choices.3No more than 4 credits of Reading and Conference: [Topic] (J 605)may be applied to the certificate.4All students pursuing the communication ethics certificate (exceptPhD students in journalism) must take Mass Communication andSociety (J 611). However, it does not count toward the 28 creditsrequired for the graduate certificate.Additional RequirementCourse work must be taken for letter grades.The required journalism courses from which students select twocourses are generally taught at least once a year. Substitutions mayoccur if courses are not available. Other, relevant courses may alsobe substituted for courses on this list as they are developed or areconsidered germane to an individual student’s program.ApplicationApplication for granting of the certificate must be made to the GraduateSchool before graduation. For details, contact a staff member in thejournalism school Graduate Programs office.Application to the certificate program should be made in writing to thejournalism school graduate director.

Hulteng Chair inMedia Ethics and Responsibility, 541-346-3740, tbivins@uoregon.edu.JournalismThe University of Oregon undergraduate program is based on thepremise that the best professional communicator is broadly educated.In accordance with national accrediting standards, students musttake at least 104 credits in courses outside the School of Journalismand Communication. A maximum of 76 credits in the 180-creditundergraduate program may be in journalism and communicationcourses. Students learn about media practice and effects. Theystudy the role of the media in society, the history of journalism, visualcommunication, the ethics of media practices, the economics of themedia, new media technologies, international communication, diversity inthe media, and the legal and social responsibilities of the media.In addition, undergraduates take a two-term series of courses calledGateway to Media that immerses them in the fundamentals of digitalstorytelling, including multimedia story development and delivery acrosstraditional, digital, and social platforms. The intent of this series ofcourses is to develop basic literacies and competencies for students whoengage in collaborative media projects.Majors are encouraged to consider a second major or a minor in a fieldrelated to their career goals. Preparation in a second field is a valuableaddition to a student’s education and enhances employability.Many students are active in campus affairs, working for the campusnewspaper; the university’s radio station; the student-run advertising,design, video, and public relations agencies; the award-winning Flux andEthos magazines; television and online programs; and alternative andonline publications, including OR Magazine, the first student-producediPad publication. The school also encourages them to participate in UOchapters of Ed on Campus, Ad Society, National Broadcasting Society,National Press Photographers Association, Public Relations StudentSociety of America, Society of Professional Journalists, and such nationalvenues as the One Club for Art and Copy. Internships are encouragedand available at newspapers, magazines, broadcast stations, advertisingagencies, public relations offices, nonprofit organizations, governmentoffices, video production firms, online publications, and public policyoffices.The best preparation for journalism majors is a broad college-preparatoryprogram with emphasis on language skills, English literature, economics,history, and the political and social sciences. Prospective students alsobenefit from the study of mathematics, statistics, computer applications,and second languages.Community college students planning to transfer to the School ofJournalism and Communication should concentrate on college-transfercourses, especially in literature, economics, and history, that fulfilluniversity requirements and the school’s general-studies requirements.Almost all professional courses are taken at the School of Journalismand Communication. Advising material is available to community collegestudents online.•Bachelor of Arts•Bachelor of ScienceUndergraduate StudiesThe role of the school’s undergraduate program is to provide studentswith the creative, critical, and problem-solving skills they need to becomeethical, professional communicators and critical media consumers.Premajor AdmissionNew students planning to major in journalism enter the university aspremajors and do not need to meet special admission requirementsbeyond the general university requirements.Each premajor is assigned to a journalism and communication advisorwho assists in planning programs, answering questions, and trackingprogress toward admission as a major and toward graduation.

The Department of Dance emphasizes allthree areas of growth, a commitment made possible by the breadth of itscurricular offerings and the depth of faculty expertise.Facility with oral and written communication is one goal of a liberal artseducation. Therefore, dance majors pursue a course of study to acquire afirm intellectual grasp of the theoretical, historical, and creative forces thatshape dance as an art form.Dance, unique in that it is also a physical form of communication, requirescontinual experience in its technical foundations. Students are expectedand encouraged to experience a variety of forms of dance training andidioms. Production and pedagogy are also integral to the undergraduatecore, because many students find careers in theater and teaching.Goals for the Undergraduate Dance Major1.Explore the field of dance from a liberal arts perspective2.Explore disciplined technique and creative processes involved in theartistry of dance3.Formulate an intellectual understanding of the historical,philosophical, and culturally significant aspects of dance4.Develop a working knowledge of music and science as they relate toand enhance the dance experience5.Develop an understanding of dance as a unique art form inconjunction with its relationship to other art forms and disciplines6.Develop a level of competence in performance, creative, andtheoretical aspects of dance to pursue graduate studies or otherprofessional goalsPreparationHigh school students planning to major in dance should includepreparation in music, drama, art, and dance, especially modern dance.Students transferring to the UO as dance majors after two years ofcollege work elsewhere should have completed two terms of college-level English composition, as many of the university’s general-educationrequirements as possible, and training in modern dance.The University of Oregon            855CareersCareer opportunities include performing in regional dance companiesand teaching in universities, colleges, community colleges, communitycenters, fitness centers, and private studios.

JC 610,"). The student must be a matriculated UO graduatestudent in an advanced degree program and registered for UO coursesduring the same term the Joint Campus Experimental Course: [Topic]() course is taken. A maximum of 15 credits taken under the jointcampus program may be applied toward a graduate degree program.Joint campus course work counts toward the 24 graded credits requiredfor the master’s degree. Forms are available in the Office of the Registrar.WICHE Regional Graduate ProgramsThe Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE)coordinates a graduate exchange program, the Western RegionalGraduate Program (WRGP), to enable students from Alaska, Arizona,California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyomingto apply for admission to selected professional programs and, if admitted,to be treated as resident students for tuition purposes.The University of Oregon has two WRGP programs: historic preservationand human physiology. For information, visit hp.uoregon.edu.WGRP certification must be renewed each academic year.Grade RequirementsGraduate students must maintain at least a 3.00 grade point average(GPA) in graduate courses taken in the degree program. Grades of D+or less for graduate courses are not accepted for graduate credit but arecomputed in the GPA. Similarly, the grade of N (no pass) is not acceptedfor graduate credit. A grade of pass (P) must be equal to or better than aB–.A GPA below 3.00 at any time during a graduate student’s studies or theaccumulation of more than 5 credits of N or F grades—regardless of theGPA—is considered unsatisfactory. The dean of the Graduate School,after consultation with the student’s home department, may drop thestudent from the Graduate School, thus terminating the student’s degreeprogram.Other Graduate ClassificationsA student not seeking a graduate degree may be classified as a graduatestudent doing graduate-level work as follows:•postbaccalaureate graduate•premaster’s•postmaster’s•postdoctoral•nonadmitted Community Education Program participantCredits earned in these classifications are recorded on the student’stranscript.Up to 15 graduate credits earned under one or more of the aboveclassifications may later be counted in a master’s degree program ifendorsed by the school or department and approved by the GraduateSchool. Students must submit a Request for Transfer of GraduateCredit form which is available on the Graduate School website. Thesecredits fall within the 15-credit maximum of transfer credit allowed fora master’s degree program. Approved credits may be used to meetrelevant university degree requirements.IncompletesFor graduate students, there are two sets of policies regardingincompletes on the student record—the first is departmental, the secondinvolves the Graduate School. Graduate students should become familiarwith both sets of policies.Graduate School policy requires that graduate students must converta graduate course grade of Incomplete ("I") into a passing grade withinone calendar year of the term the course was taken. After one year,the student must petition the Graduate School for the removal of theincomplete.To be eligible for Graduate School approval on a Petition to Remove anIncomplete, all of the following criteria must be met:•The incomplete must be no more than seven years old•The student must have the approval of the instructor to complete theoutstanding course requirements•The student must not have completed a terminal advanced degreesince the term of enrollment in the course. Incompletes that remainon the academic record after a degree has been awarded may not beremoved. All course work documented on the transcript at the time ofthe awarding of the degree stands as a permanent record and it is notpermissible to revise the recordAn incomplete "I" assigned to Thesis (503), Research (601), Dissertation(603), and Terminal Project (609) does not require a petition. Thesis anddissertation credits are automatically converted upon awarding of thedegree when the thesis or dissertation is completed and accepted bythe Graduate School. Research and terminal project credits require theinstructor to submit a Supplementary Grade Report to the Office of theRegistrar.This policy applies to the level of the course and not to the level of thestudent. An undergraduate in a graduate-level course will be evaluatedunder Graduate School policy. A graduate student in an undergraduatelevel course will follow policies in effect for undergraduate students.Continuous EnrollmentUnless leave status has been approved, a student in an advanceddegree or graduate certificate program must remain in continuousenrollment at the university, taking at least 3 graduate credits each term,until all the program’s requirements have been completed. Registrationfor summer session is not required unless the student is using university942         Graduate Schoolfacilities or faculty or staff services. Failure to maintain continuousenrollment effectively withdraws the student from graduate status. SeePermission to Reregister (p. 942).On-Leave StatusA graduate student interrupting a study program for one or more terms,excluding summer session, must register for on-leave status to ensure aplace upon return. Only graduate students in good standing are eligiblefor on-leave status.The Graduate School must receive the application by the last registrationday—as noted in the class schedule—of the term the leave begins.Leave status is granted for a specified period excluding summer session.Students with approved leave status need not pay fees. However,students must register and pay fees if they use university facilities orfaculty or staff services during the on-leave term.Master's StudentsMaster’s students, except summer-only students, may apply for amaximum of three academic terms of on-leave status during the courseof study for the degree. A master's student who attends the universityonly during summer session must obtain on-leave status for each ensuingschool year. These summer students also must complete all degreerequirements within the seven-year time limit.Doctoral StudentsDoctoral students may apply for a maximum of six academic terms of on-leave status during the course of study for the degree. See ContinuousEnrollment (p. 947) under Doctoral Degrees.Additional details about on-leave status and how to apply are available onthe Graduate School website.Permission to ReregisterA graduate student who fails to maintain continuous enrollment orobtain on-leave status is required to file a Permission to Reregister formand petition for reinstatement (using the General Petition form). Bothforms are available on the Graduate School website. The petition isreviewed by the student’s major department and the Graduate School.The student may, at the discretion of the department, be required to meetdepartmental admission policies and degree completion requirementsthat are in effect on the date of reenrollment. Doctoral students may, atthe discretion of the department, be required to register for a new yearof residency—three consecutive terms of at least 9 graduate creditsin each term. They may also be required to retake the comprehensiveexaminations if completed prior to stopping out, if the department feelsthat this is necessary in order to demonstrate currency of knowledge.Review of the Permission to Reregister form may result in a changeof residency status from resident to nonresident. More information isavailable from the residency officer in the Office of Admissions.Graduate ResidencyEach graduate degree at the University of Oregon has a residencyrequirement that dictates how much of the work required for that degreemust be completed at the University of Oregon. Please refer to theMaster's Degrees and Doctoral Degrees sections below for detailsabout residency requirements for each type of degree.Waiver of RegulationsGraduate students may file a petition requesting exemption from anyacademic requirement. The petition must first be submitted to theacademic department for review and supporting statement. The GraduateSchool then reviews the educational purpose the regulation in questionwas designed to serve. Petitions are seldom granted if the only reasongiven is to save the student from inconvenience or expense.Graduate School petition forms are available on the Graduate School’swebsite.Graduate Tuition, Fees, and Financial AidTuition and FeesThe University of Oregon has differential graduate tuition. Please referto the Office of the Registrar’s website for the current tuition and feesschedule: http://registrar.uoregon.edu/costs/tuition-fees.Fellowships and Financial AidOne purpose of scholarship and fellowship support provided by the UOGraduate School is to enhance the diversity of the graduate studentpopulation by seeking talented students from groups historicallyunderrepresented in graduate education. Broadening the talent poolfrom which graduate students are chosen enriches the educational andscholarly activities of all students and faculty members and is goodacademic practice. By bringing diverse individuals together to engage inintellectual activities, graduate programs engender respect for intellect,regardless of source, and help to build a community whose members arejudged by the quality of their ideas.At the University of Oregon, financial aid is available through graduateemployee (GE) opportunities and research fellowships, training grantstipends, scholarships, work-study, loans, and part-time jobs. GEs areavailable to qualified graduate students who are enrolled in the GraduateSchool and who have been admitted to an advanced degree program.Inquire at the department for specific application deadlines. Fellowshipawards are based on the student’s potential as a graduate student. AllGEs—research, teaching, and administrative—are represented by theGraduate Teaching Fellows Federation (GTFF), American Federationof Teachers, Local 3544. Recruitment and selection follow establishedpublished procedures from departments and the provisions of the GTFFcontract. Details of appointment procedures are available from thedepartments. Reappointment is subject to departmental policy but isalways contingent upon making satisfactory progress toward the degree.Teaching FellowshipsNearly all the schools and departments award graduate employee (GE)opportunities. For 2015–16, minimum-level salaries at 0.49 full-timeequivalent (FTE) range from $13,455 to $16,048 for the academic year.The minimum appointment is a 0.20 FTE position. Graduate employees(GEs) must be enrolled in an advanced degree program and mustregister for and complete a minimum of 9 graduate credits toward thedegree each term. Credits earned in audited courses do not count.Tuition for up to 16 credits a term, a health insurance premium subsidy,and mandatory fees subsidy are provided by the university. Failure toenroll for and complete the minimum of 9 credits a term may nullify anappointment.The University of Oregon            943Nonnative speakers of English who accept teaching-related GE positionsmust demonstrate appropriate English language proficiency. See"Language Requirement for International Graduate Employees" above.Research FellowshipsA number of departments and schools employ graduate students to workon research projects under the supervision of faculty members. Fundstypically come from research grants and contracts. Salaries and tuitionpolicy are the same as for graduate students with teaching fellowships. Inaddition, some departments have federally supported training grants andconsider fellowship applicants for support through these resources.Fellowships from Other SourcesGraduate students may be eligible for fellowship awards granted byfederal agencies and private foundations. Information on internal andexternal funding opportunities is available on the Graduate Schoolwebsite.Postdoctoral FellowshipsThe University of Oregon participates in several postdoctoral fellowshipprograms and provides facilities for postdoctoral study under facultysupervision. More information is available from individual schools anddepartments.Other Financial AssistanceSome forms of financial aid depend on financial need, defined as thedifference between the cost of attending an institution and the amountthe student and his or her family can contribute toward these expenses.See the Student Financial Aid and Scholarships (p. 22) section of thiscatalog for information about available aid and application procedures.International StudentsInternational students may work on campus during the school year butshould not expect to work off campus. Those who hold student (F-1)visas are expected to have sufficient funds for the period of their studies.Their dependents are not usually allowed to work. However, if it isnecessary for a dependent to work, students should contact the Office ofInternational Affairs.International students are eligible for institutionally-supported teachingand research fellowships described above.Master’s DegreesMaster’s degree candidates must fulfill the requirements of the GraduateSchool, which are listed below. Students must also complete theadditional requirements set by the school or department in which thedegree is to be awarded. These are described in the departmentalsections of this catalog.Credit RequirementsTo earn a master’s degree, students must complete an integratedprogram of study through either a departmental discipline or a programof interdisciplinary studies totaling no fewer than 45 graduate credits. Asnoted above, some departments require more than 45 credits.The credits must be taken after admission to the master’s degreeprogram (conditional or unconditional) or approved for transfer (seeTransferred Credit below). Of the total, 24 credits must be in UO-gradedcourses passed with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 or better. Aminimum of 30 credits in the major are required for a master’s degreewith a departmental major. In addition, at least 9 credits in coursesnumbered 600–699 must be taken in residence.Students working toward a 45-credit master’s degree with thesis mustregister for a minimum of 36 credits of course work and 9 credits inThesis (503). Credit for thesis is given pass/no pass.Second Master’s DegreeStudents who earned the first master’s degree from the University ofOregon may earn a second master’s degree in another field by takingat least 30 graduate credits, of which 24 must be in courses taken forletter grades, after official admission as a master’s degree candidatein the new major at the university. This provision does not apply to asecond master’s degree in the Interdisciplinary Studies: IndividualizedProgram (IS:IP). Although the second master’s degree may be permittedwith reduced credits, complete records of the student’s graduate-levelstudy must reflect the equivalent of all requirements for completion of thedegree as described in the University of Oregon Catalog. Schools anddepartments may require more than this 30-credit minimum or deny therequest. Students pursuing two graduate degrees at the same time mustfile a concurrent degree form, available on the Graduate School website.If the first master’s degree is from another institution, the second master’sdegree program must comply with the standard university master’sdegree requirements (a minimum of 45 credits).Time LimitStudents must complete all work for the master’s degree within sevenyears, including transferred credits, thesis, the language requirement foran MA, and all examinations. On-leave status does not extend the seven-year deadline unless an extension is expressly approved by the GraduateSchool.Residency and Enrollment RequirementsFor a master’s degree, the Graduate School requires that a minimum of30 credits (applicable to degree requirements) be taken at the Universityof Oregon during at least two terms of study. A second University ofOregon master’s degree also requires a minimum of 30 credits and atleast two terms of study at the University of Oregon. Individual schools ordepartments may have additional residence requirements.Students enrolled in an advanced degree program must attend theuniversity continuously, except for summers, until all the program’srequirements have been completed, unless on-leave status has beenapproved. For more information, see Course Registration Requirementsand Limits (p. 940), Continuous Enrollment (p. 941), GraduateResidency (p. 942), and On-Leave Status (p. 942) under GeneralRequirements and Policies.Transferred CreditGraduate Credit from Other InstitutionsGraduate credit earned while a graduate student in another accreditedgraduate school may be counted toward the master’s degree under thefollowing conditions:1.Total transferred credits may not exceed 15 credits in a master’sdegree program2.Courses must be relevant to the degree program as a whole3.The student’s home department and the Graduate School mustapprove the transfer4.Grades earned must be A+, A, A–, B+, B, or P944         Graduate School5.The courses may not have been used to satisfy the requirements foranother degree6.Transfer courses are subject to the seven-year limit for degreecompletionTransferred credit may not be used to meet the requirement of 24 creditsin University of Oregon graded graduate courses, nor are they used incomputing the UO cumulative GPA.Reservation of Graduate Credit: Permission toRegister for Graduate CreditAn undergraduate student working toward a bachelor's degree mustrequest permission to register for a graduate-level course. The studentmust file a Reservation of Graduate Credit form with the Graduate Schoolby the first Friday of the term in which he or she wants to enroll in thegraduate course. Two options are available for disposition of coursecredits.Option 1Include the graduate-level course in requirements for the bachelor'sdegree. To be eligible, the student must be admitted as an undergraduateand have earned a minimum GPA of 3.00 in each of the three terms priorto enrolling in the graduate course. Undergraduates receiving less thana grade of B in a graduate-level course will be ineligible for enrollment ingraduate-level course work.Option 2Reserve the graduate-level course for consideration by a departmentafter admission as a graduate student. This option is available toseniors only and is limited to a maximum of three graduate coursesnot exceeding a total of 12 credits. To be eligible, the student musthave earned a minimum GPA of 3.00 in each of the three terms priorto enrolling in the graduate course. Undergraduates receiving lessthan a grade of B in a graduate-level course will not be allowed to usethe course toward a master's degree, and will be ineligible for furtherreservations of graduate credit.Nondegree seeking undergraduate students are ineligible forRegistration of Graduate Credit. This includes Community EducationProgram students and undergraduate postbaccalaureate students.Undergraduates do not qualify to receive credits for the followinggraduate classes: Research (601), Supervised College Teaching (602),Internship (604), Reading and Conference (605), Field Studies or SpecialProblems (606), Workshop (508 or 608), Special Topics or Colloquium(508 or 608), and Practicum, Terminal Project, or Supervised Tutoring(609).Transfer of Reserved Graduate CreditUndergraduates who completed graduate-level courses at the Universityof Oregon under the Reservation of Graduate Credit petition process andwho reserve the courses by choosing Option 2 on the petition form mayapply up to 12 credits toward the master's degree.Course work taken for letter grades (B or better) and P/N courses, ifaccompanied by the instructor's statement that the passing grade wasequal to a B or better, is eligible for consideration. If approved, thesecourses can be used to satisfy relevant university master's degreerequirements. A Request for Transfer of Graduate Credit form (availableon the Graduate School's website) must be filed within two terms ofacceptance into a master's degree program and within two years ofearning the bachelor's degree. Any credits transferred under this optionfall with the 15-credit transfer maximum.Other University of Oregon Transferred CreditA maximum of 15 graduate credits earned at the University of Oregonwhile classified as a graduate postbaccalaureate student, a nonadmittedgraduate student enrolled in the Community Education Program or insummer session, or a student earning a graduate certificate may later becounted toward the master’s degree (see Other Graduate Classifications(p. 941) under General Requirements and Policies), pending schoolor department endorsement and Graduate School approval. This iswithin the overall 15-credit maximum for transfer. Grades earned mustbe A+, A, A–, B+, B, or P. A Request for Transfer of Graduate Creditform (available on the Graduate School's website) must be approvedfor credits completed under these classifications to be applied to degreerequirements.Distinction between MA and MS DegreesStudents pursuing an MA degree must demonstrate competence in asecond language. The minimum requirement is the same as that forfulfilling the second-language requirement for the bachelor of arts degree.(See Bachelor's Degree Requirements (http://catalog.uoregon.edu/bachelorrequirements) section of this catalog.) The student’s majordepartment may establish a higher level of proficiency or a differentmethod of determining that level. Language competence must bedemonstrated within the overall seven-year limitation for completion ofa master’s degree. There is no language requirement for the MS andprofessional advanced degrees unless the department so specifies.Examinations and ThesisThe student’s major school or department may require qualifying,comprehensive, or final examinations or any combination of these.The content and methods of conducting such examinations are theresponsibility of the school or department.In some fields, master’s degree candidates must submit a thesis; inothers the thesis is optional. A student who writes a thesis must completethe following procedures:1.Request information from the major school or department about thevarious steps involved and the standards expected2.Consult the Thesis and Dissertation Style and Policy Manual,available on the Graduate School’s website. Only theses thatmeet the standards of style and form discussed in that manual areacceptedThe advisory committee, appointed by the department, determines thework to be completed in light of the student’s academic background andobjectives. The number of committee members is determined by thedepartment. The advisor shall be from the regular faculty, tenured ortenure-track.Research ComplianceSee Research Compliance (p. 944) in the Doctoral Degrees section ofthis catalog.Summary of Graduate School RequirementsThe following outline lists minimum Graduate School requirements formaster’s degrees.

These programs areplanned according to the individual student’s interests and theestablished programs of study organized and administered throughinterdepartmental faculty committees.Graduate students pursuing a program of interdisciplinary studies maysupplement graduate courses offered by the various departments andschools with individualized studies by enrolling under the IST coursenumbers in the Courses section.A student interested in an interdisciplinary program approved bythe Graduate Council should direct inquiries to the appropriateprogram: applied information management or individualized program.Interdisciplinary programs are described below.The requirements for an MS degree in interdisciplinary studies arethe same as those for a departmental master’s degree, except thoserequirements relating to primary or secondary fields. For the MA degree,the student must show knowledge of a second language equivalentto satisfactory completion of the second-year college sequence eitherwith the College Level Examination Program test or with adequateundergraduate course work. As with all work for the master’s degree,language competence must be demonstrated within the overall seven-year time limit.Interdisciplinary Studies: Applied InformationManagementInformation on the multidisciplinary master's degree program in appliedinformation management may be found by selecting the appropriate tabat the top of this page.Interdisciplinary Studies: Individualized ProgramThe individualized program is the university’s most flexibleinterdisciplinary program leading to MA and MS degrees. The program isdesigned for students with specific, well-articulated goals that cannot bereached through established departmental programs. Although flexibilityis allowed in program design, the program must be composed of existinggraduate courses from approved master’s degree programs in threeprofessional schools, in three departments in the College of Arts andSciences, or in a combination of programs from the professional schoolsand the College of Arts and Sciences.The Interdisciplinary Studies: Individualized Program (IS:IP) requires atotal of at least 54 graduate credits; a minimum of 15 graduate credits ineach of the three areas of concentration; and 9 graduate credits for anintegrated terminal project or thesis determined by the student and threeadvisors during the course of study.Guidelines in the IS:IP program include the following:1.A maximum of 15 credits may be used from practicum, field studies,research, and reading and conference courses. Such credit must bedistributed across all three areas of the program2.The terminal project or thesis consists of 9 credits distributed acrossat least two areas. Credit for this project is earned in Terminal Project(. Joint Campus Experimental Course: [Topic]. 1-15 Credits.950         Research Centers and InstitutesResearch Centers andInstitutesThe university’s interdisciplinary centers and institutes provideopportunities for graduate training and research. Members hold facultypositions in related academic departments. Students who want to work inone of the institutes as part of thesis or dissertation research must satisfythe graduate degree requirements of the related department throughwhich they earn their degree.Students who want to work in any of these fields may obtain informationabout the programs and financial aid from institute and center directorsas well as online (http://research.uoregon.edu/content/uo-research-centers-and-institutes).Center for Cybersecurity and PrivacyJun Li, Director541-346-4424ccsp.uoregon.eduThe Center for Cybersecurity and Privacy conducts a variety of researchprojects and educational efforts focusing on the security of computernetworks and systems.

The dissertation must contribute significantly toknowledge, show a mastery of the literature of the subject, be written inacceptable literary style, and conform to the standards outlined in theUniversity of Oregon Thesis and Dissertation Style and Policy Manual.The manual is available from the Graduate School’s website. Doctoraldissertations must be submitted electronically to ProQuest (formerlyUniversity Microfilms International). Copyright registration is optional.Research ComplianceUniversity policy requires that students who intend to engage in researchinvolving human or animal subjects have their research proceduresapproved before they begin to collect data. Researchers who want touse human subjects may obtain protocol forms and procedures from theResearch Compliance Services website, orcr.uoregon.edu. Researcherswho want to use vertebrate animals may obtain protocol forms andprocedures from the Terrestrial Animal Care Services website (https://teacs.uoregon.edu).Dissertation CommitteeFollowing advancement to candidacy, the candidate’s departmentproposes the membership of the dissertation committee to the dean ofthe Graduate School, who appoints the committee after approving it.The committee includes at least four instructional faculty members. Threeof the members are from the department awarding the degree and oneis from outside the department. When appropriate, some of the homedepartment committee members may be from another department,with the approval of the dean of the Graduate School and the homedepartment. The committee should be proposed to the dean within onemonth after advancement to candidacy but in no case later than sixmonths before completion of the dissertation defense.A detailed description of the policy on dissertation committees is availableon the Graduate School’s website.Dissertation RegistrationRegistration for Dissertation (603) is allowed only after the candidate hasadvanced to candidacy. Doctoral students must have a minimum of 18credits of Dissertation (603) to graduate. Doctoral students are requiredto enroll for a minimum of 3 credits of Dissertation (603) in the term ofdegree completion and during any other term in which they are utilizingfaculty time or university resources.Defense of DissertationFormal, public defense must take place on campus at a date set by thecommittee chair and approved by the Graduate School.Tentative approval of the dissertation by the committee is recommendedprior to formal defense. This evaluation is based on copies of the finalmanuscript, which the candidate provides for the dissertation committeeat least three weeks before the formal defense.The approved application for final oral defense must also be filed withthe Graduate School three weeks before the formal defense. Visit theGraduate School website for specific instructions.The time and place of the defense must be publicly noted. Thedissertation committee must be present at the defense, and the chairof the committee must certify to the Graduate School within two weeksfollowing the defense that the defense was held as scheduled.Completion of DissertationWithin two weeks following the defense of the dissertation but beforethe dissertation is submitted to the Graduate School, each member ofthe dissertation committee must confirm in writing either approval ordisapproval of the final version. Approval requires a unanimous vote. Inthe event of a split vote, the dean of the Graduate School determines theThe University of Oregon            947review procedure after consultation with the student, the department chair(or the school dean), and the committee.Committee members should sign the Certificate of Completion, signalingapproval of the dissertation, only if they have seen and approved what issubstantially a final draft and if they are willing to delegate the overseeingof remaining minor revisions to the chair. If this is not the case, theyshould not sign the Certificate of Completion. If no signed approvalform is received by the Graduate School within two weeks following thescheduled oral examination, another oral examination must be scheduledfor defense of the dissertation. Once the dissertation has been approvedby the committee, the student must submit the dissertation electronicallyto the Graduate School. Visit the Graduate School website for deadlinesand submission instructions.Time LimitThe seven-year time limit for completing a doctoral degree begins withthe first term of admission as a conditional or regular doctoral student atthe University of Oregon.

Exton, Head Advisor541-346-4629Forensic science is the application of scientific principles andtechnological practices to the study and resolution of criminal, civil, andregulatory issues. The role of the forensic scientist is twofold: to analyzephysical evidence and to provide expert testimony in a court of law.This information is helpful in determining the innocence or guilt of thesuspect. The University of Oregon provides advising and course workfor students interested in pursuing a career or graduate study in theforensic science field, but does not offer a degree in forensic science.The majority of positions in crime laboratories require a minimum of abachelor’s degree in a physical science. The choice of major depends onyour interests and the area of forensic science in which you plan to seekemployment. Advanced degrees are useful for career advancement andmay be required for certain positions. Employment opportunities exist inlaw enforcement agencies at the local, state, and national level as well asin the private sector. Employment can also be found within such agenciesas the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Environmental ProtectionAgency, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Drug Enforcement Administration.Minimum Requirements•Bachelor’s degree in any discipline, although biology, chemistry,computer and information science, general science, or physics aremost appropriate•For graduate programs, scores from Graduate Record Examinations;a few schools will accept Medical College Admission Test scoresinstead•Letters of recommendation from science faculty membersSuggested Science Courses•A yearlong biology sequence is recommended.
