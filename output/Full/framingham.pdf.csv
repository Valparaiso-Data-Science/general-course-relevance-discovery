The system exists to provide accessible, affordable, relevant, and rigorous academic programs that adapt to meet changing individual and societal needs for education and employment.  All campuses are committed to operating effectively and efficiently in order to maintain tuition and fees at a level as low as possible, while providing a high-quality education to every student who qualifies for admission.  The public system is committed to continuous improvement and accountability in all aspects of teaching and learning.  The Board of Higher Education and institutional boards of trustees recognize their responsibilities to the taxpayers and residents of Massachusetts in the performance of their roles and responsibilities.  Massachusetts public higher education is a system with a distinguished past, increasing pride, and unlimited potential.  STATE UNIVERSITY MISSION STATEMENT There are six comprehensive state universities - Bridgewater State University, Fitchburg State University, Framingham State University, Salem State University, Westfield State University, and Worcester State University - and three specialized colleges - Massachusetts College of Art, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts and Massachusetts Maritime Academy.  All institutions integrate liberal arts and sciences programs with professional education, and the three specialized colleges also focus on academic areas identified in the colleges’ name. Each institution places a special emphasis on teaching and lifelong learning, and promotes a campus life that fosters intellectual, social and ethical development.  Committed to excellence in instruction and to providing responsive, innovative and educational programs of high quality, they seek to develop each student’s critical thinking, quantitative, oral and written communications skills, and practical appreciation of the arts, sciences and humanities as they affect good citizenship and an improved quality of life.  The state system provides a campus environment where the ideas, values, perspectives and contributions of all students are respected. Massachusetts state universities & colleges are strategically located to facilitate access to baccalaureate and master’s degree programs for Commonwealth residents who meet their high standards for admission.  In recognition of their responsibilities to Massachusetts taxpayers to manage their resources efficiently and to maintain tuition and fees at a level as low as possible, each campus has a distinctive academic focus based upon its established strengths and regional and state needs.  Each institution is a leader and resource for the community and contributes to the region’s cultural, environmental, and economic development.                                                                               ~1~Mission Statement  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019    FRAMINGHAM STATE UNIVERSITY MISSION STATEMENT Framingham State University prepares students for a productive life, enhanced by learning and leadership that will contribute to the culturally diverse world of the twenty-first century. Founded by Horace Mann in 1839 as America’s first public teachers’ college, Framingham State University today offers undergraduate and graduate programs encompassing the arts and sciences and professional studies.   Committed to excellence, the Framingham State University learning community comprises teacher-scholars, librarians, students, and staff who promote free inquiry, the respectful exchange of ideas, ethical conduct, and the belief that diversity in its many forms is essential to the educational experience.  In an environment that supports active, collaborative learning, students work closely with faculty to engage significant bodies of knowledge and develop their ability to gather and evaluate information, communicate effectively, think critically and creatively, reason quantitatively, and apply information and emerging technologies. At Framingham State University teaching is the primary role of faculty, who engage in their disciplines through instruction, scholarship, and service on campus and in their professional communities.   The University serves as an important educational and cultural center in the MetroWest region of Massachusetts.    A Framingham State University education cultivates thoughtful, responsible local and global citizens, prepares students for a career, and positions them for success.

It had as its mission the training of teachers, and was the first state-supported normal school (a school which trains teachers) in the United States of America.  Twice it outgrew its accommodations, moving first to West Newton and then to its present location on Bare Hill in Framingham in 1853. From the beginning, the Normal School met the challenge of being the first model by educating teachers who were in demand for the common schools of Massachusetts and, indeed, for schools throughout the nation. From the first class, Normal School graduates participated in the new field of education for the blind and the deaf. They traveled to the South and to the West to teach in schools being established for Blacks and Native Americans, and they went as missionaries to distant lands. From 1848 to 1898 Framingham also conducted an advanced program for women who aspired to careers in high school and college teaching, school administration, law and medicine, opening unprecedented educational and career opportunities for these women. There were principals, professors, doctors, and writers among the early graduates, and women who participated in the suffrage and temperance movements; indeed, in all of the significant educational and social reforms of the nineteenth century. At the close of the nineteenth century, the first teachers of the household arts were graduated from a new program at Framingham, laying the foundation for studies in nutrition and food science, as well as clothing and textiles. The student body increased steadily during the twentieth century and with it the size of the campus and the number of buildings. New programs and courses marked the increasingly professional character of the education offered, while extracurricular organizations were formed to enrich student life. In 1932 the Massachusetts Normal Schools became the State Teachers Colleges, and in 1960 they became State Colleges with a mandate to develop liberal arts curricula. Framingham, which had served only women, became coeducational in 1964. The University has continued to add departments such as Economics, Sociology, and Psychology, as well as career-orientated programs in Computer Science, Communications, Business Administration, and Nursing, among others, to increase the options for students and to meet the needs of the Commonwealth. In 2010, the Governor signed legislation changing the State Colleges to State Universities. Today, Framingham State University is situated on a beautiful 54-acre campus in the suburban town of Framingham. The University’s location in the economically vibrant Metro West area affords many opportunities for students and graduates alike. Approximately 6,499 full- and part-time students with 34 bachelor’s degree programs and 23 master’s degree programs are enrolled at the University.                                                                     ~3~Undergraduate Admissions All candidates seeking admission to an undergraduate degree program must submit an application to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.

Transfer credit is awarded for college-level courses at regionally- accredited colleges and universities. Transfer credit is given only for courses in which the student received a grade of C- (1.70/4.00 scale) or higher. A Pass/Fail grade is not transferable. Coursework completed at the University prior to matriculation is treated as transfer credit. Transfer credits are not used in the   calculation of the grade point average. Students must complete a minimum of 32 course-credits, including courses for general education, major and major-related requirements, as well as open/free electives in order to earn their Framingham State University degree. A minimum of eight (8) Framingham State University course-credits must be taken post-matriculation to complete residency requirements. Transfer students must complete a minimum of five (5) Framingham State University course-credits post-matriculation in their major department and, if applicable, three (3) Framingham State University course-credits post-matriculation in the minor. Once a student is accepted to the University as a degree candidate, all official transcripts are sent to the Office of the University Registrar to be reviewed by the transfer credit evaluator. All approved courses accepted in transfer will be awarded Framingham State University course-credit in an amount equal to the cumulative total number of semester credits transferred divided by four (4) and rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, if a student has five 3-credit courses (15 semester hours) accepted in transfer, four (4) Framingham State University course-credits will be awarded (an equivalent of 16 semester hours). Note: Applicants to the upper division Nursing program (Registered Nurses (RNs) only) should refer to the Nursing section of the catalog for additional information on requirements.

No student will be officially enrolled in the University or the residence halls unless all charges are satisfied. All students, regardless of their account balance and, by the due date of the student bill, are required to notify the University of their intent to attend that term.  Failure to do so may result in loss of classes, residence hall reservation, and parking assignment. In addition, a $100.00 late fee may be charged.

The Plan may be used in conjunction with all forms of financial aid such as grants, loans, and scholarships. Monthly payments must be made to TMS by the first of each month. A student may participate in the Plan by budgeting costs from July 1st to November 1st for the fall term and from December 1st to April 1st for the spring term.

A Geographic Tuition Grant will be applied to the student’s semester tuition charges. The student would then be responsible for the current published In-State tuition amount and all Fees for the semester. The student will be classified as an Out-of-State Resident for tuition purposes but will have the Geographic Tuition Grant Program attribute in order to track and apply the Grant each semester.   Eligibility is based on the student not having access to a Bachelor’s degree-granting public institution within a 500-mile radius of the student’s home town/city.

These rules and regulations, approved in 2016 by the University, and current as of publication, apply to the classification of students at Framingham State University as Massachusetts or non-Massachusetts students for tuition purposes. The Massachusetts Board of Higher Education (BHE) may revise this policy.  In that event, the revised BHE policy will supersede the following. In the event the Tuition Residency Form is not submitted prior to the semester of matriculation, the student’s classification will be set to out-of-state retroactive to the semester of matriculation resulting in out-of-state tuition charges being assessed. Part I. Definitions 1.1 "Academic period" shall mean a term or semester in an academic year or a summer session, as prescribed by the Framingham State University Board of Trustees or under their authority. 1.2 "Continuous attendance" shall mean enrollment at the University for the normal academic year in each calendar year; or the appropriate portion or portions of such academic year as prescribed by the Board of Trustees or under their authority.  1.3 “Eligible person” shall mean a United States citizen, lawful immigrant, permanent resident or holder of another legal immigration status, or is eligible to apply and has applied for such status; who has satisfied the durational residency requirement and can demonstrate his/her intent to remain in Massachusetts. 1.4 "Emancipated person," for the purposes of residency classification for tuition, shall mean a person who has attained the age of 18 years and is financially independent of his or her parents, or if under 18 years of age:  a) whose parents have entirely surrendered the right to the care, custody, and earnings of such person and who no longer are under any legal obligation to support or maintain such person; b) a person who is legally married; c) a person who has no parent.  If none of the aforesaid definitions apply, said person shall be deemed an "unemancipated person."  1.5 "Parent" shall mean: a) the person's father and mother, jointly;  b) if the person's father is deceased, the person's mother; if the person's mother is deceased, the person's father;  c) if a legal guardian has been appointed by a court having jurisdiction, the legal guardian;  d) if neither the father nor mother is living and no legal guardian has been appointed, the person who then stands in loco parentis to the person;  e) if the father and mother are divorced, separated or unmarried, the parent who has been awarded legal custody of the person; or if legal custody has not been awarded, the parent with whom the person lives. With respect to any adopted student, the word "adoptive" should be inserted before the words "father" and "mother" wherever used.  1.6 "Reside," "residency" or "resident" shall mean "domicile," i.e., a person's true, fixed and permanent home or place of habitation, where he or she intends to remain permanently.  Part II. Classification  2.1 For the purpose of assessing tuition, each student shall be classified as a "Massachusetts resident" or a "non-Massachusetts resident." A person shall be classified as a Massachusetts resident if he or she (or the parent of an unemancipated student) shall have resided in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for purposes other than attending an educational institution (public or private) for twelve months immediately preceding the student's entry or reentry as a student.                                                                     ~19~2.2 Physical presence for this entire twelve-month period need not be required as long as the conduct of an individual, taken in total, manifests an intention to make Massachusetts his or her permanent dwelling place. However, residency is not acquired by mere physical presence in Massachusetts while the person is enrolled in an institution of higher education (public or private). Part III. Determination of Residency  3.1 Proof of Residency  a) Each case will be decided on the basis of all facts submitted with qualitative rather than quantitative emphasis. A number of factors are required for residency to determine the intention of the person to maintain permanent residence in Massachusetts. No single index is decisive. The burden of proof rests on the student seeking classification as a Massachusetts resident.  b) The following shall be primary indicia of residency: 1)  The unemancipated persons, the residency of parents, having custody, within Massachusetts: 2)  Copies of both federal and state income tax returns including W-2 forms; 3)  Permanent employment in a position not normally filled by a student;  4)  Reliance on Massachusetts sources for financial support;  5) Former residency in Massachusetts and maintenance of significant connections therein while absent.  c) The following shall be secondary indicia of residency, to be considered of less weight than the indicia listed above in subsection b):  1)  Continuous physical presence in Massachusetts during periods when not an enrolled student;  2)  Military home of record;  3)  All other material of whatever kind or source, which may have a bearing on determining residency (such as motor vehicle registration and operator’s license and vehicle insurance policy benefits page).  3.2 Proof of Emancipation.  A student asserting that he or she is an emancipated person shall furnish evidence to support such assertion. Such evidence may include:  a) Birth certificate or any other legal document that shows place and date of birth;  b) Legal guardianship papers - court appointment and termination must be submitted;  c) Statements of the person, his or her parent(s), guardian(s), or others certifying no financial support;  d) Certified copies of federal and state income tax returns filed by the person and his or her parent(s);  e) Where none of the foregoing can be provided an affidavit of the emancipated person in explanation thereof and stating fully the grounds supporting the claim of emancipation.  3.3 Presumptions a) Residency is not acquired by mere physical presence in Massachusetts while the person is enrolled in an institution of higher education. (See Section 2)  b) A person having his or her residency elsewhere than in Massachusetts shall not be eligible for classification as a Massachusetts resident for tuition purposes except as herein provided:  1)  Any person who is registered at the University as a Massachusetts resident shall be eligible for continued classification as a Massachusetts resident for tuition purposes (until attainment of the degree for which he or she is enrolled) during continuous attendance at the institution.  2)  The spouse of any person who is classified or is eligible for classification as a Massachusetts resident is likewise eligible for classification as a Massachusetts resident. This provision will not apply in the case of a spouse in the United States on a non-immigrant visa. 3)  A person who is a lawful immigrant/permanent resident of the United States (or is eligible to apply and has applied for such status) is eligible to                                                                    ~20~be considered for Massachusetts residency for tuition purposes provided that he/she meets the same requirements for establishing residency in Massachusetts as are required of a United States citizen.  A Non-citizen who is in refugee/asylum status are likewise eligible to be considered for Massachusetts residency for tuition purposes provided that he/she meets the same requirements for establishing residency in Massachusetts as are required of a United States citizen. A non-citizen must provide appropriate United States Citizenship and Immigration Services documentation to verify his/her status.  NOTE: A student attending the University on a non-immigrant visa (A through T) is not eligible for Massachusetts In-State tuition unless the student is eligible and has applied for lawful immigrant status (documentation of such actions will be required). 4) Those students whose higher educational pursuits are funded by the Massachusetts Department of Institutional Assistance, the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, or any of the other Commonwealth of Massachusetts public assistance programs.  c) A person does not gain or lose in-state status solely by reason of his or her presence in any state or country while a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.  d) For the purposes of this policy the following persons shall be presumed to be Massachusetts residents:  1) The student meets the qualifications for In-State Tuition under Federal Public Law 113-146 (The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014). Part IV. Appeals and Reclassification  4.1 In any case where the Admissions Office is unable to make a determination prior to initial enrollment based on the evidence submitted, the applicant may be required to submit a “Tuition Residency Reclassification Form” to the University Registrar for review before residency classification is finalized. 4.2 Any student or applicant who is unwilling to accept the initial ruling relative to his or her residency classification, or who wishes to seek reclassification may a file a “Tuition Residency Reclassification Form.”  4.3 Any student or applicant who is unwilling to accept the ruling relative to his or her residency after submitting a Tuition Residency Reclassification Form” may submit a written appeal to the Vice President for Enrollment & Student Development or his/her designee.  The decision on appeal is final and may not be appealed further.  (i) 4.4 Retroactive Effect: Any change in a student’s classification as the result of a request for reclassification or an appeal will be retroactive only to the beginning of the semester during which the institution makes the final decision to reclassify the student. (ii) Part V. Penalties Misrepresentation in or omission from any evidence submitted with respect to any fact which, if correctly or completely stated, would be grounds to deny classification as a Massachusetts resident (for tuition purposes), shall be cause for exclusion or expulsion from or other disciplinary action by the institution.                                                                      ~21~Financial Aid  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019      Office of Financial Aid The Office of Financial Aid at Framingham State University exists in order to assist students and their families in meeting the costs of a college education. Framingham State University participates in a variety of federal, state, institutional, and private financial aid programs.   General Eligibility Requirements In order to be eligible for financial aid at Framingham State University, an applicant must be a United States citizen or an eligible non-citizen enrolled (or accepted for enrollment) in a degree program at Framingham State University. Additionally, the applicant must be maintaining satisfactory academic progress towards a degree, must be in compliance with the Selective Service Law, must not be in default on any educational loans or owe a refund on any federal grants to any institution, and must have all documents required for a completed financial aid application on file in the Office of Financial Aid.  How to Apply for Financial Aid In order to be given priority consideration for financial aid, a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), or a renewal FAFSA, if the student is a current aid recipient, should be filed at www.fafsa.gov by March 1st.  Students must include Framingham State University’s FICE (Federal Interagency Committee on Education) school code number, 002185. Additional documents may be required for students who are selected for verification by the Federal Government. These documents include completing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data retrieval process for parent and student or providing official IRS tax transcripts, a verification worksheet and other documents as requested. Students will be contacted if this information is required.  Financial Aid Awards Once financial aid eligibility is determined, a financial aid package is prepared. The package may be a combination of grant, work, and/or loan programs. The following is a list of the most common programs.  Visit www.framingham.edu/financialaid for more information.  Financial Aid Special Circumstances Appeals Financial decisions can be appealed if the family situation changes after the financial aid award has been made. Students must complete a Special Circumstances Appeal Request Form available at the Office of Financial Aid or found on the Office’s web pages. Grounds for an appeal may include, but are not limited to: loss of job, loss of other income, death in the family, divorce or separation in the family, or unusually high medical bills. All appeals are handled on an individual basis.

The amount of financial aid eligibility that is met depends upon the availability of funds, the number of eligible applicants, the date the FAFSA is filed and the financial aid file is completed. FAFSAs received by March 1st will be given priority consideration, while files completed after that date are subject to available funding. A financial aid award letter will be mailed to all students who complete an application for financial aid. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Financial Aid Office of all financial assistance received from any other sources. Types of assistance that must be reported include private scholarships, tuition waivers, veteran’s benefits, Massachusetts Rehabilitation assistance, etc. All forms of outside assistance must be taken into account in the financial aid package. Outside assistance received after the awards are made by the Financial Aid Office may cause the financial aid package to be adjusted.                                                                      ~23~Financial Aid  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019      Payment of Financial Aid Awards Financial Aid awarded prior to the due date of the student bill, excluding Federal Work Study, will be posted directly to the student’s account.   If more aid is awarded than is required to meet the financial obligation to the University, the student will be refunded this amount and it can be used to meet other educational expenses. Financial aid refunds are not usually available until the mid-point of the term. It is the policy of the Business Office to credit the first money received to the student bill. A student who withdraws from the University during the term may not be eligible for the entire financial aid award. The refund policy of the University is included with the Student Bill in the All About Tuition and Fees document and can be viewed online.  Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Federal regulations require Framingham State University to develop and apply a consistent and reasonable standard of academic progress, which must contain elements specified in the regulations. The following standards apply to any student receiving Federal or State financial aid. Grade Point Average Standards Students must meet FSU academic standards by earning a overall grade point average (GPA) of 1.70 until they have passed 8 course-credits (32 semester hours), and a overall GPA of 2.00 after that, or after four (4) semesters (excluding winter intercession but including summer courses) at FSU (whichever comes first). Pace of Completion and Maximum Timeframe The maximum time frame for completing an undergraduate degree is 150% of the published length of the program.  To ensure that students meet this requirement, schools must measure how many courses students complete against how many they attempt.  To be making satisfactory academic progress at FSU, students must successfully complete 67% of the courses attempted.  This is a cumulative measurement, and the number of courses attempted and earned will be reviewed at the end of each year at the conclusion of the spring semester.  Since a degree at FSU requires 32 course-credits (128 semester hours), 48 course-credits (192 semester hours) is the maximum amount that students can attempt within the 150% completion time frame.  Students who have attempted 48 course-credits (including semester hour credits transferred to FSU that count toward the student’s degree program) and have not yet earned a Bachelor’s degree will become ineligible for financial aid.  Courses transferred to FSU are counted towards the number of course credits/semester hours attempted and completed but are not included in the calculation of the GPA.  Examples:  A student has taken a total of 30 course credits (120 semester hours) and passed 18 course credits (72 semester hours). The student is not making satisfactory progress because the student is passing at the rate of 60% (18 divided by 30). A student has attempted 40 course credits (160 semester hours) at FSU and has transferred in 10 course credits (40 semester hours) from another institution, but has not yet earned a degree.  The student is not eligible for financial aid because the student has attempted 50 course credits (200 semester hours), or more than 150% of the allowable amount for the program.                                                                     ~24~Financial Aid  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019      Additional Elements Course Withdrawals:  If a student withdraws from one or more courses before the end of the Add/Drop period, the course(s) will not be counted as a course attempt.  Any courses dropped with a notation of ‘W’ (Withdrawn) after the Course Add/Drop period will be counted as credits attempted for determining academic progress. Incompletes:   A grade of incomplete will count as an attempted course.  Once the course work is completed and a grade is determined, the completion rate and GPA may change based on the grade that is earned.  The time frame to remedy an incomplete grade for satisfactory progress is the same as that for all students (see the Incomplete Grade Policy in the Academic Regulations section of this catalog). Repeated courses:  Courses taken more than once will count as attempted courses for each attempt, but will count only once as earned course credit toward degree completion.  Please note that additional federal regulations restrict the number of courses that students can repeat while receiving financial aid.  Please contact the Financial Aid Office if you plan to repeat courses. Non-credit courses:  Non-credit courses are acceptable as courses attempted and courses earned. Standards are Cumulative Satisfactory academic progress standards are cumulative and include all periods of the student's enrollment, including those for which the student did not receive financial aid.  Financial Aid Appeal Process Students who are not making Satisfactory Academic Progress may appeal in writing to the Financial Aid Office.  The appeal should include a detailed account of why the student did not meet the required academic standards and should include any information on special circumstances that may have affected the student’s academic performance.  Examples of special circumstances include but are not limited to: an injury to a student, an illness of the student, or the death of a close relative of the student.  The appeal should also include information on what has changed to allow the student to make satisfactory academic progress in the future. If a student’s appeal is approved, they will receive a semester of financial aid probation, and may also be placed on an academic plan.  Academic progress will be checked again at the end of the probationary semester. Reinstatement of Financial Aid If financial aid is lost because satisfactory progress has not been achieved, some ways that the student can repair his or her record over time include:  Raising the cumulative GPA to the required level  Raising the completion rate to the required level by earning passing grades in all attempted courses  Successfully appealing and improving academic performance while on Financial Aid Probation or adhering to the requirements of the assigned academic plan. Although satisfactory progress is monitored once per year at the conclusion of the spring semester, eligibility may be restored at any time throughout the year.  If a student’s GPA or completion rate changes due to grade changes, repeated courses, or courses transferred in from other schools, the student should notify the Financial Aid Office.                                                                       ~25~Financial Aid  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019       VETERANS SERVICES Framingham State University is approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for veterans’ benefits, and for the education of veterans, war orphans, and the dependents of 100% disabled veterans. Eligible veterans, other than Chapter 34, have 10 years from the date of separation from active duty to use their educational benefits. Chapter 34 veteran benefits expired January 1, 1990. When filing for benefits at the University, eligible veterans are required to submit a copy of their separation from service (DD214). The University seeks to provide assistance in obtaining benefits, financial aid, and other services for full and part-time students. Filing the chapter benefits and certification of enrollment is done through the Office of the Veteran Services, located in Crocker Hall Annex.   Categorical Tuition Waiver for Veterans and Active Duty Members To be eligible for a Categorical Tuition Waiver, a student must:  Be a permanent legal resident of Massachusetts for at least one year prior to the opening of the academic year;  Be a United States citizen or eligible noncitizen;  Be in compliance with applicable Selective Service Registration laws;  Not be in default of any federal or state student loan or owe a refund on any previously received financial aid;  Present documentation of categorical tuition waiver eligibility to the appropriate to the Office of the University Registrar;  Enroll in at least three undergraduate course-credits per semester in a state-supported undergraduate degree or certificate program; and  Maintain satisfactory academic progress in accordance with federal and institutional standards.  Be a member of an eligible category as defined below: Veteran: As provided in M.G.L. Chapter 4, Section 7(43), shall mean:  (1) any person  whose last discharge or release was under honorable conditions, and who served for not less than 180 days active service;  or (2) Any person whose last discharge or release was under honorable conditions and who served in the army, navy, marine corps, coast guard, or air force of the United States, or on full time national guard duty under Titles 10 or 32 of the United States Code or under sections 38, 40 and 41 of chapter 33 for not less than 90 days active service, at least 1 day of which was for wartime service, including: Spanish War, World War I, World War II, Korean, Vietnam, Lebanese peace keeping force, Grenada rescue mission, the Panamanian intervention force, or the Persian Gulf. For purposes of the categorical tuition waivers, “veteran” shall also include any individual who served for not less than ninety days at least one of which was served in theatre for "Operation Restore Hope" and whose last discharge or release was under honorable conditions.  Armed Forces: An active member of the Army, Navy, Marine, Air Force or Coast Guard stationed and residing in Massachusetts.  Unlike the G.I. Bill®, the Categorical Tuition Waiver does not expire. Assistance can continue as long as the student meets the eligibility criteria. Specific definitions of "veteran" in each category can be obtained from the Office of the University Registrar. Those who are eligible must complete and submit a Certificate of Tuition Waiver Form, along with a copy of their separation from service (DD214) and proof of Massachusetts residency, prior to the billing deadline. Certificates must be submitted prior to billing each semester. Veterans whose certificates are not on file prior to receiving bills must pay tuition. A refund will be processed upon receipt and approval of the certificate.                                                                    ~26~Financial Aid  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019      Massachusetts National Guard Tuition Waiver and Federal Tuition Assistance Program The Massachusetts National Guard Education Assistance Program provides a 100% tuition and fee waiver for active members of the Massachusetts Army National Guard attending a state university or community college program. Assistance can continue as long as you are good academic standing and until you have reached 130 semester hours. To apply, you must request a Certificate of Eligibility (TAGMA Form 621-3) every 30 credits from the Massachusetts National Guard Education Office by calling that office at 508-968-5889.  VALOR Act and Academic Credit Evaluation Policy As per the Valor Act of 2012 (Massachusetts), undergraduate admissions applicants may submit their military transcript via the American Council on Education (ACE) for consideration of academic credit in accordance with University's policy with transfer credit. Framingham State will also review for consideration of academic credit the DANTES DSST exams. This information needs to be provided during the application process to the University. Questions regarding the possible transferability of military credits should be directed to the Office of the University Registrar by email (registrarsoffice@framingham.edu) or by phone (508-626-4545).  Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146) changed the amount of tuition and fee charges which can be reported to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Effective July 1, 2015, public institutions of higher education must charge qualifying veterans and dependents tuition and fees at the rate for in-state residents. Any institution not meeting this requirement will be disapproved by VA for the Post-9/11 GI Bill® and Montgomery GI Bill®. Individuals qualifying for in-state tuition under Public Law 113-146 are:  A Veteran receiving benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill® (Chapter 30) or the Post-9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) who lives in the state in which the institution is located (regardless of his/her legal state of residence) and enrolls in the institution within three years of discharge from a period of active duty service of 90 days or more.  A spouse or child using transferred benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) who lives in the state in which the institution is located (regardless of his/her legal state of residence) and enrolls in the institution within 3 years of the transferor’s discharge from a period of active duty service of 90 days or more.  A spouse or child using benefits under the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship who lives in the state in which the institution is located (regardless of his/her legal state of residence) and enrolls in the institution within three years of the Servicemember’s death in the line of duty following a period of active duty service of 90 days or more. If the veteran or dependent enrolls within three years after the veteran’s discharge, the requirement to charge no more than the in-state tuition rate would apply for the duration the individual remains continuously enrolled at the institution. ‘‘GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official United States Government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill."                                                                    ~27~Academic Regulations ABSENCE BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS “Any student in an educational or vocational training institution, other than a religious or denominational educational or vocational training institution, who is unable, because of his religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day, shall be excused from any such examination or study or work requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study or work requirement which he may have missed because of such absence on any particular day; provided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon such school. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the said student such opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his availing himself of the provisions of this section.” (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 151C, Section 2B). COURSE ATTENDANCE Classroom instruction is a principle component of the educational process. Students and faculty have a mutual responsibility for contributing to the academic environment of the classroom. Consistent class attendance and participation in classroom activities are essential. Students are expected to attend all classes. Students should consult the course outline or syllabus to determine the relationships between attendance, including tardiness, and the goals, objectives, requirements, and grading of each course.  Per federal regulations, students are expected to engage in two (2) hours of study outside of class for each semester hour in class. At FSU, one (1) course-credit equals four (4) semester hours and students would be expected to spend eight (8) hours of study outside of the classroom. FIELD TRIP POLICY Field trips must be approved in writing by the chair of the department to which the faculty member planning the trip belongs before any definite arrangements are made. No special notice is required if the trip is to be completed during the normal class time. If a trip of longer duration than the normal class time is to be taken, it is the responsibility of the faculty member to publically post notice of any such trip at least two weeks prior to its occurrence. Participation on the part of the students will be on a voluntary basis when a field trip conflicts with regularly scheduled classes. Before any such field trip, the instructor must advise students that they will not be penalized for non-participation. If more than half of the students in another class are absent because of such a field trip, the instructor in that course may cancel the class. COURSE-CREDIT RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS To complete the University residence requirement, a minimum of eight (8) course-credits (32 semester hours) must be taken post-matriculation at the University.  To complete a major requirement, a minimum of five (5) course-credits (20 semester hours) in the major department must be taken post-matriculation at the University. To complete a minor requirement, a minimum of three (3) course-credits (12 semester hours) in the minor department must be taken post-matriculation at the University. REGISTRATION FOR DAY SCHOOL COURSES Registration in the Day School for the following term occurs in the fall and spring at approximately mid-semester. Students receive information for registration from the Office of the University Registrar and meet with their Academic Advisors to plan their course selections. After consulting with their advisors, they then register for the succeeding semester. The order of registration proceeds from seniors to freshmen. Note: Students in the Commonwealth Honors Program are permitted to register before all other students.                                                                     ~28~ CLASS DETERMINATION FOR REGISTRATION The responsibility for following the appropriate program of the major/concentration, as well as general education courses, to ensure the completion of all course work in the standard four-year sequence rest with the student. To ensure reasonable opportunity for course planning at registration the following levels are followed:  Completion of fewer than 8 course-credits represents freshman status;  Successful completion of 8-15 course-credits represents sophomore status;  Successful completion of 16-23 course-credits represents junior status;  Successful completion of 24 or more course-credits represents senior status. SEMESTER COURSE LOAD The normal course workload for each semester for full-time students is four (4) course-credits.   The minimum academic load for each semester for full-time students is three (3) course credits. The minimum program required for receipt of maximum educational benefit payment under the Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966 and for receipt of Social Security benefits as a dependent is three (3) course-credits per semester. Courses may not be “split,” that is, all classes in a given course must be taken by the student within the same section unless granted permission by the instructor. A student may not register for two (2) courses that meet at the same time or overlap start/end times.  In the event that students desire to take a course offered through the Department of Continuing Education (CE) because one of an equivalent type is not available in the Day School, they may request to change their enrollment status to Evening School (CE) in order to take the CE course. If this is done, students must pay the full cost of the CE course in addition to Day School program charges. Request 5th Course Policy: The maximum academic load for each semester for full-time students is five (5) course-credits, which includes courses taken in Continuing Education as well as off-campus.  Requirements for taking a fifth course-credit are: a. an overall GPA greater than or equal to 2.70; b. successful completion of at least 16 course-credits; c. at least one semester of four (4) course-credits completed for students who transferred 16 or more course credits; d. completion of three of the four (4) previous semesters with four (4) course-credits. Students must complete the 5th Course Request form and submit it to the Office of the University Registrar. Students not meeting the policy requirements and therefore denied permission, may appeal to their major Department Chair prior to the end of the Course Add/Drop period. Department chairs may grant exceptions to the above stipulations in special circumstances.  ADDING OR DROPPING COURSES Students may add or drop a semester course (or change sections of a course) without penalty if they do so before the end of the sixth academic day (see semester calendar). Students may add or drop a quarter course (or change sections of a course) without penalty if they do so before the end of the third academic day (see semester calendar). By logging onto myFramingham, students may add or drop a course, including changing a section of a course, until the end of the 6th academic day of the fall or spring semester.  If the course is full or if prerequisites are required, a student may submit a completed override form to the Office of the University Registrar before the end of the Course Add/Drop period.                                                                      ~29~ WITHDRAWING FROM COURSES Students who withdraw from a course or courses following the end of the Course Add/Drop period have until tenth week of a regular semester (or for a quarter course, no later than the end of the fifth full week of the quarter) to do so and will incur no academic penalty as far as the grade point average is concerned but will have a notation of “W” on their permanent records. No student may withdraw from a course during a regular semester after the tenth week unless there are extraordinary circumstances (such as documented hospitalization or sickness). In such cases, with the concurrence of both the Dean of Students or designee and the course instructor, a “W” grade may be authorized. Students wishing to withdraw from a course must log onto myFramingham and select the course to drop before the end of the Course Withdrawal period (see semester calendar).  Note: Non-attendance does not constitute a withdrawal. DIRECTED/INDEPENDENT STUDY Directed or Independent Studies allow students the opportunity to study an area in greater depth than available in existing course offerings. A Directed or Independent Study may also be offered when a course existing in the University Catalog is not offered during the semesters the student is enrolled at the University. To enroll in a Directed or Independent Study, a student:   Must be a matriculated undergraduate student in a declared major (undeclared students are not eligible);  Must have a minimum of 16 course-credits completed;  Must have an overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.75 and a GPA of 3.00 in the major;  May enroll in only one Directed or Independent Study in a given semester;  May enroll in no more than three Directed or Independent Studies within undergraduate degree requirements;  May be subject to stricter guidelines in the major department. Check appropriate course description for the major in question for additional criteria;  May be granted exceptions by department chairs in special circumstances. INTERNSHIP AND PRACTICUM A number of departments within the University offer students the opportunity to enroll in an internship or practicum for academic credit. Such experiences provide students with the opportunity to undertake a supervised practical experience. An internship may be completed during any academic term. Students interested in an internship for academic credit should consult with their academic advisor and chair of department offering internship, before the semester in which they propose to begin an internship. Students who want to enroll in an internship must meet departmental internship requirements, as specified in the course description, and submit a written application to the faculty member who will supervise their internship and their department chair for approval. This application must include the following information:  • the academic term during which the internship will be undertaken; • the name of the agency, company, or organization where the internship will be served; • the internship supervisor, including contact information; • the work responsibilities of the student intern; • academic value of the internship experience, including the goal(s) of the internship experience, the total number of hours of the internship, which must meet a minimum of 120 hours for each course-credit, unless a higher minimum is specified in the course description; • a brief description of how the intern will be evaluated.  This information must be submitted on the departmental internship application form. Registration for an internship must be completed by the end of the Course Add/Drop period for the semester in which the internship will be served. As soon as the University Registrar has received the completed and approved internship application, signed by the faculty supervisor and department chair, the application will be processed and the student enrolled into the course.                                                                    ~30~ TRANSFER COURSES (AFTER MATRICULATION) To receive credit for courses taken at other regionally-accredited institutions, matriculated students must obtain approval in advance from appropriate department chairs. Retroactive approval will not be given. Students can view lists of articulated transfer courses by institution using R.A.M.S. (Records Articulation Management System), as maintained by the Office of the University Registrar. Courses displayed are those that have previously been established as equivalent coursework from another institution.  This information can be used to help students academic planning. If an institution or course does not appear in the database, it means it has not yet been added.  Courses not found in the R.A.M.S. database may be transferable and will be considered upon a student’s request using the Off-Campus Course Approval form.  Please note that R.A.M.S. is for reference only. Off-Campus Course Approval forms are available in the Office of the University Registrar or on the web at www.framingham.edu/registrar. Applications for approval of a course should be accompanied by the appropriate catalog description from that institution. After obtaining the appropriate signatures for approval of the course, the student must return the completed form to the Office of the University Registrar. The form will then be reviewed for course credit transferability.  Matriculated undergraduate students may be allowed to transfer up to (3) graduate-level courses taken at Framingham State University or other institutions toward undergraduate degree completion requirements. The Food and Nutrition Department will allow Food and Nutrition senior undergraduate students to substitute a graduate course for an undergraduate major requirement with the approval of the department chair. Transcripts of these approved courses must be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar within six (6) weeks after the completion of the course. It is the student’s responsibility to have official transcripts sent directly by the institution to the Office of the University Registrar. All approved courses transferred into Framingham State University after matriculation will be awarded Framingham course credit in an amount equal to the overall total number of semester hour credits transferred divided by 4 and rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, if students take three 3-credit courses, they will be awarded two (2) Framingham State University course-credits. Transfer credit is given only for courses in which the student received a grade of C- (1.70) or better. A Pass/Fail grade is not transferable. Courses must extend for at least a three-week period and meet a minimum of forty-five hours. Although credit is awarded for all approved transfer courses, the grades will not be recorded on the student’s Framingham State University transcripts nor be counted in computing the grade point average.  Coursework taken at FSU prior to matriculation is treated as transfer work and the grades will not be recorded on the student’s undergraduate transcript nor be counted in computing the grade point average. Students may inquire further when seeking approval of courses to be taken at other institutions, and they will be notified of the total number of course-credits they have earned from such courses whenever additional approved courses are transferred. CHANGE OF MAJOR Any student interested in changing majors or change from undeclared status to a major, these procedures must be followed: 1. Obtain a Change of Major form from the Office of the University Registrar. 2. Meet with the chair of the department in which the desired major is housed. 3. When the Change of Major is approved, the chair of the department will assign a new academic advisor on the form for the student. 4. Students then must obtain the former department chair’s signature on the Change of Major form. (The department chair for Undeclared students is the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs).  5. Students must return the Change of Major form to the Office of the University Registrar.                                                                     ~31~ DECLARING A MAJOR Students are not permitted to register for their junior year without having declared a major except in the case of new transfer students admitted to junior standing as undeclared. These students may delay their declaration of a major for one semester. In either case, extension of undeclared status requires written approval through the office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs. Students may not revert to undeclared status once they have reached junior standing. MID-TERM WARNINGS Major warnings (grade of “F”) and minor warnings (grade of “D”) may be issued to the student at the midpoint of any undergraduate course. These warning grades, if submitted by the course instructor, may be viewed by the student via my.framingham.edu. Warnings may also be issued by the course instructor directly to the student at any time if the student’s work is approaching a less than satisfactory level. EXAMINATIONS 1. All examinations are to be given within the structure of the University policy regarding academic honesty. 2. Examinations, other than the final examinations, may be scheduled at the discretion of the instructor. It is the responsibility of the student to follow whatever procedures are established and presented in writing to the students by the instructor at the start of each semester for such tests. 3. All University courses should have a culminating experience that consists of either a final examination or final course project. Final examinations must take place during the regularly scheduled examination periods. The length of time for the final examination is determined by the course instructor, but it must begin at the regularly scheduled examination time and may not exceed the allotted three (3) hour final exam time block. Final course projects should be due no later than the day and time of the scheduled final examination period for that class. 4.  Students who are absent from a final examination should contact the instructor to discuss the reason for the absence. In accordance with the incomplete policy, a copy of the final examination may be sent to Center for Academic Support and Achievement (CASA). The exam will be administered on posted dates. 5. Examinations and other graded course materials should be made available to students in a timely fashion, in accordance with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974). If retained by faculty, they should be kept until the end of the next academic semester and should be made available for students’ review upon request. STANDARDS FOR ORAL AND WRITTEN PERFORMANCE The University’s policy on oral and written performance in courses is:  1.  Proper use of English is expected of students in all courses requiring oral and/or written work. 2.  Instructors may evaluate students’ oral and written work on the basis of the proper use of English, as well as content. 3.  Instructors will specify their policies for evaluating the proper use of English in course assignments. 4. Students showing major deficiencies in the use of English may be referred to CASA by the instructor.                                                                          ~32~ GRADING SYSTEM Framingham State University uses the following marking system:        Grade Grade Points A  4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B  3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3        Grade Grade Points C  2.0 C- 1.7 D+ 1.3 D  1.0 D- 0.7 F  0.0 AU = (Audit-no credit) A student may audit courses with the consent of the instructor. Such course enrollment will be officially reported on the student’s transcript pending approval by the instructor, but the student will not receive any credit. An auditor may not participate actively in course work. A special approval form for this status must be obtained from the Office of the University Registrar and returned completed by the end of the fifth academic day. P/F = (Pass/Fail) Matriculated undergraduate students attending either the Day School or Evening School (CE) are permitted to take up to two (2) fall or spring courses on a Pass-Fail basis, subject to the following conditions: 1. Only students who have successfully completed 16 course-credits or more are eligible to take a course on a Pass/Fail basis; 2. Only one (1) course may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis in any semester; 3. No course may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis if it is part of the general education requirements, or a major requirement including major-related, or if the course is within the major department; 4. A student may not choose the Pass/Fail option when repeating a course; 5. A student must declare whether a course is Pass/Fail by the last day of the Course Add/Drop period. The student requesting to take a course on a Pass/Fail basis will be notified by the Office of the University Registrar before the end of that business day. If the request is approved, the student may not change status. A student is eligible for Dean’s List if one of four courses has P/F status; 6. A Pass grade grants the student course credit but does not count in computing the student’s GPA. A Failed grade counts as a course attempted with zero points; 7. At the completion of the course when the grade is turned in by the instructor, the University Registrar will convert the letter grade and record only “P” (Pass) or “F” (Fail) on the permanent academic record. The original letter grade is kept by the University Registrar and may be released only with the written permission of the student; 8. Pass/Fail will be interpreted in accordance with the present grading system. “F” will be fail and all other grades will be pass. S/U= (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) This grade is used only for student teaching experience. W = Withdrawal from a Course. Indicates withdrawal from a semester course in the third through the tenth week of the semester, or for a quarter course, no later than the end of the fourth full week of the quarter.  WX = Withdrawal from the University after the Course Add/Drop period but before the end of the tenth week of the semester. The student has officially withdrawn from the University and no longer attends classes.  MG = Missing Grade. Final grade not yet submitted by the faculty. NG = Non-Graded course. IR/IC = (Incomplete Requested/Incomplete Contract Submitted) This is a temporary grade designation that has no impact on the student’s grade point average.                                                                     ~33~ GRADE POINT AVERAGE Only the undergraduate coursework taken post-matriculation at Framingham State University through the Day School or Continuing Education (including intersession and summer terms) will be used in determining the grade point average (GPA) of any student. The number of grade points that a student receives in a course is determined by the letter grade (see section on Grading System for explanation of grade points). The grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points by the total number of course-credits attempted at the University, by semester or overall total. The grade point average (GPA) for each semester and overall is presented in three digits, one before and two after the decimal point. In the case of suspended/dismissed students, undergraduate coursework taken through Continuing Education will be evaluated for posting at the time of readmission to the University. Courses that are academically inappropriate for Day School programs are automatically inhibited and are not calculated in the GPA. Therefore, to receive credit for 600-level courses, students must obtain prior written approval from their major department chairs. Failure to do so will result in denial of course credit toward the degree, as 600-level courses are not automatically applied to the baccalaureate degree. Students must have achieved a minimum final overall grade point average of 2.00 in order to graduate. Effective Fall 2007, completion of a baccalaureate degree at Framingham State University requires that all students achieve a minimum 2.00 grade point average in their major requirements, including major-related courses taken for fulfillment of major requirements as well as University residency requirements. Effective Fall 2018, completion of a minor requires that all students achieve a minimum 2.00 grade point average in their minor requirements as well as University residency requirements. COURSE REPEAT POLICY The only courses that may be repeated are courses in which a student receives a grade of “B-” (2.70) or lower.  Students who wish to repeat courses in which they received a grade of C, C+, or B-, will not be permitted to enroll in the course until the first day of the semester, dependent upon seat availability.  All grades, including those earned in repeated courses, will remain on the academic transcript. Students must bear in mind that the same course has to be repeated and that only the most recent grade, whether higher or lower than the original grade earned, will be the grade calculated in the GPA. Continuing courses in which “F” grades have been received must be repeated successfully before the student may take advanced work except when departmental policy permits otherwise. Only grades from Framingham State University courses can be used to recalculate the GPA when repeating courses and students are reminded that only Framingham State University grades are used in determining the GPA. Transfer coursework does not replace grades earned at the University. INCOMPLETE GRADE POLICY The IC grade may be given to a student when the instructor is satisfied that circumstances beyond the student’s control prevented the student from completing the required work for the course. The grade of IC may only be awarded if it is mathematically possible for the student to pass the course with the completion of the remaining work. An incomplete cannot be considered until after the course withdrawal deadline has passed. The student must submit a Request for Incomplete form to the instructor no later than the last day of the semester. If the instructor agrees with the request, they shall complete and sign the form. If extenuating circumstances prevent the student from completing the request form, the faculty member may initiate the incomplete request. An incomplete grade may not be considered passing for purposes of determining federal financial aid eligibility, athletic eligibility, or other purposes.  Faculty are required to assign the final grade that would be issued at the end of the semester (i.e., the final grade that will be issued if the student does not complete the work indicated on the incomplete contract form). The student and the faculty member shall agree upon a deadline for the completion of course work. The agreed upon deadline shall be no later the end of spring break for fall and wintersession courses, September 1st for spring courses and October 1st for summer courses.                                                                     ~34~ ELIGIBILITY FOR ATHLETICS Students participating in intercollegiate athletics must carry a full-time academic course load throughout the entire semester (minimum of three course-credits) and be in good academic standing. All athletes must pass six (6) course-credits (24 semester hours) during each year of attendance. In addition, to be eligible for intercollegiate athletics, all student athletes must pass 24 semester hours (6 credit-bearing courses) within one calendar year of enrollment (September 1st to September 1st, or January 1st to January 1st if enrolled spring semester). All students must take a minimum of 12 semester hours (3 credit-bearing courses) during their season(s) of competition to be eligible to compete in athletics. ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENT LEADERSHIP  To hold any class or student organization office, students must be matriculated undergraduate students enrolled in a minimum of two course-credits per semester, and be in good academic standing. Eligibility for student participation on the following university-wide governance committees is subject to the Massachusetts State College Association (MSCA) Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Day School Faculty. The Student Government Association selects all student representatives to serve on governance committees as outlined in Article VII Section B.1.b of the MSCA contract. These students must be matriculated and enrolled full-time.      All University Committee (AUC) – Three (3) student representatives      Standing Committees (student representatives must have junior or senior standing): University Curriculum Committee (UCC) – Three (3) student representatives Academic Policies Committee (APC) – Three (3) student representatives Student Affairs Committee (SAC) – Nine (9) student representatives   GRADE APPEAL POLICY The University recognizes that the instructor has the right to determine course evaluation policies. The instructor’s grading policy will be designated in the course syllabus distributed at the beginning of the semester. It is the instructor’s responsibility to grade student work in a manner consistent with those procedures published in the syllabus.  The following procedure is employed in the event that students wish to appeal a final grade based on a mechanical error in calculation or if there is reason to believe that the grade was calculated in a manner inconsistent with the course syllabus. Level I: Informal Within the first month of the semester following the semester of the course in which the final grade is questioned, students will pursue their concerns on the informal level, as designated below. Every effort will be made to resolve the students’ concerns informally at Level I. Step One: Faculty Students make an appointment with faculty to discuss their concerns about the final grade in question. The instructor is the authority in evaluating the quality of student coursework. The basis for a possible appeal is inconsistency with grading procedures specified in the course syllabus. In many cases this meeting with the instructor can be a learning experience that provides an understanding of the way that the grade was derived. Step Two: Department Chair   If the students’ concerns are not resolved in the meeting with the instructor, students may proceed to Step Two, Informal and will meet with the chairperson of the department in which the course was offered. The department chair will work to seek a resolution of the grade appeal at the informal level.                                                                     ~35~ Level II: Formal  Step One: Dean of Students If the students’ concerns are not resolved through at the informal level, students may appeal the grade, in writing, with the Dean of Students or designee prior to the end of the sixth week in the fall semester for courses taken in the prior spring or summer session, or prior to the end of the sixth week in the spring semester for courses taken in the prior fall or intersession.  Taking into account, in a fair and timely fashion, all matters and considerations related to the dispute, the Dean of Students will determine whether or not the student has a basis for appeal. If the dean decides there is no basis for appeal, the matter will be concluded.  If the Dean decides there is a basis for appeal, the matter will be forwarded with all forms and any other pertinent materials to the chair of the All University Committee (ACC) in a sealed envelope identified only by academic year filed, the grade appeal number, the administrator transmitting the form, and the date.  The Dean of Students or designee notifies the Vice President of Academic Affairs that the appeal has been forwarded to ACC. Step Two: Faculty Governance The Chair of the All-College Committee logs the appeal and forwards the unopened envelope to the Chair of the Academic Policies Committee (APC). After consultation with the administrator transmitting the appeal, the Chair of APC appoints an ad hoc grade appeal committee consisting of three (3) faculty members/librarians serving on APC. No Member of the committee may be from the department offering the course whose grade is being appealed, nor from the department of the instructor involved. Step Three - The Ad Hoc Grade Appeal Committee and the Appeal Procedure  As part of the process, the Ad Hoc Grade Appeal Committee may consult with the student, the instructor, and the chair of the instructor’s department. If the Ad Hoc Grade Appeal Committee determines that a change in grade may be warranted, the committee will inform the chair and will consult with the instructor prior to making its recommendation to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. (Note: the instructor will provide the course syllabus and grading procedures. If grading criteria are not stated clearly or are complicated, the instructor should submit the method for calculating the final grade.) The Ad Hoc Grade Appeal Committee must submit a written recommendation (either that “the Committee supports the grade as originally recorded” or that “the instructor should review the grade in question”) in a sealed envelope along with the appeal documentation for the Vice President of Academic Affairs within one month of receipt of the committee charge. The Chair of the Academic Policies Committee receives the sealed envelope from the Ad Hoc Grade Appeal Committee, logs it, and forwards it unopened to the Chair of the All College Committee, who, in turn, forwards it unopened to the Vice President. For administrative reasons, the Ad Hoc Grade Appeal Committee’s recommendation must be forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs at least three weeks prior to the end of the academic year. The Vice President of Academic Affairs will convey the Ad Hoc Grade Appeal Committee’s recommendation to the instructor and the student. If the committee recommends that “the instructor should review the grade in question,” the Vice President will ask the instructor to review the grade and to inform the Vice-President of the outcome. If the review results in an unchanged grade, the Vice President has the authority to change the grade in such cases where there has been a mechanical error in calculation or if there is reason to believe that the grade has been calculated in a manner inconsistent with the stated grading criteria of the faculty, the department, and the University. The appeal ends at this point.                                                                      ~36~ UNIVERSITY POLICY REGARDING ACADEMIC HONESTY Integrity is essential to academic life. Consequently, students who enroll at Framingham State University agree to maintain high standards of academic honesty and scholarly practice. They shall be responsible for familiarizing themselves with the published policies and procedures regarding academic honesty.  In addition to the required statement, faculty members shall, at their discretion, include in the course syllabus additional statements relating the definition of academic honesty to their courses Infractions of the Policy on Academic Honesty include, but are not limited to: 1. Plagiarism: claiming as one’s own work the published or unpublished literal or paraphrased work of another. It should be recognized that plagiarism is not only academically dishonest but also illegal; 2. Cheating on exams, tests, quizzes, assignments, and papers, including the giving or acceptance of these materials and other sources of information without the permission of the instructor(s); 3. Unauthorized collaboration with other individuals in the preparation of course assignments; 4. Submitting without authorization the same assignment for credit in more than one course; 5.   Use of dishonest procedures in computer, laboratory, studio, or field work; 6. Misuse of the University’s technical facilities (computer machinery, laboratories, media equipment, etc.), either maliciously or for personal gain; 7. Falsification of forms used to document the academic record and to conduct the academic business of the University. Procedures for Handling Cases of Alleged Infractions of Academic  Faculty are expected to report each infraction to the Dean of Students for record-keeping purposes. This allows the University to track students who have repeated violations of the Academic Honesty Policy.  Once the infraction is reported to the Dean of Students, the faculty member will be informed of whether the infraction is a first, second, or third violation, in order to correctly note this on the infraction form. In the case of a student’s first or second alleged infraction of the academic honesty policy, every effort should be made to resolve the matter directly between the instructor and student. The instructor will confront the student with the allegation of dishonesty and take appropriate action. Appropriate penalties for a first infraction range from re- submission of the work in question to failing the course, as determined by the instructor. Appropriate penalties for a second infraction range from failing the work in question to failing the course. If, however, an instructor feels that the severity of the alleged infraction warrants dismissal from the college prior to the third offense, the instructor may request a hearing, which will be conducted per the process described below. In the case of the third alleged infraction of the academic honesty policy, the involved instructor will impose the course penalty and forward all evidence and appropriate documentation of the alleged infraction to the Dean of Students, who will convene a hearing body.  The hearing body shall consist of the Dean of Students and two faculty members, one from a department other than that of the department of the involved instructor.  The Dean shall, in consultation with members of the hearing body, review all of the student’s academic honesty infractions (including the current incident) and impose a penalty of dismissal from the University.  In unusual circumstances, the hearing body may determine, as a group, that a lesser penalty shall be imposed.  Only a penalty of dismissal can be appealed. Such an appeal will be made to the University Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs within three (3) business days of notification of the penalty. NOTE: Notification of the alleged infraction must be submitted to the Dean of Students within a week of the infraction. Upon resolution of the infraction, all documentation regarding the academic honesty policy violation will be maintained by the Dean of Students.                                                                      ~37~ SEMESTER HONORS Dean’s List A matriculated undergraduate student carrying a minimum of three (3) course-credits in a fall or spring term earns a place on this honor roll (published after the end of every fall and spring semester) for each semester in which the student earns a GPA of 3.30 or higher. A student is eligible for Dean’s List if one of the four courses has “P/F” status. President’s List A matriculated undergraduate student carrying a minimum of three (3) course-credits in a fall or spring term earns a place on this honor roll (published after the end of every fall and spring semester) after earning a GPA of 3.30 or higher for each of three (3) consecutive semesters. The student must maintain this average to remain on the list. Additional Eligibility Limitations A student obtaining either an “IC” grade or an extension for an “N” grade is not initially eligible for the Dean’s/President’s List but may petition in writing to the Office of the University Registrar to have their eligibility for the Dean’s/President’s List reviewed once the final grade has been submitted. Petitions must occur by the end of the semester that the grade was submitted. ACADEMIC STANDING Academic Standing is the status that a student earns from their educational studies at an institution of higher education. Academic Standing at FSU is calculated at the end of the.  Good Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing, an undergraduate student must maintain an overall GPA as follows:   Number of Course-Credits Completed                 Minimum GPA   (includes transfer course-credit equivalents) 1 - 8      1.70 9 or more     2.00 In order to graduate from the University, a student must have an overall GPA of at least 2.00 and at least a 2.00 GPA in the major. Some departments or colleges may have additional graduation requirements, including higher GPA required in the major.  Academic Probation After grades are recorded at the end of each semester, students who have not achieved the minimum overall grade point average (GPA) for the number of courses completed are placed on academic probation for the following semester A student on Academic Probation must meet with their academic advisor within the first week of classes to review program requirements, course selection, course load, and commitments outside the classroom.  Students who are on Academic Probation will have their overall GPA recalculated after completing an incomplete, a grade change, or a summer or wintersession course at FSU. This may result in students moving to good academic standing following the summer or wintersession terms. During a probationary period, students need more time to focus on their academics, therefore they:  1. May carry no more than the normal academic load (4 courses). 2. May participate in clubs, societies, or organizations officially recognized by the University, but they may not hold or run for office. 3. May not serve on University governance committees. 4. May participate in club or intramural athletics, but they may not participate in intercollegiate athletics.                                                                    ~38~ Extended Probation  A student may be granted additional semesters of probation referred to as Extended Probation. Extended probation will be granted if the student’s semester GPA is a minimum of 2.00 even if the overall GPA remains below the minimum required GPA. Students should be aware that new courses completed at FSU during the probationary semester will add to the total number of courses, possibly raising the required minimum overall GPA to a higher level. Courses that are repeated count only once in the number of courses and only the most recent grade counts for GPA calculation. Academic Suspension Students who do not earn a minimum semester GPA of 2.00 during the any probationary semester may be suspended). If, within three (3) semesters, a student on academic probation fails to increase the overall grade point average (GPA) to the minimum required, the student may be suspended from the University. If a student is suspended from the University, the period of such suspension is one academic semester (fall or spring), during which the student is not a matriculated degree candidate at Framingham State University. However, a suspended student may enroll as a non-matriculated student in courses offered through the Evening School (CE) or Day School, including summer and wintersession courses as a non-matriculated student. Students who raise their overall GPA above the minimum required may apply for readmission to the University. Please note: Courses taken at other institutions will not change the FSU GPA. Suspended students should monitor their GPA and select appropriate courses with the Advising Center. Suspended students may also earn credit for courses taken at other institutions. However, consistent with the University’s policy on transfer courses, grades from other institutions are not counted in computing the GPA, and therefore do not constitute a grade repeat. Students taking courses off-campus are therefore advised to enroll only in new courses that have not been previously attempted at Framingham State University. Suspension Appeals  Students who receive a letter announcing their suspension may petition the Academic Standing Committee for special consideration of reinstatement to continue for another semester. Students must submit a Request for Readmission Appeal Form, within the time frame indicated in the letter of suspension, in order to be considered for reinstatement by the Academic Standing Committee. Readmission after Academic Suspension 1. If a student has been suspended from the University for academic reasons, the student may request readmission. Applications for such readmission will be reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee. 2. Students who, for academic reasons, are suspended a second time are not eligible for readmission except under the Fresh Start Policy. 3. Students who have been suspended must follow the degree requirements stated in the University Catalog at the time of return or under special circumstances, the catalog in effect when they were first admitted.   SOCIAL SUSPENSION Students may also be suspended for social reasons, as outlined in the RAM Student Handbook. Readmission after Social Suspension A student who is Expelled for social reasons may not apply for Readmission.  If a student has been suspended from the University for social reasons, the student may request Readmission at the end of the social suspension period by sending a letter or email to the Dean of Students requesting Readmission. The student may not be considered for Readmission if the Dean of Students determines the social suspension must remain in force for a further length of time.                                                                      ~39~ Students who receive permission from the Dean of Students for Readmission must complete the Readmission application to resume degree-seeking coursework at the University. Students who have been suspended for social reasons must follow the degree requirements stated in the University Catalog at the time of return.  ACADEMIC FRESH START READMISSION POLICY Fresh Start Readmission Policy: Any student who has separated from Framingham State University due to voluntary withdrawal in good standing with an overall grade point average at or above 1.70 and less than a 2.00, or due to academic suspension/dismissal and had an overall grade point average below 2.00 at the time of separation is eligible to apply for readmission under the Fresh Start policy under certain conditions:  The period of separation from the University must be at least two (2) consecutive semesters.  The student supplies evidence of personal growth during the period of separation, in the form of two letters of recommendation. Applicants to Fresh Start will be reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee (ASC).  Applications will be due August 1st for Fall semester and December 1st for Spring semester.  When a student is accepted under the Fresh Start Policy, the previous Grade Point Average (GPA) will be cleared. Only courses taken after Fresh Start readmission will count toward the GPA. Previous courses in which a grade of C- (1.7) or better was earned will count as transfer credit toward graduation requirements but will not factor into the student’s GPA. Under the Fresh Start policy, students must complete at least eight (8) FSU courses, five (5) in the major, with an overall GPA of 2.00 in order to receive an undergraduate degree from FSU. The Fresh Start policy may be exercised only once. Once a student exercises the Fresh Start, it may not be rescinded. The student’s academic transcript will note the readmission status as Academic Fresh Start along with the semester the status commenced.   WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY In the event that a student wishes to withdraw from the University, these procedures must be followed: 1. A Withdrawal from the University form must be obtained from the Office of the Dean of Students and signatures obtained on the form from the following offices, in the order indicated: A. Dean of Students (or designee)  B. Student Accounts Office  C. Financial Aid Office D. Residence Life (if in residence hall) E. Office of the University Registrar 2. Students officially withdrawing from the University after the Course Add/Drop period and before the deadline of the Course Withdrawal period (prior to the end of the tenth week of the semester; see semester calendar) will receive a notation of “WX” in all courses. If a student chooses to withdraw from the University after the tenth week of the semester, s/he will receive a final grade in all courses. Students with extraordinary circumstances (such as documented hospitalization or sickness) should consult with the Dean of Students.  3. All forms must be returned to the Office of the University Registrar. Note: A student is not officially withdrawn from the University until the appropriate form has been completed and has been validated by the Office of the University Registrar. Non-attendance does not constitute withdrawal from the University.  4. Students should refer to the University’s policy on refunds as outlined in the University Expenses section of this catalog.                                                                       ~40~ Reinstatement after Withdrawal from the University A student who voluntarily withdraws from the University without completing baccalaureate studies may request to return to the University as a degree-seeking student via Reinstatement.  This includes students who were in good academic standing or on academic probation at the time of their voluntary withdrawal (note: students who were later suspended must submit a Readmission application).  Students who have been withdrawn for more than one (1) semester must follow degree requirements stated in the University Catalog at the time of return.  Reinstated students must satisfy outstanding student conduct code sanctions and outstanding Student Account balances prior to their return to the University.   SEMESTER LEAVE OF ABSENCE - UNDERGRADUATE A Leave of Absence (LOA) is a temporary interruption of one's studies at Framingham State University (FSU) for either the Fall or Spring semester of the Academic Year (Intersession and Summer terms are excluded) for which the matriculated undergraduate student does not choose to enroll in classes.  A Leave of Absence is related only to the student’s continued enrollment at the University and is not recognized by federal regulations. Students may choose to request a Leave of Absence (LOA) from the university for a period of time not to exceed two consecutive semesters at a time. A student may request up to four (4) Leaves of Absence (LOA) during their enrollment at the University.  Students granted an LOA retain their admitted student status and remain eligible for the following privileges: • Retain the university requirements in place for their academic programs at the time of their first semester at Framingham State University (FSU); • FSU student e-mail and myFramingham access; • Priority and self-registration for the approved semester of return. Students granted LOA are not considered registered students and as non-enrolled students are not eligible for: • Financial aid disbursements during the semesters while on LOA. Students on an LOA are reported to lenders and loan service agencies as "not enrolled" and need to contact lenders for information on possible repayment requirements; • Enrollment verification since they are reported as "not enrolled," which could affect eligibility for health insurance, etc.; • Use of Campus Facilities, Fitness Center, Computer Labs, Student Health Services, or Whittemore Library access and borrowing privileges; • Campus Housing during their LOA; • Participation in varsity or intramural athletics, student clubs or any FSU sponsored activity or organization; Prior to returning from a Leave of Absence, a student is expected to: • Meet with their academic advisor; • Address any outstanding financial obligations to the University; • Register for courses prior to the start of the semester in which the student is returning;  • Follow the degree requirements as identified in the catalog at the time the student originally matriculated. The academic department chair may authorize an exception. NOTE: Students who do not return following the approved term for their LOA, or those students who did not apply for LOA, are no longer considered matriculated and need to request reinstatement to the University if they wish to continue their coursework. Reinstated students do not retain their original Catalog year program requirements and must follow the most current requirements for the degree and their major.                                                                    ~41~ Eligibility Requirements To be considered for a Leave of Absence, students must be eligible to register for classes and meet the following criteria: 1. Be a matriculated degree-seeking undergraduate student; 2. Be registered during the semester immediately prior to the beginning of the LOA; 3. Students who are participating in an FSU-sponsored study abroad program need not apply for an LOA; however, students who are participating in a non-FSU-sponsored study abroad program should take advantage of the LOA policy, if eligible; 4. Be eligible to attend the upcoming semester - cannot be on academic suspension at the end of the semester immediately prior to the beginning of the LOA; 5. Have no hold(s) (e.g., pending disciplinary status, financial, etc.) which would restrict registration. Note: Students with financial holds cannot be given consideration for an LOA. Timeline If a student requests the LOA before the end of the add/drop period, the request must be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar no later than the end of the Course Add/Drop period for the fall or spring semester. The University Registrar makes the final decision to approve or deny a request for an LOA based on the aforementioned criteria. Students requesting a Leave of Absence after the end of the Course Add/Drop and before the deadline to Withdraw from the University before will need to submit the request to the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students makes the final decision to approve or deny a request for an LOA after consulting with the University Registrar. Registration information will be sent to the FSU email account and personal email account on file prior to the start of the next registration period and also approximately two weeks prior to the term the student is scheduled to return. In order to remain active in the program before the Leave expires, the student must enroll in courses for the upcoming semester. The student may request to extend the Personal Leave of Absence for one (1) consecutive semester and must do so before the end of the Course Add/Drop period. Should the student not register once the Leave expires, the student will become Inactive (non-matriculated) at the University and will need to request reinstatement in order to resume their program of study.                                                                                            ~42~ DEGREE COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS Completion of a minimum of 32 course-credits to include general education and major (and minor, if any) requirements in accordance with the Course Residency Policy as well as earn an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.00.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD The Framingham State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) is responsible for protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in research conducted at FSU.  The FSU IRB reviews research in the following three categories: 1. Research that is federally funded; 2. Research for which the sponsoring agency requires federal-level institutional review; and 3. Research that is voluntarily submitted by an applicant(s) for a federal-level institutional review. It is expected that individuals conducting research associated with the University do so in accordance with the highest ethical and moral standards and accepted practices within their disciplines. Information about the FSU IRB and IRB-related documents may be accessed at the following http://www.framingham.edu/.  POLICY ON AUTHORSHIP  The following guidelines and best practices serve to set community standards for the valuable intellectual work that students and faculty at Framingham State University do together. As a primarily undergraduate institution that sets teaching and mentoring as a priority, the University holds that faculty and student collaborations are of great importance for our educational mission, and that are recognized and valued as part of the work that faculty do in order to fulfill the spirit and letter of our contract with the institution. Since faculty and student collaborations are happening daily as we engage in projects and inquiry in our classes, together they contribute to creative and analytical projects that are shared with wider audiences—either in conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, or other forms of publication, including online sharing, shows, and performances.  These proposed guidelines are shared with the understanding that our accomplishments as scholar/teachers in a primarily teaching institution include institutional recognition of and value for the work of mentoring student research through faculty and staff authorship and shared creative and research endeavors.                                                                    ~44~Acknowledgement of shared faculty and student work  Discussion about the amount and kind of credit to be given should occur at the start of an association between faculty or staff and students so that expectations are clear and the faculty or staff member and student can develop a shared understanding of what each person’s obligations and recognition will be. It is recognized that these arrangements may change over time and discussion should be re-opened at that time.  Guidelines for acknowledgement of student contributions to faculty work  Since it is a stated goal of this university to foster faculty-student collaboration and undergraduate research, these guidelines should be read to include rather than exclude students as co-authors of faculty publications. In this context, “publication” refers to papers, presentations and creative activities published in peer-reviewed professional journals, exhibitions, and/or festivals; projects and research presented at professional meetings and symposia; and performances outside the campus community. It does not include publications or exhibits in strictly “undergraduate” journals or shows.  Students should be considered as authors or co-authors when a project is substantially completed by the student, including data collection, analysis, writing of the final report, and executing creative production (e.g. capstone project, independent study, senior thesis), rather than a project for which the student only performs some closely supervised task (e.g. data transcription, routine data collection). In the latter case, students should be acknowledged but not listed as co-authors. If such work is contributed by all or most members of a class, perhaps even over several semesters, the faculty member should acknowledge, for example, the “Fall 2011-Fall 2013 classes in Anatomy and Physiology at Framingham State University.”  Frequently, it is necessary to combine the results of several student projects, often over several years, to produce a final product that is worthy of publication. Under these circumstances, the faculty member will need to write the final paper, combining information and analysis from several student projects. The faculty member should be first author of such papers, with the students as co-authors.  Guidelines for acknowledgement of faculty or staff contributions to student work  Faculty, as teachers and mentors, promote student learning and scholarship. As part of their teaching, faculty members commonly suggest topics for further study and advise students on methodologies that could be used in their course work. Faculty members also routinely assist students in their research/creative work and writing by providing detailed comments and critiques, by proposing alternative ways of communicating an idea, and by editing drafts. This by itself does not necessarily entitle the faculty to co-authorship. However, faculty members have a right to expect to be acknowledged and/or cited for their ideas and assistance. All authors, whether student or faculty members, have an obligation to properly cite works used and to credit ideas suggested to them by others, from both published and unpublished sources (e.g., oral communication).  Authorship credit should be based on intellectual contribution. Editing of a paper alone, does not confer co‐authorship on the faculty member or editor. Acknowledgment of this assistance is appropriate. Editing that goes beyond simple correction of grammar, spelling, and punctuation in order to clarify meaning or to introduce new ideas or interpretation does make an intellectual contribution for which co‐authorship would be appropriate. The names of the authors should be listed in the order of their relative contributions to the publication (including research design, data acquisition, art/design direction, analysis and preparation of the manuscript, and production of creative projects). PRIVACY RIGHTS OF PARENTS AND STUDENTS Parents and students are hereby notified that Framingham State University complies with the provisions of federal laws governing the privacy and disclosure of student information. The University has adopted a policy for assuring this privacy. This policy defines types and locations of educational records, stipulates students’ and parents’ rights, describes procedures for parents and students to review and inspect educational records, and provides a procedure to file complaints concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the federal law.

Students are able to choose this option of graduating with the B.S.Ed. only in the final month of the final semester prior to the expected graduation date. Students who do not meet the DESE requirements or the University requirements will not be able to choose this option and will no longer have the coordinate education major listed on their academic record. *This programs require students to have completed an associate’s degree in the field.                                                                           ~54~ MAJORS, CONCENTRATIONS, AND MINORS   Major: A program of study which cannot exceed 20 course-credits.  The faculty prescribes the courses in the major field of study. The courses that constitute the major include all the major courses, required-related courses, and professional education courses.    Coordinate Major: A program of study offered by the Education Department leading to Initial Licensure in Elementary Education and Early Childhood Education. Students enrolled in this program major in the Interdisciplinary Major in Liberal Arts and Sciences or in a traditional discipline.   Concentration: A focused program of courses within the major. Generally, a concentration provides the student with a proficiency or competency in a specialty area within the major field.   Minor: A minor constitutes a program of study less extensive than that of a major. Although minors do not qualify as degree programs, approved minors are recorded on the transcript of a student who successfully completes the requirements. Minors are awarded only with the completion of a degree.  Within a broad range of purposes, a minor may:  provide an academic emphasis in a department or provide a program of study in an interdisciplinary area,  offer students an opportunity to pursue interests different from their major field, and  help students to enhance their job potential upon graduation.  Minimum standards for acceptance into and completion of minors are the same as for majors. Specifically:  A minimum of three (3) course-credits for the minor requirements must be completed in residence. Minor residency requirements may be partially fulfilled by courses taken through FSU Study Abroad Program. Such cases require approval by the appropriate department chair.  A minimum GPA of 2.00 must be earned in the courses used for the minor.  A student may not complete a minor in their major field of study.   COURSE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS Degree: To complete the University residence requirement, a minimum of eight (8) course-credits (32 semester hours) must be taken post-matriculation at the University.  Major: To complete a major requirement, a minimum of five (5) course-credits (20 semester hours) in the major department must be taken post-matriculation at the University. Major residency requirements may be partially fulfilled by courses taken through FSU Study Abroad program.  Such cases require approval by the  appropriate department chair. Minor: To complete a minor requirement, a minimum of three (3) course-credits (12 semester hours) in the minor department must be taken post-matriculation at the University. Minor residency requirements may be partially fulfilled by courses taken through FSU Study Abroad program.  Such cases require approval by the appropriate department chair.                                                                          ~55~ PROGRAMS OF STUDY Framingham State University offers 36 majors, including several interdisciplinary programs. Major, concentration, and minor requirements for specific disciplines are described in the department sections, which follow. The courses listed in each section are currently being offered within departments and programs. Many introductory courses are offered each semester or yearly; some courses are offered in alternate years. To ensure timely completion of requirements, students are encouraged to consult with their faculty advisor or department chair in planning their sequence of courses.

UNDECLARED MAJOR A candidate for admission to Framingham State University may elect not to declare a major. Students who are admitted as undeclared students are encouraged to view their status as an opportunity to explore a range of fields of interest. Undeclared students must apply for a specific major prior to the onset of the junior year. The Associate Dean of Academic Affairs serves as chair of undeclared students.  Undeclared students are encouraged to visit the Advising Center in O’Connor Hall for help in curriculum planning and exploration of possible majors. In addition, the Career Resource Center in the McCarthy Campus Center sponsors career workshops and offers individual career counseling that is particularly helpful to undeclared students.   PRE-PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS PRE-HEALTH STUDIES CURRICULUM FOR STUDENTS INTERESTED IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS Advisors:  Aline M. Davis, Biology Department   Sarah Pilkenton, Chemistry & Food Science Department Individuals interested in careers in the medical health professions should have a minimum of one full year of the following course groups: college biology, introductory chemistry, organic chemistry and physics. To enroll in physics, students must have completed or be enrolled in Calculus I. Majoring in either Biology (Pre-Health) or Chemistry (with Biology minor) fulfills most or all of these course areas. Many of the required or recommended pre-professional courses are fulfilled through appropriate selections from the General Education program at Framingham State University, including courses in English composition and literature, psychology, and sociology. However, many professional programs require additional courses in biology and biochemistry.                                                                    ~59~Pre-professional students should meet with one of the pre-professional curriculum advisors no later than their sophomore year and continue to meet periodically. This contact will ensure that students complete the specific requirements for the professional programs to which they intend to submit applications, since each program and institution has varying admissions requirements. Note that particularly strong graduating grade-point averages are required for competitive applications to professional schools. PRE-ENGINEERING Advisor: Kristen Chon, Physics and Earth Science Department This program, in cooperation with the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, and University of Massachusetts-Amherst, establishes a freshman and sophomore curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in one of the engineering disciplines. A typical student accepted into this program will study for two years at Framingham State University and complete the program at one of the universities, earning the degree from that institution. Pre-engineering students who complete the program with a “B” average (GPA = 3.00 or better) are guaranteed admission in the engineering program at each university campus. Those students with a “C” average will probably be accepted, but their transfer cannot be guaranteed. Other students may choose to remain at Framingham and complete their program of studies in a major such as biology, chemistry, or computer science. (For further information see Physics and Earth Sciences section.)  PRE-LAW Advisor:  Christopher P. McCarthy- Latimer, Political Science Department Since law schools do not require or recommend specific undergraduate majors, the University does not offer a prescribed pre-law program, although the Political Science Department offers a minor in law and politics. Students are encouraged to choose a major and courses that emphasize reading, writing, and speaking, as well as analytical skills. Students contemplating a career in law should plan their curriculum under the guidance of both major and pre-law advisors.  3 + 3 BACHELOR’S/JURIS DOCTORATE PROGRAMS Suffolk Law School The 3+3 program enables students to attend Suffolk Law School after three years of study at Framingham State University (FSU). This is an accelerated program that allows the participants to complete their undergraduate studies and law degree in six (6) years.  Courses that students take in their first year of law school will count as free electives at FSU, which will allow them to complete their undergraduate degree requirements. Students choosing an accelerated program or those choosing to complete their undergraduate general education and major program requirements in three (3) years would be eligible. The Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science is awarded following the successful completion of the first year of law school (as noted on an official transcript sent from Suffolk University).  Interested students should meet with their major academic adviser and the Pre-Law Advisor no later than the start of their sophomore year in order to determine that they can complete all necessary undergraduate courses and credits by the end of their Junior year. The Pre-Law Advisor for Framingham State University is Dr. Christopher McCarthy-Latimer. Selected students start at Suffolk University Law School after their junior year at Framingham State University.  Students may apply to the Suffolk Law School program no later than April 1st of their junior year at FSU.   Matriculation Requirements to Suffolk University Law School  Maintain at least a 3.30 overall GPA while at FSU;  Obtain a Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score equal to or greater than the Suffolk University Law School’s median score of the prior year;  Provide at least one (1) letter of academic recommendation from an FSU faculty member by January 1st prior to the fall start in law school;                                                                    ~60~ Submit a completed Suffolk University Law School application no later than April 1st of their junior year at FSU (Suffolk University Law School will waive the application fee);  Complete required Framingham courses before beginning at the law school, including all major program requirements and General Education requirements, which need to be completed by the end of the student’s junior year. University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth Law School The 3+3 program enables students to attend University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth Law School (UMass Law) after three years of study at Framingham State University (FSU). This is an accelerated program that allows the participants to complete their undergraduate studies and law degree in six (6) years.  Courses that students take in their first year of law school will count as free electives at FSU, which will allow them to complete their undergraduate degrees.  The program is very demanding and geared towards a select group of students.  Students who demonstrate a commitment to the mission of Framingham and UMass Law are highly appropriate candidates. Students choosing an accelerated program or those choosing to complete their degree requirements in three (3) years would be eligible. The Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science is awarded following the completion of the first year of law school.   Selected students start at UMass Law after their junior year at Framingham State University.  Students may apply to the UMass Law program at:  the end of the 1st semester of their freshman year or,  the end of 2nd semester freshman year or,  the end of the 1st semester of their sophomore year or,  the 2nd semester of their sophomore year.   Completion of the program will yield a baccalaureate degree from Framingham as well as a juris doctor from UMass Law. Matriculation Requirements to UMass Law  In compliance with American Bar Association Standard 502, successful completion by the end of the junior year of at least three-fourths of the credits leading to a bachelor’s degree (i.e., the students must complete at least 24 graduation credits or 96 hours);  Earned a 3.00 grade point average (GPA) during the three years of FSU undergraduate study;  Satisfied all major requirements;  Satisfied all general education requirements;  A minimum score of 150 on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT);  Satisfy the character and fitness requirements appropriate for admission to law school;  Fulfillment of all admissions requirements normally imposed by UMass Law, including but not limited to: o Completing a law school application for basic information and to register for the Credential Assembly Service (CAS) through the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) by December of the student’s junior year at FSU;  An accepted student to the UMass Law Program can defer for one year without penalty.  The student has to enroll the following year.  If not, the student will no longer be in the UMass Law Program;   Failure to meet the above criteria will result in the student being withdrawn from the 3+3 program.  These students may apply through the regular process as a candidate for admission to the law school following the completion of his/her undergraduate degree.   If a student is lacking one or two courses to satisfy their degree or general education requirements, they may be given the summer session following their junior year to complete these courses.                                                                      ~61~ 4 + 1 BACHELOR’S/MASTER’S PROGRAMS  Bachelor of Science with a major in Biology/Professional Science Master’s with a concentration in Biotechnology (BS/PSM) This program combines undergraduate and graduate training in a scientific discipline, plus the components of business and regulatory training. This will prepare undergraduate Biology majors for a career in the pharmaceutical industry, government or healthcare industry, with just one additional year of school to complete the Professional Science Master's with a concentration in Biotechnology, specialization in Quality Assurance. The BS/PSM degrees program can be completed in a period of five years - four undergraduate years and one year of graduate studies - and is intended to focus on training highly motivated undergraduate juniors with applicable scientific and professional skills for the biotech industry.  Bachelor of Arts with a major in English/Master of Arts with a concentration in English (BA/MA) This program prepares students for high school or community college teaching, as well as graduate studies in English at the Ph.D. level, pre-professional studies in law and library science, and for careers in communications, public relations, publishing, marketing, information sciences, human resources, and business and public administration. Students in the Bachelor of Arts in English program will have the opportunity to further develop and refine their writing and communication skills, think critically and creatively, and use emerging information technologies in the pursuit of advanced research in their graduate courses for the Master of Arts concentration in English.  Bachelor of Science with a major in Food and Nutrition with concentration in Coordinated Program in Dietetics/Master of Science with a concentration in Food and Nutrition with specialization in Coordinated Program in Dietetics (BS/MS) This program combines undergraduate and graduate Coordinated Program in Dietetics (CPD) and includes both the academic requirements and the supervised practice requirements which qualify students to take the Registration Examination for Dietitians upon graduation. Upon successful completion of this 4+1 program, students are eligible to receive a Verification Form, required to document eligibility to take the Registration Examination for Dietitians.  DEPARTMENTAL HONORS PROGRAM This program affords qualified students the opportunity to do extensive study in an area of interest not usually pursued in regular academic work. The completed thesis is recorded on the student’s transcript and is placed on permanent file in the library. Distinction for completing the honors thesis is also noted at commencement. Students should consult their department chair to initiate their enrollment in the departmental honors program.  Students are eligible for honors work if they have a grade point average of 3.00 or higher for the entire sophomore year, or for the last semester sophomore year plus the first semester junior year. The 3.00 cumulative grade point average must include a minimum of four (4) course-credits taken at Framingham State University. Students undertaking this program may elect to omit one elective course in the senior year, substituting the final work of this research project for the course omitted. Course substitution must be approved by the student’s academic advisor and department chair.  The program is carried on under the direction of a faculty advisor. The choice of the faculty advisor and the actual program of study are matters of mutual agreement between the student and the faculty member. Students may begin work any time after qualifying and must continue for at least two semesters.  OFFICE OF CONTINUING EDUCATION Matriculated students enrolling in undergraduate courses offered through Continuing Education may also complete undergraduate programs leading to the baccalaureate degree with majors in: American Sign Language/English Interpreting, Business and Information Technology, Computer Science, English, History, Liberal Studies, Management, Psychology, and Sociology.                                                                    ~62~ COMMONWEALTH HONORS PROGRAM The Commonwealth Honors Program at Framingham State University is designed to provide academically talented students with the opportunity to enrich their college experience with courses both within and outside their major department. Courses bearing the “Honors” designation are drawn from a wide range of disciplines, and are designed to be intensive and intellectually challenging, drawing upon and developing students’ creativity and analytical thinking skills. Honors courses are designed for a maximum enrollment of 20 students to foster in-depth class discussion and a close student-instructor relationship. Some honors courses are restricted to “honors” participants, while others are offered as “split” courses with a core of honors students working within a larger classroom of students at large. Honors courses may be applied to the general education requirements specified by the University. Honors courses that are split may be taken by students who are not participating in the program on a space available basis in the non-honors section of the course with the permission of the instructor if closed.  Honors Program Admission Requirements Freshman Level Admission: Entering freshmen will be invited to participate in the Framingham State University Honors Program based on a weighted composite of their combined SAT scores, class rank, and demonstrated potential for superior work at the college level. Any student admitted to the University who was not initially invited to participate in the program may apply after completing the first semester of freshmen year.  A brief statement of intent, an unofficial transcript, and two letters of recommendation from faculty members should be submitted to the Director of the Honors Program. Sophomore and Transfer Student Admission:  Transfer students who have graduated from a Commonwealth Honors Program at a community college are guaranteed admission.  Other students may apply for admission to the Framingham State University Honors Program as sophomores. A minimum QPA of 3.25 together with two letters of recommendation from faculty members and a brief statement of intent should be submitted to the Honors Program Director for evaluation before October 1st of their sophomore year.   All transfer students will meet with the Director to assess their previous course work and current program requirements. Honors Program Completion Requirements Participants in the Framingham State University Honors Program complete a minimum of six (6) course-credits bearing the honors designation, including "

Interdisciplinary in nature, this course introduces students to the ways various disciplines pose questions and seek answers. All sections of this multi-disciplinary seminar will delve into issues of gender, class, and/or race. Note: This course is open to First-Year students in the Honors Program only.                                                                    ~288~Interdisciplinary  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019   "
HNRS 480," Honors Program Thesis/Project. Most honors courses are specially designed sections of regular 100- and 200-level courses which fulfill one or more general education goals and may be used toward the general education requirements. However, students may choose to substitute one upper-division course in their major (300- or 400-level) for one of the four designated honors courses by submitting an honors contract in which the student and instructor devise or enhance a project within the course emphasizing advanced, independent research on a particular subject. Upper-level contract courses do not count toward the general education requirements. As a condition of continued enrollment in the Honors Program, a freshman or sophomore must maintain a QPA of no less than 3.00 overall; a junior or senior must maintain a GPA of 3.25 or greater. In addition, a minimum grade of B (3.00) in each honors course (including the thesis) in order to count toward the program requirements. Students falling below these requirements are allowed to continue in the program for a probation period of one semester (juniors and seniors) or one year (freshmen and sophomores). Subsequent continuance is at the discretion of the Honors Program Advisory Council. In 2011, the Framingham State University Honors program received Commonwealth Honors designation from the Board of Higher Education. Participation in the Framingham State University Honors Program is noted on the students’ transcripts. Students successfully completing the program are also designated as Commonwealth Honors Scholars on their academic transcripts.                                                                     ~63~ MINORS To complete a minor requirement, a minimum of three (3) course credits (12 semester hours) in the minor department must be taken at the University.

There is no differentiation made in Course-Credit value between courses that require laboratory or studio work and those that do not. Only courses and Course-Credits accepted for transfer by the University are indicated on the academic transcript.  In Fall 2013, governance approved Half-Course-Credit designation equivalent to two (2) semester hours (thirty (30) contact hours) for courses offered at the University. Students in all majors must complete a minimum of thirty-two (32) course-credits. At least ten (10) course-credits (depending on the student’s major) must satisfy the general education requirements. If the major requirements and the general education requirements total fewer than 32 course-credits, students must take enough free electives to make up the difference. Professional Development Graduate coursework, 70000-level, will appear as 1.00, .75, .50, or .25 Course-Credits. This relates to four (4), three (3), two (2), and one (1) semester hour(s). COURSE DESCRIPTIONS Under each course number and title is a brief description of its content, followed by a statement on prerequisites, if any, explaining the requirements for admission to the course. Courses appropriate for general education are identified by Gen. Ed. Domain following the title. Lab science courses will have Lab following the title. COURSE PREREQUISITES It is the student’s responsibility to be aware of and have met prerequisites prior to attempting any course. Course prerequisites may be found in the University Catalog as part of the course description. DEFINITIONS OF COURSE DELIVERY OPTIONS:   Traditional (Face-to-Face, On-Ground, Brick & Mortar) Courses  Courses taught face-to-face have specific meeting times equivalent to a minimum of 200 minutes per week for lecture along with additional hours for laboratory, if applicable. Although the course is taught in a classroom, a BlackBoard online site is part of each course. Students refer to the BlackBoard course site for the syllabus, posted assignments, grades and other material determined by the instructor to be part of the course.  Web-enhanced Courses - All courses offered at the University have the ability to be web-enhanced due to creating a BlackBoard “course” or shell for each course section. This provides students access to the course syllabus and other course materials, submit assignments, participate in discussions, takes quizzes and exams and access grades and feedback. Hybrid (Blended, Mixed) Courses  A hybrid (or blended) class is a combination of face-to-face classroom instruction and online instruction. A portion of the instruction is provided online (between 25% and 75%) via BlackBoard, and regular face-to-face instruction is still required. Face-to-face time requirements will vary between hybrid courses and sections. The instructor of a hybrid course typically determines what instructional activities should be online or face-to-face depending on the learning goals, course objectives, content, and available resources. Similarly, the timetable for face-to-face versus online work can be organized in quite different ways that may reflect not only pedagogical criteria but also the particular circumstances of the instructor and students.  Online Courses  As the title indicates, online courses have complete, or most, online instruction via BlackBoard. These courses may include an initial face-to-face orientation session or take proctored exams on campus.  Online courses require significant self-motivation and familiarity with technology.                                                                     ~66~General Education  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019 	GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS The general education requirement is intended to provide breadth in the baccalaureate degree program to foster student learning beyond a single, narrow discipline or field. General education is designed to facilitate the increase of knowledge, an appreciation for learning in a broad context, the ability to relate new information to what one has learned previously, the capacity to judge information rather than to simply accept it, and the facility to use what one learns in a realistic and logical manner. In addition, the general education requirement is designed to help students to acquire the following learning objectives: Learning Objectives Overarching Objective: Solve Problems Using Critical Thinking  (All General Education courses should meet this objective.)    1: Communicate Effectively Orally   2: Communicate Effectively in Writing   3: Solve Problems Using Quantitative Thinking   4: Demonstrate a Critical Understanding of Human Diversity   5: Demonstrate Civic Literacy   6: Recognize Ethical and Social Responsibilities   7: Locate, Evaluate, and Apply Information   8: Solve Problems Using Creative Thinking   9: Demonstrate Technological Competency 10: Work Collaboratively and Independently To fulfill the general education requirement, students must complete 10 course-credits outside the major department that meet broadly defined requirements. Courses are listed under each of the general education subdomains. Students are not allowed to substitute non-general education courses for general education credit.  At least one course taken in Domain II-B (Natural Sciences) must be a laboratory course. Courses that include a laboratory are identified in the listing.  In conformity with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in consideration of the mission of the State Universities to prepare informed citizens, all students at Framingham State University pursuing teacher licensure must take a course that includes the study of both the United States and Massachusetts constitutions. Courses that include the study of the constitutions are identified in the listing. Students, transferring from a Massachusetts public institution, who complete the MassTransfer Block (as indicated on the student’s final transcript) may be required to complete no more than two (2) Domain GenEd course requirements at Framingham State University. The two (2) specified requirements will be determined case by case per individual. Found at the end of each department section in this catalog, each course number and title has a brief description of its content, followed by a statement on prerequisites, if any, explaining the requirements for admission to the course. It is the student’s responsibility to be aware of and have met prerequisites prior to attempting any course. Courses appropriate for general education are identified by (Gen. Ed. Domain) following the course title.  Note: Students who have withdrawn for more than one semester must follow degree and general education requirements stated in the catalog at the time of their return.                                                                         ~67~General Education  Framingham State University Undergraduate Catalog 2018-2019 	In all majors, where upon completion of all requirements a degree is awarded, one general education subdomain is considered satisfied through completion of the major program requirements.

These experiences are designed to provide a transition from theoretical knowledge to professional application, culminating in assignment to student teaching. All students in secondary education will take two consecutive quarters of student teaching practicum and seminar that will include twelve weeks of student teaching for five days each week. All undergraduate Coordinate Majors in Early Childhood Education or Elementary Education are assigned to a student teaching practicum. This is a full-time experience and the student takes no other courses during the period of student teaching practicum. The University assumes the responsibility for selecting cooperating teachers and schools and for assigning student teachers to those teachers and schools. While every effort is made to place student teachers in conveniently located centers, students must be prepared to assume responsibility for their own transportation. Students are advised to check prerequisites in order to follow the correct sequence of professional experiences and courses that lead to student teaching. Students who do not follow the sequence may find themselves in difficulty because they have not taken a prerequisite course.   Admission into Teacher Education and the Student Teaching Practicum The Education Department is proud to continue Framingham State University’s long-established tradition of excellence in teacher preparation. The Department’s commitment has been stated as follows:                                                                    ~180~ To encourage students in their continuing adult development toward becoming self-directing, professional persons.  To foster an enthusiasm for scholarly investigation and intellectual pursuit which will be reflected by students in professional field settings.  To assist students in broadening their communication skills in order to enhance both their personal and professional advancement.  To raise students’ social and cultural awareness through a professional program which reflects a philosophy of equal access to educational opportunity for all.  To help students gain an understanding of human behavior, especially that of children and young people, that will aid them in working effectively with a variety of life styles and modes of learning. These goals are consonant with the Standards established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as requisite for approval of programs to prepare candidates for licensure as teachers in this state and for reciprocal licensure through the Interstate Certification Compact. (See Education Department for the Handbook of Office of Professional Experiences for further information on teacher licensure standards.)  In accordance with the requirements for approval or accreditation established by the Commonwealth, the University’s Professional Standards Committee (PSC) applies specific criteria for the retention of candidates in teacher preparation to determine that they possess academic competencies and personal characteristics appropriate to the requirements of teaching. The PSC uses a number of criteria, both objective and subjective, for permitting students to progress through the teacher education programs.

This major aims at providing alternative avenues for accommodating the individual academic interest of students. A student may either (a) pursue in-depth study in an area or areas not presently offered as majors at Framingham State University or (b) may choose a broad spectrum of course work among a number of disciplines in lieu of the traditional one-discipline course of study. Students in this major have the opportunity to experience a broad course of study in the traditional liberal arts and sciences which fosters skills such as conceptual analysis, critical thinking, disciplined writing, creative problem-solving, ethical and moral reasoning, and strong leadership.   Prior Learning Assessment Students accepted into the Liberal Studies major may choose to apply for   Prior Learning Assessment credit (a maximum of eight (8) course-credits). Such credit is awarded through a portfolio assessment process and may be granted for substantive learning that has occurred outside the classroom following high school graduation of completion of the GED.  Credit may be awarded in the following areas:  Employment   Community Service   Independent Learning  Military Service   Noncredit Educational Experiences   Educational Travel Students who wish to apply for "Prior Learning Assessment" credit must complete the portfolio process within twelve months of matriculation into the Liberal Studies major. "Prior Learning Assessment" credits are only applicable to the Liberal Studies major at Framingham State University (these credits will be removed from the student’s academic record should the student change their major).  Students seeking certification for certain professional programs (e.g. teacher or dietetic licensure) should consult an advisor, as the Liberal Studies major may not be an appropriate route to those professions.

We will be looking at behavioral styles called “crime”, “delinquency”, “immorality”, “non-conformity”, and so forth. How do such modes of behavior arise and how do they become labeled as deviant styles by the society and its mainstream enforcers? How do deviants assess their own behavior and how is it viewed by others? How does it affect their relationships with others? What do “insider- outsider” relations consist of? What does society as a whole define as order? How do various social institutions and groupings (the legal and medical establishments, and the upholders of public morality) respond to what they view to be disorder? How does society punish transgressors and enforce rules and impose sanctions? This subfield is particularly suitable for those interested in the practice of law and law enforcement, politics, public administration, mental health, and social work.
