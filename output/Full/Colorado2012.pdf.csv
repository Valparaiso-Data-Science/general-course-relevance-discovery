Financial assistance is available in the form ofscholarships, grants, loans and student employment. Approximately 60 percent ofColorado College students receive some form of financial aid from the college or otherprograms. We award Colorado College grant assistance based on financial eligibilityand admission credentials. Once we have determined the official eligibility forColorado College grants and scholarships, we will make a four-year commitment to thestudent and family.For students who remain in good academic standing with the college, we willrenew the Colorado College grants from the four-year award automatically each year atthe same level as the official offer of financial aid. Consideration will be given tofamilies with special circumstances such as unemployment, siblings in college, andmedical expenses. For these individuals, a 1 year award would be offered. The collegealso provides a limited number of merit based awards.Qualification for Financial AidFinancial aid at Colorado College is administered primarily on the basis ofdemonstrated financial aid eligibility. Eligibility is the difference between the cost of astudent’s education and the family’s ability to meet that cost. The amount of the familycontribution is calculated by using a standard method under the Higher Education ActAmendments of 1998 (Public Law 105-244 as amended) and an institutional methodologydeveloped by members of the College Board and amended by college policy. Completeinformation on the college’s financial aid policies may be obtained in the Financial AidPolicies Handbook available at www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/financialaid/handbook/.Application and EligibilityFirst-year students and returning students who have not received financial aid atColorado College must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) andthe College Board’s PROFILE application to their respective processors by February 15.Early Action and Early Decision candidates must submit the PROFILE form at earlierdeadlines. If a student’s natural parents are separated or divorced, the noncustodial parentmust submit the Noncustodial Parent Statement through the College Board’s PROFILEservice according to the published deadlines. Complete details regarding financial aid timelines are available at for incoming students, or at for returning students. Financial Aid 41Financial AidFor first time financial aid applicants the financial aid office requires signed copies ofparent and student federal tax forms and W-2 forms from the latest tax year, and we alsorequire prior year tax returns from early admission applicants. We require a federalverification worksheet from students whose FAFSA is selected for verification. Allfinancial aid applicants who file the CSS/PROFILE should submit tax forms and W-2forms directly to the College Board’s IDOC service by March 1. All students who indicatean interest in applying for financial aid on their admission application are expected tofollow through and submit the required financial aid forms by the published deadlines.Students who have incomplete financial aid applications or who apply late may beeliminated from consideration for both financial aid and admission. By submitting theseforms, students are applying for all sources of assistance — federal, state, andinstitutional. Information provided to the college on these forms is kept confidential.Financial aid recipients must be accepted for admission as full-time, degree-seekingstudents, but applicants should note that they must initiate the financial aid applicationprocess well before any admission decision is made.Returning students must reapply for aid each year to determine continued federaland state eligibility. In most situations we only require the FAFSA form from returningstudents who have had a prior year aid award. Students must maintain satisfactoryprogress toward the degree as defined in the Academic Policies section of this catalog andin the Financial Aid Policies Handbook. Eligibility for Colorado College financial aidextends for eight semesters (usually four years) or through the completion of a semesterin which 32 units of credit are earned, whichever comes first. All credits earned andaccepted by the registrar’s office are used to determine aid eligibility except AdvancedPlacement (AP) credits, International Baccalaureate (IB) credits, half-block, adjunct, andextended-format credits. An appeal to extend eligibility must be made to the director offinancial aid. If not granted, a further appeal may be made to the Committee on FinancialAid Appeals. The financial aid office normally provides Colorado College financial aidonly for fall and spring semesters. Summer Session aid may be available directly from theSummer Session office and from federal sources.Students must enroll as full-time students (at least three blocks each semester) toqualify for CC based-aid. If students drop to less than full-time enrollment status, thefinancial aid office will review their eligibility status and continuance of aid. Studentswho are less than full time may utilize Federal Pell Grant funds and Federal StudentLoans, but Federal Stafford Loans require at least half-time enrollment. Students mustreport any change in enrollment, financial, or marital status to the financial aid officeas soon as possible. Such a change may affect the calculation of financial aid eligibilityand the resulting assistance offered.The academic curriculum is designed and courses are scheduled in such a way thata student may complete the all-college and major requirements, as well as explore thebreadth of the liberal arts and sciences, within four years of enrollment. However, somestudents prefer to graduate after only three years (particularly if they attend the SummerSession) or after five years (often including study and travel abroad). Either term ofenrollment is acceptable, but the financial aid office provides only eight semesters or 32units of CC financial aid eligibility as stated above. Students should carefully review theircourse selections with their faculty advisers and inform the registrar’s office of theirenrollment plans. Counseling is available in the financial aid office.42 Financial AidFinancial Aid AwardsOnce we determine an eligible student’s eligibility for financial aid, we utilize varioustypes of financial aid to meet the aid eligibility. Financial aid awards consist of two maintypes of assistance — gifts (scholarships and grants) and self-help (loans and work). Beloware a few of our scholarship and grant funds available.Colorado College grants and scholarships are made possible for students fromgeneral revenues of the college and through endowments and gifts to the college. Morethan 250 endowments and gifts underwrite the college’s financial aid program andaccount for a significant part of the funds awarded to students.

The recipients of this award will use the proceeds to reduce their student loan debt for their senior year. A scholarship selection committee nominates students. The president of the college awards these scholarshipsat the Honors Convocation.Athletic scholarshipsare awarded to a limited number of male ice hockey players andfemale soccer players; both sports are in the NCAA Division I. Other sports at the collegebelong to the NCAA Division III and do not award athletic scholarships. Interestedindividuals should contact the CC athletic department.Financial Aid 43Federal and State Grants• Federal Pell Grants are based on eligibility as indicated on the Free Application forFederal Student Aid (FAFSA). Awards range from $555 to $5,550 per year for a full timestudent who qualifies for this federal assistance.• Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) are available for studentswho receive federal Pell Grants and have high financial need. Grants may range from$100 to $4,000.• Colorado Student Grants (CSG) are appropriated to Colorado College by the ColoradoGeneral Assembly and are awarded to Colorado residents on the basis of financialeligibility as determined by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education andinstitutional policies. The financial aid office uses information from the FAFSA to calculatea student’s eligibility, and awards these Colorado state funds as part of the regular financialaid process. There is no additional application process for Colorado state funds.Students who are awarded any state of Colorado funds must complete the Coloradoresidency questionnaire, and the financial aid office must process that information beforefunds are disbursed.Federal LoansFederal Perkins Loans are long-term, low-interest federal loans awarded by the collegeon the basis of eligibility. No interest is charged while the student is in college. The interestrate after completion of studies is 5 percent. Students must complete the FAFSA form.Federal Stafford Loans enable students to borrow as much as $5,500 for the first year,$6,500 the second year, and up to $7,500 each year thereafter. The interest rate on anundergraduate Subsidized Stafford Loan is 3.4 percent. The interest rate on anUnsubsidized Stafford Loan for undergraduates and graduate students is 6.8 percent. Theinterest rates are subject to change.The federal government pays all interest charges while the borrower is in college ifthe borrower is eligible for the interest subsidy. Otherwise, students without financialeligibility may borrow the funds as an Unsubsidized Federal Stafford, which beginsaccumulating interest immediately. Students must complete the FAFSA form.Federal PLUS Loans are established for parents of dependent undergraduate studentsas well as graduate students. Parents and graduate students may borrow PLUS loan fundsup to the full cost of attendance minus any financial aid awarded as long as they qualify.The interest rate on a Federal PLUS Loan is a fixed rate of 7.9 percent. Payment of theamount borrowed may be deferred while the student maintains full time enrollment ina post secondary educational institution. Repayment of the interest must begin within60 days of disbursement of the loan. Students must complete the FAFSA form.Student EmploymentCampus jobs are available during the first block of each semester only to federal orstate work-study-eligible students. After this time, campus jobs are available to anystudent regardless of their work-study eligibility. Campus employers must inquire withthe financial aid office for exceptions to this policy. Student employees who work overthe summer are not automatically rehired the following academic year. The college hasa limited number of off-campus community service work-study placements availableonly to students who are eligible for federal or state work-study. Students are placed indirect service positions with nonprofit community service agencies or school districts.The financial aid office administers the student employment program.44 Financial AidOff-Campus StudyCurrently, CC has a policy that all students will pay Colorado College the actualprogram costs for any off-campus study program that is on the college’s approved list.Students receiving aid with Colorado College grants and scholarships will receive aid forthe program costs in the same proportion to the grants and scholarships they receive atCC, up to the cost of CC. If the program costs more than CC’s costs, the college will notprovide more than it would have to attend CC.Scholarship funds are available from the Christian A. Johnson Endeavor FoundationGrant, the Coit Family Scholarship Fund and the Selig Fund for Global Study for thestudy abroad programs. Applications are available in the financial aid office for theJohnson and Coit Scholarships and the dean of the college’s office for the Selig Fund.Students also may be eligible for additional loan assistance for off-campus study. Detailsare available on the financial aid website at www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/financialaid/handbook/off-campus-study.dot.Payment of AwardsFinancial aid is received as a credit to the student’s account in the business office.Awards are usually disbursed in two equal payments, one at the beginning of eachsemester. If a student’s aid exceeds his or her charges the credit balance is provided as arefund to the student. First-time Stafford Loan or Perkins Loan borrowers must sign apromissory note and must complete a loan counseling session before their loans can becredited to their student account.Withdrawal from the CollegeIf a student officially withdraws from the college during the year, the portion of the Colorado College financial aid and any federal, state, or private aid will be refundedto the college and appropriate federal, state, or private agencies according to the Returnof Title IV Funds policy of the Department of Education and the college’s policies. Referto the refund policies in the Financial Obligations section of this catalog. Examples ofthe refund and return of funds policy are available in the financial aid office. Except incases involving medical problems or other personal emergencies approved by the dean of students, a student withdrawing or taking a leave of absence during a semesterin which they receive college funds will lose a semester’s eligibility of financial aid unless the student repays the amount of the Colorado College scholarships used for that semester.AppealsStudents have the right to appeal any decision concerning financial aid policy to theCommittee on Financial Aid Appeals through the director of financial aid. Financial aidcounseling and procedures for appeals are available in the financial aid office.Veterans’ EducationStudents planning to enroll who have VA benefits should apply before registrationfor a certificate for education benefits through the Veterans Administration.

Thefirst payment to students enrolled under Title 38, United States Code, is normally delayeduntil the second month. Subsequent payments are made on the first day of the month,paid in arrears.Financial Aid 45Colorado College seeks to provide a broad education. The college therefore requiresstudents to gain some knowledge and experience in a variety of areas and to study at leastone academic discipline in depth. During the second year at the college, a studentchooses a major field in which to take concentrated work. The major may be in one ofthe following academic fields: anthropology, art, Asian studies, biology, biochemistry,chemistry, classics, comparative literature, computer science, dance, drama, economics,English, environmental science, environmental policy, feminist and gender studies,French, geology, German, history, mathematics, music, neuroscience, philosophy,physics, political science, psychology, religion, Romance languages, Russian, sociology,Southwest studies, and Spanish. Students may take a business concentration within theeconomics major. Many other majors allow special concentrations within broaddisciplinary study.The college also offers several combined or distributed majors for students whoseinterests require concentrated work in more than one department. Such major fields areclassics–history–politics, comparative literature, history–philosophy, history–politicalscience, and political economy. Self-designed majors are possible under the heading ofliberal arts and sciences.Requirements for graduation in each major field are listed under the appropriatetitles in the Departmental Courses section.46 Financial AidAll-College Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts Degree (B.A.) at Colorado CollegeThe following requirements apply to all students who entered in the Fall of 2012.Currently enrolled students (students who matriculated prior to the fall of 2012) maychoose to fulfill these requirements or the All-College requirements approved in the2011–12 Catalog. See the online version of 2011–12 Catalog of Courses.I.Students must satisfactorily complete 32 units of academic credit.II.Students must satisfactorily complete a major course of study. No major mayrequire more than 14 units in any one department and no more than 16 overall(including prerequisites). In departmentally based majors, the two units beyondthe 14-unit limit can be courses outside the department or adjunct courses. Thereare more than 30 possible majors at Colorado College, including a major of thestudent’s own design, the liberal arts and sciences major. Students at ColoradoCollege may complete a double major. The following rules must be observed:The two majors may be from traditional departmental majors or aninterdisciplinary major and a departmental major as long as the latter is not adiscipline making up part of the interdisciplinary major.• Both departments must approve the option.• In no case may more than three courses within the majors overlap.• The student must have an advisor in each major.• The student must complete all-college requirements.• The completed major(s) will be recorded on the student’s official transcript.III.Completion of the Critical Perspectives requirements: The West in Time (onetwo-block course, 2 units); Global Cultures (1 unit); Social Inequality (1 unit);Scientific Investigation of the Natural World (2 units, including at least one labor field course); Quantitative Reasoning (1 unit). Courses may meet more thanone designation (for example, a course may be designated both “West in Time”and “Global Cultures”) but students must choose one designation or the other,except in the case of “Quantitative Reasoning,” which may be fulfilled alongwith any of the other Critical Perspectives requirements. Courses of one halfunit credit, and, independent study and reading courses do not count towardCritical Perspectives requirements.The College Academic Program 47The CollegeAcademic Program[1]Critical Perspectives: The West in Time asks students to position theirknowledge of the broader world not just through multifaceted inquiry into“the here and now” but through critical inquiry across time as well. As an all-college requirement, The West in Time acknowledges the crucial importanceof understanding the past as the context out of which contemporary modesof inquiry and contemporary fields of study have grown. The West in Time isa two-block, two-unit course in which students will explore compelling aspectsof the Western experience over a significant period of time (antiquity to themodern period or the Middle Ages to the modern period). This CriticalPerspectives requirement acknowledges the modern Western propensity tocreate cultural and historical narratives that assume development and progressover time. It also insists on the importance of understanding the contemporaryWestern ‘self’ in the context of previous iterations of the ‘self.’ Courses in thisarea of inquiry will accomplish some combination of the following:• Engage students in an exploration of the past through examination ofideas, events, cultural institutions, and practices;• Enable students to expand their understanding of narratives of thedevelopment of the Western tradition over time and provide them withthe analytical tools to critique those narratives;• Engage students in critical analysis of the connections between the pastand the present;• Encourage students to consider how our understanding of contemporaryevents is informed by our grasp of the historical past.Both the Global Cultures and Social Inequality Critical Perspectivesrequirements are designed to prepare students to think critically andcreatively about the challenges of living in a rapidly changing society andglobalized world.[2]Critical Perspectives: Global Cultures courses focus primarily on the study ofnon-Western societies, or some aspects of them, including by means ofintensive study of a non-Western language.[3]Critical Perspectives: Social Inequality courses focus primarily on howinequality — with respect to nationality, race, ethnicity, gender, class, and/orsexuality — is produced, reproduced, experienced, and resisted. They analyzecritically the social and cultural differences, traditions, and experiences ofmarginalized or subjugated populations in the United States or globally,investigating the social, political, economic, cultural, psychological, and/orhistorical processes that shape the emergence and status of suchpopulations. In so doing, these courses may examine such matters as thenature of power and domination, political economy, social justicemovements, identity formation, and/or cultural and artistic productions.[4]Critical Perspectives: Scientific Investigation of the Natural World enhancesstudents’ understanding of the natural world and of the methods central tomodern science. It gives students opportunities to explore the broader earthsystem and universe, a sphere of inquiry that includes but is not limited tohumans. In a world influenced by science and technology, informed citizensneed to be familiar with the distinctive ways of thinking characteristic ofthe sciences and need to cultivate skill in quantitative reasoning. Thisrequirement complements The West in Time and the Global Culturesrequirements by addressing a distinct approach to the understanding of theworld that originated in the West but currently exercises global influence.48 The College Academic ProgramThese courses will meet the description of the preceding paragraph and willaccomplish some combination of the following:• Explicitly address the nature of the scientific method;• Give students direct experience in the gathering and analysis of scientificdata;• Emphasize the use of quantitative reasoning;• Introduce the foundations and principles of scientific knowledge;• Enhance scientific literacy.• At least one of the two units must involve significant laboratory or fieldexperience.[5]Critical Perspectives: Quantitative Reasoning courses develop students’ability to work with and interpret numerical data, to apply logical andsymbolic analysis to a variety of problems, and/or to model phenomenawith mathematical or logical reasoning.IV.Two blocks (or equivalent) of college-level language.Colorado College believes that learning a language gives any student animportant intellectual experience of cultural difference. A student may learnabout other cultures in a variety of ways, but we believe interpreting andexpressing individual experience and cultural values in another language isnecessary for enhanced international and multicultural awareness. Thisrequirement reflects the conviction that a liberal education is incomplete whenit includes no language study. Learning a language other than one’s nativetongue is not equivalent simply to acquiring a tool for practical use. It is a meansto enter fully and directly into the vital perspectives and unique workings ofanother culture. In addition, language study helps students understand grammar,enhances vocabulary, and significantly supports general literacy.The language requirement, which may not be fulfilled with adjunct courses,may be fulfilled in two ways:• Two units in any of the languages offered at Colorado College, unless thestudent is approved by the office of disability services for a course substitutionbased on evidence of a disability that significantly impacts the student’s abilityto complete the foreign language requirement;• An acceptable language program at any accredited college or university, in anynon-English language, equivalent to two units of language at Colorado College,if approved by the registrar’s office.V.FYE — A two-block course required of all first-year students addressing issueslikely to stimulate debate and including critical reading, effective writing, and aresearch project.VI.All students, beginning with the Fall 2010 entering class, will demonstrateWriting Proficiency in the form of a successfully evaluated First-Year Portfolioor subsequent coursework in classes emphasizing writing. (See the WritingProgram section for more information.)VII.A cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0.VIII.Courses taken at other institutions will be granted as much equivalent credit asdeemed appropriate by the registrar’s office.The College Academic Program 49IX.All students must complete 32 units of credit to qualify for a Colorado CollegeB.A. degree. Those students who have one unit or less to complete toward their32 units (in both all-college and the major requirements) may be allowed tomarch in commencement ceremonies without receiving a diploma. There areno exceptions and no appeals to this policy. As described below, a specifiednumber of the 32 units must be taken in residence, here at Colorado College, orthrough Colorado College programs and exchanges, including the ACM semesterprograms, detailed elsewhere in this catalog.The following rules apply to the academic residence requirement:• Students who enter Colorado College as first-semester, first-year students mustcomplete 24 units at Colorado College or Colorado College programs andexchanges, including the ACM semester programs. Transfer students arerequired to complete a minimum of 16 units at Colorado College or ColoradoCollege programs and exchanges, including the ACM semester programs.• All Colorado College students are required to complete their last eight units atColorado College, except for students participating in Colorado Collegeprograms and exchanges, including the ACM semester programs. Students whohave completed 16 units at Colorado College may petition to the Dean’sAdvisory Committee to waive up to four units of the eight-unit rule.• Because different departments have their own residence requirements for theirmajor, students should consult their major department before conducting anyoff-campus study in their major. These policies should not be confused withresidential life policies regarding college housing.X.In extended-format courses, students may take no more than one extended-format course per semester (one-half unit) and one extended-format coursespanning the year (one unit) unless the dean of the college grants permission foran overload.XI.In each adjunct course, students may earn one-quarter unit toward their degreerequirement for each semester of work. Students may take no more than threeadjunct courses per semester, unless the registrar’s office grants permission for anoverload. In no case may students count more than two total units of adjunctcredit towards the general education degree requirements.Requirements for the Master of Arts in Teaching Degree (MAT) at Colorado CollegeColorado College offers two distinct MAT programs — one for college graduates whowish to become licensed to teach elementary school (K–6), K–12 art, music or worldlanguages (French, German, Latin or Spanish) or at the secondary level (6-12) in English,mathematics, science and social studies and one for experienced teachers.The MAT programs for prospective elementary, secondary school, or K–12 teachersare designed for liberal arts graduates who have taken few, if any, education courses.Each program is 14 months in length, consisting of two Summer Sessions and oneintervening academic year. After successful completion of the program and receipt of apassing grade on the appropriate state license examination, students receive the MATdegree and are recommended to the state of Colorado for licensure.The program for elementary school teachers is appropriate for all general teachingpositions in elementary schools. The K–12 art, music and world languages programs areappropriate for teaching the respective content in elementary, middle/junior high, and50 The College Academic Programsenior high schools. The secondary school teaching program is appropriate for teachingEnglish, mathematics, science or social studies in middle/junior high school and senior highschool. Information about the program for prospective teachers is available through theeducation department’s website: www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/education/.Four MAT programs are offered in the Summer Session for experienced teachers: artsand humanities for secondary school teachers, liberal arts for elementary school teachers,integrated natural sciences, and Southwest studies for teachers of all grade levels. Theseprograms are designed to offer degree candidates opportunities to expand theirknowledge in a variety of fields, acquire knowledge they can apply to their profession,and examine new developments in the field of education.Degree candidates are required to complete a minimum of eight Colorado Collegeunits (32 semester hours), write one master’s research paper, pass an oral defense of theresearch paper, and complete two colloquia — weeklong afternoon seminars on currenttopics of concern to educators. The degree must be completed in no more than sixsummers. Up to four semester hours of graduate credit earned within the past sevenyears at other accredited colleges or universities may be applied toward the degree.Most experienced teacher MAT candidates complete the majority of theirrequirements through the interdisciplinary arts and humanities, integrated naturalscience, and Southwest studies institutes. These two-unit institutes are designed toexplore in depth a different topic each summer.Information about these programs, special teacher tuition scholarships, andapplications are available at the Summer Session office.Academic MinorsA minor is a course sequence of at least 5 units within an area of study providing adegree of specialization within that area, a specialty within a discipline, or a specialtyintegrating several disciplines focusing on significant themes. The Colorado Collegecurriculum features departmental (disciplinary) and thematic (interdisciplinary) minorsthat provide coherent plans of study. A minor at Colorado College is an optional programof study to matriculated baccalaureate students. The minors are designed to provideopportunities for in depth study outside of the major field of study.Students may declare a minor up to, but no later than two blocks prior to graduation.However, students are strongly encouraged to declare a minor as early as possible. Thereare two restrictions on choosing a minor in relationship to majors: Students cannotchoose a minor that makes up the same departmental name as their major. For example,history–political science majors may not choose a history minor.

The nation’s best universities and employers hiring intomanagement-track positions value the breadth of knowledge that a liberal arts degreeprovides. The major a student takes to prepare for business can be selected from anyoffered at Colorado College; what is important to graduate admissions committees andemployers is a demonstrated capacity to think critically, analyze complex issues, andcommunicate effectively in both oral and written forms. To supplement their interest ina business career, students should consider taking introductory courses in accountingand economics, a law course, and statistics. Advice on a course of study while at ColoradoCollege and opportunities for graduate work and employment can be obtained byconsulting the pre-business adviser as well as the Career Center.For students selecting a major in economics, it is possible to pursue the study of business in additional depth through a number of elective courses dealing directlywith the role and operation of business in society. These same courses are available tostudents majoring in any subject as long as the individual course prerequisites aresatisfied.

Details canbe found at www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/physics/engineering/.Health ProfessionsAt the beginning of the academic year, usually during Block 1, the health professionsadvising staff holds a meeting to answer questions and give general advice to studentsinterested in pursuing medical careers. Although most are interested in becomingphysicians, more students each year show interest in other careers, such as dentistry,nursing, physical therapy, physician’s assistant programs, or veterinary medicine.Most new students who are interested in preparing for a career in the healthprofessions have some time to explore their options before diving into a strict program,and the college encourages students to explore the liberal arts curriculum and declare amajor at the end of the sophomore year. Students who are interested in the healthprofessions will often major in one of the sciences, but many professional schools valueapplicants with diverse academic backgrounds, and aspiring physicians may choose tomajor in any discipline. Regardless of the major, a student must do well in courses forthe major and in the required science courses. Consideration for admission to aprofessional school after graduation is based primarily on grade point average andperformance on the required entrance tests. Personal interviews, letters of evaluationand student experience will then factor into the admission decision.Detailed information about various medical professions is available in the healthprofessions advising office in Olin Hall. Jane Byrnes, the health professions advisingmanager, is available to answer questions. Bruce Kola in El Pomar Sports Center is theadviser for physician’s assistants and physical therapy programs.LawLaw schools select students who show general excellence and high promise in theanalysis of abstract texts and in written and oral expressions. The Pre-Law Committeeadvises students on their selection of courses, law school requirements, and generalpreparation for admission to law schools. Students interested in law careers choosevarious majors depending on their interests and the recommendation of their advisers.Colorado College has a cooperative program with Columbia University School ofLaw, under which students, if selected by Colorado College and admitted by ColumbiaUniversity, may enter an accelerated interdisciplinary legal education program after threeyears at Colorado College. Upon successful completion of the three-year program atColumbia University, the student will receive the bachelor of arts degree from ColoradoCollege and the juris doctor degree from Columbia University. It is expected that onlyextraordinary students will qualify, and the program will normally select no more thanone person. Interested students should obtain specific details from the prelaw advisers.Military ScienceThe U.S. Army’s military science program is available to Colorado College students.

Students who donot successfully petition in advance for non-approved off-campus study programs willnot be able to transfer the credits into the College.International and Off-Campus Study Programs 61ValidationAlthough most students have selected their courses prior to the beginning of thefall and spring terms, all students must officially go through validation at the beginningof each term — Blocks 1 and 5 — by turning in their validation card at validation, or tothe registrar’s office. This process validates the student’s arrival on campus, intent toparticipate in courses for the semester and to fulfill all financial obligations. It is thestudent’s responsibility to notify the registrar’s office if he or she will not be on campusfor validation. Failure to validate enrollment for the semester, or to notify the registrar’soffice of late arrival, will result in a late registration fee of $50 and may cancel coursesfor the term.Pre-registrationFirst-year and transfer students select their first two courses (Blocks 1 and 2) by mailduring the summer or fall (for January transfers). During New Student Orientation Week,students meet with their academic advisers to review their choices. Then, during Block2, first-year and transfer students select courses for the remainder of the academic year.In March or April, two weeks are set aside for pre-registration (course enrollment) forthe coming academic year. During this period, students meet with their advisers to plantheir academic programs for the next year. Also at this time they may discuss a choiceof major and vocational possibilities and review their academic progress. Students mustdeclare a major before registration for the junior year.Students are responsible for entering their pre-registration (course enrollment) onlineon any computer with Internet accessibility, before the end of the pre-registration period.An 80-point, sealed-bid system will determine who is enrolled in courses and who isplaced on the waiting lists. Students will be put on the waiting list for a course when theirpoint distribution fails to get them into the selected course. Students are responsible forcompleting all necessary listed prerequisites for any course; failure to do so may resultin an automatic drop from the course by the registrar’s office or the instructor. Failure toadhere to prerequisites may jeopardize the student’s ability to perform at the levelexpected in the class.Course Attendance PolicyStudents are expected to attend courses regularly and are responsible for course workwhether present or not. The college believes in giving students as much freedom as isconsistent with their academic progress. However, excessive absence, excluding illness oremergency, may result in a special probation or dismissal from the course with no credit.62 Academic PoliciesAcademic PoliciesThe policy of Colorado College is to require attendance in scheduled classes in theweek of all-college holidays and block breaks. Faculty members will explain any specificapplications of this policy, such as grade penalties for unauthorized absences, at thebeginning of each block. Since grades for graduating seniors are due by 2 p.m.Wednesday, the last day of Block 8, seniors are expected to attend all classes through theend of Block 8.Course ChangesStudents are permitted to add a course in progress during the first two days of ablock with the signature of the professor. They may drop a course through 5 p.m. Tuesdayof the second week. The half-block may be dropped by Thursday at 5 p.m. Studentsshould be aware, however, that adding a course after the first two days of the block willbe difficult or impossible, so that credit for the block will be lost if the course is droppedafter the first two days. Students may add or drop courses to be taken in future blocks atany time prior to the beginning of those courses without the instructors’ signatures.Exceptions to the procedure must be authorized by a dean and affected professors.Students may not drop a course if involved in an Honor Council investigation.Dropping a course without authorization automatically results in a grade of No Credit.One of the primary goals of the Block Plan is to provide a framework within whichstudents may devote all of their formal academic efforts to one course. Thus, it is notpossible to register for more than one principal course during a block. However, studentsmay also enroll in a maximum of three adjunct courses and a maximum of .5 unit ofextended-format courses per semester. Students may also take a maximum of .5 unitduring the January half-block. Unapproved overloads result in a loss of credit.During the first or sophomore year, students are urged to consult with thedepartment in which they wish to major to determine an appropriate schedule. To allowstudents ample time to pursue a sound course of study in their major, they must declarethe major before registration for their junior year. However, they may change their majorat any time.Waiting ListsA student is permitted to be on one waiting list for each block. When an opening isavailable in a course, the student first on the waiting list is automatically added when aspace becomes available. Notification will be sent to the student’s Colorado College e-mail address. If a student is enrolled in another course the same block, this course isautomatically dropped. Students who are allowed into class from the waiting list by theprofessor on the first day of class must officially add the course by turning in an addform to the registrar’s office. Students who fail to officially add the course lose the optionof taking the course on the Pass/Fail option and must take the course for a letter grade.ExaminationsInstructors decide the number and nature of examinations given in a course.Students usually will be given notice in advance of examinations, but unannouncedquizzes and other criteria such as class discussions may help determine a student’s gradefor the course.Under the Block Plan, there are no final examination periods. Final exams, if given,will be held during the block(s) in which the course is offered. Instructors will decide onthe method of evaluating student performance.Academic Policies 63Students who are unable to take a scheduled examination as a result of illness or forother acceptable reasons may be given a make-up examination or may receive an“Incomplete” if there are unfinished requirements at the end of the course.All examinations are to be given under the honor system. Briefly, this system meansthat teachers are to remove themselves from classrooms during tests, except for necessaryannouncements. The Honor Council may make exceptions to this rule. The professorshall designate the time allowed for each examination. There shall be no limitation asto where examinations shall be taken except as specified by the professor. The honorsystem shall apply to all written or oral examinations, to all reports, term papers, theses,and all other work done for credit.Independent StudyA student may initiate independent study to pursue in-depth certain aspects of asubject previously studied or to investigate an area of academic interest not covered ina regular course. The following guidelines should be observed:• Courses should have specific prior expectations established, clear to both the facultysupervisor and student.• Courses should have as a prerequisite sufficient prior course work in the area of theproject to give the student a good basis for working independently, i.e., they shouldinvolve advanced, not introductory work.• Independent study should normally be for juniors or seniors who are likely to havesufficient academic maturity to succeed in it.• Courses should require the equivalent student workload of a regular course carrying thesame credit.• Courses should be planned well ahead of time.• Courses should have the approval of the department or interdisciplinary program chair.• Consent of instructor is required.Retaking CoursesStudents may repeat a course in which they did not receive a passing grade. Suchrepetition may be required if a student received a “D+” or lower grade in a course in themajor field, or a prerequisite requirement. Students may retake a course in which theyreceived a passing grade. However, credit will be awarded only once, and both grades willbe calculated into the appropriate GPAs.Credit and GradesThe unit represents the academic work of a single block of three-and-one-half weeks.There are eight blocks in the academic year, and under normal circumstances a studentcan earn eight units of credit per year and 32 units in four years. Each unit is equal tofour semester hours or six quarter hours. Adjunct courses provide .25 unit credit each,and extended-format courses provide up to .5 unit per semester. The January half-blockallows students to earn .5 unit of credit.Any first-year student who enrolls for fewer than eight blocks, and any other studentwho enrolls for fewer than seven blocks, must have the prior approval of the registrar’soffice within the first two weeks of the semester of reduced enrollment.The college provides a two-track system for all students. In a given course, studentsmay choose to be graded by either the designation of A, A–, B+, B, B–, C+, C, C–, D+, D,and No Credit (G Track) or the optional system S/CR/NC (P Track). S = A through C–; CR= D+ or D; NC = No Credit. For purposes of computing the grade point average, thefollowing schedule will be used: A = 4.0; A– = 3.7; B+ = 3.3; B = 3.0; B– = 2.7; C+ = 2.3; C= 2.0; C– = 1.7; D+ = 1.3; D = 1.0; and NC = 0.0.64 Academic PoliciesP Track passing grades are not calculated in the GPA; however, a grade of NC undereither grade track option is calculated in the GPA. D+ and D grades under both G and PTrack options may fulfill graduation requirements. They do not fulfill major,departmental minor, or prerequisite requirements. There are no restrictions placed on thenumber of courses a student may choose under each option. However, students areexpected to choose the option by which they wish to be graded at the time they registerfor courses. No change in the grading option is permitted after the fourth day of classwithout extenuating circumstances. Students who do not choose a grading track for acourse are automatically assigned to the G track by the registrar’s office. A student may,with permission of the course professor, audit (Z Track) a course. No credit towardgraduation will be awarded, but the audit, if completed successfully, will be recorded onthe student’s transcript.The college believes its grading system options offer a desirable versatility becausethey provide a commonly understood set of grades for consideration beyond the campuswhile preserving a simpler option for students who wish to be free of certain kinds ofgrading pressures. This “optional system” encourages students to take courses they mightotherwise avoid out of fear of poor grades, and in general makes students much less“grade conscious.” On the other hand, the college avoids the risk that some of itsstudents could be disadvantaged by the grading policy in the competition for jobs orgraduate and professional school admissions.In the interest of a more uniform grading policy that accords with our commitmentto high academic standards, the college endorses the following revised statement of themeaning of grades at Colorado College:A –Excellent work that reflects superior understanding and insight, creativity, or skill.B –Good work that reflects a high level of understanding and insight, creativity, or skill.C –Adequate work that indicates readiness to continue study in the field.D –Marginal work, only minimally adequate, raising serious question about readiness-to continue in the field.S –Work that falls in the range of A to C–.CR –Work equivalent to a D+ or D.NC –Failing work, clearly inadequate, and unworthy of credit.No Credit GradesIf a student does not complete the work of a course and has no satisfactory excuse,the instructor must determine the student’s grade, which may be No Credit. Unlike anIncomplete, No Credit grades cannot be made up and thereby changed to a passing gradesimply by turning in a missing paper or taking a missed examination.Grade ChangesAt the end of each course, faculty submit final grades to the registrar. The judgmentmade by the faculty member when a grade is submitted to the registrar must be viewed asconclusive. Therefore, a request for a change in a final grade will ordinarily not be approved.There are, however, rare instances in which fairness might justify a final gradechange. This might be the case, for example, when there is demonstrable evidence of amathematical error in the calculation of a grade, or where there has been an egregiouserror in grading by the instructor, such as the failure to read and take into account anentire exam or paper or a significant portion of one. Normally, grade appeals should beresolved between the student and faculty involved. A mere change of mind will notjustify a change of a final grade.Academic Policies 65The registrar’s office will allow grade changes in these rare cases. However, grades areto be considered final and will not be subject to change for any reason after a 12 monthperiod from the end of the course. Also, grade changes are not permitted after the awardof a degree. The 12 month period does not apply to graduating students.FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)College students’ records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and PrivacyAct (FERPA). It restricts institutions from releasing grades and other educational recordswithout a student’s written permission. Students may view their grades online throughthe student self-service system after grades have been submitted and recorded by theregistrar’s office. Since the system is student-controlled, students are encouraged to sharegrade information with their parents. Students can also request official transcripts fromthe registrar’s office which includes complete course, grade, and GPA information.Advanced Standing CreditColorado College encourages prospective students to take the most rigorous coursesavailable at their secondary schools. When considering applications for admission, theAdmission Committee takes special note of students who pursue such courses of study. Thecollege also recognizes challenging course work by giving credit in some instances forAdvanced Placement work (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB) work, college courses, andcertain foreign secondary degrees. No credit is awarded for CLEP tests or for life experience.Approximately one-third of each entering class at Colorado College is awardedadvanced standing credit. This credit can be used to satisfy general education requirementswhere appropriate (Advanced standing credit will not be allowed to fulfill CriticalPerspectives requirements), to satisfy major requirements where the department allows,and to accelerate graduation. However, accelerated graduation is not mandatory; studentsare eligible to remain enrolled and receive financial aid for four full-time academic years.The college will award up to eight units (sophomore standing) in transfer credit to studentswhose scores meet the appropriate criteria. Note that the registrar’s office will not awarddouble credit for the same subject earned through different programs (e.g., AP AmericanLiterature and IB American Literature), nor will it award double credit if a student takes aColorado College course in the same subject matter. The registrar’s office will considerrequests for credit after a student is admitted and has sent in the deposit.Transfer CreditColorado College accepts transfer credit for previous work done by a student. Thefollowing guidelines are used in the transfer and awarding of academic credit from anaccredited institution or approved program:• To earn credit at Colorado College, all transfer credit must come from a regionallyaccredited, degree-granting college or university (including community colleges) or aprogram preapproved by the office of international and off-campus programs for off-campus study and exchanges.• Students who have completed work at other colleges and who wish to have this workcredited toward a CC degree must have official transcripts from those colleges sentdirectly to the registrar at Colorado College. Course descriptions/syllabi for each coursemay also be requested.• Students who wish to complete a semester abroad or study away as domestic exchangestudents must receive approval from the office of international and off-campusprograms, department chairs or program directors, and the registrar’s office for allcourse work prior to enrolling.66 Academic Policies• A letter grade of ‘C–’ or higher is required to earn transfer credit. ‘D+’ and below willnot earn transfer credit at Colorado College. Courses for which a Pass or Satisfactorywas earned at another college will earn credit at Colorado College ONLY if the collegecan provide verification that the student passed with a letter grade of “C–“ or higher.• Courses must be substantially similar to Colorado College courses, and cannotduplicate, overlap, or regress from previous work.• One Colorado College unit is equivalent to 4 semester hours, or 6 quarter hours.• Grades do not transfer to Colorado College and are not calculated into the ColoradoCollege GPA (grade point average).• For college study during secondary school, please see additional requirements listedunder Advanced Placement credit.• Courses taken in disciplines offered at Colorado College are evaluated by the registrarin consultation with department chairs or program directors. The department chair orprogram director is the final authority on credit earned in his/her discipline.Credit can be awarded for liberal arts courses taken in disciplines not offered by CC upon review by the registrar. If approved, these courses will be awarded generalelective credit.Dean’s List, Distinction, and HonorsA student will be placed on the Dean’s List if she or he attains a grade point averagefor the academic year of 3.75 or higher and no NC’s or Incompletes at the time the listis calculated. To qualify for the Dean’s List, a student must complete seven units,excluding adjuncts, in the academic year (six for graduating seniors), all seven of which(or, in the case of seniors, six) must be taken for a letter grade. Only credits completedat Colorado College or within an affiliated study abroad program will be used indetermining eligibility.Certain departments in the college grant a special award of distinction at graduationto majors who have done especially outstanding work in their major field and who alsohave superior records in all their college work. The departments may offer special coursesof independent work for students admitted to these programs.The bachelor’s degree with honors — cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cumlaude— may be conferred upon those students who receive the recommendation of theCommittee on Instruction. The degree summa cum laude is conferred only by a specialvote of the faculty after individual consideration of each case.Honors at graduation will be determined on the basis of grade point averagecomputed from the last 22 units taken under the “G” grade track at Colorado College,including credit earned in ACM programs and the college’s affiliated programs. Anytransfer student who completes a minimum of 18 units for graduation at ColoradoCollege, and at least 16 units on the “G” track option, will be automatically consideredfor honors. Courses taken for less than .5 unit credit shall be excluded from the 22. TheCommittee on Instruction may consider individually the cases of students with fewerthan the required units at Colorado College. The registrar’s office will notify departmentsabout students who have the required grade point average to be considered for honors,but who would not automatically be considered using the above criteria, and thesestudents will be considered if recommended by a minimum of three faculty members.The Committee on Instruction will recommend to the faculty students who should beawarded their degree summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude. The total numberrecommended by the Committee on Instruction will normally be equal to approximately20 percent of the graduating class. Faculty approval is not required except for thegranting of the degree summa cum laude.Academic Policies 67Phi Beta Kappa: Standards for ElectionColorado College is home to the Beta of Colorado Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa,America’s oldest honor society (1776). The chapter, about 40 faculty and staff elected attheir undergraduate colleges and universities, annually inducts about 10 percent of thegraduating class into lifetime membership, based on their excellence as liberal artsstudents. Grades are the first indicator of this excellence, followed by a questionnaireasking the whole faculty to rate students. Seniors are encouraged to make sure theirtranscripts are in order at midyear, and any student interested in membership should beaware that, in doubtful cases where the chapter examines transcripts, breadth of programincluding serious study of science, mathematics, and languages is considered.Incomplete and Excused GradesIf a student is unable, for a satisfactory reason such as illness, to complete the workin a given course, he or she will receive either a grade of “Incomplete” or “Excused” forthat course. Incomplete grades must be made up by the beginning of the fourth blockfollowing the block in which the incomplete was recorded, unless the instructor sets ashorter time limit for completion of the prescribed work. If an incomplete is not madeup within the prescribed time, the registrar’s office will automatically convert it to agrade of No Credit. In no case can an incomplete grade extend longer than one yearafter the block in which the course was taken.After the second Tuesday of the course, students who want to drop a course mustpetition for a grade of Excused with a registrar. Normally, a grade of Excused will not beapproved unless the student is passing and there are extenuating circumstances, such asillness or injury, that have affected the student’s progress in the course. The student muststate a specific reason for requesting an Excused, and the instructor’s recommendationmust be recorded. The registrar’s office will make the final decision.If a student does not complete the work in a course and has no satisfactory excuseor does not meet the minimum standards set by the instructor, the instructor will givethe student a grade of No Credit.Satisfactory Academic ProgressThirty-two units are required for graduation. Students should be aware that illnessor grades of No Credit might prevent completion of one or two units during their four-year academic career. If necessary, the student can make up these losses by taking coursesin the Summer Session or by taking adjunct courses (.25 unit each), extended-formatcourses (.5 unit per semester), or the January half-block (.5 unit) to reach the minimumrequirement of 32 units.Students who receive financial aid must make satisfactory academic progressaccording to the table below. Eligibility for Colorado College financial aid extends foreight semesters or through a semester in which 32 units are completed, whichever comesfirst. All credits earned and accepted by the registrar’s office are used to determinefinancial aid eligibility. Advanced Placement (AP) credits, International Baccalaureate(IB) credits, credits for half-blocks and extended-format courses, and adjunct credits arenot used in the determination of the 32-unit limit.Each full-time student is allowed five years (10 semesters) to complete a bachelor of arts degree and receive federal financial aid. It should be noted that although students have 10 semesters of eligibility for federal funds, eight semesters is the limit forcollege funds.68 Academic PoliciesFull-Time SemesterMinimum # UnitsMinimum Cumulative GPA12 units1.526 units1.739 units1.8412 units2.0515 units2.0619 units2.0723 units2.0827 units2.0931 units2.01035 units2.0Warning and SuspensionIn Blocks 4 and 8 each year, the Dean’s Advisory Committee meets to reviewstudents’ academic records. In determining academic warnings and suspensions, thecommittee uses the following guidelines:First- and second-year students are expected to earn at least six units of credit duringeach of their first two years. All other students (third and fourth year) are expected to earnat least seven out of the last eight units taken in any two consecutive semesters (springand fall, fall and spring).Normally, students complete a degree program within four years. However, thecollege recognizes that individual circumstances may warrant exceptions. The aboveguidelines will not apply to students who take less than normal academic loads forreasons such as illness or personal problems. These students should obtain a writtenwaiver from a dean.Students failing to meet the requirements of satisfactory progress toward the degreewill be liable for the following:Academic Warning.Students who fail to meet the minimum grade point average(GPA) for the semester or pass the minimum number of courses in a semester are placedon academic warning because the Dean’s Advisory Committee believes there is reason tobe concerned about their level of achievement.Academic Probation.Students on academic warning who fail to meet theminimum GPA or units earned for the following semester or who receive a No Credit inone or more courses are placed on academic probation for the next semester. While onacademic probation, students must achieve a 2.0 GPA for the semester and pass fourclasses with a C– or better with no grade of Incomplete (I) in any of the four classes. Thelatter must be achieved for the student to be removed from academic probation. Astudent on academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be placed on academicsuspension for one year.Academic Suspension.A student is placed on academic suspension after beingon academic probation for two consecutive semesters. Suspensions are entered on astudent’s transcript as a part of the academic record. The suspended student meets withthe associate dean of the college to define the conditions for determining their readinessto return. After a one-year absence from the college, a suspended student may apply tothe associate dean of the college for reinstatement.Dismissal.A student is subject to dismissal from the college whenever, in the viewof the Dean’s Advisory Committee, his or her academic performance is so low as to makethe completion of a Colorado College degree unlikely.Academic Policies 69Leave of Absence.The deadlines for requesting a leave of absence are November 1for a leave that begins in the spring semester and March 1 for a leave that begins in thefall semester. Students must apply for a pending leave by the appropriate deadline evenif they are awaiting word of their acceptance to a specific program. Students who aregranted a leave are expected to reconfirm their return date in writing to the dean ofstudents (for nonacademic leaves) or the registrar’s office (for academic leaves) no laterthan November 1 for a return in the spring and March 1 for a return in the fall. Studentswho fail to reconfirm will have their preregistration cancelled, and they will bewithdrawn formally from the college.On formal application to the dean of students, a nonacademic leave of absence willbe considered for either financial or personal emergency. Students who find it necessaryto interrupt their education because of financial considerations are expected to contactthe dean of students and to present evidence in support of their request for a financialleave. In the case of personal emergencies, such as illness or family crisis, the dean ofstudents should be consulted. A student on personal leave of absence is expected not toattend another college or university. If unusual circumstances warrant attendance, creditwill not be accepted unless prior approval has been received from the dean inconsultation with the registrar’s office.Withdrawal from the CollegeAll students who decide to interrupt their education at Colorado College and whodo not qualify for a leave of absence, or who wish to transfer to another institution, areexpected to withdraw formally from the college. A notice of formal withdrawal isavailable in the dean of students office. To withdraw from the college for the springsemester, a student must submit a formal notice of withdrawal by November 1 of thepreceding year or forfeit the general obligation deposit. To withdraw from the college forthe fall semester, a student must submit an intention to withdraw by March 1 of thepreceding academic year or forfeit the general obligation deposit.Students who withdraw to transfer to another institution and later wish to reapplyto Colorado College must do so through the admission office as transfer candidates.Those students who withdraw for other reasons, such as time off to travel or simply totake a break from the educational environment, have the option of reapplying toColorado College by writing directly to the vice president for student life or the dean ofstudents. This option remains open for two semesters (one academic year) followingwithdrawal. The deadlines for reapplying through the dean of students for a givensemester are November 1 for reinstatement in the spring semester and March 1 forreinstatement in the fall semester. After a lapsed time of two semesters or longer, studentsin this category who still wish to reapply to Colorado College must do so through theadmission office. Students who withdraw formally from the college do not have theoption of preregistering in the spring.70 Academic Policies72AnthropologyAnthropologywww.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/anthropology/Associate Professors HAUTZINGER, MONTAÑO (chair); Assistant Professors GÓMEZ, LEZA;Visiting Assistant Professor FISH, PICKRELL; Visiting Instructor VONFELDTTHE MAJOR — REQUIREMENTS:Students majoring in anthropology must complete the following requirements:• 12 units of coursework in the department, distributed in the following categories: A minimum ofone course in each of the four subfields (archaeological, biological, cultural, and linguisticanthropology); at least four anthropology courses at the 300-level including AN315.• Two required, discipline-wide courses: AN215 Research Design — Method and Theory and AN315Advanced Integrative Seminar.• Major requirements may be satisfied by no more than: two units of off-campus credit; two unitsof independent Readings/Research (400), and one cross-listed unit taught by non-departmentalfaculty (e.g., folklore, ethnomusicology, cultural ecology).Note: The department awards Distinction in Anthropology to students who present evidence of distinguishedwork.

Because the studies ofthese Mediterranean areas span East and West, as well as being rooted in at least 5,000 years ofEuropean history, they have profound influence on how we understand our own contemporaryworlds. Classics and the classical tradition are of crucial importance in coming to understand thestructures of our own minds and experiences, as well as helping us to think multiculturally inhistorically grounded ways. Because English and many other modern languages are historicallydependent upon Greek and Latin, their mastery is crucial in helping us to use our own language withmaximum effectiveness.Our program is an area study with connections to programs and departments of anthropology, artand archaeology, comparative literature, the performing arts, philosophy, political science, andreligion. Its center is the study of languages and literature, available to students as a major withvarying emphases and intensities.A stringent major that might lead to graduate study in classics requires two years worth of workbeyond the intermediate level in one language, preferably almost that much in the other, coverageof an extensive reading list and work (measured by the comprehensive examination) to establishhistorical, philosophical and art-historical framework for the literature. Other students will spendless time on the languages (perhaps concentrating on one of them) and emphasize one or more non-classics program areas. The department will provide formal or informal colloquia to bring togetherthe studies of advanced students and faculty. Distinction in Classics will be awarded for the thesesof an excellence beyond the mere grade of A.All students majoring in classics will complete 7–14 units (including work at the 300 level or abovein language) of courses in the department, pass comprehensive examinations including reading inat least one classical language, and present senior theses or the equivalent.THE MINOR — REQUIREMENTS:Students minoring in classics will complete:1.) A two-block introductory sequence, normally chosen from our classics/history/First-YearExperience offerings;2.) Two units of Greek and/or Latin language, including one unit at the intermediate level;3.) One further unit at the 300 level or above, as a Capstone for the minor; and4.) A paper or project, normally submitted in the Capstone course, which should draw on thestudent’s whole classical studies experience.The department will provide formal or informal colloquia to bring together the studies of advancedstudents and faculty. Distinction in Classics will be awarded for the theses of an excellence beyondthe mere grade of A.104Classics101 Greek for Beginners.Introduction to the structure and vocabulary of classical Greek, withattention to those features that form the classical basis of Biblical koine and for the classical side ofGreek diglossia from Hellenistic times through the 20th century.

How does the practice of reciting improvised rhymes over re contextualizedmusic inform us as playwrights? How can the application of spray paint to movingsurfaces inspire the way we write poetry? In this course we explore these questionsthrough research expeditions, writing and performance exercises. Coursework includesimmersion in seminal cultural texts, films, and albums, in addition to field trips to relatedevents in Colorado’s own hip hop/ spoken word community.

Prerequisite:Senior majors only. 1 unit — Department.Classics–Englishwww.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/classics/requirements/interdisciplinary-majors/Advisors — Professors CRAMER, DOBSON; Assistant Professor THAKUR; Adjunct Associate Professor HUGHESTHE MAJOR — REQUIREMENTS:This major starts from the observation that English and classics reinforce each other. Classical genresunderlie modern poetry, drama, and fiction. Most writers in English, into the 20th century, havestudied classical languages (at least Latin) and literature, so that classics is an important interpretivecontext for them. Moreover, English literature responds to classics in ways that are important forclassics itself. We therefore allow students to complete slightly less work in each department thanthey would need to graduate with the single major. Normal requirements are between 10 and 14units as follows:Introduction to Literary Study and to Poetry: English 250/Comparative Literature 210 Introductionto Literary Theory (one unit) and English 221 Introduction to Poetry; English 480 (Senior Seminar,one-two units) plus either English 485 (Senior Project) or Classics 431 (Senior Thesis); the classicsdepartment written and oral examination over the department’s reading list; English courses at the300 or 400 level covering three of the following five periods: Medieval-Renaissance, Shakespeare,1660–1830, 1830–1914, 20th century; English or classics courses covering the genres of poetry,drama, and narrative fiction; one year’s work beyond the intermediate level in one classical language(normally two .5 unit courses at the 300 level in extended format).Total units required: 10–14, assuming that Latin or Greek is begun in college, that the classicalreading courses are done in extended format, and that the genres are covered in courses that alsocount under the period or classical reading requirement. Both departments strongly recommendstudy of a modern language to a level allowing literary reading.Classics–History–Politics 107Classics–History–Politicswww.coloradocollege.edu/academics/curriculum/catalog/departmental/classics-history-politics.dotwww.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/politicalscience/requirements/classics-history-politics-major.dotAdvisors — Professors CRAMER, FULLER, NEELTHE MAJOR — REQUIREMENTS:The classics–history–politics major offers students interested in the Western intellectual traditionthe opportunity for multidisciplinary study supported by training in languages central to thattradition. It culminates in a senior thesis requiring students each to address a major problem in thehistory of ideas in its historical context. The CHP major is highly flexible, allowing students to fulfillits requirements through varied options within the respective departments. Individuals’ programs,however, must be carefully chosen in consultation with CHP staff so that courses within theconstituent disciplines form an integrated whole fully supportive of their eventual senior projects.All students opting for this major will complete an array of courses establishing their familiarity withthe major political, social and intellectual developments of the Mediterranean and Europe fromantiquity to the contemporary world. Further, all will explore the Western tradition’s ways ofinterpreting its past by attention to both classical and subsequent models. Students’ historical andhistoriographical coursework will be distributed among the three constituent departments.Meanwhile, they will develop skills in at least one classical and one modern language to the pointthat they are able to use each in independent reading and research. Declared CHP majors in allundergraduate years will participate in an informal seminar meeting once a block, in which theyestablish intellectual community with their peers and advisers in discussion of significant textsoutside their course material.Finally, all CHP majors will complete substantial projects of research and criticism integrative oftheir experience throughout this program; their respective theses will be enriched by considerationof the primary sources in which they are based in the original languages, where possible.Students may choose as primary advisers for their respective thesis projects any faculty members ina constituent department; other members of the college faculty may be invited to consult on oradvise theses by student petition and approval of the CHP staff. One of the major’s core advisers,however, will always serve as first or second reader of thesis work, and advisory faculty will annuallyapprove and, as appropriate, grant honors for all theses in classics–history–politics.REQUIREMENTS — ENTRY (2 UNITS):Students may enter the major by fulfillment of the college’s “West in Time” requirement by coursesin classics, political science, history, or the cognate disciplines of art history, philosophy, or religion.Ancient and modern language (to level of proficiency as individually determined by CHP faculty).Normally, language proficiency will be understood to be the ability to read and respond to literary,historical, and philosophical works in either classical Greek or Latin (or, if appropriate to students’interests, Hebrew or Arabic) and a modern European language.HISTORY OF IDEAS (6 UNITS):Students’ historical requirement will regularly be fulfilled by the completion of at least one unit ineach of four periods (antiquity, Middle Ages and Renaissance, modernity, and the contemporaryworld), including at least two units of political science. Because suitable political science coursesfrequently address multiple historical periods, students will consult with their advisers about theappropriateness of particular syllabi to the respective period requirements, sometimes fulfilling twohistorical requirements with paired, parallel political theory courses. Although students may petitionto substitute courses omitted below — for instance topics courses of special interest — for elementsamong the core CHP offerings, the following list will optimally support their development throughthe program:I.Antiquity: History 213/Classics 250 Greek Foundations/Athenian Democracy, Classics/History216 Roman History I, Classics 226 Roman History II, Classics 222/Political Science 234 Freedomand Empire: The Drama of Ancient Politics.II.Middle Ages and Renaissance: History 274 The Middle Ages: The Making of Europe, History275 Renaissance and Reformation: Crisis and Dissent, History 312 Faith, Reason, and Medieval Society.108Comparative LiteratureIII.Modern Period: History 252 Origins of Modern Science, History 277 Early Modern Europe,History 278 Europe from 1789–1848, History 287 Enlightenment Culture, History 288Intellectual History of Modern Europe, Political Science 205 Foundations of Political Economy,Political Science 246 Politics in Literature, Political Science 292 American Political Thought,Political Science 270 Liberty and Equality.IV.Contemporary Period: History 280 20th-Century Europe, Political Science 242 Conservatismand Liberalism, Political Science 372 Contemporary Political Theory, Political Science 392Interpretations of Modern History.The following courses are or may be also appropriate to the major, and may be used to fulfillrequirements in one or more of the respective chronological categories, depending on a given year’ssyllabus, by permission of the respective instructors and the CHP advisers: History 200 Topics and209 Topics in Ancient History, History 410 Advanced Seminar, Political Science 298 What Is PoliticalPhilosophy?, Political Science 344 Realism and Idealism in Political Philosophy, Political Science 408Tutorial in Political Theory, Political Science 419 Seminar in Political Philosophy.THEORY OF HISTORY (2 UNITS):Students may fulfill the historiographical requirement by completing both Classics 221/History 302(Invention of History) and any of the following history or political science courses treating thetradition of historical analysis: History 399 Studying History, or Political Science 303 The Uses ofthe Past, offered as an independent study or summer readings course by Professor Fuller or Neel.MAJOR SEMINAR:The seminar meets regularly throughout the academic year. It may offer presentations by CHPfaculty and students or their guests, as well as common readings and discussions. Although theseminar offers no credit, regular participation will be considered part of the major’s requirements.SENIOR THESIS (2 UNITS):Declared majors must submit well-developed thesis proposals to the CHP advisory group by theend of the junior year. Their two-block thesis requirement must be completed by Block 7 of thesenior year, and may be designated on their transcript by the appropriate course number in theadviser’s discipline: Classics 322 or 401, 402, 411, 412 and 431; History 409 and 415; or PoliticalScience 402 and 450.Comparative Literaturewww.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/comparativeliterature/Associate Professors DAVIS, SCHEINER (director); Adjunct Associate Professor HUGHES; ACM-Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellow CLAREComparative methods in literary studies can be seen as the contribution by the humanities to abroad transformation of university disciplines beginning in the early 19th century; a new perceptionof phenomena in the life sciences (anatomy, psychology), and social sciences (jurisprudence,linguistics, anthropology). The change of perspective was motivated by the need for more systematicrelationships within already existing bodies of knowledge, as well as for new connections betweenobjects apparently foreign, alien to one another. Finally, in what might be felt as an ethicaldimension, one desires to relativize one’s own parochial certainties, and to rethink these from acosmopolitan, and international, viewpoint.The comparative literature program is true to these traditions, while attentive to the necessity ofrevision, change, renewal, of its offerings on the basis of the experience of the multiplicity of literaryforms, as well as current work in literary theory and criticism.The program insists that every course examine works from different linguistic and cultural areas andperiods and/or from different disciplines. We call attention to the origin and diffusions of genres,themes, and movements, and the relation between literary and other art forms. We require readingfluency in original languages (as well as translations) for all upper-division studies (seminars, thesis),and expect that students become acquainted with and capable of employing critical methods oftextual analysis.THE MAJOR — REQUIREMENTS:Eleven units (in addition to language courses below level 306 and in addition to senior thesis workother than 431) required:Comparative Literature 109• 100 Introduction to Comparative Literature — 2 units.• Two units in courses listed (or cross-listed) as Comparative Literature 200, 220, 351, or 352 — 2units.• 210 Introduction to Literary Theory or EN250 Introduction to Literary Theory — 1 unit.• 300 Practice in Comparison — 1 unit.• 310 Junior-Senior Seminar — 1 unit.• Two courses above 300 level in literature, including one course in a foreign language at level 306or above and either a second such course in a foreign language or an advanced English course —2 units.• 391 Advanced Literary Theory or 390 Theory and Practice of Translation — 1 unit.• 431 Senior Thesis.

The border between whatis beautiful and what is good is a fertile ground for students beginning a liberal arts education. Inaddition to sharpening an awareness of the fact that even such intimate feelings as the aestheticexperience are theoretically constructed, students will be encouraged to articulate differentapproaches to account for the artistic phenomenon. An important connection between thingspersonal and things political will come to the fore. Students will be introduced to the thoughts andworks of major Western philosophers and poets, from Plato and Aristotle, Nietzsche, Kant andSchiller, and Baudelaire, Gide, and Thoreau. Students will record their personal reflections on artobjects and will be encouraged to present them to a community of peers, both in short paperscirculated within the class and in class presentations to which other classes will be invited.

Because the Nazis employed so many lies topervert the truth, it has been the concern of a number of post-World War II writers andfilm-makers to render the horrendous truth in their art. In this class we will focus on theformal as well as on the moral responsibilities those artists had to face in order tounderstand and communicate the complexities of the Holocaust through literary or filmicrepresentation.

Readings includeworks by both ancient and romantic authors, such as Hesiod, Euripides, Plato, Hölderlin,Schiller, Keats, Shelley, and Byron. Through readings and through travel to ancient siteswe will work toward an understanding of how the Romantic imagination intertwinedwith ancient texts and concepts of the ancient world to help create the idea of modernGreece. Taught in Greece. (Also listed as English 280.) 1 unit — Davis, Hughes.Block 2: Topics in Comparative Literature: Media and Psychoanalysis.For Jacques Lacan,human subjectivity is constituted by an irrevocable failure: individuals function in societyonly to the extent that they fail to attain the real objects of their desire. Or, as Lacan onceput it, “Desire is the desire for desire.” This course considers that status of desire andsubjectivity in the contemporary media landscape, a setting in which failure has becomea new means for success (Charlie Sheen, Rebecca Black’s “Friday,” and the celebrity statusof “The Jersey Shore” cast are just a few recent examples of success through failure). Howcan we judge the aesthetic value of contemporary media when failure may ensure, ratherthan prevent, profitability? Is there any possibility for an ethics of media when nothingis off limits? To what extent can the psychoanalytic concept of desire be applied to andextended by the aesthetics of new media? We will pursue these and other questionsthrough readings of Lacan, Slavoj Zizek, Todd McGowan, Lee Edelman, Alenka Zupancic,and others, as well as screenings from a variety of contemporary media (including filmand television). (Also listed as English 280 and Philosophy 203.) 1 unit — Kryzch.Block 3: Topics in Comparative Literature: The Age of Romance: Music and Historyin the 19th Century.Nineteenth-century Europe was the site of great creativity,progressive social thought, and great violence. Artistic movements, ranging fromromanticism through realism and naturalism, justified and criticized the creation ofmodern industrial society, the rise of a new type of city, recurring waves of revolution, anda new understanding of human emotions. This course is designed to explore Europeanculture in the nineteenth century through an interdisciplinary perspective. We utilizedifferent kinds of primary-source texts, such as novels, political philosophy, and operalibretti, and we’ll also analyze several contemporary movies. The nineteenth century willnot be presented as a “monolith”; rather we will focus on different European cultures incomparative context (Germanic, French, Italian, British), and we will consider differencesin the female and male experience by studying composers such as Clara Schumann andFanny Mendelssohn. The climax of the course is a prolonged study of “La Traviata.” We’llread Camille, Alexandre Dumas Fils’ novel that served as a basis for the story; we’ll studythe libretto; we’ll learn about the musical elements; and we’ll see the opera.

Technology may begin as an idea in the mind of an inventor,but technologies only come into existence through unpredictable processes that involvehistorical, cultural, and environmental limitations. In those moments when technologybegins to operate unpredictably, independently of its inventors or intended purposes,technology thereby opens up possibilities for philosophical insight into culture, society,and human subjectivity. Readings include thinkers from across the field of Philosophy ofTechnology, including Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Marshall McLuhan, andBernard Stiegler, among others. We will apply our readings and discussions to a varietyissues in film and media; topics may include cybernetics, special effects, digital cinema,and virtual reality.

In this class we will explore these and other alarming philosophicalquestions both through works of science fiction and through non-fiction philosophicalessays. (Also listed as Philosophy 203.) 1 unit — Daly.112Comparative LiteratureBlock 6: Topics in Comparative Literature: The Spanish Civil War in Literature andHistory.Like so many other major upheavals of the past century, the Spanish Civil War(1936–1939) was such a cataclysmic event in the history of Spain, Europe and even the world, that the more it gets studied and examined, the more it seems to defy easyanalysis or provide definitive answers to the twentieth century’s important questions.What we can say definitively is that it sheds much light on those questions and perhapseven some light on the answers. We can also say that a full generation after the death ofFrancisco Franco, the War continues to inspire novelists, poets, historians, artists andmusicians from Spain and elsewhere to express their own notions about what the War wasabout and they think it all meant. This course, taught by a professor of Spanish literatureand a professor of history, takes an inter-disciplinary approach to the current state ofSpanish Civil War studies. (Also listed as Spanish 316 and History 200.) 1 unit — Arroyo-Rodriguez, Blasenheim.Block 8: Topics in Comparative Literature: Literature and the EnvironmentalImagination.Centering on the works of Henry David Thoreau, this course examineswhat used to be called more generally “nature writing” in American literature. The term“environmental imagination” refers to imagining the natural environment as a humanconstruction and reflecting upon such issues as these: how is human history implicatedin natural history?

But this radical change altered alsothe social, cultural and geographic face of its territory sweeping away archaic traditionsand communities that remained almost unchanged for centuries. This rural world, withits myths, hierarchies, static social views (think of patriarchy), and cyclical conception oftime represents the other face of modernity that of a heterogeneity that moderndevelopment had to colonize and homogenize in order to prosper. This course seeks tounearth the traces of a disappearing peasant world within the canon of Italian culture,literature and cinema (F. T. Marinetti, Giovanni Papini, Carlo Levi, Natalia Ginzburg, PierPaolo Pasolini). Students will examine its direct representations as the icon of anexoticized dimension where nature rules over the rational, as a place of poverty andoppression, in short as the negative point of reference for the definition of modernprogress itself. Yet students may also consider how for some authors the rural worldembodies if not an idea of free communal life, at least a space of difference underminingthe infrastructure of an equally oppressive modern system of power. Other questions wewill seek to ask are: what elements contribute to our definition of modernity? What pre-modern traits did we incorporate in that definition? What modern elements have becomeobsolete for us today?

We will walk the historic streets, explore relevant museums,cultural sites, and monuments of the city which for generations has symbolized all thepromises and betrayals of humanism, modernism and urban culture. In conversationswith African American, Antillean, and African expatriate writers and artists, we gain insightinto the work of writers such as Langston Hughes, Aimé Césaire, the Nardal sisters, ClaudeMcKay and Cheikh Hamidou Kane as well as into still simmering debates about the powerof literature, the legacies of colonialism, diasporic culture, the values of humanism, andsocial justice. As historian Franck Schoell has noted, “It is in the quartier of Pigalle and inthe cafés of Montmartre, even in the cafés of Montparnasse, that the first encountersbetween Harlemites and Dahomeans were formed.” It is important to teach this class onsite because all of the texts we are studying explicitly engage the Parisian cityscape and therelationships and conversations that could only happen in Paris. We also are able to takeadvantage of guest lecturers, writers, and performers who illuminate both the history andcontemporary realties of race, literature, and art in Paris. For example, our first guestlecturer, Professor Marina Davies of Colby College (she lives and teaches in Paris) starts aconversation with the class about the literary history of “the Parisian imaginary” — thecombination of the physical and mythical cityscape which has drawn writers andfilmmakers from around the world to the city. She gives us a theoretical vocabulary tobring to our study of the role of Paris in the work and lives of these black writers. A fewdays later, we meet an expatriate African American writer in a tiny garden in Montmartre,the setting of the closing scene of his first novel. We study black surrealism in the contextof seeing André Breton’s wall at the Musée Branly, where the French “reading” of “Other”cultures is clear in the curation of the exhibits, which we discuss critically after our guidedtour. We see the legacy of French colonialism and contemporary multiculturalism in thestreets of the Chateau Rouge neighborhood, and attend cultural and political events, allthe while hearing the voices of black writers and activists past and present. The Africanapast in dynamic engagement with French culture and history is almost palpable in themuseums (from the Picasso Museum to the Branly to the Musée Dapper, which claims tobe the only museum of the black diaspora in the world), cultural sites, streets, andcontemporary conversations in Paris. Knowledge of French is not necessary to take thecourse, but students taking the course for French or Comparative Literature credit will readthe francophone literature in the original, perform oral and written translation exercises,and write their assignments in French.

In response to the changing nature of performance, an alternative discipline hasemerged — namely, Performance Studies. Going beyond the limits of page and stage,Performance Studies has introduced a broader range of academically legitimate subjects,including rituals, festivals, political rallies, concerts, and the aesthetics of everyday life.Moreover, its critical approach emphasizes the contingent, often exclusionaryconstruction of social categories, especially gender, sexuality, and race. In order tonavigate this expanded field, this course seeks to familiarize students with PerformanceStudies’ most influential authors — such as Richard Schechner, Philip Auslander, andDiana Taylor — and principal theoretical models as drawn from theatre, anthropology,and rhetoric. In addition to these readings, the course will ask students to reconsider theown artistic and critical interests as we explore performance outside the classroom incommunity events and our own daily lives.

Reading both primary andsecondary texts, we will study the evolution of theories of “racial harmony” and theimpact of globalization on Brazil’s developing sense of national identity. Our analyticalfocus will be centered on poetry, song lyrics, musical productions, graffiti art, danceschools and performances, and cinematic productions studied in tandem with a range oftheoretical texts. The primary goal of this course is to help students develop anunderstanding of a range of interdisciplinary methodologies that will help them approachcritical questions and respond to cultural artifacts. To this end, students will be requiredto engage in both movement and artistic production as part of the course evaluation.(Portuguese language discussion section optional for advanced language students.)Prerequisite:200- or 300-level course in Comparative Literature, English or other literaturesor consent of instructor.

Beginning with seminalexperiments from the sixties, this course will explore an alternative artistic tradition thatemphasizes elements peripheral to convention cinema, such as film’s visual and physicalqualities. We will first establish how filmmakers like Michael Snow and Tony Conradused irregular rhythmic structures and their medium’s materiality to disrupt spectators’passive pleasure and thereby expose limits shared by artistic and social communication.We will also consider the use of similar techniques by feminist filmmakers such as BarbaraHammer and Joan Jonas to resist the subordination of women to the male gaze. Followingthe invention of video, our line of inquiry will shift to examine the impact of newtechnologies on experimental cinema, which led to the emergence of hybrid artisticgenres, including multi-media performance and installation. By tracing the migration ofcinema beyond the screen in work by artists like Nam June Paik, Anthony McCall, andJeffrey Shaw, the course will ultimately reflect on how these experiments redefine film asit enters a digital age.

We will see art works andfilms from postwar Japan as examples of artistic representations of despair andperseverance. What is it to forget, remember, mourn, and pray? How do we transcendviolence and loss? How does being or becoming a mover or dancer affect our emotionalrigor, seeing/learning, and creativity? These are some of the many questions we willexplore. This is not a dance class, nor is it geared toward performers. We will learn somemovement together, but we encourage you to think about movement as a method ofaccessing human experiences and building knowledge, a way to explore sensations,thoughts, and reactions to a particular space.

Prerequisite:221 or 250 or consent of instructor.Block 7: Issues in 18th Century Literature: Seduction and Satire in Women’s ProseFiction. Alongside the more widely studied “fathers” of the modern novel — Defoe,Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, and Smollett — wrote a group of women, no less central tothe development of the novel but today much less widely known. Women writers suchas Aphra Behn, Delarivier Manley, and Eliza Haywood were tremendously popular duringtheir lifetimes for the creation of a specifically female novel: the seduction novel. Usingthemes that would ultimately become untouchable for women writers in the later part ofthe eighteenth century, Behn, Manley, and Haywood explored female desire and sexualityopenly in their fiction, often using satire to comment on attitudes towards women ineighteenth-century society. How does such amatory fiction relate to larger themes ofgender (and genre) construction in the eighteenth century? What is the gender of thenovel in the eighteenth century? Why do these female authors make sustained use of theseduction narrative, and how do they work to combine it with more traditionally“masculine” forms such as satire? Are they conforming to or subverting received notionsof femininity with such use? What is the legacy of writers such as Behn, Manley, andHaywood? 1 unit — Golightly.352 18th Century British Novel.The novel from Defoe to Austen with emphasis on any oneor several of the following critical issues: the epistolary novel, satire and the novel, religious questand narrative strategies, representations of women in the early British novel, representations of‘otherness’ in the early British novel, and formal innovation and continuity in the early Britishnovel.

Prerequisite:English 221 or 250 or consent ofinstructor. 1 unit.Block 3: Issues in 19th Century Literature: Empire and its Discontents. The prevailingpolitical, social, cultural and literary discourses of our times emerge largely out ofnineteenth century debates and discussions, narratives and counter narratives. Thesediscourses both drove and were produced by Imperialism. In this course we will take aclose and critical look at nineteenth century debates and discussions, narratives andcounter narratives. We will look at canonical nineteenth century novels such as CharlotteBronte’s Jane Eyre, Jane Austen’s Mansfield Parkand Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darknessfrom what Edward Said calls a “contrapuntal” and “nomadic” perspective. Edward Said’sCulture and Imperialismwill help to frame this course. We will read these classics on theirown terms, but then ‘re-read’ them through postcolonial works such as Jean Rhys’ WideSargasso Sea, Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apartand Andrea Levy’s The Long Songthat notonly reconsider their points of view but destabilize and disrupt their narratives. WhileRudyard Kipling is celebrated for his anthems of Empire, he had a more subversive sideto him. Charles Dickens, on the other hand, is celebrated as a humanist, but he had somepretty appalling things to say about the ‘subjects’ and affairs of Empire. We will readselected poems and short stories by Rudyard Kipling and short pieces such as CharlesDickens’ “The Noble Savage” and “The Perils of Certain English Prisoners,” both inHousehold Words, Thomas Babington Macaulay’s “Minute on Indian Education,” andThomas Carlyle’s “Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question.” We will also read someof the theories of race on which such works were premised. In addition, we will read shortpieces by people in the Empire, such as Cornelia Sorabji, T. N. Mukharji and others. Thuswe will ‘read’ the nineteenth century not only through the canonical works of Britishwriters but also through their more obscure yet revealing writings, as well as through thecontrapuntal voices of the people of the Empire. 1 unit — Singh.371 19th Century British Poetry.Selected works by poets writing after 1830, such as Tennyson,Browning, Arnold, the Rossettis, Hopkins, with attention to formal and historical issues.

The premiseof CWS is that historically, as well as in contemporary societies, whiteness, like genderand class, has been a fundamental source of societal stratification. It also recognizesthat other forms of inequality have been or are based on age, religion, sexualorientation, and other social markers.

Students will explorethe relationship between “criticizing” and “doing” — specifically how this relationship expressesitself in different art forms. Students distribute their five units among the categories below in thefollowing manner: two courses, each from a different category, dealing with artistic theory, andtwo courses, each from a different category, involving artistic practice. At least one course in artistictheory and one course in artistic practice must be drawn from the same category.CATEGORY ONE:VISUAL ARTS. [Theory: AH112] [Practice: AS103, AS110, AS203, AS205, and AS214]CATEGORY TWO:THEATRE ARTS. [Theory: DR100] [Practice: DR105, DR108, DR201, DR205,DR206, DR305, DR306, DR307, DR308] [Theory: DA325] [Practice: DA221,DA321, and adjunct courses in dance when they add up to a full unit of credit]CATEGORY THREE:LITERATURE.

This project may be an element of a course in theminor or undertaken outside of formal coursework or for-credit independent study in one of thecontributing departments.Cinema StudiesAdviser — SIMONSAn interdisciplinary approach to the study of cinema. 5 units minimum.OPTION ONE:Students must choose five units among: FS215, FS315, GR210, FS205, GS220,FS212, FS312, FS318, FS284, HS205 (January half-block — when appropriate to film).OPTION TWO:3 units from Option One and two courses which do not deal directly withcinema but which must be related, in some significant way, to at least one of thecinema courses listed in Option One. These courses should be chosen afterconsultation with the adviser for the minor.THE INTEGRATIVE EXPERIENCE:A paper dealing with some aspect of cinema, written in connection with one of the cinema coursestaken in the minor or, for those two choose Option Two, with one of the non-cinema courses, ORa short movie or video project, accompanied by a paper discussing sources, influences, the way itwas made, etc. Some explanation: There are many different contexts in which the relationshipamong the three linked courses — the one cinema course and the two courses in other disciplines— may be seen. In each of the examples below, more than two non-cinema courses have beenlisted, in order to suggest that the options under each cinema course would not be excessivelylimited. Cinema and 20th-Century History, Politics, or Society: Examples: GS220, EN263, SO224,AN293, MU205, FS205, AN219, HY258, HY268; Cinema In Relation to Other 20th-Century Arts:Examples: FS205, AH245, EN398, HS330, MU399, DR204; Cinema and Theories of Art andLanguage: Examples: FS105, AH112, DR100, EN301, FR306, GS208, PH209. No doubt many othercourses would be appropriate in each of these lists, and, of course, there are still other cinema coursesthat would generate their own appropriate clusters.Concepts of Human NatureAdvisers — NOBLETT, RIKERAn examination of the question, “How are we to explain human activity?” by bringing into acommon forum the leading theories of human nature. 5 units minimum.Students must choose at least one unit from each of the following categories and have courses fromat least two departments.270 Thematic MinorsCATEGORY ONE:SOCIAL CREATION OF HUMAN NATURE.AN102, PY100, PY109, SO109,SO228, PH307.CATEGORY TWO:Courses that consider biological or psychological structures and/or forces asnecessary elements in the explanation of human activity: AN101, AN201,BY100 (Sociobiology), BY351, PY120, PY374, PY394.CATEGORY THREE:Courses that examine metaphysical or conceptual issues concerning humannature: PH218, PH100, PH116, PH210, PH307, CL220, GS101.

It may be an approved thesis or tutorial paper within their major. Counts as 1 of the 6 credits.2.) The student may take one of several integrative courses in the minor (denoted by an asterisk),with the stipulation that they be a declared health minor at the time. This would entail asignificant piece of work for that course, such as a major 25+ page research paper. 1 credit.3.) In lieu of the prior options, the student may complete an approved global health internshipthat is the equivalent of a full time internship of at least 4 weeks in length, and one that resultsin a final paper. Specific internship and paper requirements to be determined by faculty directors.1 credit. (Note, we are currently in discussions with summer session about a possible internship offeringstarting in summer 2013.)4.) If options 1 through 3 do not apply, the student can apply to complete an independent studywith a faculty member during senior year. 1 credit.RECOMMENDED:It is strongly recommended that students include at least one block in Statistics (either MA117Probability and Statistics or BY220 Biostatistics) and/or blocks that include Geographic InformationSystem training (e.g., SO246 or EV127 Intro to GIS).There exists some flexibility with the minor with the approval of the two official advisors. Othercourses may count towards the minor with their consent. Also, should students wish to work withan advisor from a different department, this can also be approved by the aforementioned. Althoughthis is a 2 block course, it would only count as one requirement towards the minor.Thematic Minors 273JournalismAdvisers — ALTERS, HENDRICKSON, PRENDERGASTInvestigation of the connections across disciplines that result in self-critical, intellectuallyresponsible journalism. 5 units minimum.Students must take "

The goal of the course will be for students togain insight, not only into Hesse’s life and works, but also into the discourse of“modernism” as it arises at the turn of the century up through World War I. Hesse’s novelshelp to create a version of “selfhood” that persists in many ways to this day. Our readingsand discussion will work toward a critical understanding of modernist version of thepsyche. At the same time, we will analyze the literary techniques through which Hessecreates what we might call the “novel of the psychoanalytic self.” This will be a “ForeignLanguage Across the Curriculum” (FLAC) course.

The Spanish War (1936-1939) was such a cataclysmic event in the historyof Spain, Europe and even the world, that the more it gets studied and examined, themore it seems to defy easy analysis or provide definite answers to the twentieth century’simportant questions. What we can say definitely is that it sheds much light on thosequestions and perhaps even some light on the answers. We can also say that a fullgeneration after the death of Francisco Franco, the War continues to inspire novelists,poets, historians, artists and musicians from Spain and elsewhere to express their ownnotions about what the War was about and what they think it all meant. This course,taught by a professor of Spanish literature and a professor of history, takes an inter-disciplinary approach to the current state of Spanish Civil War studies. 1 unit —Blasenheim, Arroyo-Rodriguez.Block 2: Topics in History: Race in America.

We utilize different kinds of primary-sourcetexts, such as novels, political philosophy, and opera libretti, and we’ll also analyze severalcontemporary movies.

Taking a comparative approach, it puts into focus theshared histories of racialization among these groups without losing sight of asymmetrical relationsof power informing these histories. The course sheds light on the ways these groups positionthemselves and are positioned as racial subjects in distinct and historically specific ways but also inrelational and mutually constitutive ways.212 Theories of Race and Ethnicity.Examines various theoretical and conceptual approachesto the study of race and ethnicity. Attention is given to the various ways race and ethnicity havebeen defined and understood including the ethnicity paradigm, class-based perspectives, and racialformation theory. Examines debates and controversies in the study of race and ethnicity as well asemergent themes and recent developments in the scholarship. Possible topics include a focus on theinterrelations among race and other axes of difference such as gender, class, and sexuality, race andthe structuring of space, the legal construction of race, race and media culture, and race and theprison-industrial complex.

Departmental requirementsare designed not just to prepare students for graduate school, but to give all majors broad exposureto the discipline and to prepare them for responsible citizenship in the contemporary world.A minimum of 10 units in the political science department is required, to include the following:1.) Two units in each of four subfields. The four subfields are: American politics, comparativepolitics, international relations, and political theory. Students must take 200 in the Americanpolitics subfield; 209 or 225 in the international relations subfield; 236 in comparative politics;and 205 or 270 or 292 or 298 in the political theory subfield. Either 209 or 225 can be countedtowards the major, but not both.2.) A tutorial in one subfield selected for emphasis. Students who are admitted to write theses areexempt from the tutorial requirement.3.) One additional course to reach the 10-unit minimum. The elective may not be 231 or 233. Inaddition to the regular courses offered by the department, students may count as their electiveone of the following courses: a topics course (203), an independent study (402), or one coursetaken at another institution.Distinction in Political Science will be awarded based on a graduating senior’s cumulative GPA incourses within the major. Proposals to write a senior thesis must normally be submitted by thebeginning of the final block of the student’s junior year, but a student studying off campus at theend of their junior year may submit a proposal in the first week of Block 1 of the senior year. Thedepartment strongly urges all its majors to achieve fluency in a foreign language and to takePrinciples of Economics and at least two courses in history. Students are strongly advised to take theprescribed courses at the 200 level before taking courses at the 300 level. Non-majors are welcometo sample departmental offerings at that level, but need consent of instructor or chair to so do.Further information is available on the web at www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/politicalscience/.American Politics and Government Courses200 American Politics and Government.The structure and process of United States nationalpolitics and government.

Psychology majors are expected to demonstrate effective oraland written communication and to show critical evaluation of assumptions and evidence regardingpsychological phenomena.Psychology 215Students must earn a grade of C– or higher to pass in ALL courses taken to fulfill major requirements(whether within or outside of the psychology department). When a grade of D+ or lower is receivedin such a course, students must repeat the course for a passing grade. Although the D+, D, and CRgrades fulfill graduation requirements, they do not fulfill major or prerequisite requirements.

Itassumes that such an understanding begins to develop through study of a foreign language, anextended experience outside one’s own country, and a familiarity with approaches which addressthe affairs of nations and peoples.The requirements of the departmental major/international affairs option are as follows:1.) The requirements of the major.2.) At least three units of credit for study outside the United States.3.) Proficiency in a foreign language:For languages that are taught at Colorado College, proficiency through the Conversation andComposition level (usually 305). For languages that are not taught at the college or are taught onlyto the intermediate (usually 202) level, proficiency through the intermediate level. Students maymeet this requirement through placement exams.4.) Three units of credit in courses that cover in a substantial way the foundations used by adiscipline to understand and compare the social affairs of nations and peoples and interactionsamong nations and peoples.A course which covers certain phenomena in geographical areas other than the United States doesnot qualify per se. A student whose major is in a discipline which offers foundations courses musttake at least one of the three units in the major. See an international affairs adviser for a list ofapproved courses.Liberal Arts and SciencesAdviser — Associate Dean of the College EVITTSome students may wish to pursue a major other than an existing disciplinary or interdisciplinarymajor. Such students may petition to major in liberal arts and sciences (LAS) and should submit theirLAS major application to the committee by the end of their second year. This option permits studentswith the help of two faculty advisers from different departments to design special interdisciplinaryconcentrations according to particular interests and needs. It is assumed that the liberal arts and sciencesmajor is interdisciplinary in its conception and is at least as rigorous as any departmental major.1.) Students selecting the liberal arts and sciences major must fulfill the appropriate college degreerequirements as listed in the catalog. A minimum of nine units or a maximum of 14 units maybe counted toward this major. The maximum number of units is recommended.2.) Only two units at the 100 course level can be counted toward the major (language courses at the100 and 200 level cannot be counted as part of the major). At least seven and no more than 12of the units, designated as constituting this major, must be above the 100 course number level.One or two of these units may be General Studies 400 and General Studies 401 (Thesis).3.) Thesis Proposal: A student declaring an LAS major should outline his or her thesis topic and thecourses that will prepare the student to write the thesis. In particular the student should addresswhich courses will provide the methodological and theoretical skills to write a successful thesison the anticipated topic. A written thesis proposal must be submitted to the principal adviser nolater than the end of the junior year. The thesis must be completed and turned in to the principaladviser no later than Block 7 of the senior year.4.) Courses, which constitute the major in liberal arts and sciences, are designated on the transcriptby two asterisks.5.) A student must submit the application for a liberal arts and sciences major to the Dean’s AdvisoryCommittee during the second semester of the sophomore year. A student wishing to apply forthis major after the sophomore year, or to change from another major to the major in liberal artsand sciences, must present persuasive evidence that such a proposal is educationally advisableand that circumstances make it possible to achieve a satisfactory major. The student must alsosubmit a written statement explaining why the proposed goals of the major cannot be achievedthrough a departmental major, a major and a minor, a double major, an interdisciplinary major,or through outside courses taken in addition to the requirement of a departmental major.6.) The principal adviser works closely with the student in constructing the initial proposal, reviewsand approves changes to the original proposed major, helps the student to conceptualize andcomplete the thesis and turns in the final grade. The associate adviser reviews the initial proposalproviding criticism and suggestions, acts as a reader of the final draft of the thesis andrecommends a final grade to the principal adviser.

They reflect the belief of Colorado College that, in addition to the more specializedmajor, you need to gain experience in comparing and connecting ideas and approaches across thedisciplines. For this reason, thematic minors are designed to end with an integrative experience inwhich you bring together much of what you have learned in the minor. The integrative experiencemay consist of a paper, a creative project, a block of independent study, or a special seminar sharedby all participants in the minor. To enable you to gain different disciplinary perspectives, no morethan one unit in the minor may be a course in the department of your major, and it must be directlyrelated to the theme or issue of the minor. You may also be creative and design your own thematicminor. Your proposal must meet the following criteria:• Five or more units of courses in all, including courses in at least two departments other than themajor, no more than one course in your major department and an integrative experience, plannedin advance with an adviser. If the minor you propose includes study abroad, your minor must beapproved before you leave. The proposal must be reviewed and approved by the Dean’s AdvisoryCommittee. Forms for proposing an independent minor are available in the registrar’s office.• Successful completion of a thematic minor will be recorded on your official transcript. The minoris a valuable option and deserves your attention.African American StudiesAdviser — SEWARDThis minor invites interested students to focus on aspects of African American history, politics, andculture culminating in a Capstone project or paper normally undertaken during the last course ofthe 5-unit requirement.Students must take at least one course from each of the following four categories.
