College opportunities have been a tradition in Grundy County for more than 130 years. Grand River College, organized in 1850, was the first school west of the Mississippi to open its doors to women. The second institution, Trenton College, opened in 1867 followed by Avalon College, which came to Trenton in 1890. Ruskin College, organized by Walter Vrooman (from England), became the center of a socialistic educational experiment. These early institutions are now defunct. North Central Missouri College, formerly Trenton Junior College, was founded in 1925 and is the second oldest publicly supported community college in Missouri. In the beginning, it was located on the top floor of Trenton High School in a building located on East Ninth Street in Trenton. The College shared facilities, administration and staff with the high school until the facility became overcrowded. In 1967, the College moved to its present location in the former Central School Building on Main Street. In 2007, land was officially given to the College to establish a second campus with an emphasis in Agriculture and Natural Resources. Trenton Junior College officially became an independent entity by action of the voters at a municipal election in April 1986; in July 1988, the College’s name was changed to North Central Missouri College. Accreditation & Memberships North Central Missouri College is accredited as an institution of higher education by the Missouri Department of Higher Education and The Higher Learning Commission, The Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, 230 South LaSalle Street, Suite 7-500, Chicago, Illinois 60602- 2504, 314-263-2504, www.ncahlc.org. Specific programs within the College carry accreditation and/or approval from:  Missouri Association of College Teachers of Education   Missouri Bureau of Emergency Medical Services  Missouri State Board of Nursing   Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE)  Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA)   National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) Accreditation assures students that work satisfactorily completed at NCMC will be recognized at full value by other colleges, universities and professional schools. Institutional memberships are maintained in several organizations, including American Association of Community Colleges, Association of Community College Trustees, Chambers of Commerce, Missouri Community College Association, and the National Junior College Athletic Association. Individuals within the College also maintain memberships with professional and collegiate organizations such as:  American College Personnel Association, American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges, Association of Career & Technical Education, Mathematical Association of America, Missouri Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, Missouri Association of College Teachers of Education, Missouri College Personnel Association, Missouri League of Nursing, Missouri Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges, Missouri Press Association, National Association of College Teachers of Education, National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, National Council for Resource Development, National Council of Teachers of English, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and others. Governance North Central Missouri College is governed by a six-member Board of Trustees. The trustees are elected by patrons of the College district and serve a six-year term without pay. They are charged with the primary responsibilities of setting College policy and the selection of a President to administer those policies. NCMC operates under the general supervision of the Missouri Department of Higher Education.   North Central Missouri College 8 CA-2019 The Campus NCMC is located in the heart of the Midwest, in downtown Trenton, Missouri. Campus facilities have more than doubled in recent years. The Barton Farm Campus,  a second campus near Trenton, includes three classroom buildings and grounds for development.

Sanford Clock Tower located above the front entrance and named in honor of the College’s first president, as well as the ship’s anchor located outside Geyer Hall are campus landmarks. An elevator is located at the north entrance of the building. The Bert and Rose Hoover Memorial Quadrangle is a beautifully landscaped central green with sitting walls and walkways making Geyer Hall a natural stage for various college and community events. Outdoor arts programs, student activities and special events are often held on the quadrangle. The red stone circle in the center is named Henderson Circle in honor of Leonard “Butch” Henderson. Hoffman Hall (HH), named in honor of Alice May Hoffman and Jeanette Hoffman Robison, houses classrooms, computer and science labs, and faculty offices. A recent expansion doubled the size of the building and now includes access to Cross Hall and a campus commons area.   North Central Missouri College 9 CA-2019 The Lloyd & Margaret Ketcham Community Center (KCC) includes a gymnasium, cardio room, exercise equipment, walking track, meeting rooms, locker rooms, training room and coaches’ offices.

The local Shakespearean Circle has developed a Shakespeare garden and each spring it features flowers and plants featured in Shakespearean literature. A metal arbor was erected in honor of Virginia Holmes and Maurine Embry and adds beauty to the scenic green space. In front of the Plaza sits a large, engraved rock marking a time capsule from 2000. The Dr. T. E. Ritze Building, located on Crowder Road and directly north of Hoffman and Cross Halls, houses the Office of Corporate and Business Relations.

Admission North Central Missouri College is part of Missouri’s community college system, which contributes to educating approximately half of all Missouri college students. Persons enrolling for college credit must have a high school diploma, GED, or home school certificate or be currently enrolled in high school. Some programs, such as nursing, have specific program entrance requirements that must be met before admission into the program will be granted.

North Central Missouri College refrains from aggressively marketing to students or using inducements to encourage students to enroll.  The College reserves the right to evaluate and document special cases and to refuse admission if the College determines the applicant is a threat or potential danger to the college community or if such refusal is considered to be in the best interest of the College.

These classifications are not mutually exclusive and may change as a student’s goals change. Freshman: Completed less than 30 semester credit hours. Sophomore: Completed 30 or more semester credit hours. Because NCMC is a two-year institution, status beyond the sophomore year is not recognized. Full-time: Generally, enrolled in at least 12 hours per semester. Students should review the program recommendations in the catalog to determine the specific course sequence recommended for each program. Part-time Student: Enrolled in less than 12 hours per semester. Audit Student: Student taking a class without the benefit of a grade or credit, usually for self-enrichment and academic exploration. Attendance requirements and mandated exam standards do not apply.

See the International Student Admissions section for requirements. Residency Classification as a resident, for tuition purposes, is determined by Missouri law. The initial classification is made at the time of admission or first-time enrollment. Students are classified according to the location of their true, fixed and permanent home and place of habitation, or the domicile where they intend to remain and to which they expect to return. “In-District” students are those whose permanent home is within boundaries of the North Central Missouri College taxing district. “Missouri Resident” students are those whose permanent home is not within the boundaries of the NCMC District, but is within the State of Missouri. “Out-of-State” students are those whose permanent home is located outside the State of Missouri. The determination of residency status is initially made in the Admissions Office. Status may change when a student is known to move from the district. A student may challenge residency status by presenting sufficient proof, as defined by the Missouri Department of Higher Education, to the Registrar’s Office before the end of the published add/drop period for the semester in which fees will be affected. Change of residency status is not retroactive and will affect future terms only. A dependent student’s residency will remain the same as the custodial parent or guardian. IRS code and definitions will be used to determine dependency. See the Registrar’s Office for complete details on residency qualifications.

Federal Financial Aid Programs Federal student financial aid programs fall under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as established by the U.S. Department of Education. The funds covered in the program are referred to as Title IV funds and include:  Pell Grant  Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG)  Direct Subsidized Loans  Direct Unsubsidized Loans  Parent (PLUS) Loans  Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)  Federal Perkins Loan  Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG)  National SMART Grant  Federal Work-Study (FWS) FAFSA, or the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, must be completed to determine eligibility for federal financial aid. Students should file a FAFSA before February 1 for optimal federal and state aid. NCMC Financial Aid Priority Deadline is July 1 for fall semester, November 1 for spring semester and April 1 for summer schedule. This deadline must be met to avoid having your courses dropped from your schedule due to non-payment, as well as timely refunds.  Grants Federal Pell Grant The most widely known grant is the Federal Pell Grant, or Pell. Pell, like other grants, is a form of financial aid that does not have to be repaid. For many students, Pell provide a “foundation” of financial aid, to which aid from other federal and non-federal sources may be added. The U.S. Department of Education provides funds to each participating college to pay all eligible students. Eligibility and award amount for Pell is determined by a formula passed into law by Congress and dependent upon the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), cost of attendance, and enrollment status. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)  The SEOG is also “federal gift aid” awarded by the College to undergraduate students for college-related expenses. The amount awarded through this grant depends upon available funding, EFC and need. Policy for Return of Title IV Funds Students who have been paid Title IV funds are required to earn these funds by attending classes through at least 60% of the period of enrollment. Students who fail to meet this guideline will be required to repay all or a portion of their Title IV financial aid. This policy applies to students who withdraw from or stop attending all classes.

Continuing education and visiting students may request an advisor or self-advise. All students are responsible for knowing and abiding by all established NCMC academic guidelines and consequent changes. Students are responsible for adding and dropping classes through their NCMC-assigned myCOMPASS online portal. Degree and Program Changes A student may change program of study and/or degree for a term until the add/drop deadline for the term. After the add/drop deadline, any changes will be effective in future semesters.  Students who wish to apply financial aid to their tuition and fees must have a declared degree or certificate in a program of study by the add/drop deadline for the affected term, in addition to meeting other financial aid requirements. Degree, certificate and program of study may be changed by submitting a Degree Change Request Form found in the myCOMPASS student portal.  Class Schedule Changes While NCMC recognizes that schedule changes may be necessary, students should plan carefully and make thoughtful choices in order to obtain the best schedule possible at initial registration. Any changes should be made during the Add/Drop period. Though advisors are available to assist students with the development of their class schedule, the final schedule and degree tracking is the responsibility of each student. Schedule changes may impact length of time to complete a degree, billing, and financial aid. Add/Drop Classes may be added or dropped from a student’s schedule only during the Add/Drop period established for each semester. There is no financial obligation and a 100 percent refund will be given when schedule changes are made during the Add/Drop period. Add/drop deadlines are published on the NCMC website and Academic Calendar located in the college catalog. Some classes may be canceled due to low enrollment before the term begins. Students should check their NCMC email and schedule prior to the start of classes to confirm enrollment status. After the published Add/Drop date, students are financially responsible for costs associated with classes remaining on their semester schedule. North Central Missouri College 26 CA-2019 Administrative Drop Policy An “administrative drop” is when the student is removed from a course(s) as a result of one or more of the incidents outlined below. Students who have been administratively dropped will be charged a $50 fee for each administratively dropped course. Any classes left on a student’s schedule will be charged at the full tuition rate. Administrative drops occur when:  On-Ground Classes  8-week or full semester class -If a student fails to attend during the first ten calendar days of the semester  4-week class - If a student fails to attend during the first six calendar days of the semester Online Classes  8-week or full-semester class - If a student does not complete at least one substantive activity (activity or assignment that impacts the final grade) during the first ten calendar days of the semester  4-week class - If a student fails to complete at least one substantive activity (activity or assignment that impacts the final grade) during the first six calendar days of the semester Course Withdrawal Courses dropped after the Add/Drop deadline are considered withdrawals and students are financially obligated to pay for all associated tuition and fees. A grade will not be earned and a “W” will be recorded on the permanent record. Notifying an instructor, advisor or simply not attending class is not sufficient to withdraw. Students may withdraw by doing one of the following by the Final Withdrawal Deadline: 1. Completing the withdrawal card, available at the Information Desk in the Alexander Student Center. 2. Emailing the request to Registrar@mail.ncmissouri.edu from the student’s pirate email account 3. Mailing a signed, dated, written request to the Registrar’s Office The final withdrawal deadline is published in the academic calendar on the NCMC website and in the student planner. For off-schedule classes, contact the Registrar for withdrawal deadlines. (email: Registrar@mail.ncmissouri.edu). A verified withdrawal, prior to the published withdrawal deadline, is always the student’s responsibility. Withdrawals may be verified by viewing the transcript, available through the student’s online myCOMPASS portal. Course Load Each course offered for college credit is assigned a specific credit hour value. The normal load for a full-time student is 15 to 18 credit hours in a regular semester. Enrollment in a minimum of 6 credit hours per semester is considered half-time, 9 credit hours is three-quarter time, and 12 credit hours is full-time. Enrollment in more than 18 credit hours per semester is considered an overload and should be carefully considered with other obligations. A general recommendation for success is that students spend two hours studying outside of class for every one hour spent in the classroom. International students must maintain enrollment in a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester. Any decrease, through drops or withdrawals, must be approved by the Primary Designated SEVIS Officer, jcunningham@mail.ncmissouri.edu. .  Class Attendance Each instructor may set his or her own standards relative to attendance as it pertains to the grade received. Students are encouraged to attend all class sessions of the courses in which they are enrolled and respond to all online class assignments. Absences reduce the value of the learning experience and also reduce the probability of passing the course successfully. Students who stop attending, with unexcused absences, will be reported to the Financial Aid Office. Federal financial aid awards may be adversely affected by non-attendance. Federal government regulations require that international students attend a minimum percentage of class sessions for all enrolled classes. VISA status may be negatively affected by failure to attend.  Students attending college-sponsored events are excused from class and should not be counted absent. In this case, it is the student’s responsibility to inform their instructor as to when they will miss class in advance of the event (1 week in advance, whenever possible). If an assignment is due, the student must submit the work prior to the absence. If there is a quiz or test on the day of the absence, the student must make arrangements with the instructor to complete the work before the absence or at a time designated by the instructor. North Central Missouri College 27 CA-2019 Academic Conduct Standards of academic and non-academic conduct are included in this catalog and the Student Handbook. Due process is available to all students, including the right to appeal a case and the right to obtain advice. Students are expected to read and abide by the rules and guidelines outlined in this catalog, as well as the Student Handbook. All members of the learning community at NCMC are expected to be honest. The College will not tolerate cheating or plagiarism on tests, examinations, reports, laboratory reports and/or other assignments. Those who engage in such misconduct may be subject to disciplinary action, which can result in expulsion. Appeal Procedures If a student chooses to appeal a policy or decision, they should submit their appeal to the respective Appeals Officer, as referenced on the NCMC website under Consumer information - “Student Complaints/Appeals”.  An appeal form can be obtained online (http://www.ncmissouri.edu), through the myCOMPASS portal, or through the Student Affairs Coordinator located in the Alexander Student Center. Unless otherwise noted under a specific process, appeals must be received by the end of the following semester from the time the business under appeal was conducted. Any issue cited in an appeal must demonstrate that it significantly altered the student’s ability to complete their responsibilities, could not have been anticipated, and involved something outside of the student’s control. Documentation should be provided. Lack of knowledge regarding deadlines or policy and/or disagreement with institutional policy are not circumstances under which an appeal may be granted.   Grading System North Central Missouri College follows a standard grading system. Students receive one of the following symbols for each course attempted.  GRADE ................ DESCRIPTION ... QUALITY POINTS A ......................... Excellent .............................. 4 B ......................... Good ................................... 3 C ......................... Average ................................ 2 D ......................... Below Average ....................... 1 F ......................... Fail ..................................... 0 W ........................ Withdrawal ........................... 0 AU ....................... Audit ................................... 0 P ......................... Pass .................................... 0 I .......................... Incomplete ........................... 0 X ......................... Fail ..................................... 0 Grade Point Average Grade point average (GPA) is the standard term used to describe a student’s overall academic level. Only letter grades of A, B, C, D, and F factor into the grade point average noted on the NCMC transcript. However, P and X grades are factored into the GPA used for financial aid eligibility. To compute the GPA, use the following formula and grade quality points: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0. 1. Compute the number of grade quality points earned per class. For example, a three- credit (3) hour course with a grade of “B” (3) would have a grade quality point value of 9 (3 hours x 3 points). 2. Add together all of the grade quality points earned to date. 3. Add together all of the GPA credit hours to date. 4. Divide the total number of grade quality points by the total number of GPA credits. Transferred credit is not used to calculate the NCMC grade point average. Athletic eligibility is calculated using NJCAA guidelines and with an assigned grade point value of 2.00 for any grade of “P”. Graduation requirements for the Associate in Arts in Teaching Degree include a minimum GPA calculated on all college credit, regardless of originating institution. Grades are available approximately one week after the end of the academic term. Students may access grades through the myCOMPASS portal, accessible from the NCMC website.  Academic transcripts will not be released for students with outstanding financial obligations to the College. North Central Missouri College 28 CA-2019 Auditing a Class A class auditor is a student registered for a course for informational instruction only, not to earn credit. An audit must be declared in the Registrar’s Office by the student prior to the end of the Add/Drop period for the semester. Tuition and fees for audited classes are the same as for those taken for credit. A grade of “AU” - Audit will be placed on the student’s transcript. Financial aid is not available for audited classes. Auditing students are expected to attend the class, but are not required to take examinations or do assignments required of regularly enrolled students.  Incomplete Grades Under extreme circumstances, a student may apply for an incomplete grade prior to the final week of a term. An incomplete grade may be given, at the discretion of the instructor, when accident, illness, death in the immediate family, or other documented circumstances beyond the student’s control prevent the student from completing some course requirements. An incomplete grade should only be considered when 80% of the course requirements have been satisfied with a grade of “C” and attendance has been maintained. Course work must be completed within eight weeks of the first day of the term immediately following the term in which the incomplete was received; otherwise, the grade will be recorded as “F”. No extension of time beyond the allotted 8 weeks will be permitted. The application for an incomplete grade is available in the Registrar’s Office. Pass/Fail Grading Developmental and some college skill classes at North Central Missouri College are graded with “P”-Pass or “X”-Fail grades. Credits earned in courses that are stipulated in the catalog as being graded on a Pass/Fail basis will not be used in computing a student’s grade point average, with the exception of athletic eligibility and satisfactory academic progress for financial aid.  Repeated Courses Students may receive credit value for a repeated course only once, unless the published course description notes otherwise. Repetition of coursework may have a negative impact on financial aid eligibility.  Courses used to meet requirements for a previously conferred degree or certificate may not be repeated.  Grades for transferred-in credit do not override grades earned from NCMC.  Students may repeat a course in which a grade of “C” or lower was earned, provided they have not completed a higher level course with a grade of “A” or “B” that required the first course as a pre-requisite.  Recorded grades will not be removed from the student transcript, but only the last grade earned will be used when computing the cumulative grade point average.  Coursework in the PN and PN to ADN programs may be repeated, regardless of the first grade earned, when the last enrollment in the course was at least five years prior to the repeat term, and the student has not used the credit to meet requirements for a previously conferred degree or certificate. Courses with recorded grades of “A” or “B” may be repeated, for informational purposes only, by declaring an audit at the time of enrollment. In the case of an audit, the student does not receive credit or a grade for the course. The first grade earned in the class remains in the grade point calculation.  Grade Disputes and Appeal Process Grade Disputes During a Semester Faculty members and students should communicate regularly and openly about all grading issues. A student who is dissatisfied with an instructor’s grading decision during a semester should discuss the issue with the instructor and attempt to resolve the matter informally as soon as possible. A student who believes that a grading issue has not been satisfactorily resolved should speak with the Dean or Program Director about the matter. The Dean or Director will work with both the student and the instructor to address the issue. Students may not file a formal course grade appeal during the semester. Grading issues that remain unresolved during the semester may become the basis for a formal course grade appeal once the semester has ended and a final course grade has been assigned. The formal process may be used only for grading issues that impact the final course grade. Disputes Regarding Final Course Grades A student who is dissatisfied with a grading decision must attempt to resolve the matter by contacting the instructor immediately. If the instructor is unavailable, the student may wish to contact the Dean or Program Director within ten business days of receiving the final grade to facilitate communication between the student and the instructor and to help resolve the dispute. Student Final Course Grade Appeal Procedure The North Central Missouri College Student Course Final Grade Appeal Procedure is based on the following principles: North Central Missouri College 29 CA-2019  A student has a right to appeal a final grade that the student believes was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error.  A student’s grade should reflect the student’s mastery of the course subject matter.  Students are entitled to a fair and impartial evaluation of their work.  Students and faculty should communicate regularly and openly about course requirements, assignments, tests, grading procedures, and grades.  The college faculty is responsible for creating the curriculum and establishing the standards by which students will be evaluated in each course.  Faculty members are entitled to the presumption that the grades they assign are an accurate reflection of the performance of the students in their courses.  Both students and faculty members have rights and responsibilities in the grading process.  Students who wish to appeal a final grade are responsible for demonstrating that the grade received was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error.  Faculty members have a responsibility to provide their students with syllabi that clearly explain the basis on which student grades will be assigned.  Faculty members are responsible for providing their students with timely feedback on their performance on tests, papers, projects, and other graded assignments.  Faculty members are responsible for keeping course records, final exams, and other materials on which grades are based (that have not been returned to students) for a year.  Faculty members have a right to have the grades they assign upheld unless it is clearly demonstrated that a grade was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on bias, caprice, or computational or clerical error.  Both faculty members and students have a right to have grade appeals resolved in a timely fashion (as prescribed in the timeline given in this document).  Both faculty members and students have a responsibility to attempt to resolve grade disputes informally. Grounds for a Formal Final Course Grade Appeal A student may file a formal course grade appeal if the following conditions are met:  The student has made legitimate attempts to resolve the dispute informally by discussing the issue with the instructor.  The grading issue at stake impacts the final course grade. (A course grade appeal may not be filed until the semester has ended and a final course grade has been assigned.)  The student believes that his or her final course grade was assigned contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error. Grade Appeals Students wanting to appeal a grade must contact their instructor within ten (10) business days after the end of the semester for which the grade was given using their pirate email account. The deadline for the final ruling of the grade appeal cannot exceed the term following the completion of the course for which the grade is being considered. A student who is dissatisfied with an instructor’s final course grade decision should adhere to the following steps: 1. Discuss the concern or issue with the instructor. THIS IS ALWAYS THE FIRST STEP to the appeals process. If resolution is not achieved after meeting with the instructor, move to step #2. 2. File a formal grade appeal by emailing the reason for the appeal using the student pirate account to the Dean or Program within ten (10) business days of meeting with faculty member. Receipt of the formal grade appeal form and supporting documentation will result in initiation of an investigative process by the appropriate Dean or Director. The appropriate Dean/Director will respond, in writing, to the student within ten (10) business days of receipt of the appeal circumstances. If resolution is not achieved through the Dean/Director, move to step #3.  3. A formal appeal may be made in writing by the student to the Vice President of Academic Affairs within ten (10) business days of receiving the Dean’s decision. Upon receipt of the formal appeal, the Vice President will initiate an investigative process which will result in a written response to the student within ten (10) business days of receipt of the formal appeal. If resolution is not achieved, move to step #4. North Central Missouri College 30 CA-2019 4. If not satisfied with the Vice President’s decision, the student may request through their pirate email, within ten (10) business days of the Vice President’s decision, to move to the next step. At this time a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will be formed to review the appeal. The request to appeal to the panel will be handled by the Vice President. The panel review will be scheduled as soon as possible with a decision being rendered and communicated in writing to the student within ten (10) working days of the panel review. If resolution is not achieved, move to step #5 5. Either party involved in the grade appeal process has a right to appeal to the President of the College within ten (10) business days of receiving the panel’s decision. The President will review the appeals and conduct whatever investigation he/she deems appropriate. The President determines the final outcome of the appeals and will communicate such in writing to the student, faculty, Vice President of Academic Affairs and the appropriate Dean/Director. In all cases, the decision of the President is final. Administrative Final Course Grade Appeal Procedure A. Informal Resolution Upon receipt of a Student Final Course Grade Appeal Form, the Dean or Director will contact both the student and the instructor involved to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If the instructor is no longer with the college, the Dean/Director shall appoint another instructor to represent faculty interests in the appeal. The faculty member representing the absent instructor shall act as a good faith representative of the faculty whose goal is to resolve the grading dispute fairly. The instructor may agree to resolve the dispute informally if he or she believes it is appropriate. For example, if the dispute involves a computational or clerical error and the instructor representing the absent faculty member agrees with the student, he or she may simply sign the Change of Grade Form to change the grade rather than begin the process of a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel to resolve the issue. B. Dean’s Response If the dispute is not resolved informally within ten (10) business days from the student-instructor meeting, the student will communicate, in writing, to the appropriate Dean/Director the desire to continue the appeal process. The Dean/Director will make the instructor aware of the appeal and ask the instructor involved to prepare a written response to the appeal. The instructor’s response should include the following:  A copy of the course syllabus.  A copy of any relevant graded assignments that had not been returned to the student.  A written statement responding to the issues raised by the student.  Any other documents the instructor believes are relevant to the resolution of the course grade appeal.  The Dean/Director should continue to pursue an informal resolution to the dispute if he or she believes that a resolution is possible. The Dean/Director may share the instructor’s response with the student in hopes of finding common ground between the two. The Dean/Director may wish to give the student the opportunity to address issues raised in the instructor’s response that the student has not previously addressed.  The Dean/Director may meet with the student and instructor individually and offer a decision, in writing, within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request to continue the appeal process. If the student is not satisfied with the Dean/Director’s decision, he/she may request in writing, to the appropriate Dean, within ten (10) business days of the Dean’s decision that the appeal be forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. C. Vice President of Academic Affairs The Vice President of Academic Affairs will review the documentation from the student, faculty, and Dean/Director. The Vice President may meet with the student, faculty member, Dean/Director to review the appeal and circumstances. The Vice President of Academic Affairs will offer a decision within ten (10) business days of receipt of the appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the Vice President’s decision he/she may request, in writing, within ten business days of receipt of the Vice President’s decision, request the appeal be forwarded to a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel. North Central Missouri College 31 CA-2019 D. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel The Vice President of Academic Affairs shall appoint a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel to consider the appeal. The Panel shall consist of a minimum of three members: a division chair, at least one full-time faculty member (the student may choose the full-time faculty member), and the Vice President of Academic Affairs and/or the Dean. The instructor involved in the grade dispute is not eligible to serve on the Panel. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel is responsible for ensuring that the grade appeal process is completed before the end of the subsequent semester. The Vice President of Academic Affairs is responsible for ensuring that the instructor and the student have at least ten (10) business days advance notice of the time and location for appearing before the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel if they requested an appearance. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel is responsible for determining the facts in the dispute and making a judgment on the merits of the course grade appeal. The Panel shall review the materials submitted both by the student and the instructor. The Panel may request any other information it deems necessary, including additional instructor records and input from third parties. Both the student and the instructor have the right to request the opportunity to appear in person before the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel if they so choose. If both parties appear before the Panel, they should be heard separately. If neither party requests to appear in person, the Panel should complete its review based on the written materials supplied by the parties and whatever other information the Panel may request. The Panel’s deliberations, including hearing testimony from the parties involved and third parties, shall take place in private. The student has the burden of proof. The student must present clear evidence that a final grade was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error. Once the members of the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel have determined that they have sufficient information to make a decision, they will vote either to grant or reject the grade appeal. A simple majority is sufficient to decide the issue. If the Panel grants the appeal, the panel will determine the appropriate course grade for the student. A member of the Panel shall prepare a written report stating the Panel’s decision and the justification for that decision. Copies of the report must be conveyed to the student, the instructor, and the Vice President of Academic Affairs. If the Panel determines that the student’s grade shall be changed, the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will prepare a Change of Grade Form and submit it to the Vice President of Academic Affairs with the Panel report attached. The stated reason for the change of grade will be “the recommendation of a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel.”  The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will sign the form instead of the course instructor. Sometimes a course grade appeal raises issues that go beyond the resolution of grading issues. These issues could include questions about compliance with ADA guidelines, concerns about an instructor following NCMC policies, or questions of a student’s academic integrity. At the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel’s discretion, they may prepare a supplementary report addressing those issues and present it to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. E. Appealing the Panel’s Decision Either party involved in the grade appeal process has a right to appeal to the President of the college within ten (10) business days of receiving the panel’s decision. The President will review the appeal and conduct whatever investigation he or she deems appropriate. Please see the NCMC Board Policy Manual, Section 2.2.130 for any additional instructions. Academic Forgiveness Occasionally, due to overwhelming or unavoidable circumstances, a student earns grades that are not representative of his or her abilities. The Academic Forgiveness Policy is an appeals procedure that allows a student, who has returned to North Central Missouri College after a minimum five-year absence, to request removal of grades for one semester from the cumulative grade point average shown on their official academic record.  Forgiveness may be requested one time, for one semester only.  Forgiveness will not be considered for students with outstanding financial obligations to the college.  Forgiveness applies to all classes in the semester chosen, regardless of grades. North Central Missouri College 32 CA-2019  Forgiveness may not be requested for any semester including courses used to complete an awarded degree or certificate.  Student must have been absent from the institution for a minimum of five years since the semester to be forgiven.  Forgiveness will not be granted until at least 12 credit hours, with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00, have been earned upon re-enrollment at NCMC.  Grades in forgiven courses are removed from the cumulative GPA at NCMC, but courses and grades remain on the student transcript with a special forgiveness designation  All grades, whether forgiven at NCMC or not, may apply when transferring to another institution. Policies at the receiving institution apply.  Academic forgiveness does not automatically satisfy academic progress standards for financial aid purposes.  Academic Forgiveness Request Forms are available in the Registrar’s Office (email: registrar@mail.ncmissouri.edu). Academic Standards Academic Excellence NCMC encourages academic excellence by naming students who have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement to the honor lists for the fall and spring semesters. The President’s Honor Roll lists students who have earned at least 6 credit hours and achieved a grade point average of 4.00 for the semester. The Dean’s Honor Roll lists students who have earned at least 6 credit hours and achieved a grade point average of 3.50 for the semester. North Central Missouri College officially recognizes students with outstanding cumulative grade point averages at the time of graduation. To qualify for this recognition, at least fifty percent of the student’s coursework in the program must be completed at NCMC. Graduates “with honors” are those with cumulative grade point averages on NCMC coursework of 3.5 to 3.84. Graduates “with highest honors” are those with cumulative grade point averages on NCMC coursework of 3.85 or above.  Academic Probation To maintain good standing, a student must achieve a cumulative grade point average corresponding to the total GPA eligible credit hours at NCMC as follows: 0-14 credit hours 1.50 GPA 15-29 credit hours 1.66 GPA 30-44 credit hours 1.83 GPA Over 44 credit hours 2.00 GPA A student falling below these standards may be placed on academic probation for a period of one semester. At the end of the probationary period, the student will be subject to academic suspension. Students placed on academic suspension have the right to appeal the suspension. Academic suspension appeals should be directed to the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs.  The guidelines for academic good standing differ from those for financial aid eligibility. See the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in the “Financial Aid” section. General Transfer Policy NCMC considers the “transferability” between colleges and universities as a matter of considerable importance and practice. NCMC also believes the relationship between and among academic disciplines and between levels of coursework must be clear. NCMC strives to assist students in making progress toward their educational objectives without unnecessary disruption or duplication of coursework. An articulation agreement is a formal arrangement for transfer of a defined set of academic credits between an academic program at NCMC and a program at another college or university. Transfer guidelines facilitate cooperation between colleges and universities for the purpose of accommodating the needs and interests of students who earn credit at one institution and choose to transfer to another. Successful transfer minimizes loss of time and duplication for students and optimizes the use of institutional resources. NCMC transfer policies recognize that each college and university has a separate and distinct mission and that each has the responsibility to establish and maintain academic quality within that mission. Underlying the policy is an attitude of mutual respect and cooperation among the institutions and recognition that the primary objective of articulation agreements is to benefit students. North Central Missouri College maintains a list of established articulation agreements with other institutions for the transfer of the Associate in Arts, Associate in Arts in Teaching, and Associate in Applied Science degrees, available on the NCMC website. For further information on articulation and transfer policies between institutions contact:  Transfer and Articulation Officer - 660-359-3948 Ext. 1405 or advising@mail.ncmissouri.edu or view the transfer information on the NCMC website (http://www.ncmissouri.edu) Student Resources page. Transferring Credit to NCMC The Missouri Higher Education Core Transfer Curriculum is a recommended lower-division core North Central Missouri College 33 CA-2019 curriculum of forty-two semester credit hours intended to facilitate student transfer among Missouri’s public institutions of higher education. All public colleges and universities have adopted the Core Transfer Curriculum, which is commonly known as CORE 42. CORE 42 is comprised of dozens of courses distributed across five knowledge areas. These courses are designated with a Missouri Transfer (MOTR) course number and icon, which guarantees the one-to-one transfer of these courses among all Missouri public institutions of higher education. NCMC accepts credit earned from institutions accredited by agencies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. All courses designated as MOTR courses by sending institutions will be accepted in transfer. Courses outside the designated Missouri Transfer Core Curriculum will be accepted in transfer when the courses are:  Lower division, credit-bearing courses equal in content to current NCMC coursework.  Lower division, credit-bearing courses with a grade of “D” or higher. Coursework from institutions on a quarter hour system will be converted to semester hours using a two-thirds conversion factor for transfer to NCMC. Transferred-in credit is not used to calculate a student’s grade point average for academic standing at NCMC. All grades, including any received from other higher education institutions, will be considered for athletic eligibility and used to calculate the cumulative grade point average required for graduates in the Associate in Arts in Teaching program. Transfer course equivalencies for many institutions can be found on the Course Equivalency page of the NCMC website, under Degrees & Academics/Academic Records/Transfer Coursework. Transfer Limitations There are some courses that are not accepted in transfer to NCMC. These include:  Career & Technical Education (CTE) courses not equivalent to content and/or level of NCMC courses.  Courses with upper-division level course numbers (300 and above).  Courses in which a grade of “F” (or equal to “F” level work) or an incomplete was received.  Developmental or remedial coursework Foreign College and University Credit North Central Missouri College staff does not evaluate foreign transcripts. Students seeking credit must have their foreign transcripts evaluated by a foreign transcript evaluation service, nationally accredited in the United States, and submit an official copy of the results to the NCMC Registrar’s Office. Credit may be granted for foreign coursework based on the results of such evaluations if substantially similar to courses offered by NCMC. The same requirements and limitations apply to foreign credit as those applicable to credit earned at U.S. colleges and universities. Transfer Appeal Procedure Transfer students have the right to appeal institutional decisions on the acceptance of transfer credit toward graduation requirements at NCMC. Students may complete the Transfer Credit Re-evaluation Appeal form and submit to the Registrar’s Office. Instructional department chairpersons will review submitted appeal forms and supporting documentation and forward decisions on transferability to the NCMC Registrar. A student, whose appeal is denied, may file a request for review with the Dean of Instruction. If the issue is not resolved to the student’s satisfaction, the Vice President of Academic Affairs will make a final decision. For more information, call (660)359-3948, ext.1206 or email registrar@mail.ncmissouri.edu.  Credit for Prior Learning (CPL) North Central Missouri College believes that learning is a lifelong process and recognizes knowledge is acquired in many different ways. In addition to the traditional classroom setting, mastery of college-level knowledge and skills may occur as a result of nontraditional learning experiences such as employment, military training and experience, non-collegiate training programs, advanced high school courses, and self-development. NCMC awards credit for measurable college-level learning which includes knowledge, skills and competencies that students have obtained as a result of their prior learning experiences. College credit may be granted on a case-by-case basis for prior learning that can be documented and is equal to learning outcomes of NCMC regular credit course offerings. Application for credit for prior learning (CPL) must be approved prior to course enrollment, regardless of method or type of prior learning. All mandatory institutional requirements for certificates and degree programs must be met and individuals are only eligible for prior learning credit once officially accepted as an NCMC student. Missouri state law limits the number of credits that can be awarded for prior learning to a total of 30 credit hours. A maximum of 50% of courses required in a certificate or degree program will be awarded for prior learning, institutional or North Central Missouri College 34 CA-2019 national examinations, and articulated credit. Please note that there may be financial aid implications as it relates to credit for prior learning. Please visit with the Financial Aid Office for further details. Credit granted through one of the CPL options may be used to fulfill NCMC program requirements, however transferability to other institutions is at the discretion of the receiving institution.  Non-Collegiate Programs  Credit may be granted for training programs that have been successfully completed at non-collegiate organizations such as government agencies, and corporations and businesses, when applicable to students’ declared programs of study at NCMC and approved by the NCMC instructional department and dean. Non-collegiate courses will be evaluated in accordance with the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations and with The National College Recommendation Service (formerly known as PONSI, the National Program of Non-collegiate Sponsored Instruction) recommendations, as well as in accordance with the college’s articulation agreements with nontraditional organizations and agencies. Non-collegiate programs must be approved prior to NCMC course enrollment when students believe they have mastery of course skills and objectives. An approved application for Credit for Prior Learning and payment of fee is required to award credit. Credit for non-collegiate programs cannot be retaken and cannot be taken by students previously unsuccessful in courses for which they are seeking CPL credit. Students must be admitted to the college prior to receiving credit. Official transcripts or certificates must be submitted to the registrar’s office. Information on availability can be sought through division chairs or the appropriate academic dean. Missouri state policy requires industrial certification, used for credit for prior learning, must have been awarded within the last five years.  Military Education and Training  Credit may be granted for military education and training, based on recommendations made by the American Council on Education. Credit will be awarded in disciplines substantially similar to courses and programs offered by NCMC. Official military transcripts, including Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), AARTS, SMART, or other military transcripts, must be submitted to the registrar’s office for evaluation. There is no fee charged to transcript credit for training in the armed services.  Portfolio Assessment   Credit for prior learning acquired through employment, self-study, volunteer, civic, or other activities may be awarded through the portfolio assessment option. Students must demonstrate that prior learning and experience have resulted in the acquisition of college-level competencies and skills directly related to courses in their learning programs. Portfolio assessments can be attempted only once per course and cannot be taken by students previously unsuccessful in courses for which they are seeking credit. Students must be admitted to the college prior to attempting portfolio assessment. Students must complete the application process for credit for prior learning and receive prior approval for portfolio assessment by the dean and appropriate academic department chairperson. Upon approval, the student must pay the required CPL fee and complete the portfolio process within thirty days. The appropriate department chair will assess the portfolio to ensure the student has met or exceeds the learning objectives of the course.  Licensures & Certifications North Central Missouri College may award credit for some licensures and certifications, when applicable to a career and technical program at NCMC. The certification must be current, documented and approved by the academic department chairperson and dean. Credit is given when the training and experience required for the certification is equivalent to learning outcomes in courses offered at North Central Missouri College. National Examinations The national examination programs for which the college awards credit are:  Advanced Placement (AP) Exams  Subject-matter exams sponsored by the College Board and generally administered through high schools at the culmination of advanced placement (AP) course offerings. Further information can be obtained by contacting high school guidance offices or the College Board website. The college generally awards credit for scores of 3, 4, or 5.  College-Level Examination Program (CLEP)  Credit may be awarded for national credit-by-examination program providing individuals of all ages and backgrounds the opportunity to receive credit for college-level achievement acquired in a wide variety of ways. General and subject examinations are available in many different areas. Official test scores must be submitted to the office of the Registrar.  DSST (formerly known as the DANTES Subject Standardized Tests)  Students participating in the DSST program have the opportunity to earn college credit for learning that has occurred outside the traditional classroom. Students may earn up to three credits for each North Central Missouri College 35 CA-2019 examination based upon their scores and the American Council of Education’s (ACE) score recommendations. Additional information can be obtained on the DSST website.  Excelsior College Exams  Students may complete subject-based exams developed and offered through Excelsior College and Pearson VUE. Students must receive a grade of “C” or higher for examinations to be considered for college credit at NCMC. Official transcripts must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office for evaluation.  Institutional Proficiency Examinations Institutional proficiency examinations are offered for some, but not all, NCMC credit classes. An application for credit for prior learning through an institutional exam must be approved by the appropriate dean and academic department chairperson. Upon approval and payment of the required CPL fee, students contact the appropriate faculty member to arrange to take the proficiency exam within 30 days.  Proficiency exams cannot be retaken and cannot be taken by students previously unsuccessful in courses for which they are seeking credit. Students must be admitted to the college prior to taking proficiency exams. Proficiency exams must be taken within thirty calendar days after fee payment. The appropriate department chair will evaluate the exam to ensure the student has met or exceeds the learning objectives of the course.  Articulated Credit North Central Missouri may award credit for approved programs of study taken at area high schools and technical schools. Coursework is designed for use toward a career and technical certificate or degree at NCMC. Qualified students must submit articulation certificates and official transcripts from the sending schools to the registrar’s office. For more information on approved programs, please visit the Dual Credit page, under Degrees/Academics, on the NCMC website.  Graduation Requirements Graduation requirements for each degree and certificate program are outlined in the Programs of Study section of this catalog. The catalog in force at the time a student begins a program will be used to establish graduation requirements, provided the student maintains continuous enrollment in the declared program. Continuous enrollment for this purpose is defined as the successful completion of at least three credit hours in at least two of the three terms per academic year in the program of study. Students who do not maintain continuous enrollment in the program of study will lose the right to use the original catalog requirements and must use the catalog in force at the time of re- enrollment, program change, or application for degree completion. Candidates for graduation also have the option of selecting the current catalog (in force at the time an application for graduation is submitted) in order to fulfill program requirements. Programs may occasionally be made inactive or eliminated at NCMC. Students enrolled in a program at the time it is made inactive may complete degree requirements and graduate in the program as long as the following criteria are met:  Continuous enrollment is maintained in a program of study  A minimum of 25% of the total credit hours required for the program have been earned  when the program is inactivated  Career and technical coursework can be made available by arrangement  All degree requirements are met within six semesters of program elimination Graduation requirements can be met through a combination of NCMC courses, transfer credit and credit obtained through nontraditional means, however a minimum of 25% of the credit hours required in the certificate or degree must be earned through traditional means at North Central Missouri College. A maximum of 50% of the required credit hours may be earned through non-traditional means (refer to Credit for Prior Learning section). Students who are planning to transfer credit back to NCMC to complete degree requirements should complete the Application of Transfer Credit for Degree Completion form, available in the Registrar’s Office, on the myCOMPASS portal, and on the college website, during the last semester at NCMC. The transfer of credit must occur within one year from students’ last enrollment at NCMC. All other graduation requirements must be met. All degrees and certificates require a minimum cumulative grade point average. Some programs of study have additional graduation requirements. The Missouri Reverse Transfer (MRT) initiative allows a student, who transfers from NCMC before earning an associate’s degree, to opt-in to the MRT program at a Missouri baccalaureate-granting institution. Academic records will be shared between the baccalaureate-granting institution and NCMC until the student completes the required credits for the award of an associate’s degree. Contact the MRT Coordinator at the 4-year institution for more information.   North Central Missouri College 36 CA-2019 Application for Graduation Students may earn multiple degrees or certificates from North Central Missouri College.  An application for graduation is required for each award sought. A minimum of an additional 6 credit hours, beyond the first award, must be earned from NCMC for each subsequent certificate and 12 credit hours earned from NCMC for a subsequent associate’s degree beyond the previous award. Students are encouraged to apply for graduation prior to enrolling for their final semester at NCMC to allow time for a degree audit. The responsibility for enrolling in courses that fulfill graduation requirements remains with the student. Application submission dates are:  December graduates - April 1 through October 1   May graduates - November 1 through March 1   July graduates - November 1 through March 1  The application is available on the NCMC website (http://www.ncmissouri.edu/), on the myCOMPASS portal, or at the Alexander Student Center info desk. Applications must be signed by both the student and the academic advisor before submission to the Registrar’s Office.  Commencement Attendance at commencement is highly encouraged and an important part of reaching this significant milestone. Students who are unable to attend commencement must notify the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs as soon as possible. 2018 CommencementCommencement is held in May at the end of spring semester. Students who expect to complete degree requirements in the previous fall term, spring term or the immediately-following summer term are eligible to participate if they submit their applications for graduation by the deadline. Students may only participate in the ceremony in the academic year in which they file an application for graduation. Failure to meet all graduation requirements does not prevent participation in the graduation ceremony. Students who do not complete degree requirements in the year the graduation application is filed, must re-apply and pay a fee in order to participate in the commencement ceremony in a future year. Graduate Recognition North Central Missouri College officially recognizes those students with outstanding grade point averages at the time of graduation. To qualify for this recognition, at least fifty percent of the student’s coursework in the program must be completed at NCMC. Graduates “with honors” are those with grade point averages on NCMC coursework of 3.5 to 3.84, and graduates “with highest honors” are those with grade point averages on NCMC coursework of 3.85 or above. Spring commencement honors are based upon the grade point average at the end of fall term. Final graduate honors, based on all grades, are acknowledged on the final transcript and may be different from those announced at commencement. For each academic year, the Arts and Sciences Division of the College honors a graduating Associate in Arts student with the Academic Excellence Award. Qualifications for this include a minimum of 3.5 GPA, recommendations from the Arts and Sciences instructors and a service component. Specific deadlines and application information will be announced through the myCOMPASS student portal.  North Central Missouri College 37 CA-2019 After NCMC Transfer Assistance NCMC provides assistance to those students who wish to transfer to other colleges or universities. Most students who have completed the Associate in Arts degree at NCMC and transfer to a Missouri public four-year institution are granted junior class standing with the lower level general education requirements met. Students at North Central Missouri College have the option of completing a general education block consisting of 42 credit hours which will meet the general education requirements at most Missouri public institutions. Contact the Registrar’s Office for information and assistance. When planning to transfer to a private or any out-of-state university, all course selections should be carefully based upon the specific requirements and recommendations of that school. Missouri Reverse Transfer Reverse transfer provides students who have not completed their degree with NCMC with the opportunity to earn a degree or certificate. Reverse transfer is available to students who have completed at least 15 credit hours at NCMC before transferring to a four-year institution. Students combine the credits earned at NCMC with the credits earned at a transfer school to complete their degree. Contact the Missouri Reverse Transfer Coordinator at the baccalaureate-granting institution for more information. Students who opt-in to the program and meet degree requirements will be notified when they have earned a degree from NCMC. Alumni North Central Missouri College alumni are in good company.

Dozens of clubs and organizations are available for leadership and fun, plus exciting campus activities and intercollegiate sports are close at hand. NCMC’s housing facilities are supervised by the Director of Residence Life, Residence Hall Coordinators and Resident Assistants (RAs). RAs are students who live in the residence halls and assist with community building and management of the halls. For more information on RA positions, contact the Director of Residence Life.

In addition, oversight, policies, and activities are planned to meet the general needs of the traditional college-age student. As a result, applicants beyond the range of 17-23 are encouraged to carefully consider “fit” before living in on-campus housing. Housing is assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, and early confirmation of arrangements is encouraged.

NCMC Creed–The NCMC Student Senate unanimously passed the following creed in 1996. We encourage students to make this creed their own. “The community of scholars at North Central Missouri College is dedicated to personal and academic excellence. Choosing to join the community, calls upon each member to follow a creed of civilized behavior. As a member of this community I believe in practicing personal and academic integrity; I believe in respecting the dignity of all persons; I believe in respecting the rights and property of others; I believe in discouraging bigotry, while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas and opinions; I believe in demonstrating concern for others, their feelings and their need for conditions which support their work and development. Allegiance to these ideals obligates each NCMC community member to refrain from and discourage behaviors which threaten the freedom and respect every individual deserves.” North Central Missouri College 42 CA-2019 Intercollegiate Athletics The intercollegiate athletic program provides competition of a high quality and allows the exceptional athlete to earn a scholarship for his/her sport skill.

All hearings shall be closed, however, the hearing officer may also request the presence of others who have personal knowledge of the alleged misconduct. A student who would like to have an advisor at the hearing must notify the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs, or designee, at least three (3) business days before the hearing. The student may confer with the advisor, but the advisor will not be allowed to address the judicial officer, any witnesses, or speak on behalf of the student. In addition, the advisor should keep the following in mind: The hearing process is not a court of law. It is not obligated to follow the formal rules of evidence and procedure. Academic decorum requires an advisor to play a different and more limited role than in the court. The standard of proof for the College shall be “preponderance of evidence.”  3. Findings and Decision–The hearing officer shall issue a decision and impose sanctions if warranted. The hearing officer reserves the right to postpone a decision if additional information is needed. The student will be notified of the decision within ten (10) business days after a decision has been made. A student found responsible for a violation of the Student Code of Conduct is entitled to an appeal and should follow the guidelines provided in the student handbook. 4. Hearings by Mail–The Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs or designee has the authority to settle matters via mail, when classes are not in session or when it is determined by the Dean that the student cannot attend due to extenuating circumstances. In this instance, the hearing officer will contact the student via a certified letter within ten (10) business days of receipt of the incident report, and allow the student to North Central Missouri College 48 CA-2019 respond to the charges within a reasonable time. The student can respond to the charges, either in written form or by scheduling a meeting by the deadline provided in the letter. If the student chooses not to respond or a response is provided in written form, a determination of responsibility will be made by the hearing officer based on the information provided. At that time, the hearing officer may impose appropriate sanctions. The Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs, or designee, shall have the power and jurisdiction to order any student to cease and desist from any activity that is judged disruptive to the institution’s operation. If the student fails to cease and desist from such activity, the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs, or designee, after discussing the matter with the student, may immediately suspend the student for a period of time not to exceed ten (10) business days, pending a formal hearing. Appeals should follow the procedures outlined in C, “Appeals for both Academic and Non-Academic Misconduct” C. Appeals for both Academic and Non-Academic Misconduct 1. Appeal to the Vice President of Academic Affairs–The student may appeal the initial hearing officer’s decision to the Vice President of Academic Affairs by filing a written notice of appeal with the Vice President of Academic Affairs within ten (10) business days after the date of issuance of the decision by the hearing officer. The student should cite specific reasons for the appeal. The Vice President of Academic Affairs shall review the record of the case, the appeal documents and other documentation and may affirm, reverse or modify the hearing decision. The Vice President, at his/her discretion, may meet with the student, faculty and/or initial judicial officer to discuss the appeal. A written decision shall be provided to the student and the appropriate judicial officer within ten (10) business days of the date the decision is rendered. 2. Appeal of the Vice President’s Decision–The student may appeal the Vice President’s decision to the College President by filing a written notice of appeal with the President within ten (10) business days after the date of the Vice President’s decision has been rendered.

A written decision shall be provided to the student and the appropriate judicial officer within ten (10) business days of the date the decision is rendered. Please see the NCMC Board Policy Manual, Section 2.2.130 for any additional instructions. 3. Failure to Attend Hearing–If at any point during the process a student fails to attend any scheduled hearing without prior approval from the hearing officer, the student loses their right to appeal the decision. 4. Status During Appeal–The student’s enrollment status shall remain unchanged pending the final decision in the matter, except in cases of emergency where the President or designee determines that the safety, health or general welfare of the student or other College parties are involved. D. Records. The Office of the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs is the official custodian of all educational records involving nonacademic misconduct. The Office of the Vice President of Academic Affairs is the official custodian of all educational records involving academic misconduct. 1. Academic Misconduct Records: Student files containing record of an offense of such gravity to result in separation from the institution shall be permanent. Student files containing records of offenses that do not result in separation from the institution shall be destroyed after three years. 2.

Policy – Alcohol and Illegal Drugs In accordance with federal law, and as described in more detail below, NCMC has adopted and implemented a program and policies to prevent the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and employees. Students Students are expected to comply with local and state laws pertaining to alcoholic beverages, controlled substances and illegal drugs. In addition, the manufacture, distribution, sale, possession, consumption, use or transportation of alcoholic beverages, controlled substances and illegal drugs and/or possession of drug paraphernalia by any student on College property, at any college-sponsored student activity, or at NCMC approved classes, field trips or activities off campus shall be strictly prohibited. This includes possession of alcoholic beverage containers. No student shall be in an intoxicated condition, which may be evidenced by disorderly, obscene or indecent conduct or appearance, while on campus or at a college- approved event off campus. No student shall furnish or cause to be furnished any alcoholic beverage to any person under the legal drinking age. Missouri under-age drinking laws and federal and state drug laws regarding the possession, use and sale of illegal drugs will be enforced through judicial referrals and/or reporting incidents to the Trenton Police Department. NCMC will impose sanctions, consistent with local, State, and Federal law, for violations of NCMC alcohol and drug policies and the Student Code of Conduct. Sanctions may include a verbal warning, written warning, loss of privileges, probation, suspension, expulsion from the halls and/or campus, or imposition of a lesser sanction. Sanctions may also include classes, community service, referrals for appropriate counseling and/or referral to local law enforcement for prosecution. If a student is convicted of violating criminal laws regarding alcohol or drugs, they may be subject to civil action. Legal sanctions may include classes, community service, fines, prison terms, loss of driving privileges, and mandated rehabilitation programs. Employees The unlawful possession, purchase, manufacture, use, sale or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by employees on college property or at any of its activities is prohibited. Violations of NCMC alcohol and drug policies as stated in College policies or employee handbooks/manuals may result in disciplinary action including corrective discipline, counseling, (faculty) reassignment, verbal warnings, documented warnings, probation, suspension with or without pay, and discharge for employees and/or referral to local law enforcement for prosecution. If an employee is convicted of violating criminal laws concerning alcohol or drugs, in addition to civil action, the employee may be subject to termination. Legal sanctions may include classes, community service, fines, prison terms, loss of driving privileges, and mandated rehabilitation programs. Failure to disclose previous convictions on a job application is grounds for termination.

Sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, and failure to conform to stereotypical notions of femininity and masculinity, as well as same gender harassment.  Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited sex discrimination, and sexual violence is a particularly severe form of sexual harassment.  “Sexual misconduct”, as used in the policy, is an umbrella term that collectively refers to sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.   NCMC is committed to taking appropriate action against those who violate this policy. NCMC employees are required to report any violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy. Students or staff who have experienced sexual misconduct are encouraged to make a report with the Title IX Coordinator: Dr. Kristen Alley, 12 Alexander Student Center, 1204 Main Street, Trenton, MO. 660-359-3948 X1400, kalley@mail.ncmissouri.edu.

Involuntary Administrative Withdrawal  A student may be subject to involuntary administrative withdrawal from the College or from College housing if it is determined that the student: a. Engages in or threatens to engage in behavior that poses a danger of causing physical harm to others, or b. Engages in or threatens to engage in behavior that interferes with the welfare of other members of the College, the educational process, or the academic environment c. Engages or threatens to engage in behavior that would cause significant property damage or directly and substantially impedes the lawful activity of others engaged in pursuits relating to the mission of the institution. These standards do not preclude removal from College housing in accordance with the residence hall occupancy agreement or other College rules and regulations. In order to determine if an involuntary administrative withdrawal is warranted, the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs may require a psychological/psychiatric evaluation. If a withdrawal process is initiated, the student shall be notified in writing. A request for an appeal must be filed, in writing, to the Vice President of Academic Affairs within two (2) business days of receipt of notification of involuntary administrative withdrawal.

Students awarded AA degrees are assured transfer to Missouri public universities through the Missouri Articulation Agreement and are accepted with junior standing at most Missouri public institutions, having fulfilled freshman and sophomore requirements with a solid foundation for upper class study. Credits earned in this program are accepted at state colleges and universities and many private institutions. Students receive individualized advisement in the selection of courses in order to meet the requirements of the transfer institutions in the college majors selected. Articulation guides for specific course transfer are available from advisors and the NCMC website (http://www.ncmissouri.edu/). Transfer students not planning to earn the Associate in Arts degree should carefully select courses that meet the general education or transfer requirements of their particular transfer school. A minimum recommendation is that students complete NCMC’s 42 credit hour General Education Core. General Education Rationale General education is the curricular foundation for Associate in Arts Degree students at North Central Missouri College. It encourages students to acquire and use the intellectual tools, knowledge and creative capabilities necessary to study the world as it is, as it has been understood and as it might be imagined. It also furnishes students with skills which enable them to deepen that understanding and to communicate it to others. Through general education, North Central Missouri College equips students for success in their specialized areas of study and for fulfilled lives as educated persons, as active citizens and as effective contributors to their own prosperity and to the general welfare of society. As knowledge of the world is structured, so must general education be constructed to introduce students to the traditional disciplines of the arts and sciences. As that knowledge is ever changing, so must general education alert students to connections between the traditional disciplines and to the potential for interaction among all branches of knowing, ordering, and imagining the real world. As the real world is diverse, so must general education inform students that the world is understood in different ways and provide them with the means to come to terms, intelligently and humanely, with the diversity. As the diversities of knowing and understanding must be made open and accessible, so students must acquire appropriate investigative, interpretative, and communicative competencies. General Education Policy In order to facilitate the transfer of students among institutions of higher education in the state, the Missouri Department of Higher Education has supported the development of a statewide general education policy that is intended to ensure the portability of general education credit among Missouri’s colleges and universities. State-level curricular goals and institutional-level student competencies for general education fall into two categories: academic skills and knowledge. 1. Skills Areas A. Communicating To develop students’ effective use of the English language and quantitative and other symbolic systems essential to their success in school and in the world. Students should be able to read and listen critically and to write and speak with thoughtfulness, clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness. B. Higher-Order Thinking To develop students’ ability to distinguish among opinions, facts, and inferences; to identify underlying or implicit assumptions; to make informed judgments; and to solve problems by applying evaluative standards. C. Managing Information To develop students’ abilities to locate, organize, store, retrieve, evaluate, synthesize, and annotate information from print, electronic, and other sources in preparation for solving problems and making informed decisions. D. Valuing To develop students’ abilities to understand the moral and ethical values of a diverse society and to understand that many courses of action are guided by value judgments about the way things ought to be. North Central Missouri College 57 CA-2019 Students should be able to make informed decisions through identifying personal values and the values of others and through understanding how such values develop. They should be able to analyze the ethical implications of choices made on the basis of these values. 2. Knowledge Areas A. Social and Behavioral Sciences To develop students’ understanding of themselves and the world around them through study of content and the processes used by historians and social and behavioral scientists to discover, describe, explain, and predict human behavior and social systems. Students must understand the diversities and complexities of the cultural and social world, past and present, and come to an informed sense of self and others. (Students must fulfill the state statute requirements for the United States and Missouri constitutions.) B. Humanities and Fine Arts To develop students’ understanding of the ways in which humans have addressed their condition through imaginative work in the humanities and fine arts; to deepen their understanding of how that imaginative process is informed and limited by social, cultural, linguistic, and historical circumstances; and to appreciate the world of the creative imagination as a form of knowledge. C. Mathematics To develop students’ understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts and their applications. Students should develop a level of quantitative literacy that would enable them to make decisions and solve problems which could serve as a basis for continued learning. D. Life and Physical Sciences To develop students’ understanding of the principles and laboratory procedures of life and physical sciences and to cultivate their abilities to apply the empirical methods of scientific inquiry. Students should understand how scientific discovery changes theoretical views of the world, informs our imaginations, and shapes human history.
