To qualify for Federal Loan program funds, the student must meet the eligibility requirements for Federal Student Aid . Students must be enrolled at least half-time during the period of enrollment to retain their eligibility for DL program funds . Students whose enrollment status is below half-time are not eligible for DL program funds . If eligibility is lost due to being enrolled less than half-time, a student can regain eligibility if enrolled at least half-time during a subsequent period of enrollment . How to ApplyYou can complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www .fafsa .gov . Follow these easy steps to simplify the process of applying for federal student aid .1 . Gather the documents needed to apply . For example, you’ll need: •  income tax returns (yours and sometimes your parents),  W-2 forms, and other records of income, and • identification documents (social security cards, driver’s licenses) .The FAFSA is used to apply for federal financial aid (grants,  work-study, and loans) . You’ll need a PIN to “sign” your online FAFSA, make corrections to the application, and more . If you  are a dependent student, your parent will need one too . Method and Frequency of Aid DisbursementsFinancial aid is awarded based on an academic year as defined on a program-by-program basis at the institution . Disbursement of aid varies by the type of assistance . The Federal Pell & SEOG Grants, Stafford loans, and Plus loans for those who qualify, will be paid to the student’s account during each payment period or term . (e .g ., Terms – three terms and Semesters –  two terms) . Once tuition and fee obligations charged by the institution have been met, the student may receive the excess amount of federal student aid that creates a credit on the account . Satisfactory Academic ProgressStudents are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress while enrolled at Arizona College . Failure to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress could result in ineligibility for federal student aid . The Satisfactory Academic Progress information is contained in the Scholastic Standards section of the catalog . Repayment Terms of Stafford LoansYour loan servicer, the organization that handles billing you for your loan, will provide you with information about repayment and your repayment start date . Our National Student Loan Data System can tell you who your loan servicer is . You can visit the servicer’s website or call them to find out how to make payments . It is very important that you make your full loan payment on time either monthly or according to your repayment schedule . If you don’t, you could end up in default, which has serious consequences .The U .S . Department of Education’s National Student Loan Data SystemSM (NSLDSSM) provides information on your federal loans including loan types, disbursed amounts, outstanding principal and interest, and the total amount of all your loans . To access NSLDS, go to www .nslds .ed .gov .In some cases, you might be able to reduce your interest rate if you sign up for electronic debiting . After you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment, you have a period of time called a grace period before you begin repayment . The grace period is six-months for a Federal Stafford Loan .You have a choice of several repayment plans that are designed to meet the different needs of individual borrowers . The amount you pay and the length of time to repay your loans will vary depending  on the repayment plan you choose .If you’re having trouble making payments on your loans, contact your loan servicer as soon as possible . Your servicer will work with you to determine the best option for you . Options include:• Changing repayment plans .• Requesting a deferment – If you meet certain requirements, a deferment allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan .• Requesting a forbearance – If you don’t meet the eligibility requirements for a deferment but are temporarily unable to make your loan payments, then (in limited circumstances) a forbearance  allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan, temporarily make smaller payments, or extend the time for making payments .If you stop making payments and don’t get a deferment or forbearance,  your loan could go into default .If you default, it means you failed to make payments on your student loans according to the terms of your promissory note, the binding legal document you signed at the time you took out your loan . In other words, you failed to make your loan payments as scheduled . Your school, the financial institution that made or owns your loan, your  loan guarantor, and the federal government all can take action to recover the money you owe . Here are some consequences of default: ADMISSION, REGISTRATION & ENROLLMENT44ADMISSION, REGISTRATION & ENROLLMENT• National credit bureaus can be notified of your default, which will harm your credit rating, making it hard to buy a car or a house .• You will be ineligible for additional federal student aid if you decide to return to school .• Loan payments can be deducted from your paycheck .• State and federal income tax refunds can be withheld and applied toward the amount you owe .• You will have to pay late fees and collection costs on top of what you already owe .• You can be sued .Sample Standard Repayment ScheduleLoan Amount $9,500Interest Rate 6 .8% Repayment Summary Months in Repayment 120 Monthly Payment $109 .33 Total Interest Payment $3,619 .60 Total Loan Payment $13,119 .60General conditions and terms for work-studyFederal work-study is awarded to students who have financial need and who have indicated an interest in work-study on their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . Arizona College work-study is awarded on a first come first serve basis to students . Prior to beginning work, all work-study students must complete a payroll authorization, I-9 form, W-4 and sign a terms and conditions form and then be approved by the Financial Aid Office . As a work-study employee, students may have access to documents,  files, and records that are protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 . Students are prohibited from sharing information obtained while at work . Failure to adhere to this Act will be cause for termination and loss of eligibility to receive future work-study awards .Employees must report to work on time and work the agreed-upon hours . Employees must inform the supervisor if they cannot report to work or will be late . Work-study employees must avoid excessive absenteeism . Exit Stafford Loan Counseling When a student loan borrower ceases at least half-time enrollment at Arizona College, the student must complete exit loan counseling . At the time of exit loan counseling the student will be provided the federal publication, “EXIT COUNSELING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS .” Also, students will sign the “Borrower’s Rights and Responsibilities” form included in this publication .Treatment of Title IV Aid When a Student WithdrawsArizona College will comply with the federal regulation in the determination of the amount of Title IV program assistance that you earn if you withdraw from school . The Title IV programs that Arizona College participates in and that are covered by federal law are:• Pell Grants• Stafford Loans• PLUS Loans• Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) When you withdraw during your payment period without having completed at least one class the amount of Title IV program assistance that you have earned up to that point is determined by a specific formula . If you received (or your school or parent received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount that you earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds . If you received more assistance than you earned, the excess funds must be returned by the school and/or you .The amount of assistance that you have earned is determined on a pro-rata basis . For example, if you completed 30% of your payment period or period of enrollment, you earn 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive . If you do not begin attendance in all classes in a payment period, the amount of your Pell grant may have to be re-calculated .If you did not receive all of the funds that you earned, you may  be due a post-withdrawal disbursement . If your post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan funds, your school must get your permission before it can disburse them . You may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds so that you don’t incur additional debt . Arizona College may automatically use all or a portion of your post withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition . Arizona College will request your permission to use the post-withdrawal grant disbursement for any other school charges . If you do not give your permission, you will be offered the funds . There are some Title IV funds that you were scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to you once you withdraw because of other eligibility requirements . For example, if you are a first-time, first-year undergraduate student and you have not completed the first 30 days of your program before you withdraw, you will not receive any Direct loan funds that you would have received had you remained enrolled past the 30th day .If you or Arizona College receives (on your behalf) excess Title IV program funds that must be returned, Arizona College must return a portion of the excess equal to the lesser of your institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of your funds, or the entire amount of excess funds . If Arizona College is not required to return all of the excess funds, you must return the remaining amount . Any loan funds that you must return, you (or your parent for a PLUS Loan) repay in accor-dance with the terms of the promissory note . That is, you make scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time .Any amount of unearned grant funds that you must return is called an overpayment . The maximum amount of a grant overpayment that you must repay is half of the grant funds you received or were scheduled to receive . You must make arrangements with your school or the Department of Education to return the unearned grant funds .Arizona College must return Title IV funds to the programs as applicable, in the following order, up to the net amount disbursed from each source:• Unsubsidized Direct Stafford loans  •   PLUS loans• Subsidized Direct Stafford loans  •   Pell Grants• Supplemental Educational Opportunity GrantsThe requirements for Title IV program funds when you withdraw  are separate from the refund policy of Arizona College . Therefore, you may still owe funds to the school to cover unpaid institutional charges . Please see section “Financial Information” for the Arizona College refund policy .4547SCHOLASTIC STANDARDSACADEMIC LOAD Full-time students are those enrolled in a minimum of 12 credit hours per term . Part-time students are those enrolled for less than 12 credit hours per term .ATTENDANCERegular class attendance and punctuality are essential to learning . Additionally, each student is expected to learn the discipline of regular attendance as well as the skills involved in their field of study .Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and to be on time for their classes . Missing subject material affects the student’s retention and ability to perform clinically . In the event of an emergency,  the student should contact the College if they are going to miss class or classes for the day .A student who reports to class after the scheduled start time or returns late from a break or departs prior to the designated class dismissal time is considered tardy .Tardies are rounded to the nearest 15 minute interval . All absences and tardies are recorded, regardless of the reason and become part of the student record at the College . If accumulated tardies and absences reach more than 10% of scheduled hours, the student may be placed on attendance probation .Allied HealthA student who does not attend at least 50% of a scheduled course will automatically earn a grade of “F .” The College may choose to terminate the student, have the student repeat classes, or other action the College deems appropriate .An examination or assignment missed due to an “excused” absence may be made up for full credit . An excused absence is one involving a medical, legal, or death that is supported with third party documen-tation . Documentation of an excused absence must accompany a student on the day of his/her return and must document absences covering the date(s) an examination or assignment was missed . An examination or assignment missed due to an “unexcused” absence may be made up for half credit .NursingNursing policies for attendance are separate from this policy and detailed in the Nursing Student Handbook .Any student who is absent 14 consecutive calendar days will be withdrawn from the program . The College does not allow make-up absences (other than for clock-hour programs, such as Massage Therapy) .GRADING An Incomplete (“I”) is a temporary grade that may be given at the faculty member’s discretion and with academic Administration approval to a student when illness, necessary absence, or other reasons beyond the control of the student prevent completion  of course requirements by the end of the academic term .Course grading is based on the following scale:   Grade Grade Points Credits Attempted Credits EarnedA 90 - 100% 4 .0 Y YB 80 - 89 .9 3 .0 Y YC 70 - 79 .9 2 .0 Y YD 60 - 69 .9 1 .0 Y YF Below 60 0 .0 Y NW 0 .0 Y NTR NA Y YI NA Y N*Bachelor of Science Nursing Program utilizes a grading scale that is available in the Nursing Student HandbookAll repeat, withdrawal and transfer credits that apply towards a student’s program are counted toward the hours attempted for maximum time frame measurement . Grades are available to students the week following course comple-tion . The electronic gradebook is available to students throughout their course in order to ensure access to their academic progress .For repeated courses, the grade most recently earned will be used in the Cumulative GPA calculation .SCHOLASTIC STANDARDSCredit Hour DefinitionArizona College measures its academic courses in terms of credit hours . An academic quarter is 10 weeks, consisting of two 5-week sessions, and a semester is 16 weeks . Conversion from clock hours is as follows:One term credit hour equals:• 10 clock hours of lecture • 20 clock hours of laboratory• 30 clock hours of internshipOne semester credit hour equals: • 15 clock hours of lecture • 30 clock hours of laboratory• 45 clock hours of clinical laboratorySATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESSArizona College, its accrediting agency, and the U .S . Department of Education require students to make Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) towards graduation . Arizona College’s Satisfactory Academic Progress policy is the same for all students regardless if they are receiving Financial Aid and applies to all enrollment statuses for the time in which they are being evaluated (full-time or part-time) .The policy consists of two standards - a qualitative standard in which students must maintain a satisfactory cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and a quantitative standard that requires students meet a minimum pace of completion towards graduation (maximum time frame) .Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is evaluated at the end of each quarter for Allied Health programs, at the end of the payment period for Massage Therapy, or at the end of the semester for the Nursing program . Students may challenge a grade for a period of thirty (30) days; after thirty (30) days the grade becomes final as outlined in the College’s Grievance Policy . For students transferring to a different program, only courses that apply to the new program will be calculated in satisfactory academic progress . Cumulative Grade Point Average Arizona College calculates the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) by dividing total cumulative “quality grade points” earned by “total quality hours” attempted . Academic letter grades carry the following grade points: A = 4 .00 B = 3 .00 C = 2 .00 D = 1 .00 F = 0 .00 .  The number of credits for a class is multiplied by the grade point value of the grade to give the total grade points for each course . The total number of quality grade points is then divided by the total number of quality hours attempted . Example:  3 credit course, grade of A was earned  3 credits x 4 grade point value = 12 12 total quality grade points hours / 3 total quality hours attempted = 4 .0 CGPAMaximum Time Frame Maximum timeframe for a program measured in credit hours is a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program . For a program measured in clock hours, a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program as measured by the cumulative number of clock hours the student is required to complete and expressed in calendar time . Please note that a student in a clock hour program cannot receive aid for hours beyond those in the program; the maximum timeframe applies to the amount of calendar time the student takes to complete those hours .Arizona College calculates the pace at which a student is progressing by dividing the total number of hours the student has successfully completed by the total number he has attempted . A student is ineligible to receive Federal Financial Aid when it becomes mathe-matically impossible for him to complete his program within 150%  of its published program length . For Satisfactory Academic Progress, students must meet the expected rate of progression . All repeat, incomplete, withdrawal, and transfer credits that apply towards a student’s program are counted toward the hours attempted for maximum time frame measurement . This includes periods in which the student did not receive Federal Financial Aid funds . Only transfer credits that count toward the student’s current program are counted as both attempted and completed hours .Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards   Cumulative Credits  Minimum  Min . Cumulative  Attempted Cumulative Credits Completed GPA (CGPA) (Max . Timeframe)01-20 Credits 1 .5 67%21-40 Credits 1 .75 67%41+ Credits 2 .0 67%Financial Aid Warning Arizona College checks Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end  of each term or semester for credit hour programs and at the end  of the payment period for clock hour programs . If a student fails to meet the minimum CGPA and/or the minimum maximum timeframe requirements the student is considered not making SAP, will be placed on Financial Aid Warning, and will be notified in writing . Financial Aid Warning status lasts for one term, semester, or payment period only and the student may continue to receive FSA funds . A student may come in compliance with SAP if, at the end of the warning period, the student is meeting the minimum SAP standards . If the student regains SAP he/she is removed from Financial Aid Warning status . Students who fail to make satisfactory progress after the Financial Aid Warning period lose their Federal Financial Aid & Veteran’s educa-tional benefit eligibility and may be terminated from the College .48SCHOLASTIC STANDARDSAppeals and Financial Aid ProbationStudents who fail to make satisfactory progress after the Financial Aid Warning period lose their Financial Aid and Veteran’s educational benefit eligibility unless they successfully appeal and are placed on Financial Aid Probation . Students who wish to appeal must do so at  the end of their warning period by submitting a letter, along with supporting documentation, to the Campus Director . The appeal should explain the extenuating circumstances that the student believes would have a bearing on the reinstatement, for example; emergencies, illness, accident, or other special circumstances . The appeal must explain why satisfactory progress was not met and what has changed in the situation that will allow satisfactory progress by the next evaluation . Arizona College’s appeal procedure may be obtained at the administra-tive office . Students granted an appeal will be notified in writing and placed on Financial Aid Probation status for one term, semester, or payment period, and Federal Financial Aid is reinstated . If the appeal is denied, the student will not be eligible for Federal Financial Aid funds . Satisfactory Academic Progress and Federal Financial  Aid EligibilityAll students are considered to be making satisfactory academic progress when they begin their program . Students on Financial Aid Warning are also considered to be making satisfactory academic progress and will continue to receive financial aid disbursements . Students are eligible for an additional disbursement of Federal Financial Aid for a term semester, or payment period subsequent to Financial Aid Warning if they successfully appeal and are placed on Financial Aid Probation . Once a student reestablishes satisfactory academic progress, their financial aid eligibility is reinstated . If the student does not reestablish satisfactory academic progress after a term, semester, or payment period on Financial Aid Probation, they will lose Federal Financial Aid eligibility and may be terminated . LEAVE OF ABSENCE PROCESSAllied HealthStudents are encouraged to complete their course work in a timely manner . However, students who have emergency situations may  be granted a leave of absence (LOA) not to exceed 60 calendar days . If the leave is to exceed 60 calendar days, the student must apply  for an extension along with third party documentation to support  this request . All missed work must be made up . Leaves are not automatically granted; they must have the approval of the Director  of Education .A leave of absence must be requested in writing on the required form, and must be accompanied by third party documentation . Students requesting a LOA must be making satisfactory progress  at the time of the request .Students who withdraw in the middle of a session will receive a grade of (w) . Students who fail to return to class during the first week of classes will be dropped from the program . All students making tuition payments to the College remain under that obligation during a LOA . Student must realize that a Leave of Absence could affect their future financial aid eligibility and the availability of class scheduling .NOTE: The above policy is not a Leave of Absence (LOA) policy relating to any Title IV Student Aid Program . A student taking an LOA will have their account adjusted and all student aid will be returned to the appropriate agency . All funds applicable to tuition will be applied to the student’s amount upon the students return . The student must reapply for aid canceled or returned by the College during their Leave of Absence (LOA) . All Stafford loan recipients who take a LOA should meet with the Financial Aid office for an Exit Interview . NursingNursing Leave of Absence policy is detailed in the Nursing Student Handbook .GRIEVANCE PROCEDUREStudents or other parties with complaints or grievances against Arizona College should first seek to resolve their complaint or grievance with the institution . To better serve students and open lines of communication with the administration of Arizona College, the following procedure for registering a complaint/grievance has been developed . If a student has a complaint(s) he would like addressed, the procedure is:1 . Student-Instructor Discussion Many problems can be resolved by an open discussion between the student and the faculty member . If a student has a grievance with a faculty member, the student needs to meet with the faculty member to discuss the concern or issue .2 . Program Director Meeting with Student If the student-instructor discussion does not resolve the issue, the student should contact the appropriate Program Director to seek a solution . If the issue can be resolved at this level, the case is then closed . If the issue cannot be resolved to the student’s satisfaction, the student may file a written grievance using the Grievance Form provided by the Program Director .3 . Submission of Grievance Form The completed Grievance Form should be submitted to the Program Director within 20 business days of the initial student- instructor discussion (#1 above) . The Grievance Form will include the following information:  –  Summary of decision that is being appealed  –  Basis for challenging the decision  –  Identity of faculty or staff member who made the decision  –  Description of prior attempts made to resolve the issue .  –  Specific remedy requested  –  Student signature49SCHOLASTIC STANDARDS4 . Grievance Committee Investigation For Allied Health Once the Program Director receives the completed Grievance Form, he or she will organize a Grievance Committee . The Grievance committee will be made up of two faculty members, the program director, and the Director of Education who will investigate the grievance . If a member of the committee is involved with the student’s grievance, a substitute faculty member or student with no known conflict in the matter will be appointed for the consideration of the grievance . For Nursing Once the Program Director receives the completed Grievance Form, he or she will organize a Grievance Committee made up of two faculty members (one each from the Mesa and Las Vegas campuses), two nursing staff/faculty members, and a nursing student, who will investigate the grievance . If a member of the committee is involved with the student’s grievance, a substitute faculty member or student with no known conflict in the matter will be appointed for the consideration of the grievance . The Grievance Committee’s responsibilities are to interview all involved parties, review the verbal and written documentation, develop recommendations in writing with a supporting rationale, and submit their recommendations to the Program Dean, who will make the final decision . When the student is interviewed,  he or she may not be accompanied by legal counsel or family members . Within 10 business days from the date the grievance was filed, the Program Dean or Director of Education will notify the student in writing of the decision .5 . Appeal The student may appeal the Program Dean/ Director of Education’s decision to the Chief Operating Officer of Nursing (COO)/ Executive Director of Allied Health under certain conditions .

Sexual violence is a form of sexual harassment prohibited by Title IX/SaVE .Three Types of Sexual Harassment1 . Hostile Environment includes any situation in which there is harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive/persistent and patently offensive so that it alters the conditions of education, from both a subjective (the alleged victim’s) and an objective (reasonable person’s) viewpoint . The determination of whether an environment is “hostile” must be based on all of the  circumstances . These circumstances could include:• the frequency of the conduct;• the nature and severity of the conduct;• whether the conduct was physically threatening;• whether the conduct was humiliating;• the effect of the conduct on the alleged victim’s mental or emotional state;• whether the conduct was directed at more than one person;• whether the conduct arose in the context of other discriminatory conduct;• whether the statement is a mere utterance of an epithet which engenders offense in an individual, or offends by mere discour-tesy or rudeness;• whether the speech or conduct deserves the protections under other principles such as academic freedom .Hostile Environment sexual harassment may occur in student to student, faculty/staff to student, student to faculty/staff relation-ships, or third party to student/faculty/staff .2 . Quid pro quo sexual harassment exists when there are:• unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature; and• submission to or rejection of such conduct results in adverse educational action .Quid pro quo harassment may occur in student to student, faculty/staff to student, student to faculty/staff relationships, or third party  to student/faculty/staff .3 . Retaliation• The College will sanction a faculty, student, or staff member who takes adverse action against a person because of the person’s participation in or support of an investigation of discrimination  or sexual misconduct .

Sexual violence includes sexual assault, rape, battery, and sexual coercion; domestic violence; dating violence; and stalking .WITHOUT CONSENTIn Arizona, “without consent” includes any of the following:• The victim is coerced by the immediate use or threatened use  of force against a person or property .• The victim is incapable of consent by reason of mental disorder, mental defect, drugs, alcohol, sleep, or any other similar impairment of cognition and such condition is known or should have reasonably been known to the defendant . • The victim is intentionally deceived as to the nature of the act .• The victim is intentionally deceived to erroneously believe that the person is the victim’s spouse . SEXUAL EXPLOITATIONOccurs when a person takes non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another for his or her own advantage or benefit, or to benefit or advantage anyone other than the one being exploited, and that behavior does not otherwise constitute one of the other sexual misconduct offenses .

Instead, the law designates a list of specific criminal offenses that can be associated with domestic violence . In addition to one of the listed crimes actually occurring, it must be established that a certain relationship existed between victim and defendant, including:• Marriage or former marriage or persons residing or having resided in the same household• A child in common• Pregnant by the other party• Family relationship• Current or previous romantic or sexual relationshipDATING VIOLENCEIn Arizona, statute, regulations, and case law do not define “dating violence .” Since there is no Arizona definition of “dating violence,” the following is the definition from the VAWA: The term “dating violence” means violence committed by a person -– (A) who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and (B) where the existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors:(i) The length of the relationship .(ii) The type of relationship .(iii) The frequency of interaction between the persons involved  in the relationship . 42 U .S .C . § 13925(a)(10)STALKINGIn Arizona, a person commits stalking if the person intentionally or knowingly engages in a course of conduct that is directed toward another person and if that conduct either:• Would cause a reasonable person to fear for the person’s safety or the safety of that person’s immediate family member and that person in fact fears such• Would cause a reasonable person for fear death of that person  or that person’s immediate family member and that person in fact fears suchCONFIDENTIALITY AND CONSENT TO INVESTIGATEWhile reports of this nature may result in the gathering of extremely sensitive information about individuals, such information is considered confidential and every reasonable effort will be made to keep the information confidential ., where possible .

In such cases, reasonable efforts will be made to redact the records in order to protect the privacy of individuals, where possible . Students are encouraged to speak to officials from the College to make formal reports of incidents . Students have the right and can expect to have incidents of sexual misconduct to be taken seriously by the College when formally reported, and to have those incidents investigated and properly resolved through administrative procedures . The College has an obligation to investigate reports of this nature with or without the consent from the victim . The College will attempt to obtain consent from the victim before beginning an investigation . If the victim requests confidentiality or asks that the complaint not be pursued, the College will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with the request for confidentiality or request not to pursue an investigation, where possible . If the victim insists that his/her name or other identifiable information not be disclosed to the alleged perpetrator, the College may be limited in its response or may not be able to honor that request . Although the response may be limited, these types of reports help to keep the Title IX/SaVE Coordinator informed of the general extent and nature of sexual violence on and off campus so the coordinator can track patterns, evaluate the scope  of the problem, and formulate appropriate campus-wide responses .Public safety, the safety of other students, or other reasons may not allow the College to honor a request for confidentiality and may require the College to investigate without the consent of the victim.RESOURCES FOR CRIME VICTIMS AND OTHERSEmergency (police, fire, and rescue)  Always dial 911 for life-threatening emergencies .For specific information regarding each program, you are encouraged to visit each agency’s website or call the agency directly .

As necessary, Arizona College reserves the right to initiate a complaint, to serve as complainant, and to initiate conduct proceedings without a formal complaint by the victim of misconduct .False Reporting . Arizona College will not tolerate intentional false reporting of incidents . Such false reporting may violate state criminal statutes and civil defamation laws .Group Action . When members of groups, individuals acting collusively, or members of an organization act in concert in violation of any policy, they may be held accountable as a group or individu-ally, and a hearing may proceed against the group as jointly accused students or individually, at the discretion of the College .Amnesty Policy . Arizona College encourages the reporting of crimes by victims and/or witnesses . Sometimes, a victim(s) and/or witness(es) may be hesitant to report to College officials because  of the fear that by reporting an incident, he/she may be accused of policy violations, such as underage drinking at the time of the incident . It is in the best interests of this community that as many victims and/or witnesses as possible choose to report to College officials . To encourage reporting, Arizona College pursues a policy  of offering victims and/or witnesses of crimes immunity from policy violations related to the incident, as long as those policy violations are not directly related to the crime itself . For example, if a student reported a rape in which he or she was involved as a perpetrator,  he or she would not be immune from policy violations .No-Contact Order . Students are entitled to seek a no-contact order that imposes reasonable restrictions on student contact during and after campus conduct proceedings .Right to an Immediate Process . Arizona College takes immediate and appropriate action to investigate sexual misconduct complaints .Sexual History . Questioning or presenting of evidence about the complainant’s prior sexual conduct with anyone other than the alleged perpetrator will be prohibited . Evidence of a prior consensual dating or sexual relationship between the parties by itself does not imply consent or preclude a finding of sexual misconduct .Character . All parties to a complaint have a right not to face questions or discussion about their character unless such informa-tion is highly relevant to determining whether the policy has been violated .62STUDENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIESNotice of When Complaint Delivered to Accused .

The parties will be informed by the Campus Director or designee if an appeal is granted .Interim Protections or Remedies In order to protect the victim, at any time during the investigation, the College may recommend interim protections or remedies . These protections include, but are not limited to, separating the parties, placing limitations on contact between the parties, or making alternative working or academic arrangements . Efforts will be made to minimize the burden on the victim . Failure to comply with these interim protections may be considered a separate violation of this Policy .SANCTION PROCESSDETERMINATION OF SANCTIONS WHERE FINDINGS ACCEPTEDSee above, under: INVESTIGATION FINDINGS: ACCEPTANCE AND SANCTION PROCESS WHERE THERE IS ACCEPTANCEDETERMINATION OF SANCTIONS WHERE FINDINGS NOT ACCEPTED; APPEAL PROCESS• Where either party, the accused or the complainant, disagrees with any delivered sanction(s), either has five (5) business days from the date sanctions are communicated, barring documented unforeseen circumstances, to present an appeal of the sanctions, in writing, to the Title IX/SaVE Coordinator .

The Title IX/SaVE Coordinator will forward all case information to the Chief Operating Officer or designee who will make a determination as to whether there is sufficient evidence to support an appeal of sanctions on the basis of: o  the availability of new information, unavailable during the original investigation, that could be outcome determinative regarding sanctions; o  a potential material deviation from written procedures which impacted the fairness of the process in a way that was outcome determinative; o  the evidence presented during the investigation process may have been insufficient to find the individual responsible by a preponderance of the evidence; o  the potential of bias by a panel member(s) which may have deprived the process of impartiality in a way that was outcome determinative; or o  a belief that a sanction(s) is substantially disproportionate  to the severity of the offense .• The sanction appeal will be reviewed by the Chief Operating Officer or designee within five (5) business days of the sanction appeal notice, barring documented unforeseen circumstances,  to determine whether there are sufficient grounds for appeal .WHERE THERE ARE NO GROUNDS FOR APPEAL• If the appeal does not state a ground for appeal or sufficiently meet the grounds for appeal, the appeal will be rejected by the Chief Operating Officer or designee and the decision to reject the appeal communicated to the Title IX/SaVE Coordinator . The Title IX/SaVE Coordinator will inform the Campus Director or designee and, if necessary, Human Resources of the decision .• The Campus Director or designee will simultaneously and in writing inform the complainant and the accused of the rejection of the appeal within seven (7) business days of the determination, barring documented unforeseen circumstances .• The Campus Director or designee will impose all sanctions on the accused student for the violation .
