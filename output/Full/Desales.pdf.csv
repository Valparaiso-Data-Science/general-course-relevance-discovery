Highly talented and moti-vated students who are nominated by their high schools may take one day course during the regular fall and/or spring semester, on a space-available basis. This high school/university articulation program promotes communication and cooperation between basic and higher education while enriching and expanding the curriculum for students capable of completing college courses while still in high school. Complete application information, including conditions and procedures, is sent to local high school guidance counselors each semester. Students are nominated by their high school guidance counselor, principal, or a screening committee designated at their school. Each participating school may nominate at most two students and two alternates per semester. The chairs of the departments offering the requested courses review the applications and recommend acceptance or denial to the associate dean of academic life. A department chair may request a personal interview or telephone conversation with the student applicant. The department chair determines the student’s placement on the basis of the student’s course request, course enrollments, and the student’s background. After reviewing the student’s application and the chair’s recommendation, the associate dean of academic life will notify the student and the nominator as to his decision. DeSales University will endeavor to accommodate qualified applicants, but it cannot guarantee admission to the requested courses. Ordinarily, the student will be limited to one course per semester. The student will not be charged tuition but will be respon-sible for the cost of textbooks, laboratory fees, and other course materials, if applicable, and transportation. Participants will be expected to adhere to the attendance policy of the course and to the University calendar. The course must be taken for a letter grade, not for pass/fail or audit.HIGH SCHOOL DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM The DeSales University Dual Enrollment Program enables high school students, juniors or seniors, to take college courses for credit at a reduced rate. Available courses include both online and on-campus options. An online application, eligibility criteria, course offerings, and updated costs are all available at www.desales.edu/dualenrollment.20CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS A freshman is a regular student who has satisfactorily com-pleted fewer than eight courses that carry a minimum of three credit hours each. A sophomore is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least eight courses (3 or more credit hours each) but fewer than 18 courses and 54 credits. A junior is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least 18 courses (3 or more credit hours each) but fewer than 29 courses and 87 credits. A senior is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least 29 courses (3 or more credit hours each) and at least 87 credits. A regular student is one who is matriculated in a degree program on either a full-time or part-time basis. A full-time student is one who carries 12 or more credit hours in any given semester. A part-time student is one who carries fewer than 12 credit hours in any given semester. A special student is one who, whether full-time or part-time, is provisionally accepted and has previously attended col-lege. A special student in the day program who desires to follow a degree program may be given a maximum of two semesters to earn status as an accepted student. The amount of time granted will be determined by the Admissions Committee at the time of the student’s admission as a special student. A special student who fulfills the stipulations in his/her letter will be notified by the director of admissions that his/her status has been changed to accepted. If the student fails to achieve the minimum require-ments outlined in the Admissions Special Student letter, the stu-dent will not be permitted to continue at the University. Once the student has been admitted as a regular student, the credits earned as a special student may be applied retroactively to the degree program. A provisional student is one who is taking courses full-time at the University but is provisionally accepted, and has had no previous college experience. Provisional students become accepted students after the successful completion of two semes-ters at the University, fulfilling the minimum requirements outlined in the Provisional Student letter. If these provisions are met, the student is notified by the director of admissions that his/her status has been changed to accepted, and the courses already taken will be applied to the degree. If the student fails to achieve the minimum requirements after two semesters, the student will not be permitted to continue at the University. A Continuing Education or ACCESS student has a differ-ent primary role from that of the traditional student. The circum-stances that surround the life of the ACCESS student ordinarily demand involvement in primary life roles other than education and necessarily divide the student’s energies. Usually, ACCESS students are beyond the traditional college age and, therefore, have greater independence and more responsibilities outside of education than the traditional student. ACCESS students typically are homemakers, workers, or retirees, and do not live in the residence halls. They normally restrict their use of college services to the ACCESS Office, registrar’s office, treasurer’s office, classrooms, library, computer center, snack bar, and book-store. Participation in the LVAIC cross-registration program is specified in the section entitled Interinstitutional Cooperation. Once students are accepted into ACCESS, they are ordinar-ily not permitted to take courses at other colleges for transfer purposes except as noted in the policy on Supplemental LVAIC Cross-Registration or unless special circumstances are noted and approved in writing by the assistant dean of lifelong learning. However, courses from other colleges can be transferred into ACCESS at the time of admission providing the courses meet DeSales University criteria. The right to classify students (e.g., as regular day, special, or ACCESS) is reserved to DeSales University. Day students whose status has changed and who desire to be reclassified as Continuing Education or ACCESS students must submit a written request to the dean of undergradu-ate education. This request must usually be documented with a letter from the student’s employer specifying that the student is employed full-time and receives a full benefit package. A reclas-sification is not retroactive but takes effect at the beginning of the next semester or session that follows the letter of reclassification. Those who are classified as Continuing Education or ACCESS students qualify for the ACCESS tuition rate.CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDENT RECORDSAnnual Notification of Rights Under FERPAThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. They are:1.  The right to inspect and review the student’s educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.2. The right to request the amendment of the student’s educa-tion records that the student believes inaccurate or mislead-ing. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment.3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s educational records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure with-out consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate edu-cational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position; a person or company with whom the University has contracted; a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official in performing his or her responsibilities. 4. The right to file a complaint with the US Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of the FERPA:  Family Policy Compliance Office  US Department of Education   600 Independence Avenue, SW   Washington, 4. The TOEFL iBT must have been taken within two years of application to a DeSales program.  Visit the TSE Web site at www.ets.org/toefl for up-to-date information. NONTRADITIONAL APPLICATION Nontraditional students may apply directly to the ACCESS Office.4 ADMISSIONS, FINANCIAL AID, SCHOLARSHIPS33COLLEGE GRADUATES SEEKING TEACHER CERTIFICATION Graduates with a BA or BS who wish to attain Pennsylvania State Teacher Certification should apply directly to the education department.SENIOR CITIZENS Senior citizens (60 years of age or older) may enroll on a space-available basis in up to four non-studio credit courses per term (e.g. spring, fall, summer) at the rate of the current one-credit tuition fee. This may be a combination of courses (up to four) offered during the day or through ACCESS; for example, one course in Session 1, one course in Session 2, and two fall day courses. In addition to the registration fee, special course fees as applicable will be charged. Senior citizens may enroll in courses for enrichment, audit, or credit; and must meet the necessary prerequisites. All applicable academic regulations will be in effect for such students. Proof of age is required at the time of registration.TRANSFER STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATES DeSales University has a tradition of serving transfer stu-dents and helping them to continue their academic program and complete their degree. Transfer students must complete 15 cours-es at DeSales University and 5 of those courses must be related to the major for a DeSales University degree to be transferred. For majors in the Division of Business, at least three of these five courses must be in the specific major and be at the 300-level or higher. In addition, sport management majors may only count one course (3 credits) of 4-9568.3. Ask the high school guidance office to submit an official copy of high school transcripts to the DeSales University admissions office.4. Submit a Transfer Questionnaire from current or most recent college. (This form can be obtained from the DeSales University admissions office or on the website. Students who have an associate degree or an RN do not need to submit this form.) The form must be completed by the student affairs office from the student’s current or most recent college.UNDERGRADUATE TRANSFER POLICY The following regulations govern the transfer of credits into DeSales University. In all cases, transfer courses must be documented by an official transcript. In some cases, additional information, including syllabi, course descriptions, or other sup-porting materials may be required. 1) With the exception of internships, all 3-credit courses taken at institutions accredited by the following regional accrediting bodies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or by the U.S. Department of Education (namely, Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and Western Association of Schools and Colleges) are eli-gible for transfer consideration at DeSales if the courses are meant to be transferable, are completed with a grade of C- or higher, and are consistent with DeSales’ mission, philosophy, and liberal arts tradition.2) The acceptance or denial of transfer credit is not determined exclusively on the basis of the accreditation of the sending institution or the mode of delivery, but, rather, considers course equivalencies, including expected student learning outcomes and comparison with DeSales’ curricula and standards. Courses that are accepted for transfer must be substantially equal in quantity and quality to the DeSales work for which they are offered as a substitute.3) No course in which a grade below C- was earned is accepted for transfer credit, except in the case that the student has completed an A.A. (Associate of Arts) or A.S. (Associate of Science) degree. All credits earned in an associate degree program and meant to be transferable will be transferred to DeSales, provided that the student achieved (a) a minimum cumulative GPA (Grade Point Average) of 2.0 for all courses presented for the DeSales degree and (b) a minimum cumu-lative GPA of 2.0 for courses required in and offered by the major at DSU. If the student has not satisfied both (a) and (b), the student’s courses will be evaluated individually, and only courses in which a C- or higher has been earned will transfer into DeSales. 4) A student must complete at least 15 courses of three or more credits at DeSales to earn a degree from DeSales. A student can transfer a maximum of 25 courses of three or more cred-its into DeSales. A minimum of 40 courses of three or more credits are required to earn a DeSales degree. 5) A student must complete 5 courses in the major at DeSales. (There are several professional programs, e.g., nursing and education, that have additional requirements imposed by their individual accreditation agencies. Please check with the chair or director of those DeSales programs.) 6) All nursing (NU) courses with a required laboratory or clini-cal component must be completed at DeSales. For additional information, refer to the Nursing heading in Section 8 of the Undergraduate Catalog.7) Only credit is transferred. The grades for transfer courses are not calculated in the student’s DeSales GPA. An exception is that grades earned at LVAIC institutions (Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges: Lehigh University and Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, and Muhlenberg Colleges) via the cross registration process are included in the calculation of the student’s DeSales GPA. Once courses have been transferred, they become part of the student’s permanent record and cannot be removed. 8) Courses not using traditional letter grades (A-F) will be considered for transfer only if additional documentation detailing successful completion of the courses is provided.9) Courses taught online or in a hybrid format will be accepted assuming they meet the criteria above.10) DeSales courses are assigned as credit hours. Courses evalu-ated for transfer from colleges and universities with differ-ent systems (e.g., quarter hours, units) are converted into credits. 11) The dean of undergraduate education is responsible for the final determination of the acceptance or denial of transfer credit.12) Depending on status at the time of admittance, students will be exempt from certain parts of the University’s general education core as noted below: Transfer with 8 to 17 courses  If students enter at the sophomore level (i.e., have transferred   8 to 17 courses of 3 or more credits each), they are exempt  from:34a) MOT (Modes of Thinking) Philosophy b) MOT Social Science c) Composition and Rhetoric I (EN103) d) Composition and Rhetoric II (EN104), provided they have transferred at least one three-credit English composition course which included the writing of a research paper. If they have not written an accept-able research paper, they must take Composition and Rhetoric II.e) World Cultures I f) World Cultures II g) "

The University imparts knowledge about and develops talents for personal, familial, and societal living. DeSales University enriches the human community and enhances the dignity of the individual through its educational endeavors. In its work, the University fosters a vital and respect-ful dialogue between Roman Catholic faith and human culture. PHILOSOPHY For DeSales University, Christian humanism means that every aspect of human experience is capable of enlightenment by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This Gospel brings light to each dimension of personal existence (physical, intellectual, social, moral, aesthetic, and religious) and every environment domain (natural world, social institutions, cultural achievements, histori-cal periods, and religious societies). The encounter between the Word of God and the concrete world of the human person makes a fully meaningful existence possible. DeSales University strives to teach the student what it means to be Christian in a Salesian way, what it means to embrace one’s own life, and what it means to bring this Good News to the human family. DeSales University is firmly and publicly committed to the principles of Roman Catholic doctrine and morality. It also fully recognizes that the search for truth requires an atmosphere of intellectual freedom and that love demands an openness to all that is good. DeSales University distinguishes carefully between the free pursuit of truth, which it guarantees every member of the campus community, and its own commitment to the teachings of the Catholic Church.HISTORY OF DE SALES UNIVERSITY On January 28, 1961, His Excellency, the Most Reverend Joseph McShea, was appointed first bishop of the Diocese of Allentown by His Holiness Pope John XXIII. This new diocese was composed of the five northern counties (Berks, Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Schuylkill) of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. At the request of the new bishop, the Oblates of Saint Francis de Sales agreed to assume the responsibility for establishing a Catholic, liberal arts college in the Lehigh Valley. Planning for the new college began in April, 1962; and the charter for Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales, with full power to award the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, was granted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on May 27, 1964. Classes began for freshmen in September of 1965. Allentown College was fully accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools during the 1969-1970 academic year. In September 1970, the College became a coeducational institution. ACCESS, the College’s undergraduate evening program for working adults, was established in the fall of 1977. In 1984, the College began offering graduate programs with the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree. Other graduate programs include: Master of Science in Management of Information Systems (MSIS) in 1988, Master of Education (M.Ed.) in 1989, Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1991, Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS) in 1995, and a Master of Arts in Criminal Justice (MACJ) in 2005. The University recently launched two doctoral programs: the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) in 2012 and the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) in 2014. In 2018 an MFA in Creative Writing and Publishing was introduced. In the spring of 1988, the College opened the Bethlehem Area Campus on Bushkill Park Drive for its ACCESS program, and in the fall of 2001 moved this campus to the Lehigh Valley Industrial Park VI off the Route #33 extension. In the fall of 2001, the College opened a campus in Lansdale, Pa., for its MBA and ACCESS programs. Planning for the transition from college to university status began in 1998 with a regular evaluation visit by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Universities. Formal application to become DeSales University was presented to the secretary of education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the summer of 1999. The secretary appointed an evaluation team which visited the campus in October of 1999. With receipt of their positive report, the full faculty of the institution voted unan-imously to become DeSales University on January 19, 2000. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania gave final approval on March 1, 2000. The Board of Trustees of Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales voted to become DeSales University on April 13, 2000. The formal date for the name and status changes was established as January 1, 2001.THE OBLATES OF ST. FRANCIS DE SALES The Congregation of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales was founded to advance the Gospel through the spirit and teaching of its patron saint. A chief focus of St. Francis de Sales was the gentleness and humanity of Jesus. The gentleman saint took this from his favorite Gospel quote: “Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart” (MT 11:29). Working to “Live Jesus,” DeSales sought for himself and implored others to integrate the very person and personality of the Savior into the character of the disciple. Consequently, “Live Jesus” grew to become a popular maxim for DeSales. One of the foremost Christian humanists of his day, St. Francis de Sales developed a fascinating and engaging perspec-tive of the human person.  He said, “The person is the perfection of the universe, the mind is the perfection of the person, love is the perfection of the mind and charity is the perfection of love.” This unique conjunction, interpenetration, and interaction of intellectual and affective elements sees a person in his or her totality. In the Salesian view, with its attempt to harmonize and integrate the divine and human aspects, anthropology becomes inseparable from theology. Everything truly human comes under the study, care, and concern of the person. That is why Christian humanism engenders a universal openness and awareness. Mother Mary Chappuis, a nun from the Order of the Visitation founded by St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane de Chantal, prevailed upon Father Louis Brisson to form a congre-gation of men committed to living and transmitting this ideal of Salesian humanism. In 1876, a small band of six men, led by Father Brisson, professed their first vows as Oblates of St. Francis de Sales and began to live the religious life in Troyes, France. Despite humble beginnings, the order experienced a rapid growth. Oblate communities now exist in India, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, South America, South Africa, Namibia, Switzerland, and the United States. The first foundation in the United States was Salesianum School, a high school for boys in Wilmington, Del., in 1903. Although the first undertaking of the Oblates in the United States was the Christian education of youth, members devote themselves to many other varied apostolates to serve people’s needs. THE SALESIAN CENTER FOR  FAITH AND CULTURE Begun in 2000, the Salesian Center for Faith and Culture serves DeSales University by promoting the interaction of faith and culture through academic initiatives that focus on the authen-tic integration of social concerns and gospel values in the tradi-tion of Christian Humanism. The activities of the Salesian Center are qualified by their attention to the legacy of St. Francis de Sales and his spiritual heirs. Programs sponsored by the Salesian Center focus on three interrelated areas of concern. Educational initiatives investigate the Salesian spiritual tradition in light of various developments in the modern world. Select students may be admitted to the Faith and Reason Honors Program and/or the Ryan Leadership Institute. Dialogue opportunities concern the impact of Salesian spiri-tuality on various aspects of contemporary life. Students have the opportunity to participate in lectures, discussions, arts presenta-1 GENERAL INFORMATION3tions, and other public events sponsored by the Salesian Center. Select students may win writing awards in the annual “Salesian Spirit” essay contest. Partnership ventures link various sectors of the local com-munity to the work of the University. Students have the opportu-nity to participate in public discussions sponsored by the Forum for Ethics in the Workplace.  Through these and other programs, the Salesian Center for Faith and Culture enables students and others to promote a culture of life, foster the engagement of faith and reason, form themselves as ethical leaders, and make a positive social impact in the community.THE CAMPUS DeSales University is situated on a beautiful 600-acre cam-pus containing 22 buildings constructed since the founding of the University, and a number of other smaller buildings which were renovated for University use.  Dooling Hall, the main academic building, consists of four wings and a central area. Within the wings are housed administra-tive and faculty offices, classrooms, and a computer science cen-ter. The central portion contains the offices for graduate programs and a student lounge. Wills Hall is a combination residence for the Oblate faculty and a chapel.  Conmy Hall, Tocik Hall, Aviat Hall, Welsh Hall, DeChantal Hall, and Donahue Hall are student residences, with facilities to accommodate 800 students. The Brisson and Chappuis com-plexes accommodate an additional 150, some of which have been converted in 2013 as designated singles. 160 students live in University Heights, a townhouse complex constructed in 1984, 1986, and 1991. Recent renovations in 2013 have converted some of these areas into apartments that serve the needs of our growing graduate student population. Within that same year, Finnegan and Harvey, two new apartment style housing build-ings, were completed and are currently housing 114 students. Another apartment style building, Guerin, was added in 2017. This area of housing is known as the University Village and pri-marily serves our upperclassmen population.  Billera Hall is an 85,000-square-foot physical education building, housing facilities for intercollegiate and intramural sports and fitness activities. It is surrounded by eight athletic fields.  The McShea Student Union features the Commons, a large family room for student gatherings, which includes a variety of game tables, several large flat screen televisions, and a fireplace. It is located next to Sandella’s Flatbread Café, an alternative eat-ing venue for students. In addition, the McShea Student Union houses all of the student services offices which include the Health Center, student leadership, campus ministry, student develop-ment, residence life, counseling, international learning, and the service and social justice office.  The Labuda Center for the Performing Arts houses the performing and fine arts department facilities and serves as a campus convocation center. The Albert M. Iacocca Studios house the University’s TV/Film major. Campbell Hall is a classroom building with a state-of-the-art distance learning center. The 37,000-square-foot Priscilla Payne Hurd Science Center houses classrooms, laboratories, and faculty offices for the natural sciences. The University Center now includes the University Campus Store and expanded meeting space in addition to the food court, student dining, and student lounge, which were com-pleted in the initial phase. The Daniel G. Gambet, OSFS, Center for Business and Healthcare is the University’s newest building. Featuring a gross anatomy lab, a standardized patient laboratory, and a simulated trading room with a ticker, the building houses the University’s business and healthcare programs. Library. Trexler Library, dedicated to the memory of local industrialist Harry C. Trexler, is located at the center of the cam-pus. Built in 1988, this 36,000-square-foot facility seats 300 and is designed to accommodate 160,000 volumes. The current collection numbers more than 550,000 items, including 132,000 volumes and 40,000 electronic books, more than 12,000 electronic journals and newspapers, and 400,000 microfiche. The periodical collection includes 550 paper and microform subscriptions. Paper and computer indexes help stu-dents to access the collection. The library staff, in consultation with the faculty, selects reference materials to meet curriculum requirements and gen-eral information needs. In the general collection, book selection is based primarily on the various majors offered at DeSales University. The library collections of the other five independent colleges of the Lehigh Valley, totaling more than one million vol-umes, are also available to DeSales University students through an interlibrary loan system. Students may access more than 35 million titles across Pennsylvania via the E-Z Borrow System for quick interlibrary loan. State-of-the-art computers and audio-visual equipment are available to faculty and students. The library is a member of PALINET (Pennsylvania Library Network) and is directly connected to the national bibliographic center, OCLC. The library’s on-line catalog and electronic resources are available within the library and from the library’s web page—www.desales.edu/library. Extensive information concerning library services is provided at the public service desk and on the library’s web page.DISTANCE EDUCATION AND INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY All students enrolled at DeSales University have a person-alized account in the Blackboard Learn learning management system. Blackboard provides access to resources such as syllabi, grades, and assignments in a digital format. These features and resources are hosted on the DeSales Blackboard site at the discre-tion of individual instructors and therefore may not be available for every traditional day course. New students are encouraged to log in to Blackboard and complete the Distance Education Student Orientation course, in which they are automatically enrolled. This course serves to familiarize students with the Blackboard online learning environ-ment and demonstrates how to best use it during their academic endeavors at DeSales. Students who need additional assistance with navigating or using the Blackboard system should reach out to the University’s Help Desk either through e-mail at help-desk@desales.edu or by phone at 610.282.1100 ext. 4357. For information about our identity verification policy, please go to  www.desales.edu/policies and click on Student Identity Verification in Distance and Correspondence Education.COMPUTERS The use of computing and network resources is encouraged in all courses offered at the University. The curricula emphasize the use of information technology as an integrated and interdisci-plinary problem-solving tool, as a change agent, and as a vehicle for education. The University maintains 10 well equipped computing labo-ratories or classrooms for research and course work. The Academic Computing Center (ACC) located in Dooling Hall, contains approximately 30 PCs in its main area.  The ACC Computing Classroom houses approximately 12 PC systems reserved for demonstrations or class use. Six special-ized Mac TV/Film workstations are housed in this room, for use by that program. Dooling Hall lower level contains the Psychology and Criminal Justice Digital Laboratory containing approximately 26 computers dedicated to program needs. Dooling Hall rooms 223, 225, and 227 are dedicated comput-ing classrooms, each containing approximately 25 workstations. Gambet Center room 221 is a dedicated computing class-room containing 32 workstations. Trexler Technology Center (TTC) main area contains 40 PCs for public computing use and classroom support. Trexler Library PC2 lab contains 16 PCs and 4 Macs, also for both public and classroom use. Two DeSales Bethlehem computing classrooms contain 25 PCs for student use when not reserved for classroom instruction. DeSales Lansdale Campus has one PC classroom equipped with 20 PCs. All computing labs and classrooms have broadcasting software available for group presentations, including instructor control and interaction with each client station. Also, each com-puting area is supported by at least one high volume laser printer. All systems in all computing areas have Microsoft Windows, are 4fully network ready with internet access, and contain a suite of both application and network software for personal use from file and application servers located in the ACC. The University provides all students with campus e-mail addresses through Google mail (Gmail). These accounts are accessible in a variety of ways. The Gmail server is available to process e-mail via the web. The Trexler Library supports an on-line catalog system and databases for research and course sup-port, as well as a variety of educational, business, scientific, and economic databases on CD-ROM through regularly updated sub-scription services. The University also provides the Blackboard Learn learning management system for course work in all disci-plines and programs. The TTC provide a variety of services for the entire University community, including newsletters (available on-line) and seminars. All computing labs are staffed by student end user consultants to provide help when assistance is required by their users. There is no additional charge for using any of the comput-ing resources provided by the University in any public computing area. Although the University does not require the students to bring a personal computer to campus, it is advisable to do so.RESIDENCE HALL NETWORK COMPUTING (RESNET) The Residential Networking (RESNET) initiative is designed to provide students who live in the University’s resi-dence halls a high-speed connection to the Internet from their dormitory room using their own computing systems.  RESNET provides students a pathway to a variety of resources locally (on-campus information servers) and remote services and resources, through the University’s high-speed Internet connection. To access this high-speed connection, a student can do so wirelessly or must obtain and correctly install a Network Interface Card (NIC), sometimes called an Ethernet adapter. Most computers purchased today have wireless capa-bility and NIC already installed. All residence halls are com-pletely wireless. Students who want to connect their systems via RESNET should connect to the DESALES wireless network. Entertainment systems (Smart TVs, game systems, and the like) may be connected to the DeSales Entertainment network via a Help Desk request. Students must electronically sign a RESNET Acceptable Use Policy statement each year to enable their connection and make it functional.DE SALES UNIVERSITY SUMMARY OF THE STUDENT E-MAIL POLICY  DeSales University provides students with a DeSales e-mail address to enable faculty, staff, and administrators to communicate more effectively and efficiently with students. Appropriate use of e-mail is essential to the success of this mode for contacting students. The following points are only part of the complete DeSales University Student E-mail Policy and are intended to inform students about the key components of e-mail usage.  A copy of the full version of the DeSales University Student E-mail Policy is available on the DeSales website http://www.desales.edu/ emailpolicy. Responsibility for checking e-mail regularly. E-mail is an official mechanism of communication within DeSales University. Students are expected to check their e-mail on a frequent and consistent basis (minimally once per week, preferably 3 times per week) to stay current with University-related communications. Students have the responsibility to recognize that certain com-munications may be time-critical. “I didn’t check my e-mail”, an error in forwarding mail, or e-mail returned to the University with “Mailbox Full” or “User Unknown” are not acceptable excuses for missing official University communications via e-mail. Using other e-mail accounts. Students wishing to have e-mail redirected from their official DeSales University address to another e-mail address (e.g., @aol.com, @hotmail.com, or some other e-mail account) may do so, but at their own risk. The cur-rent Gmail system provides a mechanism that allows students to forward their official University e-mail to another e-mail address.  The University will not be responsible for the handling of e-mail by outside vendors. Having e-mail redirected does not absolve a student from the responsibilities associated with official communi-cation sent to his or her DeSales University account.  If a student does not have access to e-mail. Students have the right to request that the University not communicate with them by e-mail, but instead use an alternative form of communi-cation. A student who does not own a computer or have access to the Internet might request an alternative form of communication. To request this, the student must notify the registrar’s office in writing that he or she wishes not to be communicated with by e-mail, and specify the form of communication and the location at which the student will receive that communication. Requesting and using an alternative form of communication does not absolve the student of the responsibility to frequently monitor and respond to University communications. Privacy, security, and confidentiality. The University will make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity and effective operation of its electronic mail systems, but users are advised that those systems should in no way be regarded as a secure medium for the communication of sensitive or confidential information. Because of the nature and technology of electronic communication, the University can assure neither the privacy of an individual’s use of the University’s electronic mail resources nor the confidentiality of particular messages that may be cre-ated, transmitted, received, or stored thereby.  The computer networks and e-mail servers that support members of the DeSales community at all locations are the property of the University. E-mails resident on University servers or hosted servers, whether personal or related to the business of the University, are the property of the University and not the property of the e-mail account holder, be they students, faculty, administra-tive staff, or consultants. Users should exercise extreme caution in using e-mail to communicate confidential or sensitive matters, and should not assume that e-mail is private and confidential. It is especially important that users are careful to send messages only to the intended recipient(s). Particular care should be taken when using the “reply” command during e-mail correspondence. The University reserves the right to filter e-mail to reduce the quantity of spam. The University is not respon-sible for any e-mail that may not be received due to the filter-ing of e-mail. Educational uses of e-mail. Faculty will determine how electronic forms of communication (e.g., e-mail) will be used in their classes. The DeSales University Student E-mail Policy will ensure that all students will be able to comply with e-mail-based course requirements specified by faculty. Faculty can therefore make the assumption that students’ official DeSales University e-mail accounts are being accessed, and faculty can use e-mail for their classes accordingly. Student Personal E-mail Use. University student e-mail may be used for incidental personal purposes provided that, in addition to the foregoing constraints and conditions, such use does not: 1) directly or indirectly interfere with the University operation of computing facilities of e-mail services, or 2) burden the University with noticeable incremental cost.  E-mail records arising from such personal use may, however, be subject to the restrictions set forth above. Prohibited Usage. Prohibited uses of electronic mail include, but are not limited to:•     Personal use of the e-mail system that creates a direct cost for the University;•     Use of the University’s e-mail resources for personal mon-etary gain or for commercial purposes that are not directly related to University business;•     Sending copies of documents in violation of copyright laws; •     Inclusion of the work of others into electronic mail commu-nications in violation of copyright laws; •     Capture and “opening” of electronic mail except as required for authorized employees to diagnose and correct delivery problems; •     Use of electronic mail to harass or intimidate others or to interfere with the ability of others to conduct University business; •     Use of electronic mail systems for any purpose restricted or prohibited by laws or University regulations;•     “Spoofing,” i.e., constructing an electronic mail communica-tion so it appears to be from someone else; 5•     Attempting unauthorized access to electronic mail or attempt-ing to breach any security measures on any electronic mail system, or attempting to intercept any electronic mail trans-missions without proper authorization; •     Any offensive or disruptive messages, including any messag-es which contain sexual implications, racial slurs, gender-specific comments, or any other comment that offensively addresses someone’s age, gender, religious or political beliefs, national origin, or disability;•     Forwarding or sending viruses. Disciplinary Action Students and non-student users who violate this policy in any way will be subject to appropriate dis-ciplinary action based upon the facts and circumstances of each infraction.DE SALES UNIVERSITY ALCOHOL AND DRUG POLICY See the Alcohol and Drug Policy at www.desales.edu/policies.INFORMATION Information about the University may be obtained at www.desales.edu.INTERINSTITUTIONAL COOPERATIONLehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges Regular Cross Registration PolicyA. Cross Registration Policy Full-time undergraduate degree seeking students in good academic standing who are not first semester freshmen and are enrolled at a member institution of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (Cedar Crest College, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Moravian College and Muhlenberg College), may register for up to two undergraduate courses per term or summer session with a limit of 8 cross registered courses during their academic career. The student may cross register at any one of the member institutions provided that the appropriate approv-als have been obtained from the home and host institution, and provided that such course, or courses, does not produce an over-load on the student’s schedule. Cross registration is permitted on a space available basis, as determined by the host institution. Students are eligible to cross register under the terms of this policy only if they pay the full-time comprehensive fee of the home institution. All other students must cross register under the terms of the Supplemental Cross-Registration Policy. Normally, this program is to be used for courses that cannot be scheduled at the home institution; however, special circumstances may cause this requirement to be waived. Cross registration would enable the student to receive both course credit and grade for the course. However, the number of credits assigned to a given course is the responsibility of the home institution.A.1. Cross Registration For January Term, Summer Session, and Special Programs Cross registration for LVAIC students is available for the January term, summer sessions, and special programs, but the student must pay the appropriate fees charged by the host institu-tion rather than the tuition cost of the home institution (which is the normal cross registration procedure). All billing will be handled directly by the host institution and the individual student.A.2 Cross Registration Limitations For Experimental And Independent Coursework Cross registration for LVAIC students is not available for the following types of instruction: independent study, tutorials, internships, practicum field experience, supervision of instructors and student teaching experiences, private music lessons, distance education, and online courses.B. Cross Registration Procedures When a student wishes to enroll for a course offered by one of the participating institutions, the student must review the course offerings available for cross registration and select a course to request. After completing the Request for Cross Registration, the information is sent to the student’s advisor who will approve or deny the request. Advisor approved course requests will be sent to the stu-dent’s home Registrar for any additional approvals. If approved by the home Registrar, the information will be sent to the host Registrar for review. Registration by the host school is dependent upon course availability and registration time lines. Students may not know the result of their request until the beginning of the semester.Students will be informed of the result of their request by the host Registrar. At the end of the term, transcripts or certified grade reports will be forwarded automatically without charge from the Host Registrar to the Home Registrar for any cross registered students.C. Cross Registration Procedures – General Considerations1. Students may review course offerings and college/university catalogs on the web sites of the institutions as well as on the LVAIC web site.2. A limit of two courses per term or summer session may be taken using cross registration. Each institution will establish its own regulations concerning the number of courses a student may take during any degree program, or the use of any course as a substitute for any requirement in a major or minor program.3. Students who register for courses at other LVAIC member institutions must assume responsibility for the costs and means of transportation and accept the inconvenience of different calendars.4. A student who registers for an off-campus course will be subject to the academic policies of the home institution and the requirements of the off-campus course. The Academic Dean of the home institution will handle difficulties arising out of conflicts of policy.5.  Students ineligible for cross registration, or seeking to register for more than two courses per term, or who seek to have a prerequisite waived, must petition to do so at both the home and host institution. No ineligible student may attend class until both home and host institutions have approved the petition. The process for petitioning varies for each institution; details may be obtained at the Registrar’s Office of the appropriate institution.6. Pass/Fail Optional Grading System – Any student regis-tering to take a course for which he/she has cross registered on a pass/fail basis should consult with the Registrar at the home institution for the correct procedures.6ACADEMIC DIVISIONS An academic division is the basic administrative unit con-sisting of a community of teachers and scholars in related fields of specialized knowledge and organized to further its academic programs, to foster the growth and development of its faculty and students, and to cooperate with other academic divisions in accomplishing the University’s mission, philosophy, goals, and outcomes.

Code Section 31.21) states that a “semester hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty.” DeSales University Credit Hour Policy The number of credits is included with each course descrip-tion in the Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog. DeSales University complies with the above standards for the assignment of credit hours as established by the U.S. Department of Education and by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In addition, DeSales University is in compliance with policies set forth by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, using acceptable and consistent methods for assigning credit hours to all courses and programs of study and conforming to commonly accepted practice in higher education.  The number of credits is included with each course descrip-tion in the Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog. Information about the number of credits, meeting dates and times, classroom location, and mode of delivery is published online and made available to students prior to registration.Unit of measurementAll DeSales University undergraduate and graduate courses are assigned credits as a unit of measurement for curricular material regardless of time frame or mode of delivery. A credit is the equivalent of one hour (50 minutes) of face-to-face classroom instruction per week for a semester of approximately 15 weeks. There is an expectation of two hours of outside study by the student for each hour of class-room instruction. Outside Study ActivitiesOutside study activities may include readings, review of notes, written assignments or journals, group projects, prepa-ration for quizzes or exams, vocal or instrumental practice, rehearsal for dramatic productions, quantitative problem solving, literature research, theatrical rehearsal, creation of lesson plans, review of films and/or dramatic productions, preparation for presentations, lab reports, preparation for clinical experiences, or other assigned work as appropriate to the student learning outcomes of the course.   Academic Period and Instructional TimeThe traditional undergraduate academic year consists of a fall and spring semester that are approximately 15 weeks in length with an additional week for final examinations. One credit is awarded for one hour (50 minutes) of classroom instruction per week for the semester of approximately 15 weeks with a minimum of 14 hours of instruction. If a course meets for three 50-minute class periods or two 75-minute class periods per week, it is said to be a three-credit course and has a minimum of 42 hours of classroom instruction.The ACCESS academic schedule consists of 10 sessions throughout the calendar year. The majority of the courses run for eight weeks, but ACCESS also offers a winter minimester that runs for 3 weeks, summer sessions that run for 3 weeks and 6 weeks, and 4-5 credit courses (e.g., Natural Science 9courses) that run for 12-14 weeks. Courses are offered either as hybrid or completely online and meet the same number of hours as equivalent full-semester courses by requiring more frequent meetings, longer meeting times, asynchronous/synchronous online meetings, and/or utilizing instructional equivalencies (described below under online and hybrid courses).       The academic year for the DPT, MEd, and MSPAS pro-grams consists of fall, spring, and summer sessions that are typically 14 to 16 weeks in length. The academic year for the MBA, MCJ, MSIS, MSN, and DNP programs consists of fall, winter, spring, and summer sessions. The fall, winter, and spring sessions are typically 12 weeks in length, and the summer session is 6 weeks in length. Regardless of whether the graduate programs consist of three or four sessions per year, courses meet the same number of hours as equivalent full-semester courses by requiring more frequent meetings, longer meeting times, asynchronous/synchronous online meetings, and/or utilizing instructional equivalencies.     Periodic ReviewAssignment of credit hours for each course is determined by the program/major based on the amount of work required to achieve the course’s student learning outcomes. Undergraduate and graduate students are provided with a course syllabus that conforms with the DeSales’ “Credit Hour Policy.” Faculty are required to submit to Division Heads all course syllabi prior to the start of the semester/session allowing time for review and approval. Final review and approval is made by the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate courses and the dean of graduate education for graduate courses. In addition, existing courses are evaluated for compliance with federal and state regulations during each program’s five-year self-study and assessment.New Course and ApprovalsFor the approval of a new course, the “Petition to Present a New Undergraduate (Graduate) Course” is completed by a faculty member and approved by the chair of the major (if applicable), department chair (if applicable), and divi-sion head, and is reviewed for compliance by the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate courses and by the dean of graduate education for graduate courses. This petition must be accompanied by a syllabus which conforms to the “Instructions for Drafting a Course Syllabus” and to the “Credit Hour Policy.” New courses that request inclusion within the core curriculum must receive additional approval from the General Education Core Curriculum Committee.  Below are the general guidelines for assigning credit hours to a particular method of instruction. Face-to-Face Classroom Instruction Face-to-face courses in the undergraduate and gradu-ate programs utilize lectures, discussions, demonstrations, or other methods of instruction. DeSales University’s traditional academic year consists of a fall and spring semester that are approximately 15 weeks in length with an additional week for final examinations. One credit is awarded for one hour (50 min-utes) of classroom instruction per week for the semester with a minimum of 14 hours of instruction.  The table above displays the minimal amount of student activity per credit for face-to-face classroom instruction.Online and Hybrid Courses Through a combination of in-class contact hours and online activities, online or hybrid courses must provide the “instructional equivalent” of the number of in-class contact hours delivered in a traditional classroom setting. In the case of a fully online class, all of the instructional hours are calculated through “instructional equivalencies.” DeSales’ formal policy (Documentation of Instructional Equivalency Hours for Online and Hybrid Courses) as well as guidance for instructors (Credit Hour Instructional Equivalency Calculation for Online and Hybrid Courses) are posted for the university community on the MyDSU portal under “Policies & Procedures” in the “Distance Education and Instructional Technology” folder. Online and hybrid courses have the same quality, assessment, learning outcomes, requirements, etc. as courses offered face-to-face. Templates are used for consistency of syllabi across multiple versions of the same course and in the organization of content in Blackboard. A thorough review process is in place whereby the appropriate division head or department chair examines the course syllabus for each online or hybrid course to ensure that the content and rigor is equivalent to that of any classes with the same course number that are offered in the traditional face-to-face classroom setting. Additionally, the Distance Education and Instructional Technology Department reviews each course for proper set-up and use of technology in Blackboard. Instructors are contacted to update or enhance course material as needed.Laboratory Components of Courses Laboratories are components of particular face-to-face courses. The laboratory portion of a course is the “hands on” component that supports the didactic (classroom) component of the course. Generally, one credit is awarded for two or three hours of laboratory per week. Online laboratories provide the instructional equivalent of the number of in-class contact hours.    Internships Internships are supervised learning experiences that take place outside the classroom for which academic credit may be granted. Internship applications are reviewed and approved by the coordinator of experiential learning and the student’s faculty supervisor. Students with a GPA of 2.5 or above are eligible to complete a 3-credit internship for academic credit. Internship applications for more than three credits must also be approved by the student’s division head and the dean of undergraduate educa-tion. Internships are graded pass-fail. Credits awarded are based on the following total hours worked during the internship:Credits AwardedMinimum Contact Time per WeekMinimum Instructional Time for 14 WeeksMinimum Out-of-Class Student Work per WeekMinimum Out-Of-Class Student Work for 14 WeeksTotal of Contact and Out-Of-Class Student Work For 14 Weeks11 hour14 hours2 hours28 hours42 hours22 hours28 hours4 hours56 hours84 hours33 hours42 hours6 hours84 hours126 hours44 hours56 hours8 hours112 hours168 hours55 hours70 hours10 hours140 hours210 hoursMinimal Amount Of Student Activity Per Credit For Face-To-Face Classroom Instruction10Number of CreditsNumber of Total Hours Worked  During Internship3135 to 150 hours 6270 to 300 hours 9405 to 450 hours 12540 to 600 hours Student Teaching The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) requires 170 hours of supervised clinical field hours prior to student teach-ing. Education students seeking certification complete a series of supervised, 1-credit clinical field courses that, when combined, meet the 170 hour requirement. PDE requires a 14-week in-school experience for completion of program requirements for student teaching. During the 14-week in-school experience, 12 credits are awarded for a minimum of 64 days of student teaching. Independent Study Independent study courses permit a student to study inde-pendently and periodically with a faculty member. Independent study proposals are reviewed and approved by the faculty supervisor, the department chair (or division head), and the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate students and by the faculty supervisor, program director, and dean of graduate education for graduate students. Credit hours are assigned based on the amount of academic activity associated with the course, the faculty supervision, and the amount of outside study (defined above under outside study activities). Most independent study courses are approved for 3 credit hours. Tutorials  At times a student may wish to take a course which is listed in the undergraduate or graduate catalog but which is not sched-uled to be offered in a given semester. The student may ask a full-time faculty member (usually one who has previously taught the course) if he/she is willing to offer the course tutorially. Tutorials must match the minimum instructional time and minimum out-of-class student work per week assigned for face-to-face class-room instruction. Tutorial proposals are reviewed and approved by the advisor, the department chair (or division head), and the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate students and by the advisor, program director, and dean of graduate education for graduate students.Supervised Clinical Experience For undergraduate nursing (NU) courses, including the required senior-level clinical internship, the credit hour assign-ment for a supervised clinical experience is based on the follow-ing required minimum total clinical hours: Number of CreditsMinimum Number of Total Clinical Hours Required During Nursing Course145 hours total 290 hours total 4180 hours total  For the Physician Assistant, Nursing, and Physical Therapy graduate programs, credit for clinical experience is gener-ally determined by their specific accrediting agencies (see the Graduate Catalog).  Practicum/Studio Courses, Applied Music, and Ensembles   Practicum/studio courses, applied music lessons, and ensembles in the Division of Performing Arts (theatre, dance, tv/film) are assigned credits based on the learning outcomes and student workload expectations within a specified period of academically-engaged time as determined by the program/major.Research in Natural Science Department  During research courses, students conduct research in col-laboration with a faculty member who has expertise in the sub-ject matter. In the Natural Science Department (biology, chemis-try, and biochemistry-molecular biology), one credit is awarded for a minimum time commitment of 3 hours per week for at least 14 weeks.THE CURRICULUM DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: The minimum course load required for graduation is 40; the minimum credit hours, 120. In addition, 3 one-semester, one-credit courses in physical education are required. A course that is listed for fewer than three credit hours may not be counted as one of the 40 courses required for graduation unless the courses are part of an approved series (e.g. "
TR 3611,"/3612/3613,  through  through  through  through  through "
DA 305,"/306) The maximum number of one-credit courses from the per-forming and fine arts that a student may take for credit and be applied toward the 40-course graduation requirement is 12. To graduate, each student must also satisfy the following:1. Achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 for all courses presented for the degree.2. Achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 for courses required in his/her major and offered by the major. In the Business majors, the minimum average 2.00 GPA must also be attained in all concentration courses.Some majors, such as Education, Health Science, Medical Studies, and Nursing, require a higher GPA as a component of their progression policies and/or as a prerequisite to their professional phases. For more information about these requirements, please see the individual program’s section below.3. Ordinarily, complete a minimum of 15 courses at DeSales University. It is the student’s responsibility to see that all of the gradu-ation requirements are fulfilled.THE UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM The undergraduate curriculum consists of three  components: I. General Education Core II. Major III. Electives or MinorI. GENERAL EDUCATION CORE The General Education Core consists of a maximum of 16 courses (plus 3 one-credit physical education courses) and is designed to offer each student a broad appreciation for human life and learning. It is structured around four elements:A.  Basic Requirements: 2 courses (Composition & Rhetoric 1 and 2), offered by the English faculty, that develop foundational skills: thinking, reading, writing, speaking, and research; plus 3 physical education courses: "
PE 100," Foundations, that explores broad concepts of total fitness, and 2 other courses that teach specific sports for life-long activity. Note:  is a graded course.B. Cultural Literacy: 6 courses that develop sequentially an appreciation for human culture, especially our Western heritage, offered by the history, political science, foreign language, art, music, English, and philosophy faculty.C. Modes of Thinking: 5 courses that present the processes that professionals in broad domains of intellectual activity (literature, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and social science) use as they attempt to contribute to human learning. These courses explore issues like: What informa-tion is important? What questions are asked? How are data processed? What conclusions can be reached? What are the values and limitations of the discipline?D. Christian Values and Theology: 3 courses that encour-age students to reflect upon the meaning and value of the Catholic faith, to live in a manner consistent with Catholic teaching and tradition, and, in light of that faith and teach-11ing, to evaluate human action and decision, to make moral choices, and to accept responsibility for them. The Values Seminar is a capstone for the General Education Core.Under the General Education Core each student must complete:A. Basic Requirements: 1. English 103 and English 104 2. Physical Education 100 Foundations (Graded), plus 2 courses from those designated as “Activities Courses.” (Any dance technique or movement-based course, as defined in the course description, may be substituted for an activities course requirement. One 3-credit dance course can satisfy both activities requirements.)(ACCESS students are exempt from the physical education requirement.)B. Cultural Literacy: 1. 2 courses studying a foreign language other than English, numbered consecutively within the same language (e.g.,  Physical Education Activities courseSophomore Humanities I and Humanities IIYear  Introductory Theology MOT Literature MOT Mathematics Physical Education Activities courseJunior Year: Humanities III & Humanities IV Intermediate Theology MOT Natural ScienceSenior Year: Values Seminar Students who take a General Education Core course that ful-fills more than one General Education Core requirement may only use the course to fulfill one General Education Core requirement. For example, if a world cultures course also fulfills a Humanities III requirement, the course may only be used to fulfill one General Education Core requirement—either the world cultures require-ment or the Humanities III requirement, but not both.II. MAJOR The major is designed to offer the student a thorough and systematic study of one subject area and to provide her/him with an integrated grasp of its content, methodology, and bibliogra-phy. The major ordinarily controls a maximum of 16 courses which may be in more than one discipline. Normally, no more than 12 of the 16 courses may be in the major discipline itself. The remaining courses taken as a part of the stipulated maximum of 16 in the major are considered major controlled electives and must be chosen from within or outside the major, at the discretion of the program’s faculty. The graduation requirements for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student’s official acceptance to the major. A student must complete five courses in the major at DeSales University. [There are several professional programs, e.g., nursing, physician assistant studies, and education, that may have additional requirements coming from their individual accreditation agencies. Please check with the chair or director of such programs.] Where personnel permits, departments offer-ing majors provide various course sequences within the major designed to accommodate the student with differing or unde-termined career interests. Each major provides a recommended matrix for the courses in its program of studies. DeSales University offers majors in the disciplines listed above under “Degrees.”III. ELECTIVES OR MINOR In fulfilling the 40-course graduation requirement, a student may select elective courses or complete a minor.Electives Electives are chosen by the student under the guidance of the academic advisor. Normally, electives provide opportunities 12for learning in academic areas of special interest outside the stu-dent’s major or supplement academic areas in which the student’s background is deficient.Minor A student who wishes to complete a minor must choose one from among the subject areas listed below. The minor consists of 6 courses and will be indicated on the student’s permanent record. Students may not take courses required for the minor under the pass-fail option. A G.P.A. of 2.0 or higher is required in the 6 courses required by the minor, at least 3 of which must be completed at DeSales University. The student is responsible for scheduling his/her minor program in such a way that he/she can take the required courses as they are available during the four-year period. After degree conferral, a minor may be added within one year. Students who seek to add a minor after graduation, however, may not be eligible for additional financial aid. The choice of a minor should be made in consultation with the stu-dent’s advisor. Please note that in some cases scheduling conflicts between required major and minor courses may occur, preventing a student from completion of a minor. Tutorials and independent study courses are not considered an acceptable way of resolv-ing such conflicts. For this reason, a student would do well to begin taking appropriate courses as early as possible in his/her collegiate career. Additional information and “Completion of a Minor” forms are available in MyDSU under the Forms and Documents heading as well as in the academic affairs office. Courses used to satisfy area of emphasis in the liberal studies program may not be applied toward a minor.American Studies (Sponsored by the humanities department) Any 2 of the following courses in American literature:  English 250  English 265  English 375 Any 3 of the following courses:  History 207  History 220  History 300  History 313  History 314  History 316  History 324  History 325  History 327And any one of the following courses:  Fine Arts 335  Political Science 255  Political Science 256  Political Science 315  Political Science 330Behavioral Neuroscience (Sponsored by the social sciences department and natural science department)  Psychology 109  Biology 263 or 355  Psychology 230 or 265 Three courses out of the following:  Psychology 230 *  Psychology 265*  Psychology/Biology 375  Psychology 381  Psychology 499**  Biology 152  Biology 267  Biology 374  Biology 461** *If not used to meet the above requirement. **Research must be in the area of behavioral neuroscience.Biology (Sponsored by the natural science department; not available to biochemistry-molecular biology or medical studies majors.

Resources are available to assist the student in meeting costs of higher education from the federal and state governments, DeSales University, and outside resources. It is the student’s responsibil-ity to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) yearly for consideration of the various financial aid programs. DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY  Filing the FAFSA allows the federal government to cal-culate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The Office of Financial Aid will use the EFC to develop a financial aid pack-age, based upon the student’s need and available resources. Need is determined by subtracting the EFC from the Total Cost of Attendance (tuition, fees, room, board, books, personal, commut-ing, and living expenses).  The financial aid package specifies the types and amounts of assistance, including non-federal aid a student will receive to cover his or her education related expenses. Government and University funds are limited and the amount awarded to a student may not meet all financial need. Parents may apply for Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) and students may apply for Alternative Loans to fully fund up to the Total Cost of Attendance. All awards are subject to revisions. Factors affecting a student’s eligibility include changes in residency status or enroll-ment, and adjustments as a result of the verification process. If an adjustment of an award is made, the student will be notified and advised to access their financial aid information through the student portal.FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCEDURESProspective Undergraduate Students • Gather end of the year income information and documen-tation to prepare tax returns. Retain copies of all documentation sent to the IRS (1040, W2’s, required schedules, etc.) • Complete the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.ed.gov as soon as possible after October 1. DeSales University’s Federal School Code is 003986. • It takes approximately 1-2 weeks for the results of the online FAFSA to reach DeSales University. • For maximum consideration for institutional assistance, the FAFSA should be completed before December 1.  NOTE: Students do not have to be accepted by the University to complete the FAFSA. Upon deposit, the Office of Financial Aid will send a packet of information that will include an official award letter.Returning Undergraduate Students Renewal of financial aid is not automatic. Students who have received aid are required to reapply each year. For renewal of aid, the FAFSA should be filed by May 1 for the upcoming academic year. Funding may be limited for those who file after this date. For state grant consideration, students must submit the FAFSA and the appropriate state grant applications by the pub-lished deadlines of their home state agencies. (Pennsylvania resi-dents must file the FAFSA by May 1 for State grant consideration.) After the FAFSA has been processed and the Student Aid Report (SAR) is received, the Office of Financial Aid will provide an official award letter provided verification has been finalized (if applicable).ACCESS Students Students enrolled in ACCESS have financial aid opportuni-ties through the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Loan Programs. ACCESS-by-day students and those enrolled primarily in in-classroom courses may also qualify for a Pennsylvania State Grant. To award federal and state financial aid to ACCESS stu-dents, the ACCESS sessions have been grouped as follows: Fall semester: Fall Day, Session 1 and Session 2  Spring semester: Wintermester, Spring Day, Session 3 and Session 4 Summer semester: May term, Session 5, Summer Minimesters, and Session 6 With the exception of the Federal Pell Grant program, stu-dents must enroll in at least six credits per semester to be eligible for financial aid. Please note that for financial aid purposes, CLEP, Challenge Exams, and/or Portfolio Assessment credits do not count toward the semester enrollment.  ACCESS students who enroll in classes during the tradi-tional day semester will be charged a fee for doing so. ACCESS students applying for financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). To participate in the Federal Direct loan program, students must complete a master promissory note and entrance counsel-ing. These processes are done online from the U.S. Department of Education website at www.studentloans.gov. Students must present payment for courses taken until a financial aid deferment is approved by the Office of Financial Aid and the Treasurer’s Office. Only after students have com-pleted all forms, are enrolled, and their file is complete in the Office of Financial Aid, will they be sent a notice of financial aid eligibility. Financial aid can then be viewed via the MyDSU student portal. Financial aid may not completely cover tuition. Students are responsible for costs accrued after financial aid (grants and/or loans) has been credited to their accounts. ACCESS students receiving any financial aid at DeSales University will be reviewed for satisfactory academic progress toward a degree at the end of each semester. The maximum time frame to obtain a degree using federal aid programs is approximately six years (or 12 full-time semes-ters). Pennsylvania residents may be eligible for a maximum of 8 semesters of state grant funds. ACCESS students are not eligi-ble for university aid due to the reduced costs of the ACCESS program. No federal loans can be awarded retroactively to pay for past due balances. All questions should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid. VERIFICATION PROCESSVerification Policy The U.S. Department of Education selects a portion of all FAFSA filers for a review process called “Verification.” Additionally, during the process of reviewing financial aid information at any time during the academic year, the Office of Financial Aid is required to question any inconsistent informa-tion by selecting the application for verification. If the student is selected by the Department of Education or by the institution, DeSales University will be comparing information from the FAFSA application with requested documentation submitted to the Office of Financial Aid. If a student/family chooses not to provide this information, they are advised that the University will be unable to administer any forms of federal aid and institutional need-based awards. If there are differences between the student application information and financial documents, the Office of Financial Aid may need to process corrections on the FAFSA once the changes have been finalized.Verification Documentation Students selected for this process may be asked to submit one or more of the following: • A verification worksheet • For dependent students: the student’s and the parent(s)’ financial documents (IRS tax transcripts, W-2 forms, etc.) • For independent students: the student’s and the spouse’s (if applicable) financial documents (IRS tax transcripts, W-2 forms, etc.) • An expense/resource worksheet (if applicable)All information must be completed in its entirety, all documents signed as required, and submitted by the specified deadlines.Verification Deadline The deadline for each applicant depends on when financial aid application information is received. Verification and Missing A. FINANCIAL AID36Document request letters are sent to students every week, after financial aid (ISIR) information is received. These letters are sent five times over a ten-week period. The final request notifies the student that s/he will not receive any need-based federal or institutional funding if the requested documents are not received by the date listed in the letter. This date is generally one week from the date the letter is generated.Notification of Award Changes due to Verification The method by which DeSales University notifies appli-cants if the award changes because of the verification process is to send an “Official Award Letter.” Initially, the Office of Financial Aid sends first year students an “Estimated Award Letter.” On that particular award letter, it is stated:An Official Award Letter will be sent to you after you deposit with the Office of Admissions and all required documentation has been received and processed. All need-based awards are subject to change if you are selected for verification and/or discrepancies are found with finalizing your Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Continuing students do not receive an Estimated Award Letter, but Official Award Letters are not prepared until after verification is completed and corrections (if needed) have been processed. If any overpayments were to occur, they would be reported to the Department of Education by way of the Overpayment reporting option on the National Student Loan Database (NSLDS) system.SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS To retain eligibility for federal and institutional financial aid, students must maintain satisfactory progress in their aca-demic program, and they must be in good academic standing. Students are required to complete 40 three-credit courses and are expected to average 5 three-credit courses per semester. Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each term for traditional day and ACCESS students. Students will be ineligible for federal and institutional financial aid when their academic progress fails to meet the following qualitative and quantitative requirements:Qualitative AssessmentAttempted Credits 12-23 24-47 48-62 63+Min. Cumulative GPA 1.5 1.6 1.8 2.0Quantitative Assessment Attempted Credits 12-23 24-47   48-62 63-180*Completion Rate 50% 54% 58% 67% Any additional students who are placed on Academic Probation because of failure to meet the institution’s Academic Standards based on a combination of attempted credits AND attempted courses will also be ineligible.  The completion rate is calculated as the number of passed courses (courses for which a student earned a passing grade) divid-ed by the number of attempted courses (the total of earned courses, and courses for which a student has received a grade of W, F, FA, FO, WP, or WF). Courses dropped during the published 100% refund period and audited courses are not treated as attempted or earned courses. For courses that have been repeated, attempted and earned courses for all occurrences are included. For transferred courses, courses accepted will be included in attempted courses only for the purpose of determining placement in the charts above. Regardless of cumulative GPA and completion rate attained at any time, students will be ineligible for federal and institutional financial aid when their total courses attempted exceed 150% of the credits required for their program (example: 120 x 150% = 180). A degree audit is performed for any student who changes programs or pursues additional degrees. If a student has exceeded the maximum time frame based on total attempted courses, including transfer courses, additional time to attempt the remain-ing courses required for completion may be granted if courses already taken are not applicable to the new programs or if addi-tional courses are needed to earn an additional degree.Financial Aid Warning Students not making satisfactory academic progress for the first time may receive one semester of financial aid on probation. The one time financial aid probation provides one term for a student to get back on track and regain eligibility. Students must attain satisfactory academic standing by the end of the semester for which they receive aid on probation. Financial Aid Probation If a student finds himself or herself on academic probation or not making satisfactory academic progress in a subsequent semester, s/he may appeal to the Financial Aid Committee for one additional semester of financial aid on probation. In order for the financial aid committee to review a student’s appeal the following information is needed:• A written statement from the student explaining why s/he was unable to achieve satisfactory academic stand-ing;• A written plan outlining how he or she will achieve satisfactory academic standing that has been reviewed with an academic advisor;• One written letter of reference from the academic advisor or a SAP waiver request, on the student’s behalf, from the dean of undergraduate studies. Waivers may be granted due to serious illness, severe injury, or the death of a relative. The dean may grant an appeal one time under these circumstances only if it is possible for a student to mathematically meet the qualitative and quantitative program requirements within 150% of the published length of the program. While appeals are generally granted for only one semester, detailed multi-semester academic plans may be developed, on a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the dean of undergraduate education. If granted, academic plans are monitored each semes-ter to ensure that the student meets all requirements. Students must meet all of the conditions of the academic plan in order to continue to receive financial aid.Financial Aid Suspension No appeal will be granted and other financial arrangements (such as an alternative loan and/or payment plan) must be used if a student finds himself or herself on academic probation and not making satisfactory academic progress in any subsequent semester after s/he has received a semester of aid on warning and a semester of aid on appeal or if s/he fails to meet the conditions of an academic plan. Academic Progress for State Aid Before crediting a State Grant to a recipient’s account, the school must verify that, for the last academic year during which the student received state grant aid, the student completed the required minimum total number of credit hours for the terms to which grant aid was applied. APPEAL FOR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES If a family’s financial situation changes after the FAFSA has been filed due to the death of a custodial parent, separation, divorce, disability, or total loss of employment by one or both of the custodial parents, the student should write a letter of appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. The Office of Financial Aid will determine the appropriateness of the appeal and as deemed necessary request additional information throughout the process to have a complete assessment of the situation. Upon final review of the appeal, the family will be notified in writing of the outcome. Approved appeals may receive additional funds on a case-by-case basis.EXPLANATION OF ENROLLMENT STATUSUndergraduate StudentsFull-time  12 or more credits per semesterThree-quarter time 9 -11 credits per semesterHalf-time  6 - 8 credits per semesterLess than half time 5 credits or less Graduate StudentsFull-time  6 or more credits per quarterHalf-time  3 credits per quarterLess than half time less than 3 credits per quarter37GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMSFinancial Aid Recipients:1.

Need-based grants are based on financial need as determined by the FAFSA.  Loans, typically offered at low interest rates, are to be repaid by students and/or parents(s) usually after they complete their program of study or separate from the University. Employment opportunities are offered to students to help them meet their educational costs.SCHOLARSHIPS Scholarship funds available at DeSales University are awarded on the basis of academic achievement and/or financial need. Students are considered for need-based scholarships if they have a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on file by the published deadline. Thanks to help from our generous donors, DeSales University is proud to offer several scholarship opportunities for our students. Merit Scholarships DeSales University recognizes students’ academic achieve-ment in high school by awarding two categories of academic merit scholarships.  The selection process for these scholarships is competitive with awards going to top-ranking applicants based on grade point aver-age, class rank (if available), and SAT or ACT scores (if provided).Presidential Scholarships - $23,000 to full tuition annuallyTrustee Scholarships - $5,000 to $18,000 annually A separate application is not required. Academic scholar-ships are available for up to eight semesters. Scholarship notifi-cation will be sent by January to students who have applied by December 1 of their senior year.Leadership Scholarship DeSales University recognizes students’ leadership achieve-ments in high school by awarding six full tuition scholarships to participants in the Leadership Scholarship essay program. Students are asked to complete a written essay about character and leadership from which finalists are chosen to interview for one of six full tuition scholarships. Because we are a NCAA Division III institution, leadership in athletics cannot be considered in awarding any scholarships or grants.Tuition Incentive Program (TIP) Graduates of the Allentown Diocesan and Oblate High Schools will receive a total of $20,000 over four years ($5,000 per year) in the form of University grant assistance. The awards are in recognition of the financial and spiritual commitment that students and families make to attend private, Catholic high schools and their recognition of the benefits of investing in a private, Catholic higher education.Catholic Schools Grant (CSG) DeSales University will provide University grant assistance in the amount of $12,000 over four years ($3,000 per year) to graduates of Parochial and Private Catholic high schools beyond the Allentown Diocese.Oblate Parish Scholarship (OPS) and Oblate Sponsor Scholarship (OSS) DeSales University will make two scholarships available for members of the Oblates to award to a student of their choos-ing. The Oblate Parish Scholarship can be given to a prospective college student who is a member of a parish administered by the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales. The Oblate Sponsor Scholarship can be given to a prospective college student regardless of his/her parish or high school affiliation. Each Oblate can award one scholarship to one student each year. Each award provides a total of $20,000 over four years ($5,000 per year).Eligibility guidelines to receive TIP, CSC, OPS, and OSS grants are as follows:1. First-time students with a high school graduation date after June 1, 2004, or later who enroll in DeSales University beginning Fall 2004 are eligible. (Note: these grant pro-grams are not retroactive for currently enrolled students receiving a similar grant.)2.

It was established for the benefit of a DeSales University freshman undergraduate student in the Division of Performing Arts who is a Dance major. The amount of the scholarship will be $2,500 each year, with renewal contingent upon meeting the cri-teria identified below. These scholarship gifts will not impact any need-based or academic-based aid that the students would already receive.

The Father Alexander T. Pocetto, OSFS Scholarship is awarded to students based on academic achieve-ment and who exhibit an appreciation for the pursuit of higher education. The Pocetto Scholarship is named in honor of Fr. Alexander T. Pocetto, retired senior vice president of DeSales University and one of the founders of the ACCESS program. The David M. Petzold Scholarship is awarded to a criminal jus-tice major based on academic achievement and a record of service to the community. The David M. Petzold Scholarship was established 39in memory of Officer David M. Petzold, who was killed in the line of duty on November 9, 2006. David was an alumnus of the DeSales University ACCESS criminal justice program.Other Scholarships Other scholarships are available through private donors and organizations. Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for information.Family Tuition Reduction Whenever two or more dependent children from the same family are in attendance during the same semester at the University as full-time undergraduate students, the family tuition reduction policy may apply. The second and succeeding children will be eligible for a tuition reduction up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%). The exact amount will be determined after all other forms of applicable financial aid have been determined and deducted. Please be advised that this program is not available to ACCESS students, graduate students, or traditional students who have used up their 8 semesters of eligibility.Tuition Payment Plans Using University sponsored payment plans, students and their families can make 10 regularly scheduled monthly installment payments during an academic year without interest or carrying charges. A separate enrollment fee is required, and the first one-tenth payment is usually due before May 1. For more information, contact the treasurer’s office at 610.282.1100, ext. 1343.SPECIAL PROGRAMSTeacher Certification Post baccalaureate students attending DeSales University and pursuing a teaching certification from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are eligible to apply for Federal Direct loans pending enrollment in 6 or more credits. Teacher certification is considered to be a fifth year undergraduate program and students who answer no to all the dependency status questions on the FAFSA will be considered dependent students. This means these students will be required to provide their parents’ financial infor-mation on the FAFSA.WITHDRAWAL AND REFUNDS Students withdrawing from the institution must inform the registrar’s office in writing. The official date of withdrawal for the purpose of a refund will be the last date of attendance as determined by the registrar. Students withdrawing from the institution who are residence hall students and/or are on the University meal plan should consult the treasurer’s office.RETURN OF FEDERAL STUDENT AID (TITLE IV) FUNDS POLICY The Department of Education has established a policy deter-mining the amount of Title IV program assistance that you can earn if you withdraw from school. The Title IV programs covered by this law include Federal Pell Grants, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, SEOG Grants, Direct and Perkins Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans.  When you withdraw during your payment period, the amount of Title IV program assistance that you have earned up to that point is determined by a specific formula. If you received (or your school or parent received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount you earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds. If you received more assistance than you earned, the excess funds must be returned by the school and/or you. The amount of assistance that you have earned is determined on a pro rata basis. For example, if you completed 30% of your payment period of enrollment, you earn 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive. Once you have completed more than 60% percent of the payment period, you earn all of the assistance that you were scheduled to receive for that period. If you did not receive all of the funds that you earned, you may be due a post-withdrawal disbursement. If your post-with-drawal disbursement includes loan funds, your school must get your permission before it can disburse them. You may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds so that you don’t incur additional debt. Your school may automatically use all or a por-tion of your post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition, fees, and room and board charges (as contracted with the school). The school needs your permission to use the post-withdrawal grant disbursement for all other school charges. If you do not give your permission (DSU asks for this when you enroll), you will be offered the funds. However, it may be in your best interest to allow the school to keep the funds to reduce your debt at the school. There are some federal financial aid funds that you were scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to you once you withdraw because of other eligibility requirements. For example, if you are a first-time, first-year undergraduate student and you have not completed the first 30 days of your program before you with-draw, you will not receive any Direct loan funds that you would have received had you remained enrolled past the 30th day. If you receive (or your school or parent receives on your behalf) excess Title IV program funds that must be returned, your school must return a portion of the excess equal to the lesser of: • your institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of your funds, or• the entire amount of excess funds. The school must return this amount even if it didn’t keep this amount of your Title IV program funds. If your school is not required to return all of the excess funds, you must return the remaining amount. Any loan funds that you must return, you (or your parent for a PLUS Loan) repay in accor-dance with the terms of the promissory note. That is, you make scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time. Any amount of unearned grant funds that you must return is called an overpayment. The maximum amount of a grant overpay-ment that you must repay is half of the grant funds you received or were scheduled to receive. You do not have to repay a grant over-payment if the original amount of the overpayment is $50 or less. You must make arrangements with your school or the Department of Education to return the unearned grant funds. The requirements for Title IV program funds when you with-draw are separate from any refund policy that your school may have. Therefore, you may still owe funds to the school to cover unpaid institutional charges. Your school may also charge you for any Title IV program funds that the school was required to return.  Withdrawal date for Title IV purposes is defined as the date the student began the institution’s withdrawal process, the student’s last date of recorded attendance, or the midpoint of the semester for a student who leaves without notifying the institution if the last date of attendance cannot be established.Attention ACCESS students: If an ACCESS student has a Pell Grant, the sessions not yet begun will be discounted, and the Pell Grant will be reduced to the lower enrollment status before calculating the aid to be returned. Student loans are contingent upon a student being enrolled at least half time (6 credits) per semester. If you enroll and later drop classes that you have never begun so that your enrollment status falls below 6 credits, you are not eligible for a student loan that semester. If a loan disbursement was made before you dropped below half-time, that disbursement can remain. However, subse-quent disbursements must be cancelled. For financial aid purposes, a student who stops attending (or officially withdraws) at any point in the ACCESS semester is considered to have withdrawn, even if one or more classes have been completed with a passing grade. In other words, a student is considered to have withdrawn if he/she does not complete all days scheduled to complete within the semester. If a student is enrolled simultaneously in two courses within a Session and stops attending only one of those, it is not considered a withdrawal. If a student officially drops classes that he/she has never begun attending before his/her withdrawal from the institution, those classes are not counted in the “days scheduled to complete.” The school must document completion of all courses with a pass-ing grade. If there is no passing grade in the last scheduled course, the school must demonstrate the student completed the period. The following questions and examples may help clarify this:1. Did the student cease to attend before completing or fail to begin attendance in a course scheduled to 40attend? If yes, go to question 2. If no, it is not a with-drawal.2. When ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in an enrolled course, was the student attending other courses? If yes, not a withdrawal. If no, go to question 3.3. Did student confirm in writing attendance in a later Session in the term? If no, student is a withdrawal. If yes, not a withdrawal if attendance is resumed in the later Session and the resumption of attendance is within 45 days of the withdrawal.Example 1:  Student has two 8 week sessions within a semester with two classes each session. The student begins attendance in both courses in the first session but stops attending both after a few weeks. No written confirmation of intent to attend session 2 is received. This student is a withdrawal and a Return of Tittle IV funds calculation must be performed.Example 2: Same scenario as above, but student stops attending only one of the two courses in the first session. The student is not a with-drawal.Example 3: Same scenario as above. During the first session, the student withdraws from both courses in the second session, and he/she completes both courses in the first session with a passing grade. The student has not ceased to attend a course he was scheduled to attend because the course was dropped within the first module and before they began. So the student is not a withdrawal. However, recalculation of a PELL grant is required because he/she was paid for two courses that he/she never attended. Example 4:Same scenario as above. The student begins attendance in both courses in the first session but stops attending both after six weeks. However, he/she provides a written confirmation of intent to attend session 2. The student is not a withdrawal unless he/she fails to begin session 2. If he/she fails to begin session 2, the withdrawal date and days of attendance are determined as if the confirmation of future attendance was never provided.  When a Return of Title IV funds calculation is required, the total calendar days used in the calculation include all days in which the student is scheduled to attend but does not count days of cours-es officially dropped before complete cessation of attendance.  41Financial Aid Programs AvailablePROGRAM  FUNDED BY  COMMENTSFederal Pell Grant Federal Government  Pell amount is determined by need.

To be eligible for general transfer admission to DeSales University, students should have a cumulative grade point aver-age of at least 2.0 (2.5 preferred) on a 4.0 scale. Certain pro-grams, such as education and nursing, require a higher GPA for admissions. The theatre and dance programs require an audition. Transfer students interested in the physician assistant program or doctor of physical therapy (DPT) program must first complete a bachelor’s degree at a regionally accredited institution. During or after their senior year, students can apply to DeSales’ Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS) program or the DPT program. Students must satisfy the prerequisite course work for the physician assistant program or DPT program during their undergraduate program. Students who have registered for 24 or more credits at any post-secondary institution should apply for admission as transfer students. Students who have registered for fewer than 24 credits are considered freshmen with college work and should follow the traditional admissions procedures. To apply for admission, it is necessary to:1. Complete and submit the application form found at desales.edu/apply.2. Ask the registrar’s office at each post-secondary institution attended to forward a copy of the official transcript(s) to the Admissions Office, DeSales University, 2755 Station Avenue, Center Valley, ) are required.

This highly selective and competitive program offers opportunities for challenging, reaching, and learning beyond the traditional curriculum. Through this program, students build strong, last-ing, and meaningful relationships with senior faculty at DeSales University. The four-year honors program includes three major com-ponents: Liberal Studies seminars, cultural experiences, and an Honors Thesis. Liberal Studies seminars are one-credit learning experiences about fundamental questions that pervade human life, including conversations about the human person, God, the world, beauty, truth, and goodness. The seminars meet weekly and are hosted by one or more senior faculty members who select readings chosen from classical and contemporary texts that reflect a variety of academic disciplines. Students who participate in the seminars regularly and actively receive an “A” for the course and one credit for each seminar. Honors students complete six seminars, which fulfill two free elective requirements toward graduation. (Credits earned for these seminars do not fulfill any General Education requirements.) Cultural experiences involve off-campus learning oppor-tunities. Honors students are required to participate in at least one experience each semester of the program. These experiences include trips to museums, lectures, shows, historic sites, and other places of cultural interest. The Honors Thesis is the culmination of the program. Under the direction of a faculty advisor, honors students research and write a 30- to 50-page paper. Students earn three credits for this work as an “independent study” course. Students present their work publicly during the annual Honors Colloquium. The best thesis each year, as judged by the Review Committee of the Salesian Center for Faith & Culture, receives the annual “Faith & Reason Award.” Participation in the honors program is by invitation and application only. Each fall semester, invitations to apply to the program are extended to members of the Freshman class who have received presidential or trustee scholarships. Applications require a letter of intent from the student and a recommendation from a faculty member or the student’s academic advisor. Only 15 students are admitted to the program each year. Honors students who complete all components of the pro-gram have their participation noted on their university transcripts and receive special recognition of their accomplishment at the commencement exercises.TIME-SHORTENED DEGREES There are no rigid time requirements for the DeSales University degree. It is possible for a superior student to shorten the time ordinarily required to complete the undergraduate degree by as much as one year. This can be done by taking advantage of the various credit-by-examination procedures, the overload policy, and by attending college during the summer months.SECOND DEGREES DeSales University will grant a second baccalaureate degree to students who have already received a baccalaureate degree from DeSales University or another accredited institution, and who wish to earn a degree in a different major field of study. To be eligible for admission to this program, the student must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 from the first institution. In addition, the department chair and/or division head of the new major must accept the student into the second degree program (some departments have specific limitations, e.g., busi-ness) and approve the student’s program of study. To graduate from this program, the student must satisfy the requirements of DeSales University’s General Education Core and the requirements of the academic majors, in accordance with the DeSales course-transfer policy. The student must com-plete at least ten three-credit courses toward the second degree at DeSales University; at least five of these courses must be in the major field of study. Graduates of DeSales University must complete a minimum of ten three-credit courses beyond the conferral date of their most recent DeSales degree. The student also must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 both in the major field of study and in all courses taken at DeSales University. (Students who have graduated from DeSales University under the old curriculum will be seen as having completed the General Education Core for the purposes of this policy.)ACCELERATED POST-BACCALAUREATE PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS Accelerated post-baccalaureate professional programs grant professional degrees (and/or certification) in preparation for pro-fessional licensure to individuals already holding undergraduate degrees. DeSales University offers an accelerated post-baccalau-reate BSN program.INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM Juniors and seniors whose cumulative grade point average is 2.0 or better may, if they choose, take one course per year of independent study. Each department regularly lists one 3-credit course, usually numbered 499, for independent study. The student who wishes to matriculate in this course must develop an independent study project, secure a project advisor, who, for day students, must ordinarily be a full-time faculty member, and obtain the approval of the project advisor, the department chair, and/or the division head, and the dean of undergraduate education before registration for the term in which the student intends to complete the project. These approvals must be obtained on an official form available in the academic affairs office or online. Successful completion of the course will consist of fulfilling all requirements and satisfying the standard of evalu-ation previously agreed upon by the student and his or her project director. The course designation and number and the project title will be entered on the student’s transcript when successful completion has been certified by the project advisor.16TUTORIALS At times a student may wish to take a course which is listed in the Undergraduate Catalog but which is not scheduled to be offered in a given semester. The student may ask a full-time faculty member (usually the one who offers the course) if he/she is willing to offer the course tutorially. If the faculty member agrees, the student completes the Application for Tutorial form available in the academic affairs office or online, obtains the appropriate signatures, and submits the form to the registrar at the time of registration. (A tutorial differs from an independent study project because a tutorial is simply a different mode of offering an already existing course, while an independent study project requires the student and the faculty member to design a new project.)ACADEMIC POLICY REGARDING INTERNSHIPS Internships are elective, planned, and supervised learning experiences that take place outside the classroom, preferably at off-campus sites, for which academic credit is granted as an added dimension of the student’s academic major. The program is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors who have completed course work that, in the judgment of the faculty supervisor, is required by the nature of the internship proposal. If a student’s GPA falls below a 2.5, they are seeking more than 3 credits, or they will be put at a course overload, they will need additional signatures as designated on the application form. Students must be in good academic standing and not on academic pro-bation to be approved for a credited internship. If their GPA falls within the 2.0-2.49 range, it is up to the discretion of the department chair/division head and the dean of undergradu-ate education to approve or not approve your internship for academic credit.  The Career Development Center staff and/or the stu-dent’s faculty supervisor can assist the student in identifying possible internship sites. Assignments and duties of the student intern should constitute a new, meaningful, and challenging experience. Menial tasks must not comprise the major part of the internship.  Questions should be referred to the coordinator of experiential learning or the student’s faculty supervisor.  The coordinator of experiential learning administers the pro-gram’s policies and procedures. The Career Development Center staff can provide assistance to the student in preparing a resume and in interviewing with the sponsoring employer. The faculty supervisor ensures that the internship is a worthwhile experience. This is done, in part, by carefully reviewing the student’s learn-ing contract containing the internship’s objectives and methods for evaluating student performance. The employer supervisor at the work site develops a description of the student intern’s job responsibilities and project assignments, provides orientation and job training for the student, supervises the student’s work, and completes a final evaluation of the student’s performance. An offer letter should be provided by the employer. All students must attend a mandatory orientation where they will sign an agreement with the Career Development Center that states their understanding of program require-ments and will receive a packet with the required paper work and due dates. All students must complete an intern-ship application and submit a resume and offer letter/e-mail before they can be registered by the registrars office for an internship. In addition, students must be enrolled in the college’s student accident insurance plan or have similar coverage under a family or personal accident insurance plan. All students must register for internships according to the registration deadlines posted in the Undergraduate Catalog (typically the last day for dropping and adding courses). It is assumed that students are not paid for internships. In cases where salary may be provided to the student, the faculty supervisor and coordinator of experiential learning must concur that the learning objectives and nature of the internship are satis-fied first rather than salary consideration. Internships are ordinarily limited to three credits (one course) per semester, and a student may not register for the same internship in successive semesters. Internship proposals for more than three credits during the regular academic year must include additional complex job responsibilities and must be approved by the student’s department chair and the dean of undergraduate education. Credits awarded are based on the following number of total hours worked during the internship and all internships are graded pass-fail: 3 credits (1 course) - 135 to 150 hours total 6 credits (2 courses) - 270 to 300 hours total 9 credits (3 courses) - 405 to 450 hours total 12 credits (4 courses) - 540 to 600 hours total ACCESS students may complete an internship with their current employer with the approval of the faculty supervisor, department chair/division head, and coordinator of experiential learning. In order for the internship to be approved, the following criteria must be met: 1) The proposed work experience must be different from his/her current day-to-day job2) The student must be supervised by someone other than his/her current immediate supervisor Traditional students taking internships during the fall or spring semester will be charged the appropriate full-time or part-time rate. Traditional students taking internships during the fall or spring that preclude them from taking courses on campus (e.g., due to location or time frame) will still be charged the appropri-ate traditional day rate. Traditional students taking internships in the summer will be charged the ACCESS rate. ACCESS students taking internships during the fall, spring, or summer will be charged the ACCESS rate.  Students must provide their own transportation to internship sites. Exceptions to any of the program’s prerequisites and requirements are referred to the department chair/division head and the dean of undergraduate education for final determination and decision. Requests for exceptions must be made before the time of registration for an internship.

MG 475,".  Accelerated BS/MBA in Accounting: The DeSales accel-erated BS/MBA degree program permits students to earn a BS in Accounting and the MBA graduate degree in four and one-half years and simultaneously to satisfy the education requirements for CPA certification in Pennsylvania and other states. In addition to taking the ten courses required in the business undergraduate core, BS/MBA in Accounting students will take: "
AB 301,", , 302, 322, 451, and  or 322 can be used to fulfill one course of this requirement). Finance majors are encouraged to take additional electives in accounting. Students con-templating graduate school should complete  and "
AB 302,", "
AB 322,",  and "
AB 451,", "
AB 453,", an undergraduate AB elective, and 11 graduate MBA courses. Students in the accelerated BS/MBA program must maintain a 3.0 GPA to remain in the pro-gram. Criminal Justice: A major objective of this program is to prepare professionals who will be capable of making meaningful contributions toward improving the criminal justice system. Financial Planning: The financial planning track of the finance major is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board Registered Program, which prepares students to become certi-fied as a CFP professional. Students in other majors or already holding a bachelor’s degree can complete the certificate in finan-cial planning program, which is also a CFP Board Registered Program. Successful completion of either program allows stu-dents to sit for the CFP Certification Examination. Nursing: The baccalaureate degree in nursing, master’s degree in nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice program, and MSN APRN certificate programs at DeSales University are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http://www.aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation) Physician Assistant: This program prepares students to 17become professional physician assistants who work under the direction of a physician after successful completion of the national boards. Students are capable of obtaining histories and performing physical examinations on a wide variety of patients in multiple medical settings and order and perform routine test-ing on those patients. Students are given didactic and clinical experiences which enable them to work in a variety of health care settings. Physical Therapy: The undergraduate major in Health Science prepares students for early admission to the doctoral pro-gram in physical therapy at DeSales University. Upon completion of the 3-year graduate phase of the program, students will be eligible to sit for the National Physical Therapy Examination in order to earn a license to practice as a physical therapist. Physical therapists are healthcare professionals who diagnose and treat individuals of all ages who have medical or health-related condi-tions that impair their abilities to move and perform daily func-tional activities. Physical therapists perform a variety of exami-nation techniques in order to develop individual plans of care to reduce pain, restore function, improve movement, and prevent disability.  Once in the graduate program, students participate in didactic and clinical experiences that prepare them to work in a wide variety of health care settings including hospitals, outpatient clinics, home health agencies, public schools, sports and fitness facilities, work settings, and long-term care. Pre-Law: For admission to law school, no specific major is required. However, the law and society major has been specifi-cally designed to meet the needs of students who hope to go to law school. In addition, the criminal justice, history, and political science majors have tracks developed to accommodate students who plan to attend law school. Students who select other majors may wish to minor in law and society. All students interested in law should contact the pre-law advisor, Dr. Jennifer Moore, in the Department of Social Sciences at the earliest possible time. History majors intending to go to law school should follow the pre-law track, which has two groups of requirements: 1) the completion of 12 courses in United States, European, and com-parative history; and 2) four more courses in philosophy, politics, criminal justice, and law. Pre-Medicine, Pre-Dentistry, and Pre-Veterinary: Students who wish to prepare for entrance into a school of medicine or dentistry are advised to major in either biology or chemistry. Both programs provide the flexibility to include all the required and recommended courses prescribed by medical, dental, and veterinary schools. Teacher Education: DeSales University offers an under-graduate program of certification for teachers of early childhood and elementary education and secondary education, which is described in detail in the education section of this catalog. The University has received program approval for teacher certifica-tion in biology, chemistry, communication, early childhood and elementary education, citizenship education, English, French, mathematics, social studies, and Spanish. Dual certification and dual-certification five year programs are available in conjunction with graduate studies in instructional technology, online instruc-tion, special education (pre-K–eight and grades 7–12), , and TESOL (teaching English to speakers of other languages).DUAL MAJOR A student who wishes to major in two areas is responsible for designing a program of studies which satisfies the degree requirements for each of these majors. The appropriate depart-ment chair or division head must approve the student’s program of studies, designating one area as the official major, which determines the degree (BA or BS). The degree will be awarded only in the official major. Upon completion of all the graduation requirements of the other major, a notation will be made on the student’s permanent record. DeSales University does not guar-antee that the student can complete the dual major in four years, and its completion may require additional semesters. The student who takes advantage of this option will be assigned a separate academic advisor for each major. After degree conferral, a dual major may be added within one year. Students who seek to add a dual major after graduation, however, may not be eligible for additional financial aid.  If either major is within the Division of Business, at least five courses used to meet the requirements of the second major must be distinct from the courses used to meet the requirements of the official major. A triple major consisting of three Division of Business majors is not permitted.INTERNATIONAL STUDY (STUDY ABROAD) DeSales University encourages qualified students to study abroad. Currently, the University offers the opportunity to study in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Switzerland, and Monaco. Detailed information about these and other programs are available from the Office of International Learning. Study abroad must be planned well in advance and receive the approval of the appropriate division head and the student’s academic advi-sor, the director of financial aid, and the director of international learning.  Certain regulations governing the status of foreign institu-tions, the acceptance of creditable courses, the relevance to a stu-dent’s objectives and major field of study, the student’s academic record, foreign language competence at least at the intermediate level, and other factors must be thoroughly explored before per-mission for the year, semester, or summer session is given. Study abroad opportunities during the academic year are usually open to students who have at least sophomore or junior year status, and ordinarily a 2.75 cumulative GPA overall. Students interested in study abroad must plan early, review their plans with their academic advisor and the director of international learning, and observe the deadlines published by the Office of International Learning. Information about financial aid procedures is available from the director of financial aid and through the Office of International Learning. Please note that DeSales University merit-based scholarships/grants that are non-need related are not applicable to the cost of study abroad for programs not offered by DeSales University, but need-based aid is applicable. Students who study abroad for a semester but enroll in a course at the University will be assessed a tuition charge at the part-time tradi-tional undergraduate rate per credit hour.DE SALES SEMESTER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM IN ROME During the fall semester of their junior or senior years, full-time DeSales University students are encouraged to study abroad in DeSales University’s program in Rome, Italy. Detailed information about this program is available from the program coordinator, Professor Elizabeth Rosa.CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The programs listed below are offered as certificate pro-grams. These are available to students who desire a systematic knowledge in one or several areas related to their current interests and plans. For complete details about the objectives and require-ments of these certificate programs, students should contact the ACCESS office. Business Administration Financial Management Financial Planning (CFP®) Human Resource Management Information Technology Management/Leadership Marketing Marriage and Family Philosophy Public Accounting TheologyEXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES DeSales University does not consider extracurricular activi-ties as a body of exercises totally distinct from the academic program, but views them rather as an integral part of the liberal education which it offers. It sees and encourages participation in extracurricular activities as an opportunity for exercise in the skills and attitudes which it endeavors to impart to the student 18through its academic program. Viewed in this context, extracur-ricular activities form an integrated and significant element in the academic program of DeSales University. Student publications and debating provide opportunities for exercise in the skill of intelligent self-expression; intramural athletics furnish occa-sions for the exercise of skills learned in the physical training program; social events advance the development of the student’s social personality; attendance at lectures supplements the general cultural training received; and religious activities provide the opportunity for the concrete expression of that total religious commitment which the theology program of DeSales University seeks to inspire.ACADEMIC RESOURCESStudent Advisement Program Individual attention is one of the major benefits offered by DeSales University to its students. DeSales University’s Student Advisement Program constitutes a major part of this benefit. The program’s purpose, simply stated, is to help each student as an individual in every way possible to derive maximum benefit from the educational experience here. This means the advisor counsels the student in effective methods of learning and seeks to remove any known obstacle (academic, disciplinary, psychological, per-sonal) to the learning process by appropriate referrals. Each advisee is assigned an advisor in his/her department. Students who have not declared a major are assigned to an advi-sor who works specifically with students in the exploratory stud-ies program. Exploratory studies students remain with the same advisor until they declare a major. Efforts are made to provide continuity, vis., to keep the same group of advisees with the same advisor over their sophomore, junior, and senior years.  One of the advisor’s major responsibilities is academic programming. While the ultimate responsibility for fulfilling all course requirements belongs to the student, students should always consult their advisors for guidance in academic matters. At a minimum, advisees must meet with their advisor once per semester to discuss course registration for the following semes-ter and to receive registration clearance. However, students are encouraged to schedule additional appointments with their advi-sors as needed. The student advisement program is under the supervision of the director of the academic resource center.Academic Resource Center The Academic Resource Center (ARC) offers a wide variety of services to assist undergraduate students (traditional, ACCESS, and accelerated BSN) in achieving their academic goals.  These services include peer or professional tutoring in specific subjects, and assistance with essays and research papers via the Writing Center.  Assistance with general academic skills such as study techniques, reading comprehension, and time man-agement is also available for traditional day students. The ARC also sponsors workshops for all students on methods of studying more effectively.Special Services-Gateway To Success Gateway To Success (GTS) is a program designed to help underprepared students adjust to the academic rigors of univer-sity life. It provides support in areas such as academic advising, curriculum planning, goal setting, tutoring, and student develop-ment. First-year students complete a summer program during which they are oriented to the campus and prepared for the University’s academic requirements. These students participate in social events, academic workshops, and career programs. Staff members also help students to emerge as campus leaders and to graduate with marketable skills. Candidates for this program are identified during the admissions process.DISABILITY SERVICES DeSales University is committed to full compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and all subsequent amendments, and supports the inclusion and equal access of students with disabili-ties. Policies and procedures have been developed to provide students with as much independence as possible and to promote self-advocacy. The Disability Services Office (DSO) offers strategies and individualized sessions in effectively transitioning into the higher education environment; including executive func-tioning skills, time management, organization, study skills, note taking skills, and appropriate coping strategies. The DSO works closely with students who self-identify in order to ensure equal access to University programs, services, and activities. Students are encouraged to submit documentation in a timely manner in order to give the DSO sufficient time for review, particularly because accommodations are not retroactive. Students will then participate in an interactive dialogue with a DSO staff member for the purpose of determining any appropri-ate and reasonable accommodations. The university does not pro-vide, nor is financially responsible for personal care attendants. DeSales, like all post-secondary schools, expects that students who plan to attend the University will have already acquired compensatory strategies and will be willing to be self-advocates with faculty and staff. Students with disabilities, similar to their peers without disabilities, must be qualified based on all academic and non-academic criteria for admission to the University, continued enrollment, and graduation from the University. All questions, documentation, and requests concerning academic, residential, or dining accommodations should be addressed with the Disability Services Office. For more informa-tion, please contact the DSO or visit www.desales.edu/disability.Internal Grievance Procedure DeSales University has an internal grievance procedure pro-viding for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and their implementing regulations. Section 504 states that “no otherwise qualified individual in the United States, shall, solely by reason of his/her handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” (PL 93-112, 2973) Complaints should be addressed to the Section 504 compli-ance officer who has been designated to coordinate ADA compli-ance efforts:  Mr. Peter M. Rautzhan  Associate Vice President of Administration and Planning  Section 504 Compliance Officer  DeSales University  2755 Station Avenue  Center Valley, , plus one other course in accounting.

ACADEMIC REGULATIONS21Class Recording Policy By registering for or attending DeSales University courses, individuals consent to the recording of classes within the scope of the DeSales University Class Recording Policy, available at www.desales.edu/policies.RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND FREEDOMS OF STUDENTS Copies of the Student Handbook are on file in the student affairs office and online.GRADING SYSTEMThe following system of grades is used:A = 4.0 quality pointsA- = 3.7B+ = 3.3B = 3.0B- = 2.7C+ = 2.3C = 2.0C- = 1.7D+ = 1.3D = 1.0F = 0.0 A/A- Indicates mastery of the course content accompanied by evidence of exceptional achievement in critical, independent, and creative thought competently expressed. B+/B/B- Indicates a good grasp of course content accompa-nied by evidence of a marked achievement in critical, indepen-dent, and creative thought competently expressed. C+/C/C- Indicates an adequate grasp of course content accompanied by evidence of an average achievement in critical, independent, and creative thought and the capacity to express it. D+/D Indicates a limited grasp of course content and evidence of minimal achievement in critical, independent, and creative thought. F indicates an insufficient grasp of course content with evidence of an unacceptably low achievement in critical, inde-pendent, and creative thought. FA Failure because of excessive absence. (See Attendance Policy below.) I Incomplete: The mark of an Incomplete is given only in instances where the student is near the end of the semester/ses-sion and through no fault of his or her own is unable to complete course requirements. Traditional Day Program: The maximum time limit for the make-up of an Incomplete is four months from the last day of the semester in which the Incomplete was given; otherwise, unless an extension of this limit is granted in writing by the Dean of Undergraduate Education, the grade becomes an “F.” The last day of the semester is specified in the academic semester calendar.  ACCESS Program: The maximum time for the make-up of an Incomplete is eight weeks from the end of the previ-ous session/semester in which the Incomplete was given; otherwise, unless an extension of this limit is granted in writing by the assistant dean of lifelong learning, the grade becomes an “F.” The last day of the semester is specified in the ACCESS calendar. Incompletes as Pre-Requisites. An unresolved incomplete course that carries over into the subsequent academic term may prevent a student from beginning another course(s) for which the incomplete is a pre-requisite. AU Audit (no credit) PO Pass on Pass-Fail option. (See The Pass-Fail Option below) FO Failure on Pass-Fail option P Satisfactory W Official withdrawal WP Official withdrawal, passing at time of withdrawal WF Official withdrawal, failing at time of withdrawalGRADE CHANGE Traditional Day Program: The maximum time limit to change a grade (other than an Incomplete) is six months from the last day of the semester in which the grade was given. The last day of the semester is specified in the academic semester calendar. ACCESS Program: The maximum time limit to change a grade (other than an Incomplete) is six months from the end date of the previous session/semester in which the grade was given. Specific dates are listed in the ACCESS calendar.THE PASS-FAIL OPTION Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take courses under the pass-fail option under the following conditions:1. This option may be used for only one course per semester taken as a free elective, or for an internship. ACCESS sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take free elective courses under the pass-fail option. For ACCESS students, this option may be used for only one course per semester2. The pass-fail option requires the approval of the student’s academic advisor and of the course instructor (except for internships, as stated below).3. Neither mark, PO (pass) or FO (fail), is computed in the student’s grade point average. The mark of PO indicates that the student receives full credit for the course toward gradu-ation; the mark of FO indicates that he or she has failed the course and must repeat it, or an equivalent, under the usual procedures.4. Students may not take any courses required for a minor under the pass-fail option. A student may switch from pass-fail to letter grade (or from letter grade to pass-fail) within one month of the first day of a given term with the permission of the instructor, the academic advisor, and the dean of undergraduate education. For courses in ACCESS sessions, deadlines for changing from credit to pass-fail (or pass-fail to credit) are indicated on the ACCESS calendar. Students taking these courses must adhere to the deadlines.AUDITING An auditor is permitted to attend lectures and, with the per-mission of the instructor, to take part in class discussions. The auditing student does not, however, take examinations, receive grades, or earn credits. For full-time students, there is no additional tuition for auditing a course. For part-time students, the tuition is approximately one-half that charged per credit hour (applicable course fee will be charged at approximately half the normal fee). A course audited may not be used for credit or repeated for credit unless approved in writing by the associate dean of academic life. The approval of the instructor in the course to be audited and of the student’s academic advisor must be secured for a student to audit any course. The instructor may request of the associate dean of academic life that an auditor be officially withdrawn from the course whenever it is clear that the student is not profiting from the course or that the auditor’s presence in the class is interfering materially with the learning process of the other students. A student may switch from audit to credit (or from credit to audit) within one month of the first class day of a given term with the permission of the instructor and the academic advisor. For courses in ACCESS sessions, deadlines for changing from credit to audit (or audit to credit) are indicated on the ACCESS calendar. Students taking these courses must adhere to the deadlines.ATTENDANCE POLICY Students are expected to attend classes regularly. If absences do occur (for whatever reason), it is the student’s responsibility to make up whatever work has been missed. Instructors are under no obligation to make special arrangements for students who are absent. Freshmen are limited to twice as many absences as credits are given for a particular course. An absence on class days preced-ing and following a holiday is counted as a double absence. In cases where classes meet twice per week for 75 minutes each, the first absence shall be counted as a single absence, the second as a double absence. If the class meets once per week for a three-hour period, a single absence is counted as three absences. ACCESS students should also refer to the attendance policy in Section 6 below.22 Upperclassmen who are on academic probation automati-cally become subject to the attendance regulation for freshmen. Freshmen and upperclassmen on academic probation who are absent more than twice the number of credit hours in any subject in one semester may be barred from examinations and may for-feit credit in that subject at the discretion of the instructor. Regular class attendance for sophomores, juniors, and seniors is encouraged, but not compulsory except as noted below. They are, of course, responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the courses they take. DeSales University presumes that upper-classmen will be mature and responsible enough to understand that voluntary regular attendance at classes is necessary if course requirements are to be fulfilled adequately. Permission to make up missed examinations or laboratory exercises may be given at the discretion of the instructor. Students who miss an announced quiz or examination may be given an “F” for that quiz or examination at the discretion of the instructor. Faculty may stipulate, with the approval of their division head, their own absence policy for courses subscribed by upperclassmen. Faculty who set forth such a policy must publish it in writing to all the students whom it affects at the beginning of the course to which it applies. No such policy, however, may be more restric-tive than that which is applicable to freshmen. An instructor may ask a student to justify excessive absences. Permission to make up laboratory assignments, studios, quizzes, announced tests, or examinations may be granted at the discretion of the instructor.GRADE REPORTS Instructors submit a progress report for each student to the registrar’s office in the middle of each semester. Final reports are submitted at the end of a semester, and these final grades become part of a student’s permanent record. Midterm grades are issued only to traditional students and are not part of the student’s permanent record. Final grade reports are issued to all traditional day students and ACCESS students on the dates indicated on the official Academic Semester Calendar. Final grades become part of a student’s permanent record. Grade reports are posted on student WebAdvisor accounts and are not mailed. However, if a student wants a hard copy grade report mailed to his/her permanent address, the student must click the “Mail Grade Report Request” link under “Academic Profile” WebAdvisor by the drop/add deadline each semester.GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA) The student is required to maintain a specific grade point average to be in acceptable academic standing, to maintain finan-cial aid eligibility, and to graduate. The grade point average is calculated in the following way: The quality points per course are determined by multiplying the number of credit hours (1, 2, 3, etc.) by the number of qual-ity points assigned to the grade received (e.g., A = 4.0 quality points). The sum of the quality points received for all courses is then divided by the number of credit hours attempted. Quality points per course = credit hours multiplied by qual-ity points. Grade Point Average = sum of the quality points of all courses divided by the number of credit hours attempted. Only courses for which a letter grade is given are computed into the grade point average. Only the higher grade is counted for a repeated course. Courses accepted in transfer are awarded credits not grades or quality points.DEAN’S LIST The Dean’s List is published each semester. To be eligible for this list, a day or ACCESS-by-day student must have taken no fewer than 12 credit hours (excluding pass/fail and audited cours-es) and attained a grade point average of 3.25 or better during the semester in question. A student with a grade of Incomplete for a given semester is not eligible for the Dean’s List for that semester until the Incomplete has been removed. Special students are not eligible for Dean’s List. ACCESS evening students are recognized on an ACCESS Dean’s List when they have earned 9 credit hours (excluding pass/fail and audited courses) and attained a grade point average of 3.25 in fall, spring, and summer semesters.COMMENCEMENT Students must apply for graduation via WebAdvisor by the deadline date indicated on the official Academic Semester Calendar. All transfer work must appear on an official transcript and be received in the Registrar’s Office by the deadline for final grades as indicated on the official Academic Semester Calendar.  All students must pay the graduation processing fee and successfully complete all degree requirements to be eligible for graduation. There are three opportunities to graduate each year: January, May, and September. Commencement ceremonies are held only during May. Students who lack a maximum of two (2) three-credit or more courses to fulfill their degree requirements may attend bac-calaureate, march at commencement, and receive a handshake (but not a diploma) from the President during commencement. The student must apply for this privilege no later than the Tuesday before commencement. The University will not initiate the contact. The Registrar will verify the graduation requirements that have not been met. The request must be approved by the Division Head. A graduation fee must be paid upon completing the application for graduation. A student may choose to partici-pate in an additional commencement ceremony. No student may march more than twice for an undergraduate degree.COMMENCEMENT HONORS DeSales University awards commencement honors for out-standing academic achievement as follows: Cum laude: for a cumulative GPA of 3.25 to 3.49. Magna cum laude: for a cumulative GPA of 3.50 to 3.74. Summa cum laude: for a cumulative GPA of 3.75 to 4.0.HONORARY SOCIETIES In 1971, DeSales University was given approval to establish a chapter (Delta Delta) of Delta Epsilon Sigma, a national scho-lastic honor society for students, faculty, and alumni of Catholic colleges and universities. Other honorary societies at DeSales University include Alpha Sigma Lambda (continuing education), Chi Tau Epsilon (dance), Delta Mu Delta (business), Kappa Delta Pi (education), Kappa Mu Epsilon (mathematics), Phi Alpha Theta (history), Pi Sigma Alpha (political science), Psi Chi (psychology), Sigma Theta Tau (Mu Omicron Chapter) (nursing), Sigma Tau Delta (English), and Theta Alpha Kappa (theology).ACCEPTABLE ACADEMIC STANDING Students are said to be in acceptable academic standing if they earn the minimum applicable cumulative grade point aver-age listed below: For 4 or more courses and 12 credit hours attempted, the minimum is 1.50 Students with fewer than 8 courses and fewer than 24 credit hours whose GPA is under 1.5 will receive an aca-demic warning. Students with a GPA below 1.0 will be placed on academic probation (see Academic Probation for Traditional Day Students below). For 8 or more courses and 24 credit hours attempted, the minimum is 1.60. For 16 or more courses and 48 credit hours attempted, the minimum is 1.80. For 21 or more courses and 63 credit hours attempted, the minimum is 2.00. In the case of transfer students, the number of courses and credit hours transferred will be added to the number of courses and credit hours attempted at DeSales University to determine the applicable minimum cumulative grade point average. All students are expected to achieve acceptable academic standing. Students who fail to achieve acceptable academ-ic standing have their grade reports and transcripts stamped “Academic Probation” at the end of the fall and/or spring semesters. ACCESS students who fail to achieve acceptable academic standing have their grade reports and transcripts stamped “Academic Probation” at the end of the fall or spring semester. Students who fail to achieve acceptable standing for 23two consecutive semesters are subject to review by the Academic Regulations Committee.ACADEMIC PROBATION FOR TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS Academic probation constitutes a formal warning to stu-dents that they are no longer in acceptable academic standing because their academic work has fallen below the standards set forth above or because they have received a grade point average below 1.00 in their last semester (fall or spring). Students who have either fallen below the standards set forth above for two consecutive semesters or have received a grade point average below 1.00 for one semester are liable for dismissal from the University. These students must appear before the Academic Regulations Committee, convince the committee that they would benefit from another semester at the University, and be approved for return by the dean of undergraduate education to continue their studies. Students who have either fallen below the stan-dards set forth above for one semester or have been permitted to return to the University as a result of an appeal to the Academic Regulations Committee are given one additional probationary semester to achieve acceptable academic standing. If they fail to accomplish this, they are liable for dismissal. During this addi-tional semester they are on academic probation. Probationary status for a completed fall or spring semester cannot be revoked or changed by subsequently using summer or winter coursework to alter a student’s GPA. Students on academic probation are subject to the following regulations:1. Students on academic probation are not eligible to partici-pate on a DeSales University intercollegiate sports team.2. Students will be strongly encouraged to reduce their course load to four courses during any probationary period.3. Students on academic probation are strongly encouraged to consult with their academic advisor on a monthly basis during any period of probation. Failure to consult with the advisor will be a major criterion for determining grounds for dismissal. Advisors will review students’ academic progress and at the same time provide assistance in academic or related matters to help students return to acceptable aca-demic standing.4. Probationary students will be restored to good academic standing if, at the end of the probationary semester or next summer session, they meet the standards indicated above. Such students may also take Summer Session courses at DeSales University and be restored to acceptable academic standing before the probationary semester begins if they meet the same standards.5. If at the end of one probationary semester students have not achieved acceptable academic standing, but, in the opinion of the Academic Regulation Committee, they have a reason-able chance of attaining acceptable academic standing, one additional probationary semester will be allowed.6. Students who have received a warning of academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be liable to dismissal.7. Upperclassmen who are on academic probation are subject to the same class attendance policy as freshmen.ACADEMIC PROBATION FOR ACCESS STUDENTS All ACCESS students are expected to achieve acceptable academic standing as defined above. ACCESS students who fail to achieve acceptable academic standing have their grade reports and transcripts stamped “Academic Probation” at the end of the fall and/or spring semesters. Students who have received a warn-ing of academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be liable to dismissal.OVERLOAD An overload of one course (of three or more credits) per semester may be permitted a superior student subject to the approval of his or her academic advisor. (For the purposes of this policy, three 1-credit courses taken during a semester will be considered an overload unless one of these is a P.E. course.) A “superior student” in this context is ordinarily defined as one who has achieved a grade point average of 3.0 or better in the work of the semester preceding that in which the student seeks the over-load. A student who achieves a cumulative GPA of 3.25 may be permitted an overload of two courses per semester subject to the approval of the advisor.COURSE WITHDRAWAL POLICY A student may drop any course during the first week of each semester. In the event of such a drop, the course is not listed on his or her permanent record. Subsequent withdrawal (withdrawal with permission) requires the approval of the registrar’s office for traditional day students, or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students. The last day for withdrawal with permission is the date published in the Academic Semester Calendar, which appears at the end of the Undergraduate Catalog. The last date for dropping or adding courses is also published in the Academic Semester Calendar. If a student withdraws with permission, he/she will be given a grade of either W, WP or WF, at the instructor’s discretion. The grade given in such instances will become part of the student’s permanent record but will not be used in the computation of his or her grade point average. Withdrawal after the course withdrawal deadline results in a failure (F). By withdrawing from a course, a student may put himself/herself in jeopardy of losing financial aid or of not graduating on time. If withdrawing will result in a total course load of fewer than 12 credits or if the student has withdrawn from courses in the past, then it is strongly recommended that the student speak with a staff member in the financial aid office before submitting a withdrawal form. The student may also want to speak with his/her advisor about summer courses or overloading to graduate on time. A stu-dent is not officially withdrawn from a course until the student has submitted the signed Approval Form to the registrar’s office.REPEAT COURSE POLICY1. Repeat of Failures a. If a student fails a course and then repeats it with a pass-ing grade (excluding pass/fail grades), both the original failure and the repeated grade appear on the transcript but only the higher grade is used in the calculation of the GPA. b. If a student fails a course which was failed before, only one failure is calculated on the transcript. Ordinarily a stu-dent may repeat a course only once, but in case a student twice fails a course required for graduation, the student may petition the advisor and the dean of undergraduate education to be allowed to take the course a third time.2. Repeat of a course in which a “C-,” “D” or “D+” was earned. Any course in which a “C-,” “D” or “D+” was earned may be repeated once provided the student has permission of the academic advisor. Both grades will be recorded on the transcript but only the higher grade will be used in the calculation of the GPA.3. A course in which a grade higher than a “C-” was earned may not be repeated (except in 4 below).4. All nursing students are required to achieve a grade of C+ or higher in all nursing courses. Any nursing student who receives less than a C+ may repeat that nursing course once. A nursing student can repeat a total of one (1) nursing course throughout the BSN curriculum. All nursing courses must be repeated at DeSales University.5. Grades earned in repeat courses completed at Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg and Lehigh through the LVAIC cross-registration policy may replace the previous grade in the calculation of GPA, though both grades will appear on the transcript. MAKE-UP OF FAILURES Failures of required courses must be made up by repeating the course with a passing grade at DeSales University or with a minimum grade of C- at another institution. Prior approval to take any course for transfer credit at another institution must be obtained from the associate dean of academic life, in accordance with the transfer course approval policy directly below. Grades 24earned in repeat courses completed at Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg and Lehigh through the LVAIC cross-registration policy may replace the previous grade in the calcula-tion of GPA, though both grades will appear on the transcript. For courses repeated elsewhere, the transfer grade will not be com-puted in the student’s GPA. DeSales University will not transfer course work completed at any institution unless the grade earned is at least a C-. Make-up of Failures Received in Senior Year: An instruc-tor may permit a student who has received a failure for a course taken in either semester of the senior year to take a re-examina-tion in that course. Such re-examination must be completed no later than one week before commencement.TRANSFER COURSE APPROVAL Prior approval for all transfer courses completed elsewhere must be secured from the associate dean of academic life if the student wishes to transfer the work to his/her program at DeSales, using the form available in the academic affairs office or via MyDSU. The approval column must be signed by a department chair or division head only in cases where a course is required for the major. The student completes this form, secures depart-mental or division signatures where applicable, and presents it for approval to the associate dean of academic life with a catalog description of the course to be taken. Individual courses will be evaluated in accordance with the undergraduate transfer policy, which can be found in Section 4 below. This procedure need not be followed for courses taken at DeSales University. At the conclusion of the course, the student must request that an official transcript be sent from the other college or university to the DeSales registrar’s office. Transfer credit is granted only for courses in which the student earned a grade of C- or better. The DeSales registrar’s office validates the approval transfer of credit. Transfer of grades is allowed only if a student cross-registers at one of the LVAIC institutions (Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg, and Lehigh). For classes at those institutions, a student must complete a cross-registration form, available at the registrar’s office.CHANGE OF MAJOR The change of major is a formal procedure. The student should obtain the signature of his/her present academic advisor and then take this form to the registrar’s office. If the student plans to follow a specific track or concentration in the new major, the track or concentration must be listed. The registrar’s office will circulate the form to the department chair or division head of the new major for his/her approval. The department chair or divi-sion head sends the form to the registrar’s office. The student will receive a confirmation of the change of major via e-mail from the Academic Resource Center (ARC). The graduation requirements for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student’s official acceptance to the major.CREDIT BY EXAMINATIONFull-time and part-time undergraduate students who have acquired substantial knowledge in certain subject areas may apply for permission to verify this knowledge by examination, and consequently receive credit. Credit by examination may be earned for any course unless specifically excluded by the offering department (e.g., Education 101: Academic Literacy and Strategies; English 100: An Introduction to Academic Writing; Mathematics 107: Mathematics for Teachers I: MOT/Mathematics, Mathematics 109: Survey of Mathematics, Mathematics 110: Finite Mathematics, and Mathematics 111: Probability and Statistics; and the 101-102 level of a foreign language). Students should check with individual departments and/or divisions concerning other courses not open to credit by examination. An examination is always required, but other forms of evaluation may also be required by a department and/or divi-sion, e.g., written, laboratory, studio, or other type of evidence as is normally required by students who are regularly enrolled in the course. Interested students may obtain from the department and/or division titles of books normally listed in the course syllabus or other information as to course content. Students who believe they have the necessary knowledge, preparation, or background to establish credit by examination shall make application to the appropriate department chair and/or division head no later than the end of the third week of the term. If, in the opinion of the appropriate department chair and/or division head, the student has a reasonable chance of establishing credit, the student, by no later than the close of the term, shall arrange for the examination together with satisfactory completion of all course assignments and requirements demanded by the department. The nature of the examination given shall be entirely the decision of the depart-ment chair and/or division head in consultation with members of the department. No course in which the student has at any time previously been registered for either credit, auditing, or enrichment purposes may be challenged under this program. A student attempting credit by examination shall not be entitled to formal instruction in the subject matter of the course. Ordinarily, a student may attempt only one challenge examination per semester. Before the examination the student will choose one of two methods of evaluation:1. The student may request that the examination be assigned a specific letter grade. In this case the student may accept or decline the grade made. If the student accepts, the grade will be placed on the student’s permanent record. If the student declines, the grade will not be recorded, but the student will forfeit any further credit by examination opportunity in the course and receive no credit.2. The examination may be evaluated as Pass or Fail and recorded on the permanent record if passed. Failures will not be recorded on the student’s permanent record, but the student will forfeit any further credit by examination oppor-tunity in the course and receive no credit. A $75 administrative fee is required of all full-time tradi-tional students. All other students, including ACCESS students, are required to pay 30% of the tuition to sit for the exam.THE COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) DeSales University offers a student the possibility of receiving credit by examination through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). A new or matriculated student may receive up to 75 credits (25 courses) for demonstrating college-level competency on these exams developed by the Educational Testing Service. Credits earned through CLEP are considered transfer credits (See Transfer Policy). By recognizing college-level achievement learned through employment expe-riences, purposeful private study, military-industrial-business training, or advanced work in high school, this program gives the student an opportunity to reduce the cost of a degree at DeSales University in terms of time and money. DeSales University has been designated as a CLEP Testing Center. The exams are admin-istered at the Bethlehem Area Campus. CLEP examinations are computer-based and students obtain their scores immediately. Only scores sent directly from CLEP to DeSales University are considered official and will be accepted. The CLEP examinations are of two types, the General Examinations and the Subject Examinations. Both types measure the knowledge and understanding of factual information, as well as the ability to see relationships and apply basic principles to new situations. These examinations are based on typical college courses offered across the country. CLEP General Examinations. The five CLEP General Examinations measure material often covered in the first two years of college as part of a general liberal arts requirement. The examinations in humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and history are 90-minute multiple choice tests. It is important to realize that the CLEP General Examinations are analogous to end-of-the-year exams and require more than a cursory knowledge of the subject area.1. A student is eligible to take any or all of the General Examinations if he or she has not taken or transferred more than one course in the specific areas covered by the exam or exams.2. If the minimum acceptable score is received on a General 25Examination, the student will receive six credits. These credits fulfill General Education requirements, where appli-cable. CLEP Subject Examinations: The CLEP Subject Examinations measure the achievement of principles, concepts, and knowledge from specific college courses. All of the Subject Examinations are 90-minute multiple choice tests. Depending on the particular test and the score obtained, a student may earn credit for one or two courses.1. A student may take any of the Subject Examinations any-time before graduation, provided the student has not taken that course for credit or audit.2. Course credit earned from the Subject Examinations can be used to satisfy General Education requirements, where applicable.3. A student must have the permission of his or her department chair and/or division head to test out of major requirements. CLEP Examinations may be repeated three months after the first administration. No CLEP Examination may be taken more than twice. Students who are interested in the CLEP Examinations should inquire at the ACCESS Office.ADVANCED PLACEMENT Students seeking advanced placement must take the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examination(s) in the subject(s) involved. Only the results of the first administration of each examination can be considered as a basis for granting credit, i.e., students may not retake exams until they achieve a satisfactory score. In addition, all examination results to be considered for advanced placement and/or credit are to be submitted before the applicant’s matriculation in DeSales University. Only scores sent directly to DeSales University from the College Board are considered official and will be accepted. Students who achieve scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the Advanced Placement Economics: Macroeconomics Examination will receive 3 credits in place of "
EC 210,". DeSales University abides by the following policy with regard to the Advanced Placement Examinations in English Language and Composition and Literature and Composition: a score 1, 2, or 3, no advanced placement or credit; a score of 4, the student is awarded 3 credits for , ; one 200/300 level PO course (excluding ; and, one additional mathematics course at the 300 or 400 level ("
CS 211,". Finally, for a score of 4 or higher on the AP Computer Science Principles examination, a student may earn 3 credits as a free elective.

The goal of the media studies major at DeSales University is to produce media professionals with basic skills for content pro-duction and advanced tools of critical thought necessary for cri-tiquing that content, with an emphasis on media theory. Students will take courses in media theory, journalism, digital media, and media production.  Media professionals must carry into their chosen field the appropriate tools for critical thinking about how media function as institutions, as content producers, and as political influencers, among other things. Equally so, scholars who choose a path of studying media in higher education should have a knowledge of the technical aspects of the production process that will help inform their scholarship. The major incorporates experiences both in and out of the classroom to produce students who have experience in produc-tion and theory and an awareness of ethical concerns present in the contemporary world of the media industry.Core Courses"

Honorable Withdrawala.  Students must not be on probation for either academic or disciplinary reasons.b.  Students must have resolved all financial indebtedness to DeSales University.c.  Withdrawal Procedure:  1) A students should complete a Withdrawal Form, avail-able in the registrar’s office.  2) The registrar will determine the official withdrawal date and mark it on the form.d.  Students not currently on campus should contact the reg-istrar to request a Withdrawal Form.e.  Withdrawal after the deadline will result in a failure (F) for all courses registered in that semester. The official withdrawal deadline for each semester is listed in the academic calendar.f.  Given that the last date of attendance before a withdrawal may impact a student’s financial responsibilities, it is recommended that a student interested in a withdrawal speak directly with the Bursar’s Office and/or Financial Aid Office for additional information about the implica-tions for their tuition and financial aid. Students granted “honorable withdrawal” and who have not 26taken any courses at another institution during their separation from DeSales may return to DeSales University without fur-ther formal action by the Committee on Admissions. However, students must submit a written request for readmission to the registrar, or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students, no later than one month before the beginning of the term for which readmission is sought. Students who have taken courses at another institution during their separation from DeSales must apply for admission through the admissions office.2. Withdrawal on Probation Students who are on probation for academic reasons and who wish to withdraw from the institution should complete a Withdrawal Form available in the Registrar’s Office, and designate “Withdrawal on Probation” as their reason for doing so. Students who wish to return to DeSales University after “withdrawal on probation” must apply to the Committee on Admissions. If students who left DeSales University while on academic probation are readmitted by the Committee on Admissions, they will be given the option of declaring one semester of “academic bankruptcy” at the time of their readmis-sion. A note will be entered on the record to indicate that the student has declared “academic bankruptcy” for that semester. Total credits earned and cumulative grade point average will be recomputed excluding all effects of the “bankrupt” semester, and the student will renew academic work at DeSales University with this revised grade point average and total credits earned.3. Leave of Absence Students who are not on probation and who must or wish to interrupt their education may apply to the associate dean of aca-demic life or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students for a leave of absence. The application should contain the reasons for requesting the leave of absence and an estimate of its duration, usually not to exceed one year. Ordinarily, leaves are not approved after the withdrawal deadline. Moreover, students must fulfill conditions a, b, and c under No. 1 Honorable Withdrawal above. Students granted such a leave may return to DeSales University without further formal action by the Admissions Committee but must submit a written request for readmission to the associate dean of academic life no later than one month before the beginning of the term for which readmission is sought. However, if the authorized period for the leave of absence has expired without an approved request to extend the leave, the stu-dent must reapply for admission through the admissions office. Given that the last date of attendance before a leave may impact a student’s financial responsibilities, it is recommended that a student interested in a leave speak directly with the Bursar’s Office and/or Financial Aid Office for additional infor-mation about the implications for their tuition and financial aid. Questions about housing should be addressed to the residence life office.4. “Stop Out” Policy Day or ACCESS students who find it especially profitable or economically necessary to “stop out” for work, travel or other experience will be permitted to do so, at the discretion of the dean of undergraduate education without loss of credit or standing (as described in Leave of Absence above).5. Academic Dismissal DeSales University reserves the right to dismiss a student for academic reasons whenever there is clear evidence that the student is no longer deriving benefit from its educational pro-gram. A student is always liable to dismissal:a. If the student has received the warning of academic proba-tion for two consecutive semesters;b. If the student achieves a grade point average of less than 1.00 in any semester of any year, regardless of whether or not his or her cumulative grade point average is thereby brought below the minimum non-probationary standard. A list of students “liable to dismissal” is presented by the dean of undergraduate education or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students to the Committee on Academic Regulations at the end of each semester. The decision to dismiss rests with this committee, subject to the approval of the pro-vost/vice president for academic affairs. The words “Academic Dismissal” appear on the official transcript of a student who is dismissed for academic reasons.6. Reinstatement Students who are required to withdraw for academic rea-sons are ordinarily not eligible for reinstatement until they have successfully completed 8 courses (24 credits) at an accredited institution of higher education. Reinstatement is not automatic; rather students must reapply to the college and submit all required application documents. Students will be evaluated by the Admissions Committee to determine if the student has met the qualifications to be reinstated at the institution. If readmitted, students may request one semester of “academic bankruptcy.” Before the student is reinstated to the University, the stu-dent’s bursar account will be checked. If an outstanding balance exists, the student must clear the account before being permitted to return.  Before the student is reinstated to the University, the stu-dent’s disciplinary record will be checked. Any violations of the student code of conduct will be taken into consideration as part of the admission’s decision. Financial aid eligibility will be determined based on dem-onstration of need, filing by the deadlines, and availability of funds. Additionally, students must meet financial aid satisfactory academic progress standards to be eligible for financial aid. For more information regarding academic progress, refer to section 4-A “Financial Aid” of this catalog.7. Suspension and Expulsion Occasionally students are separated from the University for non-academic reasons. Usually the letter of suspension or expulsion clearly states the conditions of the action taken by the University and the possibilities for further association with the University. Please consult the Student Handbook for a fuller explanation of these types of separation from the University.ACCESS COURSES TAKEN BY TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS If courses are not offered in the day session, limited seats may be available for traditional day students in hybrid ACCESS courses under unusual circumstances. The student must request an exception by submitting a completed Approval Form (avail-able in MyDSU under the Forms and Documents heading as well as in the academic affairs office) to the dean of undergraduate education. If registration of an ACCESS course is allowed the following regulations apply:1. Traditional day students may not take online ACCESS courses during the fall or spring semesters. 2. Normally, no more than five (5) seats will be available per hybrid class3. Courses during Sessions 1 through 4 are considered as part of their five-course load. They may also overload courses, if they qualify, in these sessions on a space-available basis.4. Registration for ACCESS courses must be completed by the date for changing or adding courses as indicated on the academic calendar for each day semester. Permission to withdraw from a day course and add an evening course after the date for changing and adding courses is granted by the dean of undergraduate education only by way of excep-tion and for serious reasons, e.g., serious illness. The desire merely to improve one’s GPA or to avoid a failure is not a good reason for granting this exception.5. Permission to withdraw from evening credit courses must be obtained from the student’s academic advisor and from the director of the academic resource center. Withdrawal from evening credit courses will follow the applicable deadlines for these courses, which are published on the ACCESS cal-endar, available online.6. After the date for changing or adding courses, traditional day students are not permitted to withdraw from a day course and add an ACCESS evening or weekend course during Sessions 2 or 4.7. Students enrolled in ACCESS courses must follow the ACCESS calendar for those courses in all respects. This is especially important for breaks.TRADITIONAL DAY COURSES TAKEN BY ACCESS STUDENTS Before the advertised pre-registration dates for traditional 27day students each semester, there will be five (5) seats held for ACCESS students in all traditional day courses. Additional ACCESS registrations in traditional day courses will be accom-modated after pre-registration on a space available basis. ACCESS students who need to get into a traditional day course that is closed due to space limitations (e.g., science and computer labs, smart classrooms, and limits set by the University for core courses) must obtain a signature from the chair of the department offering the course. TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS ENROLLING IN SUMMER ACCESS COURSES Traditional day students who want to take ACCESS summer and winter session courses must register for them in WebAdvisor and pay the appropriate tuition. The tuition for summer courses is due before the summer course begins and cannot be deferred until the fall semester. The tuition for winter courses is due before the winter course begins and cannot be deferred until the spring semester. These courses may not be considered part of a fall or spring course load.ONLINE COURSES FOR TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS To prepare all students to engage in future online educational opportunities as a form of lifelong learning, DeSales University offers full-semester online courses specifically for traditional day students. Traditional day students, with the exception of first-semes-ter freshmen, may register for as many as two of these online courses in any fall or spring semester, provided that they do not exceed a total of two such courses during the entirety of their undergraduate program. Final exams for these online courses may be administered in a classroom on campus or online, at the discretion of the instruc-tor. As noted above, traditional day students may not take online ACCESS courses during the fall or spring semesters.TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS IN GRADUATE COURSES Ordinarily, full-time students who have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 and have senior status may enroll in graduate courses while fulfilling the requirements for an undergradu-ate degree. Ordinarily, they may register for no more than two graduate courses at a time and may accumulate no more than nine graduate credits unless specifically required by the program. The students must have the permission of their division head (or his/her delegate), the appropriate graduate program director, the dean of undergraduate education, and the dean of graduate education. Departments which sponsor accelerated programs may establish criteria which are more stringent than those delineated above.  Ordinarily, students may not carry an overload course dur-ing a semester or session in which they are enrolled in a graduate course. Students may not take the graduate course(s) for a Pass/Fail grade. Registration is on a space-available basis. All pre-scribed course sequences and all prerequisites must be followed. Full-time undergraduate traditional day students who register for both undergraduate and graduate courses as part of their five course load pay no additional tuition.ACCESS STUDENTS IN GRADUATE COURSES ACCESS students and other undergraduate students who pay tuition on a per-credit basis, have senior status, and have a cumu-lative GPA of at least 3.0, may enroll in graduate courses while fulfilling the requirements for an undergraduate degree. Ordinarily they may register for no more than two graduate courses at a time and may accumulate no more than nine graduate credits unless specifically required by the program. The students must have the permission of the appropriate division head (or his/her delegate), the dean of undergraduate education, the appropriate graduate program director, and the dean of graduate education. Departments which sponsor accelerated programs may establish criteria which are more stringent than those delineated above. Ordinarily, students may not carry an overload course dur-ing a semester or session in which they are enrolled in a graduate course. Students may not take the graduate course(s) for a Pass/Fail grade. Registration is on a space-available basis. All prescribed course sequences and all prerequisites must be followed. These students must pay applicable graduate tuition.CANCELLATION OF COURSES ELIMINATION OF PROGRAMS The University reserves the right to cancel courses due to insufficient enrollment, staffing difficulties, or other contingen-cies. In such cases, students will be informed in a timely manner so that other courses might be selected. Occasionally, majors, minors, or certificate programs may be terminated. Reasonable efforts will be made so that students who have matriculated into them will be able to complete their programs in a timely fashion.ACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY Acts of academic dishonesty violate the deepest convictions of the University community and will not be tolerated. Such acts, including plagiarism, cheating, and other unacceptable behaviors are strictly prohibited. This policy applies to all academic cours-es, regardless of the method of delivery (e.g., traditional lecture, laboratory, online, and hybrid courses).Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of copying the ideas, and/or specula-tions, and/or language of any other person or persons, without acknowledgement, and presenting this material as your own original work to satisfy any academic requirement or complete any academic project. Plagiarism takes place even in the event that you make use of or paraphrase another person’s unique and distinctive terminology, whether it be a single word or phrase or extended passage, without acknowledgement. Such use is considered plagiarism regardless of your intent to deceive. The following acts will be deemed acts of plagiarism, though the list is not exhaustive. Presenting as your own1. Published or unpublished work prepared by others, or dic-tated by others, including papers purchased or borrowed from any person or organization;2. Lab reports or exercises copied from or dictated by others;3. Homework assignments of any kind copied from or dictated by others;4. Oral reports copied from or dictated by others;5. Formal lecture notes incorporated into your work;6. A computer solution developed by someone elseCheating  Dishonest acts that give any student an unfair advantage are considered cheating. The following acts will be deemed acts of cheating, though the list is not exhaustive:1. Using materials not specifically allowed by the instruc-tor during the taking of an examination, test, or quiz; for example, a. Use of material written by another student either with   or without his or her knowledge; or b. Use of crib notes, no matter by whom prepared; or, c. Use of texts and/or supplementary marginal notations   in texts; or, d. Use of notes written on the surface of the desk at which  examination is being taken; or, e. Use of electronic aids, including but not limited to  calculators, phones, tablets, and other mobile devices;2. Unauthorized collaboration or communication, either in the giving or receiving of information, during an examination, test, quiz, laboratory report, or assignment (regardless of the format, e.g., take-home, online, in-class, or on-campus);3. Stealing, using, possessing, or transmitting verbally or otherwise actual examinations, tests, quizzes or portions thereof, or other confidential information before or during the time of the exam.4. Submitting any material for a grade in one class that has been previously or simultaneously submitted for a grade in another class, in whole or in part, without documented authorization from both instructors;285. Arranging or attempting to arrange to have your own aca-demic work done in whole or in part by someone else, with or without compensation;6. Falsifying of laboratory or research data or results; or, falsifying or inventing bibliographical entries for research papers;7. Willfully aiding or abetting any act of cheating and/or pla-giarism.Other Unacceptable Behaviors A number of unacceptable behaviors cannot properly be termed either plagiarism or cheating, yet they are also prohibited. The following acts are considered acts of unacceptable behavior, though the list is not exhaustive.1. Misuse or abuse of Trexler Library resources, including but not limited to:a. Unauthorized removal of library resources;b. Hiding library resource materials of any kind within the library;c. Defacement or mutilation of library resources (e.g., underlining, highlighting, or removing paragraphs or pages);2. Copying right-protected print or non-print materials beyond accepted norms;3. Falsifying the reason for an absence from class;4. Misrepresenting yourself, or allowing yourself to be misrep-resented, by means technological or otherwise; for example,a. Responding for someone else using classroom par-ticipation devices (e.g., clickers, cell phones, or other electronic devices) in a physical classroom, or allowing someone else to respond for you;b. Logging in to an online learning environment (e.g., an online course or learning management system) using someone else’s credentials, or allowing someone else to log in using your credentials;5. Misrepresenting the number of hours completed and/or the tasks completed in a credit-bearing experience (e.g., intern-ship, research, practicum, clinical rotation, etc.);6. Withholding knowledge of an incident of cheating or pla-giarism from the individual instructor to whom the work is submitted.Procedures1. The faculty member or, when appropriate, university profes-sional staff member, who discovers or is made aware of a case of plagiarism, cheating, or unacceptable behavior will, on his/her own initiative and in a manner he or she deems appropriate, normally resolve the situation with the student in a private, one-on-one setting. The faculty/staff member may alternatively choose to resolve matters in consultation with the appropriate administrator (the dean of undergradu-ate education, in the case of undergraduate students; the dean of graduate education, in the case of graduate stu-dents).2. When a faculty/staff member and student meet to resolve a case of plagiarism, cheating, or unacceptable behavior, the faculty/staff member, having previously determined that the case before him/her is beyond question a proven and unmistakable offense, will present his/her position, hear the student’s position, and in the end, may determine that igno-rance on the part of the student warrants only a warning to the student. If, however, he/she determines a degree of guilt on the part of the student, he/she is empowered to levy any one of the following sanctions:a.  grade penalty for the individual assignmentb.  grade penalty for the coursec.  failure in the course. In the case of library violations, temporary suspension or permanent loss of library privileges may be levied.3. The faculty member will compose a letter stating the nature of the offense as well as the sanction imposed. The faculty/staff member will send the letter to the student and will send a copy of the letter to the appropriate administrator to be kept on file. Should there be an appeal, any subsequent actions in regard to the incident will be duly recorded by the appropriate administrator.4. Should it be determined that this is a second offense involv-ing this student, the incident will then be resolved by the appropriate administrator in conjunction with the faculty/staff member. In such cases, the appropriate administrator’s decision for resolution may supersede the original decision of the faculty/staff member, when made without knowledge of the first offense.5. In the case of a second offense, the administrator will solicit written statements from the faculty/staff member and the student in question. He/she may then meet with the student and/or faculty/staff member for any needed clarification.6. On the occasion of a second offense, the vice president for academic affairs may impose the penalty of dismissal from the University.7. In the event a faculty/staff member and appropriate admin-istrator working in consultation determine that an egregious breach of academic ethics has been committed, the student may be liable for dismissal from a major, a program, or the University, even on the first offense.8. When the appropriate administrator reaches a decision, he/she will inform the student of that decision in writing and will also inform the student of his/her right to appeal the decision and/or the severity of the sanction before the full Academic Affairs Committee. The faculty/staff member involved also will have the right to appeal. The appropriate Academic Affairs Committee (undergraduate or graduate) will hear all appeals—undergraduate, graduate, ACCESS, and faculty.9. The words “Academic Dismissal” appear on the official transcript of a student who is dismissed for academic rea-sons.ACADEMIC DUE PROCESS The undergraduate student who feels that he or she has an academic grievance should follow the procedure outlined below: The student should first discuss the problem or grievance with the faculty/staff member. If, following discussion with the faculty/staff member, the student is not satisfied and continues to believe that he/she has not been dealt with fairly, he/she should discuss the grievance with the chair of the department and/or the division head involved. Students may be asked to present their grievance in writing. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student has recourse to the dean of undergraduate education. As a final appeal, the student may request the Academic Affairs Committee to evaluate the situation and make a recom-mendation to the provost/vice president for academic affairs. This request must be presented in writing and include the perti-nent information regarding the situation. The Academic Affairs Committee will normally act upon such an appeal within one month of its receipt. The provost’s decision will be final. When the Academic Affairs Committee does not meet (e.g., during the summer) the order of appeal shall be: faculty/staff member, chair of the department and/or the division head involved, dean of undergraduate education, and provost/vice president for academic affairs.29COUNSELING CENTER The Counseling Center provides counseling services to full-time, traditional day students free of charge. The center is staffed by two professional counselors and master’s level interns. The counselors offer group and individual counseling designed to help students develop their full potential and overcome obstacles related to their educational or personal growth. Some of the reasons students seek or are referred for counseling include problems relating to adjustment issues, relationship difficulties, concerns about mood, self-esteem and self-concept issues, and drug and alcohol issues. The counselors, upon request, provide outreach programs in the residence halls as well. In addition to traditional counseling, the center also pro-motes a wellness lifestyle. Efforts are made to help students understand their cognitive, behavioral, and emotional function-ing, and the effects of this functioning on various dimensions of their life (i.e., intellectual, spiritual, physical, nutritional, inter-personal, educational/vocational, recreational, emotional, and social.) The center’s goals are promoted through outreach program-ming, faculty/staff and student workshops and training, newslet-ters, and other special programming events. Additional services offered by the center include consultation and referral. For more information, call the center at 610.282.1100, ext. 1462 or 1551.PACE (PEER ADVISING, COUNSELING, EDUCATING) PACE is a team of trained and certified students who serve as advisors, counselors, and educators to the student body. They are trained by the BACCHUS initiative of NASPA (National Association of Student Personnel Administrators). DeSales University recognizes that students often relate bet-ter to, or are more comfortable with, their peers when it comes to confiding personal struggles. For this reason, the PACE team is trained to provide confidential, one-on-one peer counsel-ing. Students in need of guidance and/or support can schedule appointments directly with a PACE counselor of their choice. Students can schedule an appointment by emailing pace@desales.edu, or calling 610-282-1100, ext. 7223. As educators, PACE hosts programs throughout the year to raise awareness about suicide, substance abuse, body image, bullying, responsible use of social media, identifying abusive relationships, alcohol safety, mental health awareness, nutrition, time management, coping with stress, and more.CAMPUS MINISTRY Through its worship and other spiritual activities, Campus Ministry seeks to form Christian Humanists by helping the traditional student community to be faithful, maturing, and prayerful disciples of Jesus who minister to and lead the Church and society. The life, teachings, and spirituality of St. Francis de Sales are the guiding force in the ministry. Campus Ministry seeks to form students who will value and pursue life-long faith development; be full, conscious, and active participants in Sunday Eucharist and parish life; can discern, develop, and live an attractive personal life of devotion, prayer, and service appropriate to their vocation and state in life; and be able to articulate a working understanding of Salesian spirituality. While DeSales is a proudly Roman Catholic institution in the Salesian tradition, Campus Ministry seeks to serve the needs of the entire student body, including those of other faith traditions and of no particular faith. CENTER FOR SERVICE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE The Center for Service and Social Justice provides volunteer service opportunities for all members of the University commu-nity and works to create and foster a vibrant commitment to com-munity service through meaningful outreach activities. A variety of opportunities are available for individuals and groups to put their faith into action. The programs promote genuine human interaction between the members of the University community and our neighbors in the Lehigh Valley and beyond. The Center for Service and Social Justice provides various activities to accommodate a broad range of community needs, the diverse skills and interests of the DeSales community, and the different schedules of all involved. Its programs include:•  Ongoing service projects: On a regularly scheduled basis students work at after school programs in both elementary schools and high schools, homeless shelters, and retirement communities. Transportation is provided.• One time service projects: A number of events and activities take place only once per semester or once per year, such as the DeSales Blood Drive, Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, and the Catholic Charities’ Halloween and Christmas parties.• Spring and fall break service trips: Students participate in week-long service projects at locations outside the Lehigh Valley. Recent destinations include Pittsboro, N.C.; Washington, D.C., New Orleans, and Joplin, Mo.HEALTH SERVICE The Health Center is dedicated to helping students stay well and directing them toward proper treatment if they become ill. The center is open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Treatment given by the nursing staff is without charge. Student visits to the University physician are covered by the Student Life Fee. If a student is referred for further off-campus diagnostic testing or blood work, every effort is made to access care within the parameters of the student’s personal health insurance carrier. In emergency situations, students are sent to a nearby hospital. All students must submit a completed physical examination as part of the admissions process.ATHLETICS AND RECREATION/INTRAMURALS Students participate in a full and active program of intra-mural and recreational sports housed in Billera Hall. The facility includes four regulation basketball courts, four volleyball courts, a fitness center, and an aerobics studio, which is open to all mem-bers of the University community. Outdoor facilities include an all-weather track and field facility, as well as field hockey, soccer, and softball fields, base-ball, tennis, and lacrosse venues. Additionally, the cross country course, which traverses the campus, is one of the best in the eastern United States. DeSales University is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the Middle Atlantic Conferences (MAC), the Freedom Conference, and the Lehigh Valley Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (LVAIAW). The University sponsors a 16-sport intercollegiate athletic pro-gram, offering competition in baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, track and field, and golf for men; and in basket-ball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball for women.THE DE SALES EXPERIENCE IN CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP The mission of the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership is to foster students’ character and intellect in an environment that nurtures self-exploration. The Experience is co-curricular, linking character formation, service, and leadership with the student learning outcomes of the DeSales undergraduate academic program. The DeSales Experience provides students with the knowledge and skills to become leaders and ethical citizens in the Salesian tradition. The DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership is a four-year program that begins with students’ completion of Character U, extending throughout the first year. During their sophomore and junior years, students are expected to complete 40 hours of community service, hold a leadership position on 3 STUDENT SERVICES30campus, and complete a career development experience. They must also complete one academic course from the categories of Salesian spirituality and Christian humanism; ethics and charac-ter; globalization, social justice, or human rights; or career, lead-ership, or vocation; which will provide knowledge and skills that contribute to leadership and ethical citizenship. Finally, students must participate in the Senior Success Series throughout their senior year and maintain a good student conduct record. Upon graduation, those students who complete the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership will be presented with an honorary pin at the Baccalaureate ceremony, and will wear an honorary cord at graduation to represent their accomplishments.CHARACTER U – THE FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE The Character U program is DeSales University’s first-year experience. This unique, outside-of-the classroom program helps freshmen transition into college life and immerse themselves in the campus community. This is achieved by having the students attend various events throughout their first year at the university includ-ing, but not limited to, social, academic, service, spiritual/Salesian, cultural, and wellness events. Each month is dedicated to a specific trait from The Golden Counsels of St. France de Sales (September: Patience, October: Trust/Cooperation, November: Perseverance, February: Love, March: Forgiveness, April: Hope). To help students better understand these traits, Character U hosts nationally recognized keynote speakers who share their personal stories and relate them to the character trait for the month. Each freshman is also assigned a mentor who initiates contact over the summer and offers the student help in prepar-ing for opening day and orientation. A group of ten freshman mentees and one mentor continue to work together throughout the students’ first year, including weekly meetings to discuss health and wellness, academic progress, and other important components of a successful first year. In an effort to stimulate thinking about character development, citizenship, and life after graduation, mentors also guide freshmen through a curriculum based on moral dilemmas that they may encounter during their time at DeSales University. Completion of Character U is the first requirement of the four-year program, the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership.SENIOR SUCCESS SERIES The Senior Success Series is the culminating requirement of the DeSales Experience in Character and Leadership. As Character U prepared the students for their tenure at DeSales, the Senior Success Series will prepare students for life after graduation. This series of programs and events affords students the opportunity to network with and learn from industry profes-sionals and successful DeSales graduates. Twice per month, stu-dents will attend sessions that address various components of the transition from University life to the world of work. As much as possible, alumni and members of the community will share their knowledge about the transition to work and the value of a liberal arts education. The sessions that the students attend include:• Networking and creating a brand• Job search• Personal and professional character • Interviewing • Finances • Community engagement • What’s next? RESIDENCE LIFE The Office of Residence Life and the Office of Campus Life (Housing) are committed to providing residence halls that are safe, secure, and conducive to the learning and growth of each resident. In accordance with Salesian spirituality, the residence life staff strives to create a welcoming living environ-ment in which students’ rights and responsibilities are protected, differences are celebrated and appreciated, constructive social interaction is valued and advanced, and students are challenged to be contributing members of the community. The major-ity of DeSales University students live on campus in one of 10 residential communities: Aviat Hall, Brisson Hall, Chappuis Hall, Conmy Hall, DeChantal Hall, Donahue Hall, Tocik Hall, University Heights, Welsh Hall, and Finnegan, Guerin, and Harvey Houses (University Village). The Office of Residence Life oversees the supervision of the residence hall staff and enforcement of residence hall regulations. The Office of Campus Life coordinates all aspects of housing, including housing assignments.  The live-in professional staff members are directly responsible for the general operation of an assigned housing area, supervising the resident advisors (RAs), planning and coordinating residence hall programs, responding appropriately to student concerns, and ensuring compliance with University regulations/residence hall policies. Each residence hall floor/unit has a RA who serves as a resource for the resi-dents, as a leader in building community, and who documents any violations of University/residence hall policy. University policies and residence hall regulations are designed to ensure a high quality of daily life and to prevent behavior that is an infringement on the rights of others, detrimen-tal to personal growth and the common good, or in basic discord with the mission of the University.

Programs and resources help students define career goals, expand their knowledge of career alternatives, understand effective decision making/goal setting, have meaningful career-related experiences, and build a strong strategy for job searches or graduate education.  We welcome students and embrace opportunities to collabo-rate with employers, graduate and professional schools, faculty and staff, student organizations, parents, and alumni to provide the highest quality service to students.  Career development can help students attain successful employment or acceptance into graduate/professional schools with the following phases of career development:• Exploration of majors and careers • Acquisition of relevant experience • Guidance with job search correspondence and the job search process • Planning for graduate or professional school  Career development also helps students who are seeking internship experiences related to their academic majors and career goals. The program is a partnership among the student, the faculty supervisor, the employer, and DeSales University—represented by career development. Each partner has a responsi-bility to be honest and ethical. Each student represents not only himself or herself, but also his or her academic department and the University. Conduct and performance should be of the high-est standards. Internships give students educationally-relevant work and learning experiences that integrate theory learned in the classroom with practical application and job skill development. Through this experience, students should also achieve greater maturity, including an enhanced understanding of their own per-sonal and professional ethical codes.STUDENT CONDUCT The University expects its students to conduct their lives in a responsible manner. Students who exhibit behavior, which is inconsistent with the stated mission and goals of the University and the regulations, which flow from them, are subject to formal disciplinary procedures.MULTICULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Student affairs strives to build an environment at DeSales that welcomes all members of the community in a respectful manner through cultural activities, educational opportunities, and exploration of the world we live in.32ADMISSIONS PROCEDURES Admission to DeSales University is based on a student’s past academic achievement as well as his/her potential for future growth.

This is appropriate for individuals who want the abil-ity to provide documentation of participation in a course.• Value Initiative Program (VIP) – No permanent record will be maintained.  Students, in either option, will be permitted to attend classes on a space available basis and will not be required to take exams or other academic assessments. The cost for taking courses through either of these options is included with tuition/fees information. Anyone who is interested should contact an ACCESS advisor.ACCESS EVENING-WEEKEND NURSING PROGRAM DeSales University has a national-class reputation for strong undergraduate and graduate nursing degree programs. ACCESS has combined the strengths of the DeSales nursing education with a format that enables busy adult learners to earn a BSN degree while continuing to work, care for a family, and handle other responsibilities. Evening-Weekend nursing students are able to complete classes offered in the evenings and on weekends. Many are available in 8-week sessions with multiple scheduling options, including online.SENIOR CITIZEN PROGRAM Senior citizens (60 years of age or older) may enroll on a space-available basis in up to four non-studio credit courses per term (e.g., spring, fall, summer) at the rate of the current one-credit tuition fee. This may be a combination of courses (up to four) offered during the day or through ACCESS; for example, one course in Session 1, one course in Session 2, and two fall day courses. In addition to the registration fee, special course fees as applicable will be charged. Senior citizens may enroll in courses for enrichment, audit, or credit; and must meet the necessary prerequisites. All applicable academic regulations will be in effect for such students. Proof of age is required at the time of registration.ACCESS ADVISING All ACCESS students are encouraged to take advantage of the advising services. Students should plan to meet with an advisor on a consistent basis to discuss course planning, schedul-ing options, and other academic issues. Advising is available in person, through e-mail, or by telephone.ACCESS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS A certificate program provides the student with a coherent program of study that has specific and readily obtainable objec-tives and yet does not require the number of courses or the time commitment of a degree program. Professionals and college graduates who want or need additional higher education creden-tials outside their major area of collegiate study are also good candidates for an ACCESS certificate. The assistant dean of lifelong learning is responsible for administering certificate programs for ACCESS students. For complete details, students should contact an ACCESS advisor. Business Administration Financial Management Financial Planning (CFP®) Human Resource Management Information Technology Management/Leadership Marketing Marriage and Family Philosophy Public Accounting TheologyACCESS INDIVIDUALIZED MAJOR (AIM)  The ACCESS Individualized Major (AIM) offers students an opportunity to earn an interdisciplinary, self-designed degree. As a BA in liberal studies, it is intentionally structured to cross traditional discipline boundaries to address the student’s specific academic and vocational needs. AIM “customizes” a student’s education while ensuring rigorous standards within a carefully constructed yet flexible framework.CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING DeSales University recognizes that many adults acquire college level learning in non-collegiate settings such as work, the military, community organizations, and independent study. The ACCESS program provides the adult learner with a variety of methods to demonstrate that they have acquired college level learning. Students who desire to earn college credit for their prior learning may choose from one or a combination of the following options:DeSales University Challenge Exam Program Credit by examination may be earned for most DeSales University courses. In addition to the DeSales University Challenge Examination Program, standardized examinations have been developed by the following nationally recognized organizations.

Students are required to pay 30% of tuition for assessment of a portfolio related to a given course. For more information, contact an ACCESS advisor.CHANGE OF MAJOR The change of major for an ACCESS student is a formal procedure. The procedure to declare or change a major begins with the student’s ACCESS academic advisor.

The request form will be signed by the student and by the advisor who is making the recommendation for the change. The completed approval form will be sent to the appropriate department chair 46for approval. The registrar’s office is responsible for changing the major on the student’s permanent record once the form with proper signatures has reached the office. The graduation require-ments for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student’s official acceptance to the major.HIGH SCHOOL HONORS PROGRAM The High School Honors Program provides access to col-lege credit courses to academically talented high school juniors and seniors who receive appropriate recommendations from their principal and counselor and approval from the University’s dean of lifelong learning. The High School Honors Program serves to provide academically talented juniors and seniors from area high schools with opportunities to pursue learning at the college level as an enriching supplement to their secondary-level courses of study and with opportunities to earn college credits while they are still enrolled in high school. High school students who suc-cessfully complete credit courses may apply these credits toward a degree if they decide to enroll at DeSales University after graduation from high school or they may wish to present their earned credits for transfer to other colleges or universities. A student participating in the High School Honors Program will be billed at the ACCESS tuition rate and will be responsible for any related course fee.ACCESS ATTENDANCE POLICY In ACCESS, for courses that meet during an eight-week period, students who miss more than one class may be withdrawn from the course.

If the aid is less than the charges, the difference is immediately due and payable.2. When students are eligible for tuition reimbursement from their employers, written evidence of this eligibility is required from the employer. Only the amount of tuition that can be reimbursed will be deferred. In cases where all reimbursement is contingent upon successful completion of the course(s) and the student fails the course, DeSales University will require payment by students from their own funds. If they do not pay, they will not be permitted to matriculate in any subsequent session until all bills are paid and they will be ineligible in the future for tuition deferment of any kind.3. When students negotiate a loan through the government or a bank or other agency, written evidence of the loan is required. Tuition is deferred until the loan money is received.4. No ACCESS student will be permitted to register for any session until bills for all previous non-deferred sessions are fully paid.47TRANSCRIPTS OF CREDITS A fee of $8 will be charged for each transcript of cred-its.

Clinical field consists of a minimum of 170 hours of supervised classroom and educational experiences before student teaching. Field-experience competencies as deter-mined by PDE must be met during the field experience. Once candidates have completed all courses within the pro-fessional sequence, they are ready to student teach. STEP candi-dates may be placed in secondary public and nonpublic schools in grades 7-12 within their certification content area. ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONExperiences in Schools Candidates in the professional educator program participate in numerous observation and practice-based field experiences beginning in freshman year through the student teaching experi-ence. Candidates should be prepared to complete a minimum of 170 clinical field hours before student teaching. Field experiences are conducted in public and nonpublic schools within a 20-mile driving distance of the University’s Center Valley campus. The purpose of the program is to further develop, demonstrate, and assess the competencies of the certification program, thereby preparing the candidate for student teaching and eventual full-time employment as a professional educator. The field program strives to develop sensitivity and culturally responsive attitudes in working with diverse student populations: races, genders, reli-gious beliefs, national origins, and socio-economic backgrounds. All clinical field experiences and student teaching experiences will include field-based reports, evaluation, and feedback by 72cooperating teachers, University supervisors, and/or peers. See the Field Experiences Guide for Students for additional detail. Legal Clearances: Requirements for Observation, Field Experiences, and Student Teaching All students conducting observations or engaged in field experiences must obtain updated legal clearances before engag-ing in any fieldwork or entering schools. New clearances must be obtained each year before the fall semester. It is the student’s responsibility to provide legal copies to the education office to be kept on file. Required clearances include:1. Act 114 (FBI Fingerprinting)2. Act 34 (PA Criminal History Clearance)3. Act 151 (Child Abuse Clearance)4. PDE-6004 (Arrest/Conviction Report and Certification Form)5. TB test (negative results required)6. ECEE students must provide proof of rubella immuni-zation, both initial inoculation and booster. Information about clearances is available in the education department office. Students wishing to complete field experience requirements in Allentown Diocesan schools must also complete training in the Protecting God’s Children program and Diocesan signature forms. Other requirements may be mandated by the school or school district at their discretion. Please see the educa-tion department office for changes in clearance policies.Evening Classes Select Professional Phase courses may be offered in the evening in a hybrid format depending on enrollment demands.Comprehensive Assessment Program Portfolio Requirement All students in education must complete and submit a final semester portfolio. The CAP portfolio will be reviewed and evaluated by a committee of the faculty. Students who receive an unsatisfactory rating will be required to remediate the port-folio. See current CAP portfolio requirements on the Education Program Information Center on Blackboard.Student Teaching   All certification programs include a 14-week full-time stu-dent teaching experience for initial certification. To be eligible for student teaching, students must have been accepted into the professional educator program (PEP) and will formally apply for student teaching by October 1 (for spring placement) or March 1 (for fall placement). Students must take and pass all Basic Skills exams or have met the SAT/ACT exception requirement and must have taken the Praxis II Subject Area test or the PECT Tests for certification in Pre-K–4 with a satisfactory score. (See the student teaching application for details.) Students who plan to student teach must complete all aspects of the professional sequence and satisfy all major certification requirements before student teaching and practicum experiences. No other course-work is permitted during student teaching. Once candidates have completed all courses within the professional sequence and have been approved to student teach by the major chair, they are ready to student teach. Student teaching for initial certification is offered as four separate courses during the final semester of senior year within a public or nonpublic school. Candidates for certification must enroll in all four courses of student teaching concurrently. Student teaching and practicum field experiences are supervised by program faculty with knowledge and experi-ence in the area of certification and mentored by highly qualified and trained cooperating teachers in the schools. Students seeking certification who receive a final grade below a C in any domain of the student teaching/practicum course sequence cannot be recommended for certification. Student teachers not performing at a satisfactory level will face termination from student teaching. See the Student Teaching Handbook for conditions and details.Professionalism and Educator Ethics All student teaching candidates must present record-free clearances and be determined to be of “good moral character” as defined by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In addition, if a student teaching candidate has shown behaviors in contradiction to the PA Educators Code of Conduct, a full-time faculty committee will meet to determine student teaching eligi-bility. Due process as defined by the university will be followed.Education Program Completion Leading to Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Teacher Certification Candidates who successfully complete all the require-ments outlined in the degree and/or certification programs of the DeSales University education program will be eli-gible to receive an Instructional I certification from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Candidates for certification must also meet and demonstrate mastery for Pennsylvania Department of Education competencies embedded in the courses. In accordance with the Pennsylvania Department of Education’s standards, policies, and procedures for the state approval of certification of professional education for the public schools of Pennsylvania, certification candidates must complete a full-time (14 weeks) student teaching field experience, and achieve at least a satisfactory rating on the "
PDE 430,", Pennsylvania Statewide Evaluation Form for Student Professional Knowledge and Practice (refer to Student Teaching Handbook). Candidates must also be of good moral character to be recommended for certification in Pennsylvania.  All certification candidates must schedule an exit interview with the director of early childhood and elementary education, special education, or secondary edu-cation at the end of student teaching. Other requirements for certification may be mandated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania at any time.Dual Certification / Five-Year Undergraduate-Graduate Program Policies Undergraduate education students with a major in early childhood and elementary education or a minor in secondary education may enroll in graduate courses leading to dual/addi-tional certification in special education PreK-8, special education 7-12, English as a second language program specialist K-12 cer-tification, STEM, or instructional technology specialist certifica-tion.  Education students seeking admission into the dual-certifi-cation track will apply by October 1 of junior year (or after the successful completion of 18 courses). This application will be in conjunction with application for the professional phase. To gain acceptance, students must have a 3.0 GPA at time of application and must have taken the PAPA exams or the ETS Core exams (or must have met the SAT/ACT exception requirement per PDE) for the professional phase. A committee of the department will review applications and accept students into the dual-certifica-tion track. Second-semester juniors (or with accumulated successful course completion of 23 or more courses) who are accepted and enrolled in a dual-certification track will be permitted to enroll in graduate coursework specific to their dual-certification track only, before attaining senior status. In addition, graduate course registration before attaining senior status will be limited to one graduate course per semester. Students must also demonstrate maintenance of the GPA requirement before enrollment in gradu-ate courses. Dual-certification track students will meet the under-graduate policy for overload of courses and will be restricted to enrollment in dual-certification courses only under this policy.  Undergraduate students accepted and enrolled in a dual-cer-tification track may take up to 12 credits of graduate work before undergraduate graduation; however, a maximum of nine credits only may be applied toward a master’s degree pursued at DeSales.TIMS (Teacher Information Management System) All candidates for certification who have completed all program requirements, field requirements, student teaching, and teacher assessment exams will apply for certification online at the Pennsylvania Department of Education website. All informa-tion must be entered and required documentation must be sub-mitted either online or in paper. At such time as all information has been correctly entered, candidates will appear on the DeSales University dashboard for approval.

Students who enter DeSales University directly from high school as freshmen to obtain the terminal degree of Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) begin their course of study in the accel-erated health science major (3+3 pathway). After completion of three years of preparatory work in the core curriculum and pre-requisite mathematics and science courses required for entry into the professional phase of the DPT program, successfully progress-ing students will then complete the four-year Bachelor of Science in Health Science degree with two semesters of graduate-level coursework in physical therapy. After completion of seven addi-tional consecutive semesters at the graduate level, students receive the DPT degree. To be eligible to sit for the National Physical Therapy Examination and to qualify for licensure as a physical therapist, students must graduate from an accredited Doctor of Physical Therapy Program.  The Doctor of Physical Therapy Program at DeSales University is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE), 1111 North Fairfax Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314; telephone: 703-706-3245; email: accreditation@apta.org; website: http://www.capteonline.org.Mission Statement  The mission of the health science to DPT program is to provide a quality physical therapy education consistent with Christian humanism and the Salesian values of faith and reason. Students and graduates use their knowledge and skills to inte-grate scientific inquiry and evidence-based clinical reasoning into everyday practice, addressing the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of movement dysfunctions. With a focus on social responsibility and ethical conduct, students and graduates are committed to the advancement of the physical therapy profes-sion and to an ongoing personal desire for learning and growth. Through inter-professional communication and collaboration, graduates are prepared to be adaptable in the complex healthcare environment of today and tomorrow. Student Learning Outcomes  The health science to DPT program intends to graduate students who will successfully: 1. practice physical therapy with compassion and understand-ing that exemplifies Salesian and Christian humanistic val-ues of gentleness, humility, and simplicity for every person in their care,2. function competently in a variety of physical therapy set-tings upon entry into the field,3. integrate theoretical knowledge of foundational and clinical sciences in physical therapy with evidence-based practice in the creation and implementation of effective and contempo-rary treatment plans,4. communicate effectively with a spirit of camaraderie and collaboration as productive members of an inter-profession-al healthcare team,5. respect the uniqueness of cultural beliefs and values that influence interpersonal communication and behavior in a complex healthcare environment,6. engage in critical inquiry and scholarly activities within clinical practice that lead to innovation in the profession and a personal plan for lifelong learning, and7. adopt a servant-leadership attitude to initiate and advocate for changes in health policy toward health promotion, dis-ease prevention, wellness, and equitable access to care. Technical Standards Participation in and successful completion of the health sci-ence to DPT program requires that any enrolled students possess the ability to acquire academic knowledge, perform essential physical functions, and demonstrate professional attitudes and behaviors involved in physical therapy practice. The clinical doctorate degree awarded at the completion of the student’s edu-cational process certifies to the public that each individual has acquired this broad foundation of knowledge and skills requisite for safe, effective, and efficient care to the community being served.  Every student in the health science to DPT program must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform these essential func-tions, with or without reasonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodations may be offered to a student upon request in accordance with the provisions outlined in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, and DeSales University policy for students with disabilities. Reasonable accommodations may not: (1) fundamentally alter the nature of the didactic or clinical education curriculum, (2) compromise the essential elements of the program, (3) cause an undue financial or administrative burden for the University, or (4) endanger the safety of patients, self, or others. It should also be noted that completion of all clinical education courses is a gradu-ation requirement, and some facilities with which the program affiliates may not be able to meet the same accommodations as those offered to the student by the University during the didactic portion of the curriculum. Applicants to the health science to DPT program do not need to disclose information about reasonable accommodation needs before an admission decision. An offer for admission can be withdrawn, or a student already in the health science to DPT program may be withdrawn if it becomes apparent that the appli-cant/student is unable to perform any of the essential functions or meet any of the technical standards outlined below.  The following technical standards and essential functions 85represent minimum skill sets ensuring the successful completion of the degree requirements and future success in the provision of physical therapy services. These standards and functions are described and defined by both (1) category and (2) examples. The examples are for clarification and do not represent an exhaustive list of all possible abilities.

Affective Abilities are needed to be able to respond in a professional manner and to work harmoniously with individu-als from a variety of social, emotional, cultural, and intellectual backgrounds, often under complex and potentially stressful cir-cumstances. Examples include the ability to: • display maturity, good judgment, sensitivity, and emo-tional stability in all academic and professional set-tings,• effectively cope with and prioritize heavy academic schedules and deadlines,• demonstrate time management skills and a work ethic that promotes punctual attendance and full participa-tion in all classroom, laboratory, community, and clini-cal education experiences,• take initiative, be creative, prepared, flexible, enthusi-astic, cooperative, tolerant, respectful of authority, and industrious in all academic, clinical, and professional settings,• develop respectful, empathetic, compassionate, yet effective relationships with fellow students, faculty members, clinical instructors, patients, family mem-bers/caregivers, and other members of the healthcare team,• exercise good judgment and prompt, safe completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients and families,• demonstrate the emotional stability to function effec-tively under stress and to adapt to an environment that 86is likely to change rapidly, without warning and/or in unpredictable ways,• accept suggestions and feedback, and adapt one’s behavior as appropriate,• demonstrate the willingness to learn and abide by ethi-cal, legal, and professional principles and standards of physical therapy practice,• be self-reflective with respect to one’s commitment to learning and professional development,• recognize personal limitations and request assistance as appropriate,• present a professional appearance and maintain good general health/personal hygiene, and• be able to maintain confidentiality. While certain technological compensations can be made for some disabilities on a case-by-case basis, a student should be able to perform in all of the standard areas noted above in a reasonably independent and timely manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a student’s judgment must be mediated by someone else’s power of selection and observation, and as such is unacceptable.  When requested, the University will provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students with documented dis-abilities. It is the student’s responsibility to reveal the need for reasonable accommodations and provide the diagnostic data to substantiate this request. Requests for accommodations are made by contacting the director of disability services at 610.282.1100, ext. 1453 or by visiting www.desales.edu/disability for additional information.Admissions to the Health Science Major To achieve excellence in the health science to DPT program, and to accomplish program goals and student learning outcomes, highly selective criteria for admission at the undergraduate level have been identified.

The year-round program of seven remaining consecutive semesters is designed to prepare entry-level graduates to enter the field of physical therapy practice as knowledgeable and skilled experts in treating movement dysfunction. Students and graduates from the DPT program are value-guided, adaptable, reflective, collaborative, and capable of making independent clinical deci-sions based on integrative thinking and best-practices evidence. Successful matriculation through all semesters of the gradu-ate curriculum satisfies eligibility requirements to sit for the National Physical Therapy Examination. There is no advance placement into the DPT graduate program, and no credit is awarded for experiential learning. For more information about the DPT program and all operational policies and procedures for the graduate phase of the program, please refer to the Graduate Catalog of the University. Professional Requirements for Clinical Education  Students matriculating into the DPT program are required to complete four clinical education rotations in a variety of physical therapy settings. Successful completion of all clinical rotations is a requirement for graduation from the DPT program. Criminal Background and Child Abuse Clearance checks are performed as a requirement of participation in this aspect of the curriculum. If a student has a positive history in these regards, it is possible that he or she will not be able to be placed at clinical sites, nor will he or she be eligible for licensure depending on the laws of the state to which application is made.

Any offer of full acceptance into the Nursing major is contingent on the results of the applicant’s nationwide criminal background check and FBI fingerprint-ing. A positive record, on either the nationwide criminal background check or the FBI fingerprinting, will result in revocation of the applicant’s acceptance, or, in the case of a matriculated student, program dismissal.  7. Students seeking transfer into the nursing major either from another major offered at DeSales University or from another academic institution must have a minimum cumu-lative grade point average (GPA) of 2.75 in order to be accepted into the program. In addition students must meet all minimum progression requirements outlined for nursing majors to be eligible for transfer. Accepted transfer students must abide by the nursing progression requirements out-lined in the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time of acceptance into the nursing program. The BSN program’s prerequisite science courses are eligible for transfer con-sideration provided the courses adhere to the undergraduate transfer policy detailed in Section 4 of the Undergraduate Catalog, were completed with a grade of “C” or higher, and were completed within the last five years of the student’s matriculation into a DeSales BSN program.8. The admission process is rigorous; demonstrating minimum admission requirements does not guarantee acceptance or acceptance of transfer into a DeSales nursing program.9. Once an admission decision has been reached and notifi-cation of the decision has been sent to the applicant, the decision is considered final and the application is closed. Information related to closed applications is not discussed with the applicant or the applicant’s designees. There are no further appeals.Nurse Scholars Program Acceptance into the Nurse Scholars Program as an incoming freshman assures direct matriculation into the MSN program upon completion of the BSN program, provided that the student remains in n “Acceptable Academic Standing” as outlined in Section 2 of 107the Undergraduate Catalog. The MSN program provides options for advanced study which prepares graduates for certification as a family nurse practitioner, psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner, adult gerontology clinical nurse specialist, or adult gerontology acute care nurse practitioner. MSN degree options also include forensic nursing with certification in investigative forensics, nursing informatics with certification in healthcare infor-mation management, and nurse executive via the dual MSN/MBA program (students interested in the dual MSN/MBA program must apply separately to the MBA program for admission consideration; acceptance into the MBA program is not guaranteed). Students may begin course work in graduate level nursing courses during the senior year of their undergraduate program of study, which may be credited toward both undergraduate elective courses and the graduate degree. Students can ordinarily expect to graduate with a BSN within four academic years. Following graduation with the BSN students may obtain an MSN degree through part-time study in approximately 2 years while gaining experience working as a registered nurse. In addition to fulfilling all requirements of a nursing major seeking the BSN, the nurse scholar must:1. Demonstrate minimal combined Math and Verbal SAT scores of 1220;2. Have attained at least a high school GPA of B+;3. Interview satisfactorily with a Department of Nursing and Health faculty member;4. Attain at least a B in all nursing and science courses during the undergraduate program of study.5. Maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher throughout the undergraduate curriculum;6.

The Accelerated BSN Program’s tuition is comprised of four, flat, term rates charged during the course of the approved 15-month Accelerated BSN curriculum. Refunds are based on the flat term tuition rate, and as such students withdraw-ing from one or more courses are not eligible for a prorated refund based on number of courses from which they withdrew. The Accelerated BSN degree tuition refund policy for the summer terms is as follows:• 100% refund of the term tuition – Any withdrawal received prior to the first day of class. The first class is defined as the first didactic/lecture held for the term.• 60% refund of the term tuition – Any withdrawal received after the first class day has commenced and prior to the fourth day of class in the term. Class is defined as the didac-tic/lecture portion of a course and does not include labora-tory or clinical days.• 0% refund of the term tuition – Any withdrawal received after the fourth day of class in the term.  Class is defined as the didactic/lecture portion of a course and does not include laboratory or clinical days.

Students become historically informed, independent thinkers who can critically and creatively engage in the discipline of philosophy and contemporary culture with a view to the common good.Philosophy Major Student Learning Outcomes Students who graduate from DeSales University with a major in philosophy demonstrate:1.  competence in the basic techniques of logic;2.  familiarity with major philosophers, texts, and arguments central to the Catholic intellectual tradition;3.  the ability to philosophize clearly, knowledgeably, and cogently in speech and in writing;4.  the ability to evaluate the values, beliefs, and assumptions of contemporary culture from a philosophical perspective.Philosophy Major Program Liberal arts education has traditionally placed strong emphasis on the importance of philosophical reflection for the formation of the human person. The philosophy program at DeSales University recognizes this fact and strongly promotes it. This program seeks to encourage the development of the intellectual and moral virtues, helping students not only to think clearly about reality and to know the greatest truths, but also to understand how to conform their practical activity to this knowledge; philosophy at DeSales regards the entire person in his or her humanity. This program is designed to enable students to see philosophy as a dialogue among persons seeking truth, and to promote personal participation in that search. The philosophical insights that result from this search should help students to discriminate and relate the different kinds of knowledge that make up the sum of human learning, and hence enable them to interpret their study of the sciences and the humanities in their sig-nificance for the human race. This training takes place within the Christian intellectual tradition and DeSales University’s dedication to Salesian spirituality and Christian Humanism.Philosophy Major Requirements To graduate with a BA degree in philosophy, students must complete a 12-course program, designed in conjunction with the philosophy faculty, so as to address the problems of the four major periods of philosophy in our Western tradition. The following courses are required for all philosophy majors: 1. Philosophical Thinking ("
PL 400," or "
PL 410,")6. One course from the Contemporary period ("
PL 438,"-479)8. Independent Study in Philosophy ("
PL 499,") In addition, students majoring in philosophy are required to complete four “controlled electives.” These courses, in philoso-phy or related fields, are chosen by the student, with the prior approval of the philosophy faculty.DeSales Institute of Philosophy and Religion, Bangalore, India BA in philosophy at the DeSales Institute of Philosophy and Religion In cooperation with the DeSales Institute of Philosophy and Religion in Bangalore, India, DeSales University offers a BA in philosophy for students enrolled at that institution.
