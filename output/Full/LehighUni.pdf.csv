All students have anobligation to read and be familiar with the Student Handbook, the Codeof Conduct, and the other policies contained therein.In Bethlehem, An Educational TraditionLehigh University shares in the historical heritage of Bethlehem, eventhough, having been founded in 1865, it is a relative newcomer. Thefact that Lehigh was established in Bethlehem reflects the tradition ofeducation established by the community’s first settlers thirty years beforethe founding of the nation.The first Moravians were among the many German religious sects thatcame to the New World, and especially to Pennsylvania, during theearly 1700s. But unlike William Penn, who established his sylvania as anew land where he might hold his Quaker beliefs away from England’soppression, the Moravians came as missionaries with the intent ofconverting the Indians to Christianity. For this purpose they settled theLehigh Valley.The early Moravians were industrious. Their first building, the GemeinHaus (community house) was completed in 1741. This building standstoday, one of thirty-nine remarkably preserved pre-Revolutionary Warbuildings constructed by the Moravian settlers and in continuous useever since by the Moravian community. Many of these buildings arelocated on Church St., west of the City Center; industrial buildings arelocated in the 18th Century Industrial Area in the Monocacy Creek valleywest of the business district.The leader of the Moravians was Count Nicholas von Zinzendorf ofDresden. He arrived in the settlement in time for their observance ofChristmas Eve in 1741 and gave the settlement the name Bethlehem—“house of bread”.The settlers built high-quality structures of stone, demonstratingprinciples of engineering that were not generally used elsewhere. Theywere interested in music, and established the first symphony orchestrain America. In 1748, the settlement had a fourteen-man orchestra. Thecommunity’s first organ was built in 1757 by John Gottlob Klemm. Themusical tradition, including the trombone choir, continues today, perhapsmost visibly in the Bach Choir of Bethlehem, whose yearly Bach Festivalis held in the university’s Packer Memorial Church. In 1985, the 300thanniversary of the birth of Johann Sebastian Bach was observed.Zinzendorf envisioned Bethlehem as the center for manufacturing;outlying Moravian settlements, such as Nazareth, Pa., would beprimarily devoted to agriculture. On October 15, 1742, a large barn was“raised” with the help of most of the residents. Three months later a gristmill at the community spring produced the first flour. In 1758, the SunInn was built along Main St., a haven for travelers. Reconstruction ofthe picturesque inn was completed in 1982, and it now operates as acommunity center and restaurant.Zinzendorf’s determination that Bethlehem would be a major industrialcenter was assisted by the completion in 1755 of the water works, thefirst public utility in the New World.The Moravian dedication to education was an extension of thephilosophy of John Amos Comenius, who had written, “Everyone oughtto receive a universal education.” The Moravian educational institutionsthat continue today, including Moravian Academy and Moravian College,stem from this tradition.The Moravians, although avowedly opposed to war, found theircommunity pressed into service as a hospital when Washington’s troopsbivouacked at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777-78. Washingtoncame to the community once, and many other Continental Army officerswere visitors.The Sun Inn was also used as a hospital during the war; among itspatients was an aristocratic renegade from France, Marie Joseph PaulIves Gilbert Motier, the Marquis de la Fayette. Lafayette had come toassist the Continental Army aboard his own ship, the “Victory.” Fiftyyears later a college in Easton was named in his honor and it becameLehigh’s traditional football rival.The first bridge across the Lehigh River was built in 1794. It wasreplaced in 1816, but the latter was destroyed by a flood in 1841. In1759, the turnpike (toll road) over South Mountain, generally along theroute of the present Wyandotte St. hill, was opened. The present Hill-to-Hill Bridge was built some fifty years ago.“Black gold.” During the late 18th century, anthracite was found inthe mountains north of the Lehigh Valley. In 1818, the Lehigh CoalCo. and the Lehigh Navigation Co. were formed, one to mine theanthracite on the upper Lehigh River, the other to transport it down riverto metropolitan markets.The Lehigh River was difficult to navigate. Consequently, in 1829 theLehigh Canal was completed from Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe),through Bethlehem to Easton, where it connected with the DelawareCanal. During the 1840s, iron mines were opened in the area, andseveral blast furnaces, fueled by coal, were in operation. Zinc ore, wasfound in neighboring Upper Saucon Township. In the 1850s Asa Packerbuilt the Lehigh Valley Railroad. These origins eventually led to theheavy industry that continues in the Lehigh Valley today.When Asa Packer founded Lehigh University in 1865, one of hisobjectives was to make possible broadly based education for youngpeople of the region, combining the technical skills needed to run theflourishing industry of the Lehigh Valley with a liberal education.In addition to its role as a steel-making center, Bethlehem today is amajor tourist attraction. The Moravian community sets up an elaboratenativity scene and the entire city is decorated with lighting during theholiday period. The Moravian tradition of a single candle (now electric) ineach window is widely observed.Atop South Mountain is a steel tower known as the Star of Bethlehem.During the holiday period, the star’s hundreds of bulbs create a 95-foot-high star that can be seen for many miles. The star was the gift to thecommunity of Marion Brown Grace, wife of Eugene Gifford Grace, thesteel magnate and president of the university board of trustees.The community of Bethlehem has a population of approximately 78,000persons with segments from a variety of nations who retain traditions oftheir country of origin.There are five principal independent colleges in the Lehigh Valleybesides Lehigh. They are Lafayette, DeSales University, Moravian,Muhlenberg, and Cedar Crest. A cooperative program is maintained thatallows cross-registration for courses as well as shared cultural events.There are also two community colleges in the area.In August 1984, Bethlehem held its first Musikfest, a 10-day annualfestival that features a variety of musical performances and ethnic foods.An instant success, Musikfest was the brainchild of Jeffrey A. Parks, alawyer and 1970 Lehigh graduate.16         University ResourcesUniversity ResourcesLehigh University offers a variety of resources to support the campuscommunity.Library and Technology ServicesThe exponential growth and increasing sophistication of informationtechnology offer new and exciting opportunities for enhanced teaching,learning, and research.

They carry no regular academic credit, but participantscan often earn some form of continuing education credentials.Lehigh continuing education programs are designed to meet specificneeds. Contents, schedules, and timing are adapted to effectivelyserve the audiences for which they have been developed. Apart fromprograms presented on the Lehigh campus, a number of seminars areavailable for “in-house” presentation to organizations on a contractbasis. For more information about these programs, contact theappropriate department or research center.Lehigh University 2018-2019       23Undergraduate StudiesA listing of undergraduate and graduate courses offered by LehighUniversity can be found in the Courses, Programs, and Curricula section(p. 53), under each departmental heading. For purposes of record, allapproved courses are listed. It must be understood, however, that theofferings in any given semester are contingent upon a number of factors,including student needs as determined at the time of registration.CREDIT HOURSEach course is designated  a credit value of the course in terms ofsemester hours (“credit hours”).COURSE NUMBERINGThe course numbering system specifies which courses can beapplied to the program of study as the student progresses toward theundergraduate or graduate degree. In general, the numbering series isas follows:•0-99. Courses primarily for freshmen or sophomores. Not availablefor graduate credit.•100-199. Intermediate-level undergraduate courses. Not open tofreshmen except on petition. Not available for graduate credit.•200-299. Advanced undergraduate courses. Courses in the Collegeof Business and Economics and specific departments as noted in thelistings are open to freshmen and sophomores only with permission.Not available for graduate credit in the major field.•300-399. Advanced undergraduate courses. Same as 200-299, butavailable for graduate credit in major field.•400-499. Graduate-level courses, open to undergraduates only bypetition.PROVISIONAL COURSESEach instructional department is authorized to offer provisional courses,or those offered on a trial basis, as well as special opportunities courses.Such courses can become a permanent part of the university curriculum.These courses are numbered, as is appropriate, 95-98 . . . 195-198, . . .295-298, . . . 395-398, for a maximum of two years.PREREQUISITESAcademic preparation required for admission to courses is indicatedunder “prerequisites” included at the end of each course description.Prerequisites are stated in most cases for purposes of convenience interms of Lehigh courses. Academic status required for admission, wherenumbering does not fully describe this status, is also indicated under“prerequisites.”A student who does not have the status (e.g., sophomore standing)or the academic preparation set forth as prerequisites may requestspecial consideration.  A student may obtain online permission fromthe designated college or department officer or demonstrate academicwork completed elsewhere meets the prerequisites listed.  Each studentis responsible to make sure they meet and maintain all conditions ofprerequisite for their coursework prior to the start of classes.  If a studentfails to meet a prerequisite after registration for a given course, thecollege dean's office, Registration & Academic Services, and/or theinstructor may take action to drop the student from a course with unmetprerequisites.In a few cases, co-requisites are indicated. In such instances the co-requisite course is taken in the same semester.INFORMATION LIMITSThe course descriptions are intended to guide the student in selectingappropriate courses. For reasons of space, descriptions are brief. Inmost cases, courses will have a significantly broader scope than thetopics listed in the description. In some courses, material may changefrom what is described. If there is doubt concerning the appropriatenessof any course for the individual’s educational objectives, it is suggestedthat the student confer with the adviser.ABBREVIATIONSWhenever possible, course listings contain information indicating whatrequirements the course satisfies, the semester or semesters in which itis offered, and the name of the scheduled instructor or instructors.While all information herein is subject to change, the information isincluded to serve as a guide in the selection of appropriate courses thatbest fulfill the student’s academic requirements and personal goals.The symbols following course descriptions for some College of Arts andSciences courses include:GC. Courses that meet the Global Citizenship program requirements.HU. Courses that meet the Humanities distribution requirements.NS. Courses that meet the Science distribution requirements.SS. Courses that meet the Social Science distribution requirements.MA. Courses that meet the Mathematical distribution requirements.ND. Not designated to meet distribution requirements.The symbols following course descriptions for some College ofEngineering and Applied Science courses include:ES. This code plus the following number indicates that the coursesatisfies a number of hours of engineering science requirements forABET accreditation.Graduation RequirementsStudents are expected to maintain regular progress toward thebaccalaureate degree by carrying the “normal” course load—between12 and 18 credit hours each semester. Each student is expected tocomplete the baccalaureate degree by attending four consecutiveyears and eight semesters. They may, however, wish to acceleratethe pace toward graduation by using advanced placement credits,summer session study, and receiving credit for courses throughexamination. Students will have a limit of 8 calendar years to completethe requirements for the bachelor’s degree. Students may petition theCommittee on Standing of Students (SOS) for up to a one-year leave ofabsence for special circumstances beyond their control.Students in good academic standing earn their degrees by meetingthe requirements of their specific degree curriculum as well as generaluniversity requirements. Students are expected to satisfy the credit-hourrequirements of their chosen curricula. Students should confer with theiradvisors on matters related to curriculum.Basic military science credit hours are in addition to the credit hoursspecified in the curricula. A maximum of six credit hours of advancedmilitary science courses may be applied toward the baccalaureatedegree.Undergraduate Residency RequirementTo be eligible to receive a Lehigh baccalaureate degree, the candidatemust have completed either a minimum of 90 credit hours, or 60 of thelast 75 credit hours at the University or in residency programs.Five-Year, Two-Bachelor-Degree ProgramsThe university’s five-year, two-degree programs enable a student toreceive two bachelor degrees upon completion of five years of study.The civil engineering and earth and environmental sciences programthat affords two bachelor degrees, and the electrical engineering andengineering physics two-degree program are examples of programsin the College of Arts and Sciences and the P.C. Rossin College ofEngineering and Applied Science.Some five-year, two-degree programs appear in the description ofcourses under Arts-Engineering and Five-Year Programs. It is possibleto arrange for a dual bachelor degree program even after studying atLehigh for some time. Engineering students, for example, who decideat any stage of study that they wish to meet the requirements for boththe bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degree may sometimescomplete the combined requirements in five years if the decision ismade before the third year.A student entering Lehigh to obtain a second bachelor’s degree, thoseLehigh students who wish to declare a second degree in anothercollege, or students wishing to pursue both a B.A. and a B.S. degreewithin the College of Arts and Sciences must have a minimum of 30additional credit hours beyond the first degree credit-hour requirementsin order to qualify for the second degree. All of the 30 additional credit24         Advisementhours must be taken at Lehigh or in Lehigh residency programs. Allspecial second degree programs must be approved by the dean of thecollege in which the degree is to be offered and the Standing of StudentsCommittee.Several ways exist for students to obtain two degrees in five years ofstudy. See listings under ARTS-Engineering; Civil Engineering and Earthand Environmental Sciences; Electrical Engineering and EngineeringPhysics; and College of Education.AdvisementThe academic advisor is one of the most valuable resources in theeducational process, not only to assist in making academic selectionsto match the student’s particular background, interests, and futureobjectives, but also to identify program options, to work out an academicpace, and to develop career planning strategies. The advisor willhelp to identify other resources and support systems available at theuniversity, such as the Center for Academic Success, Counseling andPsychological Services, and the Center for Career and ProfessionalDevelopment.Every undergraduate in the College of Arts and Sciences and the P.C.Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science is assigned a facultyadvisor upon matriculation. This advisor will usually change when thestudent selects a major or program.Every undergraduate in the College of Business and Economics(CBE) is assigned to a professional advisor in the CBE UndergraduatePrograms Office. Once a major is declared, a faculty mentor from themajor department will be assigned for more in-depth conversationsabout major courses and career paths.Pre-professional advisors, such as Pre-law, Pre-medicine and Pre-MBAare located in the Center for Career and Professional Development.Guide to Academic Rules and RegulationsOver the years, the University has adopted numerous rules andregulations. Some of the principal rules and regulations are given hereso that currently enrolled and potential undergraduates and graduatestudents will be apprised of what is expected of them, and what they canexpect of the University.This section concerns academic regulations. Additionalregulations can be found in the Lehigh Student Handbook (http://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/handbook), and there is a comprehensivestatement of all policies in the publication Rules and Procedures of theFaculty. The Rules and Procedures of the Faculty can be found onlineon the Provost’s website.Eligibility for DegreeIn order to be graduated, a candidate for a baccalaureate degree mustachieve a minimum cumulative average of 2.00.To be eligible for a degree, a student must not only have completed allof the scholastic requirements for the degree, but also must have paidall university fees, and in addition all bills for the rental of rooms in theresidence halls or in other university housing facilities. Payment alsomust have been made for damage to university property or equipment,or for any other indebtedness for scholarship loans or for loans fromtrust funds administered by the university.Responsibility for meeting academic requirements.Each student is solely responsible for his or her progress towardmeeting specific requirements for graduation.  Academic advisers,department chairs and the associate deans staff are available to assistthe student.  It is strongly recommended that the student specificallyconsult with his or her adviser prior to the senior year to ascertaineligibility for the degree for which he or she desires to qualify and todetermine that all program and hours requirements are met.A student degree audit (http://go.lehigh.edu/degreeaudit) is available24/7 via the online student information system for all undergraduatestudents. Students should review their audit before registering foreach semester, including each in their senior year. The degree auditis provided as a tool to aid in advising and to track academic progressand degree completion. The student degree audit attempts to note allprogram deficiencies based on real-time academic history and currentregistration information. However, each student is responsible for thecompletion of all graduation requirements as outlined in the Universitycatalog.Final date for completion of requirements.For graduation, all requirements, scholastic and financial, must besatisfied no later than the Friday preceding the degree award date.Application for DegreeCandidates for graduation on University Day in May must apply onor before February 1; candidates for graduation in September applyon or before July 1; candidates for graduation in January apply on orbefore October 1. Students must apply online using the Banner StudentInformation System.Failure to apply by the dates mentioned debars the candidate fromreceiving the degree as of the next consecutive graduation date. If apetition for late filing is granted prior to the deadline to complete allrequirements, a fee is assessed.Undergraduate Credit and GradesA “semester hour,” used interchangeably with “credit hour,” is a courseunit normally involving three to four hours of student effort per weekduring one semester. This includes both in-class contact hours and out-of-class activities. The major parameters influencing the in-class/out-of-class division include the mode of instruction and the level of the course.Definitions of GradesCourse grades are A, A–, B+, B, B–, C+, C, C–, D+, D, D–, P, F, N,X, Z. The meaning of each grade is as follows: A, A–, excellent; B+,B, and B–, good; C+ and C, competent; C–, continuation competency(the student has achieved the level of proficiency needed for the courseto satisfy prerequisite requirements); D+, D, and D–, passing, butperformance is not adequate to take any subsequent course whichhas this course as a prerequisite.  P, pass-fail grading with a gradeequivalent to D– or higher; F, failing; N, incomplete; X, absent from thefinal examination; Z, absent from the final examination and incomplete.Grades are weighted as follows: A, 4.0; A-, 3.7; B+, 3.3; B, 3.0; B-, 2.7;C+, 2.3; C, 2.0; C-, 1.7; D+, 1.3; D, 1.0; D-, 0.7; F, 0.  Quality points foreach course are assigned according to the number of credit hours in thecourse.Other symbols used for courses on student records are: W, withdrawn;CR, credit allowed; NCR – no credit.  NR is used when no final gradewas received from the instructor of record by the final grade submissiondeadline.Grades in the range of A through D–, P, and CR may be credited towardbaccalaureate degrees within the limits of program requirements.Grades of F, N, X, Z, W, and NR cannot be credited toward the degree.Grades of W do not count as hours attempted.Courses in which grades of D+,D, D-,F, NCR, W, NR, N, X, or Z arerecorded do not meet prerequisite requirements.   The student mayrequest to waive a prerequisite. Upon presentation of evidence ofsubstantially equivalent preparation, and with the approval of theinstructor of the course, the teaching department chair and the chair ofthe major department, the prerequisite may be waived.The grade N (grade),  may be used to indicate that one or morecourse requirements (e.g., course report) have not been completed.It is the obligation of the student to explain, to the satisfaction of theinstructor, that there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness oremergency) that justify the use of the N grade. If the instructor feels theN grade is justified, he or she assigns a grade of N supplemented bya parenthetical letter grade, (e.g., NF).  In such cases, the instructorcalculates the parenthetical grade by assigning an F (or zero score) forany incomplete work unless he or she has informed the class in writingat the beginning of the course of a substitute method for determining thedefault grade.In each case in which an N grade is given, the course instructor willprovide written notification to the department chairperson stating thename of the student receiving the grade, the reason for the incompleteLehigh University 2018-2019       25work, the work to be done for the removal of the N grade and the gradefor the work already completed.A student who incurs an N grade in any course is required to completethe work for the course by the fifth day of instruction in the next regularsemester. The N grade will be converted into the parenthetical gradeafter the tenth day of instruction in the next regular semester, followingreceipt of the N grade, unless a petition to request an extension hasbeen approved, or the instructor has previously changed the grade usingthe removal-of-incomplete procedure. The parenthetical grade will bedropped from the transcript after the assignment of the course grade.The grade X (grade) is used to indicate absence from the finalexamination when all other course requirements have been met.  In such cases, the instructor calculates the parenthetical grade byassigning an F (or zero score) for the missing final exam. The X grademay be removed by a make-up examination if the absence was forgood cause (e.g., illness or other emergency). To be eligible for a make-up exam the student must submit a petition to the Dean of Students. If the student fails to petition, or if the petition is not granted, or if thestudent fails to appear for the scheduled make-up examination, thenthe X grade will be converted into the parenthetical grade after the firstscheduled make-up examination following the receipt of the X grade. Ifthe petition is granted and the final examination is taken, the X grade willbe changed by the instructor using the make-up examination proceduresand the parenthetical grade will be dropped from the transcript.Where valid reasons exist for not taking the make-up examination at thescheduled time, the student may petition for a later examination with afee.The grade Z (grade) is used to indicate both absence from the finalexamination and incomplete course requirements.  The instructorcalculates the parenthetical grade using an F (or zero score) for the finalexamination and either an F (or zero score) for incomplete coursework.A student who incurs an Z grade in any course is required to completethe work for the course by the fifth day of instruction in the next regularsemester. The Z grade will be converted into the parenthetical gradeafter the tenth day of instruction in the next regular semester followingreceipt of the Z grade.  In no case shall the deadline for completion ofthe work be later than the last day of classes in the first full semester inresidence (except summer) following receipt of the Z grade.N, X and Z grades do not count as hours attempted and are not used incomputations of cumulative averages.Where failure to complete coursework prevents the student from takingthe make-up examination at the scheduled time, the student may petitionthe Committee on the Standing of Students for a later examination.Grades that were originally assigned an N, X, or Z grade, whenconverted or computed, will be noted with an ‘*’ asterisk prefix.If no grade is received by Registration & Academic Services beforestudent grades are officially posted, a grade of NR will be assigned. It isthe responsibility of the faculty member who failed to submit a grade toresolve the situation. If a correct grade is not submitted or the situation isnot otherwise resolved then the NR grade will be converted to a grade ofF on the tenth day of instruction of the next academic year semester.Scholastic Averages and ProbationScholastic requirements for undergraduate students are expressedin terms of the cumulative grade point average (GPA)—the weightedaverage of all grades received in residence or at institutions specificallyapproved for grade transfer. The cumulative GPA is computed at theend of each semester and the second summer session.  The Universitytranscript reports a student's cumulative GPA to two decimal places.When considering cumulative GPA for graduation honors and academicstanding, the University truncates the GPA to two decimal places,without rounding.All undergraduates are required to maintain a 2.0 cumulative average,the minimum average required for graduation, to remain in goodacademic standing. Students who do not meet this GPA requirement willbe placed on scholastic probation.Non-degree students with less than 12 credit hours attempted will nothave their progress evaluated until they earn at least 7 credit hourstotal.  A non-degree student with two or more F grades is eligible to bereviewed by the Committee on the Standing of Students, and may beplaced on probation or dropped for poor scholarship at the committee’sdiscretion.Any undergraduate student who achieves a 1.69 or lower cumulativegrade point average in a given term, or who fails more than eight hoursof coursework, is eligible to be reviewed by the Committee on theStanding of Students, and may be placed on academic probation.SCHOLASTIC PROBATIONStudents on scholastic probation are ineligible for (a) intercollegiatecompetition and other extracurricular activities in which they publiclyrepresent the university; (b) major office (elective or appointive) in anyuniversity organization; and (c) other activities which require more timethan should be diverted from primary purposes by students whoseacademic survival is at risk. The Dean of Students shall monitor andenforce this ruling.REMOVAL FROM PROBATIONStudents are removed from probation at such time as they meet thestandard listed above, effective at the end of any semester or thesecond summer session.DROPPED FOR POOR SCHOLARSHIPA student who makes a 2.2 GPA or better in the probationary semesterbut fails to meet the standards stipulated is continued on probation foranother semester. A student who makes less than a 2.2 GPA in theprobationary semester and fails to meet the standards stipulated above,is dropped for poor scholarship.If a student goes on scholastic probation for a second (although notnecessarily consecutive) term, a review by the Committee on theStanding of Students will determine whether the student will continue onscholastic probation or be dropped for poor scholarship.Academic GrievancesStudents may seek redress of various grievances within the Universitythrough the agencies and procedures described under this heading. The Associate Dean of Students is available to discuss with students thenature of their grievances and to advise them on the recourse open tothem.Redress of Academic GrievancesAn undergraduate (or group of undergraduates) with a complaint arisingout of any course should bring the complaint first to the instructor ofthe course in which the grievance occurred.  If, after meeting with theinstructor, the student feels that satisfaction has not been received,the complaint should then be taken to the instructor’s immediatesuperior, and so on up the line, from the instructor of a section to thefaculty member in charge of all sections of the course, the departmentchairperson, and the dean of the college.If the student (or group of students) believes the grievance should notgo to the instructor, he or she should take it to the instructor’s immediatesuperior.  In case of doubt as to whom to bring the grievance, thestudent should consult the dean of the college or the Dean of StudentsOffice.A graduate student (or group of students) with a complaint arising outof any course or research activity should bring the complaint first to theresponsible faculty member.  If, after meeting with the faculty member,the student wishes to pursue the matter further, the complaint shouldthen be taken to the department chairperson, and the dean of thecollege.If the student (or group of students) believes the grievance should notgo to the faculty member, he or she should take it to the departmentchairperson.  In case of doubt as to whom to  ring the brievance thestudent should consult the dean of the college, the Dean of Studentsoffice or the University Ombudsperson.Right of Appeal of Academic GrievancesA student failing to gain satisfaction in the manner described abovemay appeal by petition to the Committee on Standing of Students or forgraduate students, the Committee on Standing of Graduate Students.26         Course WithdrawalIn general, a student has the privilege of petition about any academicmatter of concern to him or her in the University.  Petition forms areavailable in the Associate Dean of Students office, the dean’s officesand Registration & Academic Services.Course WithdrawalA student dropping a course within the first ten days of the semester(three days for summer sessions) will have no record of the course onthe transcript. A student dropping all courses for which he or she isregistered is considered to be withdrawn from the university (p. 26).A student who withdraws from a course with the approval of his/heradvisor and section instructor after the tenth day of instruction andbefore the end of the eleventh week of instruction will have a grade of“W” assigned to the course.An Add/Drop form signed by the student’s advisor must besubmitted to Registration & Academic Services before thedeadlines noted above to be official. No course may be droppedafter the eleventh week of classes during a term as noted on theUniversity Calendar.University WithdrawalA student withdrawing from the university (dropping all courses during agiven term) must submit the withdrawal request to the dean of studentsoffice. Withdrawal after registration day will be noted on the academictranscript by assigning a grade of “W” to all courses. The date of thewithdrawal will be noted on the academic transcript for a withdrawal atany time during the term.A student who reduces his or her course load below the minimumrequired for full time status,  but does not withdraw from the university,becomes a part-time student for the rest of that semester. Some areasaffected by part-time status are financial aid, athletic eligibility, veteransaffairs, immigration status, insurance and loan deferment.Undergraduate Leave of AbsenceEach student is expected to complete the baccalaureate degree byattending Lehigh for four consecutive academic years. Once a studentwho has matriculated at Lehigh chooses to deviate from this attendancepattern, a revised degree plan, coordinated with his or her advisor andassociate dean, must be submitted. Students must submit a request fora Leave of Absence through the Dean of Students. The form must besigned by the student’s advisor and the associate dean of the college,and the completed form must be submitted prior to the start of anysubsequent enrollment at another college or university.Current Lehigh University students are prohibited from concurrentenrollment at any other college or university. Courses taken concurrentlywill not be eligible to apply towards a Lehigh degree. An exception ismade for cross registration at another LVAIC institution.Students cannot assume that a leave will be granted to study at anothercollege or university (this policy does not apply for study abroad throughthe auspices of Lehigh Abroad or LVAIC programs). The programof study and reason for the leave must be approved by the SOScommittee.If unapproved leaves are taken, students are declared as non-returningand must apply for readmission through the Dean of Students if theywish to re-enroll. Courses taken at another college or university while onan unapproved leave will not be permitted to transfer toward a LehighUniversity baccalaureate degree.In addition, students taking an unauthorized leave of absence must beaware that their eligibility for student aid is jeopardized.Any student who is uncertain about attending a future fall or spring termat Lehigh University is urged to discuss the matter with the Dean ofStudents Office prior to taking any action to withdraw or attend anothercollege or university.Students may take courses at another institution during a summer termwithout requesting an academic leave of absence. They should checkwith Registration & Academic Services for limitations and processes fortransfer course approval prior to taking the courses.Release of Final GradesGrades for undergraduate students are available online as soonas possible following the deadline for reporting of grades using theBanner Student Information System. Undergraduate students whorequire a printed grade report must submit the request in writing toRegistration & Academic Services each term. Instructors may developtheir own policies for release of unofficial reports of academic progressto individual students, or to their advisers, deans, or financial aid officers,on a need-to-know basis, including early release of unofficial final coursegrades. Any such policies must respect the rights of students privacy.Repeating of CoursesA student may repeat a course only twice --  a total of three attempts. Withdrawal from a course counts as an attempt (effective Fall 2017).If a course is repeated the final grade received upon repetition of thecourse is counted in the cumulative average.  Only the most recentgrade and the credit associated with that course and grade countstowards degree requirements.  The original grade and associated credithours received will be excluded from the cumulative average and degreerequirements. A grade that was originally received in a course may not be changed byrepeating the course under the pass-fail option.Students repeating a course that has been graded C or better may notoverload (greater than eighteen credits) during that term.For deletion of a grade from the cumulative average after repeating acourse, a student must repeat the identical course with a final grade atLehigh.All instances of repeated courses are displayed on the student'sacademic transcript regardless of repeated status.  Students areresponsible for determining any academic or financial implications forrepeating courses.Pass-Fail Systems for UndergraduatesSTUDENT OPTION SYSTEMThe pass-fail grading option is intended to encourage sophomorelevel (and above) undergraduate students to take challenging coursesoutside the major field.  Courses numbered below 100 are generally notavailable for optional pass/fail grading system.  However, the Collegeoffering a course may establish a petition process to determine, ona case-by-case basis, whether a student is allowed to take a coursenumbered below 100 with pass-fail grading.  Courses 400 and above arenot available for the optional pass/fail grading system. A student may register for no more than one course pass-fail numberedabove 100 and below 400 in any one semester.  Students shouldcheck the pass/fail restrictions for specific courses. He or she maytake a maximum of six courses pass-fail per undergraduate career ifthe student is on a four-year program, or a maximum of eight coursesper undergraduate career with a five-year, two-degree program. If astudent changes a course from pass-fail grading to regular grading, thatcourse will still count toward the maximum number of courses takenpass-fail during the student’s undergraduate career.  The optional pass/fail option may not be used for major or minor subject credit towardgraduation or for distribution requirements.Each college faculty shall decide under what conditions and whichcourses or categories of courses throughout the university may be takenfor pass-fail credit by students registered in that college, except forcourses designated specifically for pass-fail grading. Each college shallkeep the educational policy committee advised of changes in its rules.A student designates the course(s) to be taken pass-fail normally atpreregistration but not later than the fifteenth day of instruction in aregular semester.  Summer/Winter session deadlines are proratedaccording to the length of the session. Prior to this deadline, thestudent may transfer from pass-fail to regular grading, or vice-versa,without penalty. The courses designated for pass-fail grading bythe student require the written acknowledgment of the academicadviser.  Retroactive changes to/from pass-fail grading are strictlyprohibited.Lehigh University 2018-2019       27Since the instructor giving the course is not officially notified whichstudents are taking the course pass-fail, a regular letter grade isreported to Registration & Academic Services for the pass-fail students.The student record reflects “P” for reported letter grades from A throughD–, and “F” for a reported letter grade of F.Under this system, the student surrenders his or her equity to lettergrades of A through D–, except as specified below. A grade of Papplies to the student’s graduation requirements but is not used in thecomputation of the cumulative average; whereas an F grade is includedin the cumulative grade point average.Acceptance into a program that does not allow pass-fail grading in acourse is the only valid reason for converting the grade for a completedcourse from pass-fail to a letter grade.  If a student changes his orher program such that a course previously taken for pass-fail gradingis not allowed for pass-fail grading in the new program, the studentmust submit a petition to the Committee on the Standing of Studentsrequesting acceptance by the new program, or substitution of theoriginal letter grade submitted, or the substitution of another course. The recommendation of the advisor must accompany the petition.Courses that cannot be taken pass/fail and are above the 100 level:•Anth 140 (CogS 140, 5(610) 758-6099global (https://global.lehigh.edu/esl).lehigh.edu/eslThe International Center for Academic and Professional English (ICAPE)at Lehigh University offers a variety of year-round courses and privatetutoring for undergraduate and graduate students who would liketo improve their academic English skills and their understanding ofAmerican pragmatics and culture.ENGLISH DEPARTMENT CREDIT COURSESUndergraduate students who are non-native speakers of English (andthose who speak varieties of English other than standard AmericanEnglish) may be required to register for 5.Admission to Graduate StudyA graduate of an accredited college or university may be consideredfor admission to graduate study. The decision to admit a studentrests with the applicant’s major department and stands for one yearfollowing the first semester for which admission was offered. If morethan one year elapses, the prospective student’s department reservesthe right to reconsider the original offer. Students wishing to pursuean interdisciplinary degree may, in some cases, apply to the programdirectly.Applications for admission may be completed online at https://www.applyweb.com/lehighg/index.ftlAn applicant may enter the graduate program as a student in thefollowing categories: regular, associate, or non-degree. Except forqualified Lehigh undergraduates, only those who have been admittedofficially by the graduate program office of an appropriate college or bya department in one of the categories above may register for graduatecourses or take them for credit.REGULAR GRADUATE STUDENTSOnly regular graduate students are candidates for graduate degrees.Applications for admission as a regular graduate student must be filedby July 15 for the following fall semester or by December 1 for the springsemester. Regular graduate students wishing to begin in the summermust apply before April 30. Certain departments or programs haveearlier deadlines. Applicants should consult their respective departmentsor their dean's office. In order to be considered for admission as aregular graduate student, the applicant must satisfy at least one of thefollowing conditions: have an undergraduate GPA of at least 2.75 out of4.00 (note: College of Education GPA minimum is 3.0); have an averageof at least 3.00 for the last two semesters of undergraduate study;have a graduate grade point average of at least 3.00 for a minimum oftwelve credit hours of graduate work completed at other institutions; orhave successfully satisfied the probationary conditions as an associategraduate student (discussed below). Satisfying one of these conditionsis necessary for admission as a regular graduate student but may not bethe only condition required.Graduate students who are non-native speakers of English are requiredto show English proficiency.  This may be done with the Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language Internet-Based Test (TOEFL iBT) orthe International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Pleasecontact your department or program of choice about which test(s) areacceptable and for the required acceptance scores.The English proficiency requirement may be waived if a student hasobtained a degree from an English language university in an Englishspeaking country and demonstrates effective English language skills.Applicants should consult with their respective departments or programof choice to confirm whether they are eligible for a waiver.Individual departments may evaluate their candidates for admissionaccording to higher standards and additional criteria. Students seekingadmission to Professional Certification Programs may have to meetadditional requirements to comply with Pennsylvania Department ofEducation Regulations. Departments should be consulted for informationregarding required examinations for admission. For example, candidatesfor the MBA program are required to take the Graduate ManagementAdmissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Exam.  In somecases, GRE subject tests are required.Lehigh University 2018-2019       33Admission of a student to graduate standing is executed through theOffice of Graduate Studies in each college or the respective dean’soffice. Credentials for admission to counseling psychology and schoolpsychology programs and to all College of Education doctoral programsare acted upon only once a year.Completed applications accompanied by requests for financial aid mustbe submitted by January 15 for admission in the following fall semester.(Some departments have earlier deadlines.) Applications received afterthe deadline will be considered on a space-available basis.ASSOCIATE GRADUATE STUDENTSAssociate graduate student status may be offered to applicants whoapply but fail to qualify for regular graduate student status. Onlyassociate student applications will be considered during the lateadmissions period between the end of the regular admission periodand the first day of classes. Applicants for associate status may submitunofficial rather than official transcripts; letters of recommendation arenot required at that time. However, Registration & Academic Serviceswill require an official final transcript before grades are released. Certaindepartments or programs have earlier deadlines and more stringentrequirements. Applicants should consult their respective departments.Associate graduate students who are admitted during the late admissionperiod and who clearly qualify for admission as regular graduatestudents may petition for regular status after classes begin if allcredentials are in order. There is no late application fee. Individualdepartments may have more stringent requirements.Associate graduate students are allowed to take up to nine credits ofcoursework numbered 300 or higher before they must petition for regularstudent status. In order to be granted regular student status, they musthave completed those nine credits with at most one final course markbelow B-. Associate graduate students receiving a final course marklower than a C- will be dropped from the program. Students should notethat individual departments may impose more rigorous probationarystandards. For example, the College of Education has more stringentprobationary standards; please see the handbook for details.When the probationary period of nine credit hours is completed,associate graduate students must petition for regular student status inorder to enroll for additional coursework. Such a petition requires thesubmission of any regular admission documents not already on file.Courses completed during a successful probationary period may counttoward a graduate degree if they are part of an approved program.NON-DEGREE STUDENTSStudents who do not wish to enter a degree program may seekadmission with non-degree status. In this case, the prospective studentcompletes an abbreviated application form which can be completedonline at https://www.applyweb.com/lehighg/index.ftlThe admissions criteria for non-degree graduate students are: 1) abachelor’s degree from an approved institution with an overall gradepoint average of at least 3.0; (applicants with undergraduate GPAsbelow 3.0 may be admitted with the approval of the department inwhich they wish to take courses;) or 2) evidence that the applicantis presently a student in good standing in an appropriate graduateprogram at an approved institution; or 3) evidence that the applicanthas received an appropriate graduate or other advanced degree froman approved institution. In addition, non-native English speakers arerequired to demonstrate English language skills equal to those requiredof degree-seeking students and are held to the same English proficiencystandards.Admission decisions for non-degree students are made by the deanof the appropriate college or other responsible official designated byhim/her for this purpose. The signature of the designated official on theapplication and registration forms confers admission to the non-degreegraduate student status. Informal transcripts will be accepted for initialadmission, but formal transcripts must be on record before the studentcan receive any transcript or grade report from the university or enroll foradditional courses.Non-degree OptionsIn addition to degree programs, there are two non-degree options:1) Regular non-degree and 2) Non-degree for external certification.Regular non-degree admission is for students who wish to take up to 12credits of graduate coursework without seeking a degree. Non-degreefor external certification students are admitted to pursue coursework forthe purpose of obtaining certification through an external accreditingagency. These students complete coursework for the appropriatecertification, with the number of credits being dictated by the externalaccrediting agency. Given this external control of credit requirements,the number of credits will vary and will typically exceed the 12-creditlimit for regular non-degree students. A student admitted as non-degreemay subsequently be admitted to a degree program, but would needto submit all components required for admissions consideration bythat degree program.  Students should consult their respective collegedean's office for proper procedure.GRADUATE COURSE AUDITINGWith the permission of the departmental chair, graduate students canbe admitted to a course as auditors. This course will not count for credittowards any graduate degree, and may not subsequently be taken forcredit. In no case shall a student who has attended a course as anauditor be given an anticipatory examination for credit or register for thesame course in the future. A student completing a course in this mannerwill have the course and the notation “AU” indicated on the permanentrecord. A student rostered on an audit basis may be withdrawn from thecourse with a grade of “W” for poor attendance.LEHIGH UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATESA Lehigh undergraduate with a 3.0 cumulative grade point average whohas achieved Junior standing may take any 400-level course for whichhe or she is qualified. The qualifications are defined by the departmentand are certified by the course instructor and department chairpersonthrough petition to the Graduate and Research Committee. Additionalinformation on constraints on undergraduates taking graduate levelcan be found in Guidelines for Undergraduates to Take Graduate LevelCourses (p. 29).Undergraduates at Lehigh who are within a few hours of meeting therequirements for a baccalaureate degree may, with the special approvalof the Graduate and Research Committee, enroll for up to 12 credithours of study for graduate credit. Lehigh undergraduates may applycourse credits taken in the undergraduate program toward a graduatedegree under the following conditions: 1) the course credits are notsubmitted as part of the requirement for an undergraduate degree; and2) courses for possible graduate credit are approved in advance by thecourse instructor, department chairperson, and the dean of the college.The student must receive a final course mark of B- or better.READMISSIONA student who has not been registered in a Lehigh graduate programfor one year must petition for readmission. Petitions approved bythe student’s major department must be forwarded to Registration &Academic Services.INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND SCHOLARSInternational applicants must hold an American bachelor’s degree oran equivalent foreign degree requiring at least 16 years of primary,secondary, and university education. International applicants applyingfor regular graduate student status must submit all documents requiredfor that status (see above).RegistrationREQUIREMENTSAll graduate students using Lehigh University resources must beregistered. The maximum roster of a full-time (no employment) graduatestudent shall not exceed 18 credit hours, but students can petition toSOGS for up to 20 credit hours. Graduate students who are full-timeemployees at the university may not take more than six semester hoursof graduate work in any one semester. Graduate students who arehalf-time employees of the university (e.g., half-time teaching assistantor half-time research fellows) may not take more than ten semesterhours of graduate work in any one semester. Graduate students undercontract to devote not more than one-third of their time to universityemployment may take a maximum of twelve semester hours in any onesemester. Graduate students who are employed elsewhere and cangive only part of their time to graduate work must restrict the size of theirrosters accordingly. Full time status is indicated for graduate students34         Graduate Credit and Gradeswho register for a minimum of nine credit hours each semester, or threecredit hours in each summer session.REGISTRATION PROCEDURERegistration is scheduled to begin in November and April at a timedesignated on the university calendar. Students should check with theirdepartments for registration and semester class schedules. Graduatestudents register using the online system after consultation with theiradviser. A course adviser will discuss course selections with studentsand provide the registration PIN.LATE REGISTRATION PENALTIESRegistration after the designated period during the prior term forcontinuing full-time graduate students will require a late registrationfee. Students who have not completed the registration process by thetenth day of the regular academic semester or by the fourth day of thesummer session will not be permitted to attend class.FULL-TIME STATUSIn order to maintain full-time enrollment status, a graduate student mustordinarily register for a minimum of nine credits each semester. Full-time students may not be employed full-time. Identification as a full-timestudent is important for three purposes:1.eligibility for financial aid,2.compliance with visa requirements for international students, and3.for university and national graduate enrollment data.Full-time status may be maintained with fewer than nine credits ofregistration after fulfillment of degree credit-hour requirements andunder some other selected circumstances, provided that the studentis, in fact, continuing a program of full-time study and research. In suchcases, the status must be certified each semester on the Graduate FullTime Certification request form, first by the department and then by theappropriate college.Graduate Credit and GradesCourse grades are defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except that, ata minimum, no final course mark lower than C- may be counted towarda graduate degree and pass-fail registration is not allowed for graduatestudents. No regularly admitted student who receives more than fourfinal course marks below a B- in courses numbered 200 or higher isallowed to continue registration as a graduate student. Individual degreeprograms may have higher standards.The N grade is defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except that,parenthetical grades are not required for thesis or research courses andgraduate students have a calendar year to remove course incompletegrades unless an earlier deadline is specified by the instructor. Graduatestudent incomplete course grades that are not removed remain as Nor N (grade) on the student record for one year. After one year, theN grade will be converted to an F and the N (grade) will be convertedto the parenthetical letter grade. Incomplete grades may be extendedan additional year with approval of the course instructor and thegraduate coordinator. After two years, outstanding incomplete gradeswill be converted to an F or the parenthetical mark. After two years,students may appeal to the Committee on Standing of GraduateStudents (SOGS) with a timeline and plan for completion. Thesis orresearch project N grades may remain beyond one year until the work iscompleted.The X grade is defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except that to beeligible for a make-up examination a graduate student must file a petitionand the petition must be approved by the Graduate and ResearchCommittee.  The instructor schedules and administers the make-upexam.The Z grade is defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except thatgraduate students have a calendar year to complete courseworkfollowing a Z grade unless an earlier completion deadline is specifiedby the instructor. The X portion of the grade is removed as describedfor undergraduates. Z grades which are not removed remain on therecord of graduate students. All petitions for exceptions are sent to theCommittee on Standing of Graduate Students (SOGS).A student’s grade that was originally assigned an N, X or Z grade whenconverted or computed will be noted with an “*” asterisk prefix.REPEATED COURSE POLICYIf a graduate student repeats a course, each time that course is takenit is included in the academic record, as is the final grade assigned,and both appear on the official student academic transcript.  All finalcourse grades assigned are included in the calculation of the student'scumulative grade point average.  Course credits from a repeatedcourse, however, count only once toward satisfying graduation creditrequirements.A student may repeat a course only twice --  a total of three attempts. Withdrawal from a course counts as an attempt (effective Fall 2017).WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSEWhen a student drops a course within the first ten days of the semester(four days for summer sessions) no indication of this action is recordedon the academic transcript. A student that drops all courses for which heor she is registered is considered to be withdrawing from the university.A student who withdraws from a course after the tenth day of instructionand before the end of the eleventh week of instruction will have a finalcourse mark of “W” assigned to the course.  This is a non-punitivegrade.An Add/Drop form signed by the student’s adviser must be submittedto Registration & Academic Services before the deadlines noted to beofficial.UNIVERSITY WITHDRAWALA student withdrawing from the university (dropping all courses duringa given term) must submit the Drop/Add form signed by the adviserto Registration & Academic Services. Withdrawal during the firsteleven weeks of instruction will be noted on the academic transcriptby assigning a final course mark of “W” to all courses. The date of thewithdrawal will be noted on the academic transcript for a completeuniversity withdrawal at any time during the term.GRADUATE STUDENT SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTSThe following guidelines state the minimum requirements for all graduatestudents. Individual degree programs may have higher standards.Associate and Non-Degree StudentsAssociate and Non-Degree Students will be placed on probationwhen they receive their first final course mark below a “B-” and will bedropped for poor scholarship at the end of a term when the student hasaccumulated either two “C”, “C-” or “C+” final course marks or one finalcourse mark below “C-”.If an associate student is assigned two grades below a “B-” in the sameterm the student is eligible to be dropped without any term on probation.Once on probation, students remain on probation until they are grantedregular status or receive degree. Students who are eligible to be grantedregular status but fail to apply by the regular student deadline will beevaluated according to the regular student criteria.Regular StudentsRegular Students will be placed on probation at the end of the termin which they are assigned their fourth final course mark below a“B-” in courses numbered 200 or above and will be dropped for poorscholarship at the end of any term in which they are assigned their fifthfinal course mark below a “B-”.Once regular students are placed on probation they will remain onprobation until they receive their degrees.ReadmissionGraduate students who have been dropped for poor scholarship areineligible to enroll for the next regular term. After one term away theymay petition for readmission. The department and the dean’s officemust review the petition. If approved, the student will be readmitted onprobation and may be dropped again with any additional final coursemarks below a “B-”.Academic GrievancesStudents may seek redress of various grievances within the Universitythrough the agencies and procedures described under this heading. The Associate Dean of Students is available to discuss with students thenature of their grievances and to advise them on the recourse open tothem.Lehigh University 2018-2019       35Redress of Academic GrievancesAn undergraduate (or group of undergraduates) with a complaint arisingout of any course should bring the complaint first to the instructor ofthe course in which the grievance occurred.  If, after meeting with theinstructor, the student feels that satisfaction has not been received,the complaint should then be taken to the instructor’s immediatesuperior, and so on up the line, from the instructor of a section to thefaculty member in charge of all sections of the course, the departmentchairperson, and the dean of the college.If the student (or group of students) believes the grievance should notgo to the instructor, he or she should take it to the instructor’s immediatesuperior.  In case of doubt as to whom to bring the grievance, thestudent should consult the dean of the college or the Dean of StudentsOffice.A graduate student (or group of students) with a complaint arising outof any course or research activity should bring the complaint first to theresponsible faculty member.  If, after meeting with the faculty member,the student wishes to pursue the matter further, the complaint shouldthen be taken to the department chairperson, and the dean of thecollege.If the student (or group of students) believes the grievance should notgo to the faculty member, he or she should take it to the departmentchairperson.  In case of doubt as to whom to  ring the brievance thestudent should consult the dean of the college, the Dean of Studentsoffice or the University Ombudsperson.Right of Appeal of Academic GrievancesA student failing to gain satisfaction in the manner described abovemay appeal by petition to the Committee on Standing of Students or forgraduate students, the Committee on Standing of Graduate Students.In general, a student has the privilege of petition about any academicmatter of concern to him or her in the University.  Petition forms areavailable in the Associate Dean of Students office, the dean’s officesand Registration & Academic Services.Graduate Leave of AbsenceGraduate Student Leave of Absence PolicyDuring the course of graduate study, students may find themselves incircumstances that require them to interrupt their graduate work.  Whenthese occasions arise, the University allows students to request a leaveof absence for either personal or medical reasons.  The informationprovided below is designed to assist students in making a smoothtransition away from graduate study and then back again.Students are required to submit the Leave of Absence Request formto the Office of Graduate Student Life.  If the student is eligible, theOffice of Graduate Student Life will then notify the academic adviser,program director, department chair, graduate associate dean of theappropriate college and Registration & Academic Services.  In orderto enhance their successful return to graduate school, students arestrongly encouraged to meet with their advisers to discuss their plansand to keep the lines of communication open.Please note that a “withdrawal” indicates the student intends todiscontinue graduate study, whereas a “Leave of Absence” indicatesthat the student intends to return at a specified later date.  This policyaddress leaves after which the student intends to return and resume hisor her studies.Important Information about Requested Leaves of Absence:•Only students who have successfully completed at least onesemester of graduate work and are in good academic standing areeligible for a leave of absence.  Students in their first semester whorequest a leave will need to petition for readmission.•Funded students who are requesting a leave due to the birth oradoption of a child should apply for a Graduate Student ParentalLeave.  Students can access information and the form here:http://www.lehigh.edu/~inprv/pdfs/GraduateStudentParentalLeavePolicy11-17-09withForm.pdf•The University will grant a leave of absence for up to one year.  Ifmore time away is required, students may request a second yearof leave.  Should students require more than two years away fromthe University, they will be required to apply for readmission to theprogram at the end of their time away.  A leave that commencesduring the semester will count as an entire semester away in termsof total leave time allowed.•If students take a leave during the semester, they may be required tosubmit a drop/add form to Registration & Academic Services (http://www.lehigh.edu/~inengrit/gradforms/pdfs/add_drop.pdf).  Studentsmay be eligible for a prorated refund.   Please consult the Bursar’sOffice for details: (http://www.lehigh.edu/~inburs/refund.html).•An approved leave of absence extends the time-to-degree deadlinefor the length of the approved leave, but only up to the university-mandated maximum of two years.•While on leave, students are not registered with the University.  Thishas important implications:•The student may not submit work, take exams, propose or defendtheses or dissertations, or use faculty time.•The student will not have access to University services, includingthe Health and Counseling Centers, the Fitness Center, and Libraryand Technology Services. This means the student’s Lehigh emailaccount will be suspended and he or she will be unable to use libraryservices.  However, the College Dean’s Office may request that theemail account and library privileges remain active during the term ofthe approved leave, up to a maximum of two years.•Funded students cease to receive stipend payments from the start ofthe approved date of the leave.  Students receiving funding providedto the university by external grants or contracts should consult withtheir funding-related adviser/supervisor about applicable rules,procedures and possible limitations.  While those who have providedfinancial support for students who go on leave will do their best tosupport those students when they return and resume their studies, itis not possible to guarantee such support will be available when thestudent returns.•Student loans may come out of deferment and the student may berequired to begin repaying his/her loans. Please consult FinancialAid: http://www.lehigh.edu/~infao/graduate/index.html.•Immigration status may be affected for international students. Please consult the Office of International Students and Scholars:http://www.lehigh.edu/oiss/•Students living in campus housing will need to make other livingarrangements, since only registered students in good standing areeligible for such housing.  Unfortunately, Residential Services alsocannot guarantee space upon the student’s return.•Students enrolled in the University health insurance plan maybe able to keep their health insurance during the term of thehealth insurance contract.  In this case, students can contact theUniversity Health Center to obtain a list of primary care doctors in thecommunity to use during their leave of absence. Please consult thestudent health insurance brochure for eligibility restrictions:  https://financeadmin.lehigh.edu/sites/financeadmin.lehigh.edu/files/offices/bursar/docs/HealthInsuranceBrochure.pdf•Students requesting a leave for medical or psychological reasonsmust include documentation from their health provider whichindicates a recommendation for the leave and expected time away.  The documentation is submitted to --and is only available to--the Director of Graduate Life. Such documentation remains keptconfidential.•Students who need to be absent within the semester (no more thana few weeks in duration) must consult with their professors about thepossibility of making up missed classwork and, if applicable, workrelated to their funding support.  In these circumstances, students donot need to submit an official Leave of Absence request.  Studentsmay consult the Director of Graduate Student Life with questions andconcerns.•To formally request a leave of absence, students must complete theform at the following link: http://lehigh.edu/go/gradloaImportant Information about Involuntary Leaves of Absence:36         Graduation•The University may require an involuntary leave of any student whoappears to have a serious physical, psychological or emotionaldisorder which offers reasonable cause to believe he or she maybe a danger to self or others, or may disrupt proper activities of theUniversity community and its members, or may be unable to lookafter his or her affairs adequately.  An involuntary leave of absenceis included in the maximum leave of two years.  •Time-to-degree deadlines are not extended for students who aresuspended due to Code of Conduct violations.Returning from Leave and Resuming Graduate Studies•When ready to resume graduate study, students arerequired to complete the Graduate Readmission Form(https://publicdocs.maxient.com/reportingform.php?LehighUniv&layout_id=111).•Returning students are encouraged to contact their program adviseras early as possible to discuss registration. •Returning students may only re-enroll for a full semester or summersession.  In order to meet this requirement, such students need to beaware of registration deadlines.•Students who take a leave from graduate study without requestingan official leave of absence will be required to petition the Standingof Graduate Students (SOGS) committee for readmission if they’vebeen away from the University for more than one year.

Ultimately, ethics concerns how we ought to live, individuallyand collectively. Ethical concepts, issues, questions, norms, andsystems can be studied philosophically, psychologically, sociologically,anthropologically, historically, politically; ethical inquiry engages thenatural and applied sciences and engineering and addresses concernsin economics and business; ethical questions are explored in religionand literature and through artistic expression.The Center's organizing perspective is that there is no aspect of humanbeings, no space in human lives, that does not have ethical dimensions—our intrapersonal lives, our interpersonal relations, as well as theeducational, professional, familial, social, cultural, religious, artistic,political, economic, environmental, scientific, and global dimensions ofour lives together. The ethics domain thus encompasses all aspects ofLehigh University.Research and Educational ActivitiesThe Center for Ethics, which serves the entire Lehigh community, hasthree principal aims:•Enhance student engagement with ethical issues and ethicaldecision-making•Foster research in ethics and ethical issues•Promote public ethics educationThe Center functions in two ways. First, it provides resources to support,coordinate, and expand existing ethics-related educational and researchactivities and programs at Lehigh, thus highlighting and promoting thewide-range of opportunities to engage with ethical issues across theuniversity and in the wider community. Second, the Center focuses attention on vital but difficult questions andcreates new opportunities for engagement with ethical issues in thefollowing ways:•Bringing to campus ethics leaders from academia, business, civicorganizations, government, through the Peter S. Hagerman ’61Lecture in Ethics series;• Supporting and enhancing curricular, co-curricular, and researchopportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in everydiscipline to develop and apply intellectual tools that will enable themto identify, understand, and deliberate well about ethical issues;•Nurturing cutting-edge research and scholarship, especiallyinterdisciplinary work, that addresses both current ethical challengesand enduring moral questions;•Organizing thought-provoking and penetrating explorations of, andinformed and unbiased discussions about, the most important ethicalproblems of our times;•Taking a major role in fulfilling Lehigh’s responsibility to be aleader in public education about ethical issues and approaches toaddressing them, and providing a resource of ethics expertise to thewider community.The Center for Ethics engages with the connections and challenges ofthe multiplicity of ethical worldviews on our campus, in our communitiesand nation, and globally and cross-culturally. The Center thus serves to•advance the study and practice of ethics;•enrich the quality of understanding of, discussions about, anddeliberation and decision-making concerning moral questions,issues, and problems;•assist students to become engaged, ethically sensitive citizens whoare well-prepared to grapple with the difficult life-choices and ethicalchallenges they face at Lehigh and will face after graduation; and• catalyze ethical leadership.Center for Photonics and NanoelectronicsCenter for Photonics and Nanoelectronics (CPN)Web: www.lehigh.edu/cpnLocations: Sinclair Laboratory (7 Asa Drive, Bethlehem, 5) andSherman Fairchild Laboratory (16A Memorial Drive East, Bethlehem, PA18015)Center Director:Nelson Tansu (ECE), CPN Director & Daniel E.

Kothare, Ph.D., codirector; William L. Luyben, Ph.D.,codirector; Hugo S. Caram, Ph.D.; William E. Schiesser, Ph.D.,EugenioSchuster Ph.D.; James T. Hsu, Ph.D.The mission of the Chemical Process Modeling and Control ResearchCenter at Lehigh University is to advance the theory and applicationof feedback control techniques, dynamic modeling, optimization andautomation, and to apply these tools to a range of chemical andbiological systems. A key execution strategy involves close collaborationwith industrial partners to identify and solve technological relevantautomation problems.The Center was established in January 1985 through the efforts offaculty members of the chemical engineering department at LehighUniversity, leading industrial processing companies, the Ben FranklinPartnership Program of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, coupledwith the organizational and financial support of the National ScienceFoundation (NSF).The center provides a unique atmosphere for fundamental research,development of specific techniques, application to real industrialprocesses, and opportunities for advanced education (M.S. andPh.D.) in chemical process modeling and control for academics andindustrial practitioners. Facilities are available for real time testingof new algorithms in experimental process units, development ofdynamic simulations of real processes, and the close collaboration withresearchers in several other fields of chemical processing.Interdisciplinary collaboration is encouraged with other research groups,centers, or institutes engaged in biotechnology, polymer processing,environmental science, applied statistics, signal processing, chemicalreaction engineering, and process design.EDUCATIONAn integral part of the center is the commitment to conduct anoutstanding program dedicated to the education of undergraduate andgraduate students. The center has and continues to attract top qualitystudents from a large group of well recognized international universities.In addition, each year several industrial companies send employees toreceive advanced training and engage in research efforts for particularcompany technical requirements.FACULTYThe center brings together several faculty members from differentengineering disciplines in the university engaged in the researchand educational efforts of the center. Visiting faculty from other wellrecognized universities supplement these researchers and provideopportunities for diversity of thinking and innovative research. All of theassociated faculty members are recognized around the world as leadersLehigh University 2018-2019       43in their respective fields of specialization. They also serve as consultantsto a variety of industries.FACILITIESThe Center is located in Iacocca Hall on the Mountaintop Campus ofLehigh University. This building represents a unique facility availableto the center as well as the chemical engineering department and theEmulsion Polymers and Bioprocessing Institutes. The center has theuse of several dedicated computer facilities with numerous workstationcomputers continuously available to the students, faculty, and staff.In addition to the local computing network, the center's researchershave access to the Lehigh University central computing facilities and itsoutside links to other worldwide computing systems and data networks.The center has several laboratories with sophisticated equipmentdedicated to process control research work.AREAS OF RESEARCHThe research activities of the Center span a wide spectrum of problemsin large complex chemical process design, dynamical analysis andcontrol, as well micro and nanoscale complex process development,evaluation, dynamical analysis and control. A recently added area ofresearch studies the role of feedback control in biological systems withparticular emphasis on neuronal systems encountered in neuroscienceand neurology. The research themes emphasize a combination of newtheoretical developments, new applications and translation of newtheoretical developments to practical problems.1.Synthesis and PlantWide ControlDuring the last decade Center faculty have done pioneering work inthe area of plantwide control, which has resulted in the only textbookthat covers this important area. There continue to be a number ofprojects in this area.a.On Demand Control of Processes with Multiple Products: Thisproject studies the design and control of processes in whichconsecutive reversible reactions produce multiple products.The demand for these products can vary, so the process andits control system must be able to produce exactly the desiredamount of each individual product. An ideal system has beenstudied first in which the effect of equilibrium constants andvolatilities can be explored. A real chemical system is also beingstudied (the production of methyl amines).b.Design and Control of Tubular Reactors Systems: Adiabaticgasphase exothermic reactions are often carried out intubular reactors. There are several types of systems: a singleadiabatic reactor, multiple adiabatic reactors in series with eitherintermediate cooling or "cold shot" cooling (mixing some coldfeed with the hot reactor effluent) and a cooled tubular reactor.These alternatives are being studied in terms of both steadystatedesign (which has the lowest total annual cost) and dynamiccontrollability (which provides the tightest temperature control inthe face of disturbances).2.Dynamics and Control of DistillationReactive distillation is an emerging area in chemical engineeringbecause it offers potential savings in capital and energy costsin some systems, particularly for reversible reactions. A recentproject explored several reactive distillation systems: ETBE, methylacetate, TAME, ethylene glycol and metathesis of pentene. Thesteadystate economic designs of these systems were studied.Then their dynamics and control were explored. Different types ofchemical systems require types of control structures. These columnsare sometimes operated using of an excess of one of the reactantsand sometimes using exact stoichiometric amounts of the two freshreactant feeds. Both the process design and the control scheme aredifferent with these two scenarios.3.Convex Optimization Techniques in Linear and Nonlinear ProcessControlThe last few years have seen the emergence of a new class ofoptimization problems that have been variously referred to as aLinear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), semidefinite programming (SDP)problems and convex problems. We were one of the first groupsto explicitly show the applicability of LMIs in process control byreformulating the modelbased predictive control (MPC) algorithmsas LMI problems. There are several classes of problems involvingcontrol of systems subject to constraints that are amenable to LMIformulation. These include efficient offline MPC for fast samplingtime processes, observerbased nonlinear, MPC, multimodeltransition control using MPC, antiwindup, moving horizon estimationand evaluation of robustness, i.e., the impact of model uncertaintyon controller performance. These new control algorithms are beingtested on numerous application platforms.4.Multi-Model and Hybrid Systems Analysis and ControlHybrid and multimodel systems are a class of systems in which thereis interaction between continuous dynamical behavior of systemswith discrete switching behavior. For example, systems describedby piecewise linear multiple models are continuous and linearwithin a prescribed region and switch to a different linear modeldescription in a different prescribed region of the statespace. Otherexamples include switches and overrides that switch one of a familyof controllers into the closedloop, based on the operating space andcontrol objective.Our research in this area has focused on two broad problems(1) control of systems described by multiple piecewise linearmodels; (2) formulation of saturated systems as switched/piecewiselinear models and subsequent antiwindup controller design usingpiecewise quadratic functions. We demonstrated, through a casestudy, the control of a highly nonlinear solution copolymerizationreactor using multimodel switching MPC. . We have also shownhow an appropriate antiwindup controller synthesis problem can beformulated using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions.5.Dynamics and Control of Micro and Nanochemical SystemsMicrochemical systems are a new generation of miniature chemicalsystems that carry out chemical reactions and separations inprecisely fabricated three dimensional microreactor configurationsin the size range of a few microns to a few hundred microns.Typical microchemical systems combine fluid handling and reactioncapabilities with electronic sensing and actuation, are fabricatedusing integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing techniques and usesilicon and related IC industry materials, polymers, ceramics, glassor quartz as their material of construction.The goal of this integrated research and education programis to study the unique dynamical properties of such integratedmicrochemical systems and to develop a framework for designingimplementable feedback control techniques for this class ofmicrosystems. Concepts for distributed and boundary controltheory will be employed to study the modelbased feedback controlformulation of microchemical systems and to develop a technicalframework for microsystem controller design. The IntegratedMicrochemical Systems Laboratory (under the direction of ProfessorM.V. Kothare) conducts this research as part of the Center.6.Control of Biomedical Systems: We are currently working onapplying control techniques to emerging problems in biomedicalengineering, in particular, in neuroengineering. This involvesdeveloping models of ensembles of neurons in the human brainand use of such models in optimizing closed loop neuroprostheticrehabilitation strategies.For more information, contact Mayuresh V.

Snyder, Ph.D.; Dmitri Vezenov, Ph.D.Originally established in 1975, the Emulsion Polymers Institute (EPI),provides a focus for graduate education and research in polymercolloids. Formation of the institute constituted formal recognition ofan activity that had grown steadily since the late 1960s. Recently,the research thrust of the Institute has been broadened to includeengineered particles . The new focus is rooted in fundamentalscientific-based particle design, but guided by identified applications,while still maintaining a core competency in emulsion polymerization.The rapidly broadening applications for particle technologies in fieldssuch as biotechnology (e.g., drug delivery, imaging, assembly ofbiocompatible scaffolds), nanotechnology (e.g., directed assembly ofhierarchically ordered, functional structures), and others demand aconcomitant diversification of the institute to include a broader class ofparticles: polymeric, inorganic, hybrid, macroionic, metallic, as well asnovel particulate composites designed at the nanoscale that will span allindustrially-relevant scales.The institute has close ties with polymer and surface scientists inthe Center for Polymer Science and Engineering (CPSE), Center forAdvanced Materials and Nanotechnology (CAMN), and the departmentsof chemical engineering, chemistry, physics, and materials science andengineering. These ties reflect the interdisciplinary nature of researchthat is carried out in the Institute.RESEARCH ACTIVITIESFundamental particle research in the institute spans particle synthesis,particle functionalization, and directed assembly of particles into higherorder, functional structures. Continuing emulsion polymers researchis a blend of theoretical and experimental problems related to thepreparation, characterization, and applications of polymer latexes andare aimed at understanding the kinetics, mechanisms, morphology,and the colloidal, surface and bulk of the latexes. Applications of thisfundamental technology, resulting from interdisciplinary researchamong the faculty associated with the institute, stand to align wellwith the strategic university and college-level nanotechnology,biotechnology, and energy/environment initiatives. Many projects withinEPI achieve what has been the largest obstacle to commercializationof nanotechnology: scalable process design of nanoscale functioningmaterials. Materials fabricated by EPI researchers are designed tofunction either as nano- or microscale sensors, material modifiers, or toself-assemble into advanced materials that depend on the nanoscalefeatures of its constituents. In addition, engineered particle technologiesdeveloped at EPI and other institutions have allowed for the validation ofsoft condensed matter theories at scales available to experimentalists. Inthe biotechnology area, research focuses on diagnostic and therapeutictechnology to prepare particles that are biocompatible, biologicallyspecific, easily detectable, and responsive to external controls. In thearea of energy, work focuses on a variety of different unique particletechnologies that may be used in applications such as catalysis andphotocatalysts for the hydrogen economy, photovoltaics and solar cells,and membrane separations. In the environmental area, in additionto seeking novel particle technology for contaminant remediation inwater, tailor-made colloidal particles with desirable surface properties,should provide model systems for fundamental insight into surfacephenomena, relationships between bacterial adhesion to a surfaceand cellular bioenergetics, and bacterial transport through unsaturatedporous media. Similarly, model porous media constructed by engineeredparticles could benefit research on the sources, fate and transportof bacteria in the environment, new water treatment technologies fordeveloping countries, and alternative water disinfection technologies.Research support for institute activities is obtained from industrialorganizations through their membership in the Emulsion PolymersIndustrial Liaison Program as well as government agencies. Hencesome considerable effort is made to relate the research resultsto industrial needs. Consequently, graduates can find excellentopportunities for employment.EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIESGraduate students in the Institute undertake dissertation researchleading to the master of science or doctor of philosophy degree inexisting science and engineering curricula or in the Center for PolymerScience and Engineering. Programs of study are tailored to meetthe individual needs of each student and considerable flexibility ispermitted in the selection of courses and a research topic. Educationaland research opportunities exist for postdoctoral scholars and visitingscientists as well as resident graduate students. In addition, the instituteholds a short course each June, “Advances in Emulsion Polymerizationand Latex Technology” that typically attracts a number of industrialparticipants as well as EPI students and is an excellent opportunity tointeract with industrial scientists and engineers.For more information, write to H.

Kramp, English; Monica Miller, Religion;Monica Najar, History; Nicholas Sawicki, Art, Architecture and Design;Amardeep Singh, English; María Bárbara Zepeda Cortés, HistoryThe humanities consider how we understand and record humanexperiences. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines includingphilosophy, history, literature, religion, visual arts, music, and language,humanistic study teaches us how to think creatively and critically aboutour own identities and our connections to others—whether they liveacross the street or across the world, whether they lived long ago orwill live in the futures we imagine. The Humanities Center at LehighUniversity is thus vital for building community both on and beyond ourcampus. The Humanities Center creates interdisciplinary intellectualopportunities for students, faculty, and staff engaged in humanisticinquiry across departments and programs. Through speaker series,reading groups, conferences, an undergraduate research journal,research grants, and informal gatherings, the Humanities Center fostersa broad community rooted in vibrant, rigorous, and creative inquiry intowhat it means and has meant to be human. The Humanities Center hasdesigned an annual speaker series on a theme, hosted scholars, writers,artists, and activists to speak on a single issue and organized year-longfaculty seminars to address specific intellectual topics. Recent themeshave included Home, Movement, Contagion, Speaking Bodies, and thePosthumanities.RESEARCH ACTIVITIESThe Humanities Center fosters interdisciplinary research activity inseveral ways. Faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates mayapply for funding to support reading groups, colloquia, conferences andvisiting speakers. Graduate students may apply for modest financialsupport to enable them to travel to present research at academicconferences. The center sponsors a works-in-progress series, whichfosters dialogue about ongoing research projects in the humanities.Summer, Individual and Collaborative Research Grants are available forfaculty and graduate students. The objective of these grants is twofold:1.to strengthen the intellectual community of Lehigh’s scholars in theHumanities and2.to provide support for faculty to pursue a humanistic researchproject or creative activity and for graduate students to finish theirdissertations.EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIESThe Humanities Center hosts and sponsors the production of the LehighReview, an undergraduate research journal founded in 1992 by theLehigh humanities faculty. Original articles range in topic and subjectacross the spectrum of undergraduate study, from English to Economicsand Physics. Published annually, the entire publication process—fromreviewing submissions to editing to design and illustration—is handledalmost exclusively by undergraduate students and supervised by agraduate student instructor.

The Institute’s long termgoal is the creation of a worldwide network in glass research for newapplications, and the development of a new generation of scientistsand engineers with enhanced international leadership capabilities.Specifically on campus, it promotes new activities in glass researchthrough international and national collaborations, and the developmentof new approaches to the education of glass. Faculty and students fromvarious Departments of Rossin College of Engineering and AppliedScience, and College of Arts and Sciences participate in its activitieslisted below.Half of the 20 most significant inventions of the 20th century, asidentified by the National Academy of Engineering, would not havematerialized without glass. The solutions to 12 of the 14 grandengineering challenges of this century depend on the availabilityof glass either as a support material or as an active component forsensing, information storage, treatment delivery, etc. The discoveryof new phenomena, along with continually improving properties andprocessing methods, will keep glass at the cutting-edge of technology.Unfortunately, in recent decades glass education has fragmentedwith the result that a larger number of students is exposed to glassymaterials, but with relatively shallow, cursory knowledge that does notprepare them to become a professional glass scientist or engineer.To meet these challenges IMI-NFG is pooling together resources ofeducational institutions, leading glass companies, national laboratoriesand professional organizations from across the globe. Thus, it ispromoting research through synergistic collaborations and internationalexchange of researchers at undergraduate to faculty level as wellas training glass professionals through internet and other educationtechnology to create a new generation of scientists and engineers withenhanced leadership capabilities.To promote international research collaborations for new uses of glass,and to make glass education available without geographical boundaries,IMI-NFG sponsors and provides support for the following program:GLASS EDUCATIONAL MATERIALDevelopment of Educational Material such as video DVDs and hands-ondemonstrations by the leading international glass experts to promote theunderstanding of glass at all levels. A variety of over 300 video tutoriallectures and overviews of the latest progress is available via Internetto interested students without charge. For example, a full semestercourse on Optical and Photonic Glasses consisting of 39 lectures isaccessible from IMI-NFG’s web site. The teachers at Lehigh and otheruniversities and colleges will find this collection a useful resource fortheir lectures. Professionals in industry can learn the subject by studyingthese lectures.For more information, contact Prof. Himanshu Jain, Director,International Materials Institute for New Functionality in Glass, LehighUniversity, Sinclair Lab 120, 7 Asa Drive, Bethlehem, 5.

Nied, Ph.D.,Michael Rex, Brian C. Slocum, Jean Toulouse, Ph.D., Kemal TuzlaPh.D., Richard P. Vinci, Ph.D., Masashi Watanabe Ph.D.The Loewy Institute continues tradition of the Institute for Metal Forming,which was established in 1970 to teach the principles and applicationsof metal forming technology to graduate and undergraduate students,to provide instructions and equipment for graduate research in metalforming processes, and to assist industry with solutions to problems inmetal forming.The main objective of the institute’s research is to conduct cross-disciplinary process engineering studies to better understand andcontrol manufacturing processes and their impact on the microstructuralresponse of a material. The material microstructure developed duringprocessing is responsible for physical properties of the material.Recently, classical metal forming research has been expanded toinclude projects in powder processing including additive manufacturing,microstructure characterization and analysis, as well as forming andprocessing technologies for polymers, glasses, and ceramics.The study of the forming processes encompasses physical andnumerical modeling; simulation of microstructure response to processparameters. Computer enhanced analysis of material flow also allowsus to optimize tooling design in many manufacturing processes.The combined quantitative results of these techniques may then becompared with experimental data obtained from instrumented metalforming laboratories (such as those maintained at the institute), or fromour research partners in industry.RESEARCH ACTIVITIESCurrent research areas include: deformation and processing of metals,metal and ceramic powders, glasses, polymers, light-optical andelectron-optical micro-texture characterization, tooling design and toolingmaterials, thermo-mechanical processing of metals, rapid prototypingand rapid tooling aka additive manufacturing, and machinability of thesintered powder materials. Additionally new research projects havebeen initiated in development of materials for medical and energyapplications.EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIESStudents interested in metal forming should refer to course offeringsin the departments of materials science and engineering, mechanicalengineering and mechanics, and industrial and manufacturing systemsengineering.For more information contact Wojciech Z.

All too often research that is createdfor these individuals remains at the development level and is notdisseminated into best practices. The Center is focused on conductingand disseminating applied research and assuring research outcomes getinto the hands of parents and practitioners as quickly as possible.APPLIED RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIESThe CPRP focuses on applied research that has a significant impacton the lives of individuals who have identified areas of disability or areconsidered at risk for developing disabilities.   Research conductedthrough the CPRP is supported through federal grants.  Projects includeenhancing the role of early head start home visitors to improve infants’and toddlers’ communication and language skill development (LittleTalks); developing a progress monitoring measures to assess earlylanguage and literacy skills in children birth to age 3 (Developing IGDIs);developing a program to improve language outcomes of preschoolchildren with language impairments (Parents Plus: Language Coach);developing an early intervention education program for parents of youngchildren (age 3-5) with or at-risk for ADHD (PEAK); improving children’slanguage, literacy, and school readiness through storybook readingstrategies (Read It Again); enhancing school-wide positive behaviorsupport (SWPBIS) by adapting tier 2 interventions in elementaryschools (ATTAIN); training leaders to effectively implement Responseto Intervention in middle and high schools (RTI Personnel Preparation);evaluating a multicomponent intervention for high school students withADHD (BEST); developing a college and career readiness program forhigh school students (Pathway 360°); and examining the educational,psychological, and social functioning of college students with ADHD(TRAC).PARTNERSHIPThe Center forms and maintains partnerships at national, regional,and local levels. Several objectives are established to accomplish thisgoal. The CPRP assists with the development and implementation ofresearch projects designed in local school districts and intermediateunits, as well as early childhood education and intervention providers.Many school districts, particularly small and rural districts, do not havethe capacity to engage in wide scale research efforts. Yet, these districtsoften have very significant needs for empirically based decision making.The CPRP provides a cost effective vehicle for these districts to engagein such research efforts. Another level of partnership for the CPRPis interdisciplinary research within the University community. Thisobjective is met through facilitating cross- college and cross-programproposals. Continuous efforts are made to invite colleagues from acrossdepartments and colleges in the University to join with faculty in theCollege of Education in pursuing research interests that are within themission of the Center. Efforts also continue to conduct research withcolleagues across institutions. Projects have included partner institutionssuch as Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Ohio University, the OhioState University, Oregon Research Institution, Temple University,Teachers College, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Pittsburgh, American Institutes for Research, UtahState University, and Inspired Learning, LC, in Allentown.DISSEMINATIONThe CPRP is a resource for facilitating the translation of researchinto practice. Investigators conducting research have published theoutcomes of findings in professional journals and outlets. In addition, theCPRP disseminates research findings and state-of-the-art interventionsand strategies to parents, teachers, and other practitioners through ourwebsite and other dissemination activities.LEHIGH UNIVERSITY AUTISM SERVICESLehigh University Autism Services is a clinic housed in the Center forPromoting Research to Practice.

Hyland, senior associatedean; Dominic Packer, associate dean; Jackie Krasas, associatedean; Susan Szczepanski, interim associate dean.The College of Arts and Sciences is the heart of Lehigh University,offering a wide variety of academic majors, minors, and interdisciplinaryprograms, while also providing essential liberal arts access to all Lehighstudents. Arts and Sciences faculty are engaged as active scholars,are highly accessible, and are committed to the teaching mission of ourundergraduate programs. A hallmark of our college is the faculty’s abilityto engage students interactively and experientially in teaching, research,and scholarship.Students in the College develop new habits of mind that have becomethe hallmarks of a liberal arts education, testing assumptions, seekingevidence to support their understanding of the world, and probing theunknown with curiosity. These habits prepare our graduates to thrive inan uncertain world. Through a combination of college-wide distributionrequirements and major field requirements in their chosen discipline,Lehigh Arts and Sciences students investigate and acquire knowledgeof human cultures and the physical and natural world by studying arts,humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences.Studying broadly in these areas while pursuing a deeper concentrationin a major field helps develop the intellectual curiosity and requisite skillsnecessary to creating lifelong learning habits as our graduates confrontconstant changes in society, technology, as well as their careers andpersonal lives.The College of Arts and Sciences offers several curricular options:•A four-year arts and sciences curriculum leading to a bachelor of artsor bachelor of science degree in designated fields.•A five-year arts-engineering curriculum leading to a bachelor’sdegree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a bachelorof science degree from the College of Engineering and AppliedScience.•Dual degree programs within the college and in conjunction with theother two undergraduate colleges.•A five-year program leading to a bachelor's degree from the Collegeof Arts and Sciences and a master's degree in Education from theCollege of Education. Please see below for more information. MAJOR DEGREE PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGEBachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science Degree ProgramsTwo distinct bachelor-degree programs are offered by the College, theBA and the BS, each distinguished by the number of courses taken inthe major field and ancillary disciplines. For the Bachelor of Arts degreea student takes a comparatively smaller number of courses to fulfill themajor requirements plus a selection of courses in various fields outsidethe major. For the Bachelor of Science degree (offered in designateddisciplines), a student takes a more extensive concentration in the majorfield, along with a proportionally smaller number of courses outside themajor. Except for this distinction, the same basic requirements mustbe met for both degree programs (including the minimum number of120 hours for graduation and the minimum grade point average in themajor of 2.0). No more than six hours of military science may be appliedtoward either degree.Bachelor of Arts Degreeba degrees are offered in the following areas ARTS  Architecture, art, art history, design, music, music composition,  theatreHUMANITIESAsian studies, classical civilization, classics, English, Latin Americanand Latino Studies, modern languages and literature (Chinese, French,Francophone Studies, German, Japanese, & Spanish and HispanicStudies), philosophy, religion studiesSocial SciencesAfricana studies, anthropology, cognitive science, economics,environmental studies, global studies, health, medicine & society,history, international relations, IR/MLL joint major, IR/ECO joint major,journalism, journalism/science writing, political science, psychology,science, technology and society, sociology, sociology and anthropology,women, gender and sexuality studiesMathematics and Natural ScienceAstronomy, behavioral neuroscience, biology, chemistry, computerscience, earth and environmental science, mathematics, molecularbiology, physicsBA degrees in predental science or preoptometry science are availableto students who are admitted to certain combined degree programs (seePre-Health Professions Programs).Bachelor of Science DegreeBS degrees are offered in the following areasAstrophysics, behavioral neuroscience, biochemistry, biology, chemistry,computer science, earth and environmental science, mathematics,molecular biology, pharmaceutical chemistry, physics, psychology,statisticsGENERAL PLAN OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDYStudents in the College are required to choose (usually by the end ofthe sophomore year) a major field and to complete a program of coursesselected in consultation with the student’s advisor. For most students,the credits earned for the major and those earned for college distributionrequirements are not enough to meet the graduation requirement of 120credit hours. Students normally take free elective courses in areas ofinterest to earn these remaining credits. Three types of courses - onein the student’s area of concentration (the major-field requirements), asecond set drawn from certain designated disciplines (the distributionrequirements), and a third set without constraints (the free electives) -comprise the educational program of the College.Major Field of ConcentrationBy majoring in a specific discipline a student establishes a foundation ofknowledge and develops expertise and intellectual sophistication in theirfield.The minimum number of credits for a major is 30. A student mustmaintain a minimum grade-point average of 2.0 in the major field, and inthe entire coursework.Standard major sequencesWhen a student declares a major they are assigned a major advisorfrom that department or program's faculty. The major advisor assistsstudents with course selection, research opportunities, internshipselection, and other areas of professional development. In all cases, thefinal responsibility for meeting both major and non-major requirementsrests with the student.Special interdisciplinary majorsIn addition to our established major programs, specially structuredinterdisciplinary majors linking multiple disciplines are possible. Forexample, a student interested in a professional school of urban orregional planning might wish to structure a special major consistingprimarily of courses in political science, environmental studies,sociology, or any other relevant disciplines.Any student may, with the aid of faculty members chosen from thedisciplines involved, devise an interdisciplinary major program to includeno less than thirty credits of related course work, with at least 15 credits54         College of Arts and Sciencesfrom advanced courses. The major advisors and the dean of the collegemust approve the program.Multiple majors and Dual degreesA student who wishes to fulfill the requirements for more than onemajor program has two options: a double major or a dual degree. Adouble major is a single BA degree with two majors. A student pursuesa double major by declaring both majors. Typically, double majors canbe completed in four years, but sequencing of courses and time conflictswith required courses can introduce delays. No more than three coursesmay be used to meet both majors' requirements.A dual degree program is a combined BA and BS program or twoBS degrees in one or more of our undergraduate colleges. The BAis offered by the College of Arts and Sciences, and the BS may be inCAS or in one of the other undergraduate colleges. A student pursuesa dual degree by declaring the first program and then petitioning theStanding of Students Committee for permission to pursue the seconddegree program. A semester-by-semester plan and a major declarationfor the second degree must accompany the petition to pursue a dualdegree. The dual-degree student must satisfy major and distributionrequirements for both degrees and earn a minimum of 30 additionalcredits beyond those required for the first degree. All of the 30 additionalcredits must be taken at Lehigh or in Lehigh residency programs.The requirement of 30 additional credits typically makes the dualdegree program a five-year program. There is no limit on the numberof overlapping courses between two degrees, but there must be atleast 30 credits of stand alone coursework in each degree program. Foradministrative purposes, students who take two degrees or two majorsmust designate one as their primary major or primary degree program.Distribution RequirementsWhatever expertise in a single discipline an undergraduate may achieve,curiosity lures most of us beyond the confines of a single chosenspecialty. Furthermore, in a swiftly changing world, careers are rapidlybeing redefined and only a person of broad intellectual mindset canconsider where their talents may be most useful to society. Manyof the basic modes of thought and work in various fields are beingreformulated, often producing surprising influences in the public andprivate spheres. To develop a satisfying professional life and be aresponsible citizen of our increasingly global world, one needs exposureto the concepts and methods of a variety of disciplines.CAS distribution requirements draw upon five primary domains oflearning: arts, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and socialsciences. The faculty believe exposure to these broad areas willhelp students develop a basic understanding of the various forms ofknowledge generated in these fields. Specific credit hours are requiredin each of the following four domains: arts and humanities, mathematics,natural sciences, and social sciences.Distribution Requirements for the B.A. and the B.S.First-Year SeminarOne course during the first year3-4English CompositionTwo courses during the first year6Mathematics 1Chosen from designated courses in mathematics, philosophy, orcomputer science3Natural Sciences 1Chosen from designated courses in astronomy, astrophysics,biological anthropology, biosciences, chemistry, earth andenvironmental sciences, physics, and neuroscience.8At least one science course must also include the associatedlaboratory.Social Sciences 1, 2Chosen from designated courses in anthropology, classics,economics, political science, history, international relations,journalism, psychology, social psychology, social relations,sociology, and STS.8Arts and Humanities 1, 2Chosen from designated courses in architecture, art, classics,history, modern languages and literature, English, music,philosophy, religion studies, and theatre.8Junior Year Writing Intensive 13-4Only courses designated as "WI" in the class schedule or selectindependent studies may be used to fulfill this requirement.Total Credits39-411Students and advisors should monitor closely the progress toward completionof requirements. Courses taken to satisfy a major program may be used tosatisfy distribution requirements in only one distribution area.2CAS also offers courses in interdisciplinary programs that satisfy Arts &Humanities and Social Science distribution requirements in the followingprograms: Africana Studies, Asian Studies, Cognitive Science, EnvironmentalStudies, Global Citizenship, Global Studies, HMS (Health, Medicine, &Society), Jewish Studies, Latin American and Latino Studies, and WGSS(Women, Gender, & Sexuality Studies).Total required for graduation: 120 creditsFIRST-YEAR SEMINAR PROGRAMDuring their first academic year, preferably in the fall, every studentin the College of Arts and Sciences is required to enroll in a First-Year Seminar. College seminars provide an intimate and supportiveenvironment that facilitates the transition to university life. Within theseminar students develop skills that serve as a framework for their futurescholarly work – how to read closely, think critically, write clearly, learncooperatively, speak persuasively, and solve problems creatively.Courses in this program are an excellent way to explore a subjectthat may be new, or to enter more deeply into an area of previousinterest. Whatever the topic, FYSs emphasize reading assignments,papers, and oral presentations, while others include tests, laboratorywork, or fieldwork.JUNIOR-YEAR WRITING CERTIFICATIONThe faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences value writing as anessential tool for learning.  Writing well is indispensable for performingresponsibly in any profession and in most areas of life. Beyond the twoEnglish courses required in the first year, students are encouraged totake courses that provide continued practice in writing. In particular,each student must complete at least one “writing-intensive” course,normally during their junior year. Students must follow the guidelinesfor this requirement set up by their major department. Some majorprograms require the writing-intensive course be taken in the major field,while others allow it to be chosen freely from writing-intensive coursesoffered by any department or program. Courses that satisfy the writing-intensive requirement may also be used to fulfill major or distributionrequirements. Please note: only courses designated as "WI" on thecourse schedule, or select independent studies may be used to fulfillthis requirement. Transfer credits may not be used to meet the WritingIntensive requirement.MINOR PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGECertain departments, divisions, and programs in the College affordstudents an opportunity to minor in an additional field of concentrationother than their major field of study.Minors require a minimum of 15 credits, but the specific content isdetermined by the department, division, or program offering that minor.A minor is optional, and if successfully completed, will be shown onthe university transcript in the same manner as the major field. A 2.0minimum grade-point average is required for courses in the minor.Because of this requirement, no course in the minor program may betaken with Pass/Fail grading. No more than one course may be double-counted toward a major and a minor, and no more than one course mayoverlap between two minors.The following are established minors in the College of Arts andSciences:•Actuarial Science (Mathematics)•Africana Studies (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Anthropology•Applied Mathematics•Architecture•Art Lehigh University 2018-2019       55•Art History •Asian Studies (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Astronomy•Biology •Chemistry•Chinese •Classical Civilization (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Classics (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Cognitive Science (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Computer Science•Creative Writing•Data Science (Computer Science)•Design•Documentary Storymaking•Earth and Environmental Science•Economics•English•Environmental Studies (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Film Studies•French and Francophone Studies•German•Global Studies (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Graphic Design •Health, Medicine, and Society (Interdisciplinary Programs)•History•International Film (Modern Languages and Literatures)•International Relations•Japanese•Jewish Studies (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Journalism: Science and Environmental Writing •Latin (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Latin American and Latino Studies (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Military Science•Molecular Biology •Museum Studies (Art, Architecture, and Design)•Music•Music Industry•Philosophy•Physics•Political Science•Probability and Statistics •Product Design•Psychology•Public Administration (Political Science)•Religion Studies•Russian •Science, Technology, and Society (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Sociology •Sociology and Anthropology•Spanish and Hispanic Studies•Studio Art •Sustainable Development (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Theatre•Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (Interdisciplinary Programs)•Writing (English)*For minors outside of the College of Arts & Sciences, please seebelow. OPPORTUNITIESECKARDT SCHOLARS PROGRAMThe Eckardt Scholars Program is a highly selective and uniquehonors program in the College of Arts and Sciences. The programprioritizes intellectual curiosity, independent work, and close mentoringrelationships between students and faculty. Each incoming classincludes approximately twenty Eckardt Scholars. These students receiveunique academic privileges that provide them with great opportunitiesat Lehigh and beyond. Students in the program are exempt from theArts & Sciences distribution requirements and work with their majoradvisor and the Eckardt Scholars Program Director to create a flexiblecourse of study that best suits their academic interests and ambitions.Although exempt from distribution requirements, students will completethe requisite number of credits for their degrees and all correlativerequirements for their majors. The program includes participation in twoEckardt Scholar Seminars and completion of an independent project(e.g., a thesis, artistic creation, or other capstone experience) during thesenior year.Participation in the Eckardt Scholars Program is restricted to onlythe most well-qualified students. Some students are invited to enrollwhen first admitted to Lehigh, while others are identified by faculty andencouraged to apply during their first few semesters. Admission to theprogram is decided on the basis of academic records, written statementsof educational goals, and at least two faculty recommendations.FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDYStudents planning to pursue graduate study toward a doctorate shouldbe aware that most graduate schools require doctoral candidates todemonstrate a reading knowledge of one or two foreign languages.Proficiency in foreign languages is advantageous for careers in law,government, journalism, commerce, industry and other fields.INTERNSHIPSMany departments and programs offer credit for specific internshipexperiences. Students should consult with their home departmentfor information on arranging internships. The University faculty hasestablished three important criteria that must be met by all internships:80 hours of work are required for each credit awarded, no credit can beawarded for an internship ex post facto, and the student must registerfor the internship course during the same term that the internship workis performed. Students must pre-arrange all internship experiences withthe appropriate department. Internship credits cannot be awarded forwork experiences lacking a distinct, identifiable educational component.A memorandum of understanding circulated among the employer,student, and departmental internship course director helps to promotea common understanding of the educational and work objectives of theinternship. Students are advised that not all work experiences advertisedas “internships” warrant academic credit, even though they may beotherwise worthwhile.*For information on the Five-Year Bachelors Plus Master's ofEducation and Secondary Teacher Certification please see below. PRE-LAW PROGRAMIn keeping with the policy of the Association of American Law Schools,the university does not have a prescribed pre-law curriculum; however,Lehigh has a strong pre-law tradition. Successful candidates for lawschool demonstrate skills in critical analysis, logical reasoning, andcommunication and have pursued rigorous coursework of significantbreadth and depth. Lehigh students have attained entrance to lawschools from diverse curricula in all three of the undergraduate colleges.Specifically law-related courses are offered in the College of Arts andSciences (e.g. Constitutional Law and Politics, Civil Rights and CivilLiberties, Law and Order) and the College of Business and Economics(e.g., Introduction to Law and Legal Environment of Business).In addition to formal academic instruction, Lehigh provides otheropportunities for learning about the law and legal careers. The annualTresolini Lecture series brings nationally recognized speakers tocampus for extended interactions with faculty and students. Tresolinilecturers have included present and past U.S. and state Supreme Courtjustices and renowned legal scholars and practitioners. Lehigh alsoprovides opportunities for gaining academic credit in several off-campusprograms that provide practical experience in law and public affairs.Advising is available to prospective pre-law students on a continuousbasis from first-year orientation through the law school applicationprocess in the senior year. The pre-professional advisor in the Centerfor Career and Professional Development coordinates these pre-lawcounseling services.56         College of Arts and SciencesPRE-HEALTH PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMSSchools of medicine, dentistry, optometry, podiatry, and veterinarymedicine stress the importance of a strong liberal arts education aswell as prescribed studies in the sciences. Although most pre-healthstudents will choose a major in a pure or applied science, as long ascandidates have the essential courses in biology, chemistry, physics,and mathematics, they may major in any of the three undergraduatecolleges.A health professions advisory committee, which includes the pre-professional advisor and faculty members from the sciences and socialsciences, provides career and academic counseling and works closelywith students from first-year orientation through the entire process ofapplying to professional schools. Students with an interest in the healthprofessions are urged to consult with the pre-professional advisor in theCenter for Career and Professional Development as early as possible intheir academic career.Combined-Degree Program in DentistryIn cooperation with the School of Dental Medicine at the Universityof Pennsylvania, Lehigh offers an accelerated program that enablesselected students to earn both the baccalaureate degree (B.A.) with amajor in predental science and the doctor of dental medicine degree(D.M.D.) after seven years of study at the two institutions. In the firstthree academic years at Lehigh, credit hours are earned toward the 120credits required for the baccalaureate degree. The next four years arespent in the regular program of dental education at the Penn School ofDental Medicine in Philadelphia. By successfully completing their firstyear at the dental school, students acquire the necessary additionalcredit hours for the Lehigh baccalaureate degree.During their first three years at Lehigh, students are expected tomake satisfactory progress in prescribed academic areas as well asin the area of personal growth, developing those attributes ultimatelyneeded to become a dentist. Penn Dental School receives studentgrades and monitors student progress through feedback from Lehigh.Students are expected to attain specified grade point averages and DATscores. Students’ undergraduate credentials are processed through theAdmissions Committee of Penn Dental School before a final definitiveacceptance is offered. The dental college reserves the right to withdrawan acceptance, or require that a student spend additional time on theundergraduate level, on the grounds of academic or personal maturationconcerns.Application for admission to this program is made through Lehigh’sOffice of Admissions.

Founded in 1865 as a predominantly technical four-yearschool, the university now has approximately 4,700 undergraduateswithin its three major units, the College of Arts and Sciences, theCollege of Business and Economics, and the P. C. Rossin Collegeof Engineering and Applied Science, and approximately 2,100students enrolled in graduate programs offered through the graduateschools in these colleges and in the College of Education. There areundergraduates from nearly every state and U.S. territory and more than40 foreign nations.The university is primarily situated on the Asa Packer Campus on thenorth slope of South Mountain overlooking Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.Sayre Park, the wooded refuge located toward the top of the mountain,is the setting for many living groups. The residences are reached viawinding private roads. Many residential units on campus commanda panoramic view of the Lehigh Valley. The Appalachians are visibleto the west, with an especially good view from The Lookout on thePacker Campus. Both the tower and dining room in Iacocca Hall on theMountaintop Campus afford panoramic views of the Lehigh Valley. Thecampus at its highest point is 971 feet above sea level.A substantial portion of the upper level of Lehigh’s campus is maintainedas a nature preserve. The preserve supports deer, squirrels, chipmunks,raccoons, wild turkeys, and other birds.Besides the Asa Packer Campus, the university has extensive athleticfields and facilities on the Murray H. Goodman Campus, two miles tothe south in Saucon Valley. The university acquired the MountaintopCampus in 1986; it linked the Packer and Goodman campuses. In 2012,the university received a gift from the Donald B. and Dorothy L. StablerFoundation: 755 acres in nearby Upper Saucon Township. That broughttotal land holdings to 2,358 acres, making Lehigh one of the largestprivate universities in the country.The board of trustees and university officers have established andenforce policies designed to preserve Lehigh’s natural beauty. It is theircontention that the environment in which the young adult universitystudent pursues knowledge can make the total educational experiencemore meaningful, and that the ideal environment is separate and uniquefrom the distractions of the nonacademic community.There are approximately 480 full-time members of the faculty, teachinga total of more than 2,000 course titles (not all of which are offered everysemester). Among faculty members who are tenured and to whom theuniversity has a permanent commitment, nearly all hold the doctoratedegree (typically Ph.D. or Sc.D.).In total, there are more than 2,000 employees of the university, making itthe second-largest employer in the community.History and PurposeThe principal author of the brief history of Lehigh University that follows,Dr. W. Ross Yates, holds the bachelor of arts and master of artsdegrees from the University of Oregon, his native state. He receivedthe doctor of philosophy degree from Yale University and studied inFrance on a Fulbright Scholarship. He joined the Lehigh staff in 1955and served as dean of the College of Arts and Science from 1963 to1972.When the sound of the last cannon of the Civil War died away,statesmen, educators, and industrial pioneers marshalled the victoriousforces of the North and turned their attention to education. They wantedto increase the number of trained scientists, engineers, and other skilledpeople so they could transform the vast natural resources of the countryinto a strong and independent national economy.Asa Packer was one of the industrial pioneers. He built the Lehigh ValleyRailroad and controlled a coalmining empire in the mountains of easternPennsylvania. He knew, as did many others, that a strong nationaleconomy depended on more than technical skills. It needed above allpeople broadly educated in the liberal arts and sciences — people whocould combine practical skills with informed judgments and strong moralself-discipline. He kept this in mind when founding and endowing LehighUniversity.The site that Packer chose for his university was a railroad junctionacross the Lehigh River from Bethlehem, a community founded in 1741by Moravian missionaries. William Bacon Stevens, Episcopal bishop ofthe Diocese of Pennsylvania and the first president of the university’sboard of trustees, in 1869 described the origin of the university asfollows:“In the fall of 1864 an interview was requested of me by the Hon. AsaPacker, of Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe), Pa. He came to my house inPhiladelphia, and said that he had long contemplated doing somethingfor the benefit of his State, and especially of the Lehigh Valley. Fromthat valley he said he had derived much of the wealth which GOD hadgiven to him, and to the best interests of that valley he wished to devotea portion of it in the founding of some educational institution, for theintellectual and moral improvement of the young men of that region.“After conversing with him a little while, and drawing out his largeand liberal views, I asked him how much money he proposed to setaside for this institution, when he quietly answered that he deigned togive $500,000. At the time of this interview no one in this country, it isbelieved, had offered in a single sum such an endowment for a literaryinstitution. It was the noblest offering which an American had ever laidon the altar of learning, and more than equaled many royal donationswhich have carried down the names of kings as patrons of Europeanuniversities.“Filled with profound emotions at the mention of such a gift for such anobject, I asked the noble donor what specific plans he had dreamed inhis own mind in reference to it. His reply was, ‘I am not much acquaintedwith these matters, but you are, and I want you if you will to devise aplan which I can put into effective operation.’ I told him that I would makethe attempt. I did so. I drew up the outline sketch of such an institutionas I thought would give the largest results for the means used, andsubmitted it in a few weeks to his inspection.“He examined it with the practical judgment and business habits withwhich he deals with all great questions, and adopted the scheme as thebasis of his future university.“The first meeting of the Board of Trustees, selected by Judge Packer,met at the Sun Hotel, in Bethlehem, July 27th, 1865, and began toorganize the work before them.”The trustees followed several principles in setting up the university.One was that of combining scientific and classical education. Theyconsidered both to be practical. The principle carried forward an idealof the great 17th century Moravian educator, John Amos Comenius. Amotto taken from the works of Francis Bacon was used to summarizethis principle, namely, Homo minister et interpres naturae — man, theservant and interpreter of nature, to use a free translation. That mottolives on at Lehigh, being an element in the university seal.The trustees chose as first president a man whose education and habitsexpressed this principle, Henry Coppee. They established five schools,including a school of general literature in addition to four scientificschools of, respectively, civil engineering, mechanical engineering,mining and metallurgy, and analytical chemistry.Another principle upon which the trustees insisted was that of keepingthe size of the student body proportionate to the abilities of the facultyto teach them well. The university would admit only as many freshmeneach year as it could be assured of providing with the highest qualityof education. In the 19th century the total enrollment never exceededseveral hundred students; the size has increased significantly in recentdecades, along with the number of faculty members.The trustees also insisted that Lehigh was to be nondenominationaland would have an admission policy based on merit. Competitiveexaminations were held for applicants for admission. From 1871 to 1891no tuition was charged, but the national financial crisis at the turn of thecentury decimated the value of the Lehigh Valley Railroad stock thatPacker had given to Lehigh, which was the principal source of income.At first the student body was entirely male. The contemporary ideologicalclimate would permit nothing else. But around 1916, women wereadmitted to graduate programs. In 1971, the university opened itsLehigh University 2018-2019       455undergraduate program to them as well. Today men and womenapplicants are considered on an equal basis.From the first, the students were serious-minded. In 1924, CatherineDrinker Bowen, daughter of president Drinker and later a famousbiographer, published a brief history of Lehigh University, in which shecommented:“Ask any college professor which brand of boy he would prefer to teach,the cigarette brand or the flannel shirt variety. Right here we offer tento one the flannel shirts...Lehigh still holds to the emblem of the flannelshirt—long may it wave! Engineers come to college to work. A writerin the Syracuse Post in 1895 spoke truthfully when he said, ‘From thefirst, Lehigh’s characteristic has been her earnestness. It is the boastof her graduates, the inspiration of her students. Men go there to learnto take a useful part in the economy of life.’” The university communitywas constantly infused with new faculty and students determined torenew and rework the original principles in the light of changing times.The students’ ambition and zeal bore fruit; as alumni they carried theuniversity’s educational goals into the work of nation-building. And,having received, they gave to perpetuate Lehigh’s work of service.Today, Lehigh University still adheres to Asa Packer’s goal of a liberaland scientific education for practical service. Faculty and students workto maintain high quality in instructional programs. Generous supportfrom individuals, foundations, industry, and government help Lehighto retain high quality of education and faculty while keeping tuitionas low as possible. (Tuition covers only a part of the cost of a Lehigheducation.)Presidents of the UniversityThe presidents of Lehigh University are described and theirachievements cited in the following paragraphs. The years inparentheses are those served in the presidency.Henry Coppee (1866-1875). Coppee served as a railroad engineer inGeorgia, a captain in the Army during the Mexican War, and taught atWest Point and at the University of Pennsylvania before becoming firstpresident in 1866.Much building was done on the new university campus. A Moravianchurch on Packer Avenue was remodeled into Christmas Hall; a housefor the president was erected on campus; and Packer Hall, the universitycenter, was built.Coppee lectured in history, logic, rhetoric, political economy, andShakespeare.John McDowell Leavitt (1875-1880). Leavitt was an Episcopalclergyman who graduated from Jefferson College and taught at KenyonCollege and Ohio University. During his incumbency, the university wasdivided into two schools, General Literature and Technology. As of 1876,a student could receive two engineering degrees by taking a longercourse, and beginning in 1877 the master of arts, doctor of philosophy,and doctor of science degrees were established.Linderman Library rotunda was completed in 1877. Asa Packer diedin May 1879, and Founder’s Day was held in his honor the followingOctober.Robert Alexander Lamberton (1880-1893). Lamberton, a graduate ofDickinson College, practiced law in Harrisburg, Pa., and was a universitytrustee when asked to become president. During his administration,students and the community witnessed the first Mustard and Cheesedramatic presentation.A gymnasium (now Coppee Hall) was erected, and Chandler ChemistryLaboratory was built, now known as Chandler-Ullmann Hall. Lehigh wasalso building its reputation for academic excellence; the mechanicalengineering department was established in 1881 and the Lehigh chapterof Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1887.Thomas Messinger Drown (1895-1904). Drown studied medicine atthe University of Pennsylvania and went abroad to study chemistry.Thereafter he was professor of chemistry at Lafayette College. In 1895he assumed the presidency of Lehigh and was greatly interested infurthering the university’s development as a technical school.His first years were difficult ones because the Panic of 1893 decimatedthe university’s stock holdings in the Lehigh Valley Railroad.Nevertheless, Lehigh managed to grow in enrollment, academics, and inphysical plant. Williams Hall was completed. The curriculum leading to adegree in arts and engineering was established, as was the departmentof zoology and biology. New curricula were adopted in metallurgicalengineering, geology, and physics.Drown died in office in 1904. Professor William H. Chandler becameacting president.Henry Sturgis Drinker (1905-1920). Drinker, an 1871 Lehigh graduate,was the only university alumnus ever to become president. In 1907,the alumni endowment fund began, the Lehigh Alumni Bulletin was firstpublished in 1913, and the Alumni Association was incorporated in 1917.Drinker, besides being a lawyer, was a mechanical engineer and hadbeen largely instrumental in solving the problems of constructing thetwo-mile-long Musconetcong Tunnel, an engineering feat that madepossible a railroad line between Easton, Pa., and New York City. Hestarted a tradition of businesslike management of university affairs.During Drinker’s years, more buildings were completed: the originalsection of Fritz Engineering Laboratory, Drown Hall, Coxe MiningLaboratory, Taylor Hall, Taylor Gymnasium and Field House, TaylorStadium, and Lamberton Hall. Drinker’s interest in horticulture led to theplanting of many rare trees and plants.A teacher’s course and business administration course were begunin 1909 and in 1918 the university was divided into three colleges:liberal arts, business administration, and engineering — the roots of thecolleges of today. Army ROTC was established in 1919.Drinker’s daughter, Catherine Drinker Bowen, went on to become ahistorical writer of note. Her experiences as the daughter of a Lehighpresident and occupant of the President’s House are recorded in FamilyPortrait (Atlantic Little-Brown).Drinker resigned in 1920 and Natt M. Emery, vice president, served aschief executive officer until 1922.Charles Russ Richards (1922-1935). Richards took office in 1922.During his presidency, the first graduate degrees were awarded towomen. Lehigh faced a shortage of students from 1929 to 1936 as aresult of the Depression, but the newly established office of admission,as well as university scholarships, fellowships, and deferred tuitionpayments, helped to ease the shortage.Changing concepts of education were evident in several newlyorganized academic offerings: philosophy, music, psychology,journalism, history, and fine arts. The majors system was instituted aswere the senior comprehensive examinations in the Arts College. Theplacement bureau, a public relations office, and a student health servicewere organized.The Alumni Memorial Building, a memorial to the Lehigh alumni whoserved in World War I, was opened in 1925 and Packard Laboratory wascompleted in 1929. In the same decade, a major addition to LindermanLibrary also was completed.Clement C. Williams (1935-1944). Williams, a civil engineer,was president during an era of unprecedented alumni support.Undergraduate enrollment rose to an all-time high, passing 2,000 in1938. Richards and Drinker residential houses, and the Ullmann wingadjoining the Chandler Chemistry Laboratory, were built. Grace Hall,the first arena-type facility of any size on campus, was completed in1940, the gift of Eugene G. Grace, an 1899 graduate, who headed theboard of trustees. A Graduate School implemented the programs in thethree colleges. Williams retired in 1944, and the university was without apresident for approximately two years.Martin Dewey Whitaker (1946-1960). Dr. Whitaker, who had beendirector of the Atomic Energy Commission Laboratory at Oak Ridge,Tenn., and had worked in developing the atomic bomb, faced theresponsibility of helping the university community readjust to peacetimeconditions after World War II.During his time as president, Lehigh’s assets nearly tripled; theendowment more than doubled to $18 million. Many buildings wererenovated, and the Dravo House and McClintic-Marshall Houseresidence halls were built. The faculty increased in number by 75percent and the first endowed distinguished professorships wereestablished.456         Presidents of the UniversityThe Centennial development program was begun in 1959. It raised morethan $22 million for faculty salaries and construction that later includedWhitaker Laboratory.An extensive renovation and enlargement project associated withPacker Hall was undertaken in 1957, and, upon completion in 1958, thebuilding became a university center.Whitaker died in office.Harvey A. Neville (1961-1964). Dr. Neville was the only faculty memberever elected president. His association with the university began in 1927as an assistant professor of chemistry. During his three-year term aspresident, the first phase of the Saucon Valley athletic complex wascompleted, and Sayre Field was opened atop South Mountain. TheCenter for Information and Computing Science was established.Neville, a strong supporter of research who fostered its growth on thecampus, died in 1983.Deming Lewis (1964-1982). Willard Deming Lewis became Lehigh’s10th president after a distinguished career as a space engineer andresearch administrator.Dr. Lewis earned three degrees at Harvard and two from England’sOxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar in advancedmathematics. In 1941, he joined Bell Telephone Laboratories, andin 1962 he became general manager of systems development withBellcomm Inc., which engineered systems for the Apollo project thatplaced the first man on the moon.Lewis, who died in 1989, received 33 U.S. patents on such devices asmicrowave antennas and filter and digital error detection systems. Hehelped write the equations describing a stylus sliding through a warpedgroove.During Lewis’ tenure as Lehigh president, women were admitted asundergraduate students in 1971. New majors were begun in naturalscience, biology, social relations, geological sciences, environmentalscience and resource management, religion studies, computerengineering, computing and information science, applied mathematics,management science, American studies, and other fields. Six researchcenters and seven institutes were established.Capital campaigns brought in more than $130 million, and constructionwas completed on Maginnes Hall, Whitaker Lab, Mart Science andEngineering Library, Sinclair Lab, the Seeley G. Mudd Building, NevilleHall, Rathbone Hall dining room, 13 fraternity houses, the Centennial Iand Centennial II residential complexes, the Brodhead House residencehall, the Trembley Park student apartments, the Saucon VillageApartments, the Philip Rauch Field House, and the Stabler Athletic andConvocation Center. The restoration of Packer Memorial Church wascompleted, and Packard Lab was renovated.The original Physics Laboratory is now named in Lewis’ honor, as is theindoor tennis center.Peter Likins (1982-1997). Dr. Likins, who earned a B.S. and Ph.D. fromStanford, and an M.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,became Lehigh’s 11th president in 1982. He sought balanced excellencein undergraduate programs while pursuing focused objectives ingraduate study and research.Under Likins, Lehigh nearly doubled in size with the purchase in 1986 of742 acres of land and a research complex from Bethlehem Steel Corp.The new Mountaintop Campus links the Asa Packer and Goodmancampuses.Lehigh also added many new buildings and facilities. Perhaps mostnotable was the $33 million Zoellner Arts Center, which provided a newhome to Lehigh’s departments of music and theatre and to the UniversityArt Galleries, and made Lehigh a center for the fine arts. The arts centerand the new Rauch Business Center, home of the College of Businessand Economics, were built on the site of Taylor Stadium, which wasreplaced by Goodman Stadium on Lehigh’s athletic campus.Also during Likins’ term, Lehigh built a $20 million, state-of-the-arttelecommunications system, the E.W. Fairchild-Martindale Library andComputing Center, one of the most automated libraries anywhere, andthe Harold S. Mohler Lab, which honors the former chairman of theboard of trustees.Also dedicated was the Sherman Fairchild Center for the PhysicalSciences, which includes the renovated Physics Building (renamedLewis Lab), and the adjoining Sherman Fairchild Lab.Lehigh became home to the Northeast Tier Ben Franklin AdvancedTechnology Center, which has helped hundreds of new high-technologybusinesses get started. And the university led the way in establishingthe Colonial League, now the Patriot League, in football. The league iscommitted to the Lehigh tradition of scholar-athletes.Financial support grew from $10 million a year to over $24 million. Withover half of alumni making gifts, Lehigh ranked among the top Ph.D.-granting schools in percentage of alumni donors.Likins’ term also saw the establishment of the Lehigh Valley Center forJewish Studies at Lehigh, the Center for Advanced Technology for LargeStructural Systems, largest of its kind in North America, and centers inintegrated circuits, management studies, chemical process modelingand control, and international studies.Likins, an expert in spacecraft dynamics and control who has writtentextbooks in engineering mechanics, was one of 13 science advisers toPresident George H.W. Bush. He came to Lehigh after serving as deanof engineering and provost at Columbia, and left to become president ofthe University of Arizona.William C. Hittinger (1997-1998). A former chairman of the university’sboard of trustees, Hittinger became interim president after the departureof Peter Likins. A member of the National Academy of Engineering,Hittinger served for 22 years on the board of trustees. He graduatedfrom Lehigh in 1944 with a B.S. in metallurgical engineering, andreceived an honorary doctor of engineering degree from Lehigh in 1973.Over a 40-year career in the electronics industry, Hittinger workedfor Western Electric Co., National Union Radio Corp., Bell TelephoneLaboratories, Bellcomm Inc., General Instrument Corp., and RCA Corp.At Bellcomm, he oversaw systems engineering for NASA’s mannedspaceflight program, and at RCA, where he became executive vicepresident, he was responsible for corporate technology, patents,licensing, international business and marketing development, andcorporate technology planning.Hittinger was a member of President Reagan’s National SecurityTelecommunications Advisory Committee from 1982-86. He was alsoa member of the U.S.-Brazil Presidential Committee on Science andTechnology and a member of the board of directors for eight companies.Hittinger served as national president of the Lehigh Alumni Associationin 1971-72 and received the prestigious L-in-Life Award in 1979. AnROTC student at Lehigh, he served in the U.S. Army in 1943-46 duringWorld War II, rising to the rank of captain.During Hittinger’s term as chairman of the board of trustees, Lehighbegan construction of the Zoellner Arts Center, completed theUlrich Student Center, aggressively improved its financial aid forundergraduates, and completed the $300 million Campaign forPreserving The Vision. As president, Hittinger realigned the IacoccaInstitute into the College of Business and Economics, oversaw theconstruction of the new Sayre Park Village residential complex, andhelped Lehigh move forward during a time of presidential transition.Gregory C. Farrington (1998-2006). Dr. Farrington was appointedLehigh’s 12th president in May 1998 and served the university foreight years before stepping down in June 2006. Proclaiming on manyoccasions that “the only thing good enough for Lehigh is the best,”Farrington promoted academic excellence, improved facilities, andfostered collaborative relationships between Lehigh and the surroundingcommunity.Farrington earned his B.S. from Clarkson University and his A.M. andPh.D. from Harvard, all in chemistry and specializing in solid stateelectrochemistry. Before joining the University of Pennsylvania’sDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering in 1979, he was aresearch chemist for General Electric Company’s Corporate Researchand Development Center in New York State. At Penn, he served asdean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science. He holds orshares more than two dozen patents and has written or edited booksand book chapters, as well as 100 technical papers.Lehigh University 2018-2019       457While at Lehigh, Farrington established the university’s bold and creativeLehigh 2020 Initiative. Launched in October 2000, the $75-millionacademic venture capital fund focused investment on attracting andretaining the best faculty and students, creating distinctive academicprograms, funding critical research fields, and stimulating cross-curricular collaboration. New programs created through the 2020program include those in bioscience, bioengineering, applied lifescience, computer science and engineering, information systems andengineering, and bioeconomics.Along with the reinvigoration of academics and the promotion ofinterdisciplinary learning, Farrington also literally changed the face ofLehigh’s historic campus. More than 20 major campus enhancementprojects were completed during his term, among them the constructionof Campus Square, a new Alumni Building Arrival Court and parkinggarage, and a pedestrian walkway through the heart of the campusgreen, transforming it into a central gathering place. In addition, CoppeeHall, Lamberton Hall, Maginnes Hall, Wilbur Powerhouse, Grace Hall,the A. Haigh Cundey Varsity House, and Linderman Library wererenovated.Under Farrington’s leadership, Shine Forever: The Campaign for Lehighgenerated more than half of its $500 million goal to endow faculty chairs,scholarships, academic programs, and facilities.He also advocated collaborations with the city of Bethlehem, the stateand federal governments, industry, and other partners to strengthen theuniversity and spur regional economic development. His commitmentto the Lehigh Valley was evident in his participation on various boardsas well. He actively participated on the board of trustees of St. Luke’sHospital & Health Network, the National Museum of Industrial History,and Lehigh Valley Partnership.Alice P. Gast (2006-2014) became the 13th president of LehighUniversity on August 1, 2006.Before coming to Lehigh, Dr. Gast served as the vice president forresearch and associate provost at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, where she was also the Robert T. Haslam chair in chemicalengineering. Prior to joining MIT in 2001, she spent 16 years as aprofessor of chemical engineering at Stanford University and at theStanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.The focus of Dr. Gast’s research career was the study of surface andinterfacial phenomena, in particular the behavior of complex fluids. Herareas of research include colloidal aggregation and ordering, proteinlipid interactions, and enzyme reactions at surfaces. She is the co-authorof Physical Chemistry of Surfaces , a classic textbook on colloid andsurface phenomena, and has presented named lectures at several of thenation’s leading research institutions.Dr. Gast received her B.S. in chemical engineering from the Universityof Southern California. After earning her Ph.D. in chemical engineeringfrom Princeton University, she spent a postdoctoral year on aNATO fellowship at the Ecole Superieure de Physique et de ChimieIndustrielles in Paris.Dr. Gast has served on numerous advisory committees and boards,including the Board of the American Association for the Advancementof Science and the National Research Council Committee for Science,Technology, and the Law. In 2010, Dr. Gast was named to theprestigious post of science envoy by U.S. Secretary of State HillaryRodham Clinton and the U.S. State Department. In 2012, she wasappointed to the board of directors of Chevron Corporation.Kevin L. Clayton (2014-2015), former vice-chair of the university’sBoard of Trustees, became interim president after the departure of AliceGast. Mr. Clayton retired from the global investment management firmOaktree Capital Management, L.P., where he had a distinguished 19-year career.  He joined Oaktree in 1995 and founded their Marketing andClient Relations Department; he retired as principal and director of thefirm.Clayton earned his B.A. in government from Lehigh in 1984 and hisM.B.A. from St. Joseph’s University in 1988.  During his time at Lehigh,he served as a four-year class president; as a member of the NewmanAssociation and Alpha Tau Omega; and was elected to OmicronDelta Kappa, the national leadership honor society.  He continued hisservice to Lehigh as a member of the Board of Trustees during theperiod 1993-1999 and again from 2005-2014.  As a member of theBoard, Clayton served on the Finance Committee, Endowment FundInvestment Committee, Campus Planning and Operations Committee,Student Affairs Committee, and Advancement Committee.  He alsoserved on the Dean’s Advisory Council for the College of Business andEconomics.Clayton and his family have long-standing ties to Lehigh. His late father,William Clayton ’51, was a Lehigh trustee for more than 20 years andwas a member of the Executive Committee of the Board.  In honor ofhis parents, Clayton and his wife, Lisa, established the William L. andCarol L. Clayton Endowed Scholarship Fund in 2003.  In 2008 theyestablished the Lisa A. and Kevin L. Clayton ’84 Endowed ScholarshipFund to support students enrolled in Lehigh's South Mountain College.  Their contributions also include supporting the Annual Fund, theAthletics Partnership Program, and the Dean’s Strategic Initiative.  TheClaytons' son, Patrick ’13, became a member of the third generation ofClaytons to earn a Lehigh degree.John D. Simon (2015-present) was installed as Lehigh’s 14th presidentduring the annual Founder's Day ceremony on October 2, 2015. Beforecoming to Lehigh, Dr. Simon was executive vice president and provostat the University of Virginia.

The first recipient,T.H. Hardcastle, of the Class of 1880, wrote his thesis on AlexanderPope, entitled it The Rights of Man, and read it aloud at commencementin June 1882.The first Ph.D. was granted in 1893 to Joseph W. Richards, Classof 1886. Richards, who had a background in metallurgy andelectrochemistry, taught at Lehigh until his death in 1921.Women were admitted to the graduate program in 1918 when the facultyand the board of trustees agreed to grant the degrees of M.A. and M.S.to women, provided they attended classes in the late afternoon andon Saturdays “so that the general character of campus life shall not beaffected.” Three women received graduate degrees in 1921, the firstwomen to complete graduate work at Lehigh. In 1929, the rule waschanged, and women were admitted on much the same basis as men.In 1936, the Graduate School was established to administer thegraduate program. The Ph.D., which was temporarily discontinuedin 1894, was reinstated in nine departments: chemistry, chemicalengineering, civil engineering, geology, history, mathematics,mechanical engineering, metallurgical engineering, and physics.Tomlinson Fort, professor of mathematics, was selected in 1938 as thefirst dean of the Graduate School.In 1995, graduate programs were decentralized and are nowadministered by the four colleges of the university, as described below.COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCESDonald Hall, deanDominic Packer, associate dean for research and graduate programsThe College of Arts and Sciences offers graduate degrees in thehumanities, social sciences, mathematics, and natural sciences. Themaster of arts, master of science, and the doctor of philosophy degreesare given in most of the traditional academic departments and in someinterdisciplinary programs. Advanced degrees may be obtained in thedepartments of biological sciences, chemistry, earth and environmentalsciences, english, history, mathematics, physics, political science,psychology, and sociology. In addition, interdisciplinary degrees areavailable in American studies, environmental policy design, photonics,and polymer science and engineering.Although degree requirements vary from department to department,most require a combination of formal coursework and independentresearch. Students work closely with a faculty adviser in formulating andcarrying out their research programs. Students admitted to a traditionaldepartment who are interested in an interdisciplinary approach maydesign a program of study and research which draws on faculty andfacilities in other areas of the college or university.For the most up to date information, interested students should checkthe CAS graduate website (http://cas.lehigh.edu/grad) or contactthe Office of Research and Graduate Programs, College of Arts andSciences, 9 West Packer Ave., Bethlehem, PA. 18015, 610-758-4281 oremail to incasgrd@lehigh.edu.COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICSGeorgette Chapman Phillips, DeanYuliang Yao, Associate DeanThe College of Business and Economics offers the master of sciencedegree in accounting and information analysis; master of sciencedegree in applied economics; master of science degree in management;master of business administration with concentrations in businessadministration, corporate entrepreneurship, finance, marketing,international business, project management and supply chainmanagement; and the doctor of philosophy degree in business andeconomics.

Rossin College of Engineering and AppliedScience is most often related to the college’s extensive researchactivity, and graduate students are expected to engage in analytical orexperimental research as part of their programs of study. This activityinvolves students in the process of creating new knowledge under thedirection of the college’s distinguished faculty and brings them intocontact with some of the most modern and advanced experimentaltechniques. Many college research programs are supported bycontracts, fellowships, and grants from industry and from federal, state,and local governments. This funding not only provides financial supportfor outstanding students but also allows them to deal with some of themore complex and pressing problems facing our society in the 21stcentury.Many faculty members and graduate students in the P.C. RossinCollege of Engineering and Applied Science are associated withinterdisciplinary research centers and institutes as well their owndepartments. The opportunity for interdisciplinary study allows themto cross departmental lines in specific technological areas and to workwith faculty and graduate students from other departments. Centersand institutes perform research that fall under five broad categories:  materials and nanotechnology, infrastructural systems, applied lifescience and bioengineering, energy and the environment, and complexengineering systems. Information on individual centers and specificresearch activities can be found at URL www.lehigh.edu/engineering/research/centers/.  Extensive research in many of these areas is alsoconducted within academic departments.Further information on the graduate programs may be obtained throughthe Office of Graduate Studies and Research, P.C.

Doctor of philosophy degrees in Chemistry andPolymer science and engineering may be obtained by study andresearch in any appropriate area of chemistry.The following information on admissions, proficiency examinations andother policies applies to both doctor of philosophy degrees in chemistry.Admission to graduate study in chemistry assumes that a student hasmet, or is willing to meet though further study, minimum undergraduaterequirements for a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. This would include(beyond two semesters of introductory chemistry) two semesters oforganic chemistry, two semesters of physical chemistry, two semestersof analytical chemistry and one semester of inorganic chemistry. Apromising student whose degree is in a field related to chemistry (e.g.,biology, chemical engineering) may be admitted to graduate study inchemistry provided that any deficiencies in basic chemistry preparationare made up in the first year of graduate study, noting that some of thecourses required for this may not carry graduate credit.The Chemistry Department administers proficiency examinations at theadvanced undergraduate level in analytical, biochemistry, inorganic,organic and physical chemistry to all regular graduate students atthe time of matriculation. Each student is required to take threeexaminations. Information regarding material to be covered on theseexaminations will be sent to each student several months in advance ofmatriculation. It is expected that each student will prepare diligently forthese tests. A Ph.D. candidate must show proficiency in three areas.  Anincoming student who fails one or more of the examinations will haveto two additional opportunities to demonstrate proficiency by re-takingthe examination(s).  The student is highly encouraged to meet with theGraduate Advising Director to determine the best course of action inlight of the exam performance and projected area of study.  The studentmay prepare for the examination(s) by self-study and/or enrolling in orauditing of appropriate courses, and is strongly encouraged to seekfaculty advice on preparing to retake any exam.Doctor of Philosophy DegreeCompletion of a doctor of philosophy degree program normally requiresa minimum of four years fulltime work after entrance with a bachelor’sdegree. There are few specific course credit requirements for the Ph.D.;however, approved degree programs generally have at least 24 hoursof course work (including any applied toward a master’s degree) and 6credits of research. Thus, the program consists of approximately one-third formal course work and two-thirds independent study and research.There is a two-credit seminar requirement ( or  or  and & , , , covering the same material but at a slower pace.The , & & &  or , but taught from a more thorough andrigorous point of view.Attribute/Distribution: M or .

There are also several formal researchrequirements of the program.First-Year ApprenticeshipFirst-year students are expected to choose an advisor and begin to workon research projects as early as possible. An oral report of the student’sresearch activities is made to the department. Students will submit adraft Master's Thesis Proposal by June 1 of the first year of the Ph.D.program.Master’s ThesisA master’s thesis (usually empirical or data-based) is required. An oralpresentation of the thesis is made to the department. Students enteringwith a master’s degree may instead conduct an equivalent non-degreePre-dissertation Project.Third-Year independent scholarly activity Third year students will work toward formulation of their dissertationproposal by completing a literature review or writing a small grantproposal. By the end of the third year of the Ph.D. program, students willchoose a dissertation committee, and meet to report on their researchactivities.Doctoral DissertationThis is an original piece of scholarly work usually involving empiricalresearch, although original theoretical or historical research is possiblewith faculty approval.Course work For the Ph.D., the minimum course requirements include:•Three core courses covering cognitive psychology ( Introduction to Psychology 4 CreditsPsychology as a science of behavior.

These decisions are made on the basis of federal,state and institutional policies. Any refunds due to the Title IV programswill be refunded in the following order:Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford LoanFederal Direct Subsidized Stafford LoanFederal Perkins LoanDirect PLUS LoanFederal Pell GrantFederal SEOGAny other Title IV programFinancial AidThe mission of the Office of Financial Aid is to reduce the financialbarriers to a Lehigh education for those families whose resourcesalone would make it impossible to meet the cost of attendance.  Weare committed to meeting 100% of demonstrated need for all admittedundergraduate students and strongly believe that this commitment,along with a cooperative and willing family partnership, can make aLehigh University education an attainable goal.Our aid program is designed to measure the difference betweenour costs and the amount of money your family can be expected tocontribute towards those costs. That difference is called “financial need”and represents financial aid eligibility. The majority of Lehigh’s funds areawarded on the basis of financial need. Students must file on time andmeet academic progress requirements to be eligible for consideration.The basic components of financial aid consist of gift aid (grants andscholarships) and self help (employment and loan assistance). Gift aidis generally not repayable. The majority are awarded on the basis of“need” and are renewable on the basis of continuing “need”, satisfactoryacademic progress criteria and on time filing. Employment providesmoney for books and personal expenses, and is paid through biweekly12         Application Procedurespayroll checks based on hours worked. Loans are repayable funds fromone or more sources, repayable after the student ceases to be enrolledon at least a halftime basis.Additional sources of aid include, but are not limited to: state agencies,employers, and various clubs, churches, religious and fraternalorganizations, and foundations. High school guidance counselors areable to provide information about local aid programs.For more detailed information, please visit the financial aid office websiteat www.lehigh.edu/financialaid.Application ProceduresAPPLICATION PROCEDURES  Statistical Methods; Statistical Methods, Statistical Methods, is an acceptable alternative.

In order to maintain federal and institutional grant eligibilityfrom one academic year to the next, students must continue todemonstrate financial need. Changes in circumstances such assibling(s) enrollment in undergraduate college, changes in householdsize or changes in income may result in a change in financial aideligibility. For more detailed information such as deadlines and linksto forms, please visit the financial aid website at www.lehigh.edu/financialaid.All students receiving financial aid must maintain satisfactory academicprogress.  Satisfactory academic progress for Federal financial aideligibility differs from the academic progress policy for institutional aid.

Students mustachieve a minimum cumulative GPA of a 1.70 after their freshman year(earning between 0 and 22 credits) and a minimum cumulative GPAof 2.0 for all other grade levels (23 credits and above).  Per FederalGuidelines, students have a maximum of 12 semesters of Federal Aidto complete their graduate requirements (aggregate loan limits apply aswell).  Students must successfully complete a minimum of 67% of theirattempted coursework.In order to maintain eligibility for Institutional financial aid, studentsmust 1.) Earn 12 new credits each semester, 2.) Earn a minimum gradepoint average of 2.0 for each semester, and 3.) Maintain a minimumcumulative grade point average of 2.0.  Eligibility for institutionalaid at Lehigh University is limited to Undergraduate enrollment in 8consecutive semesters (unless you are enrolled in IBE, IDEAS or ArtEngineering).  NOTE: Institutional aid is provided to assist students inobtaining a bachelor’s degree.  Additional aid will not be available tostudents who choose to enhance their bachelor’s degree with additionalcredentials (ie. second major/minors) and are unable to do so during the8 consecutive semesters.For both Federal and Institutional aid purposes, academic progresswill be checked annually, at the end of each payment period, unless astudent is on Financial Aid Probation, in which case SAP will be checkedat the end of each semester.Sources of University AidSeveral forms of university-funded aid, based on need and merit, areavailable.LEHIGH UNIVERSITY GRANTS [ENDOWED AND SPONSOREDSCHOLARSHIPS]Lehigh Grants are need-based awards funded through university fundsand endowments established by generous alumni and friends of theuniversity.

Furthermore, our expectation is that bothparents, regardless of marital status, have a responsibility toparticipate in the financial aid process. •Expected Family Contribution: Lehigh financial aid counselorscarefully review the information your family provides in the financialaid application, including any additional circumstances brought toour attention, in order to determine the Expected Family Contribution(http://www1.lehigh.edu/financialaid/glossary), also known as the“EFC."  It is important to understand that the Expected FamilyContribution is not what we think a family has “left over” after otherexpenses have been covered, and we do not necessarily expect thatthe parent contribution will be paid from current income.  Rather,the level of contribution reflects our analysis of what parents canafford to absorb in education costs over time.  Parents may chooseto provide their contribution from savings, current income, futureincome (through borrowing), or some combination.•Determining Need-Based Financial Aid Eligibility: Need-basedeligibility is calculated per academic year and is determined usingthe following formula:Cost of attendance for one academic year - calculated EFC =financial need•Merit-Based Financial Aid: All students are considered for meritaid at the time of admission.  Students who are selected to receivea merit-based scholarship will be notified when they are admittedto the University.  The Office of Financial Aid does not determineeligibility for merit scholarships (academic, athletic or otherwise),and the application process described on our website is notrelated to these resources.  View more information on Lehigh meritscholarships > (http://www1.lehigh.edu/admissions/undergrad/tuition)If a student has demonstrated financial need (http://www1.lehigh.edu/financialaid/glossary), this financial need will be covered with acombination of gift-aid (http://www1.lehigh.edu/financialaid/glossary) andself-help (http://www1.lehigh.edu/financialaid/glossary).Student Rights and ResponsibilitiesSTUDENT RIGHTSStudents have the right to know•the cost of attendance;•the refund policy for students who withdraw;•the financial assistance available from federal, state and institutionalsources;•procedures and deadlines for submitting applications for financialaid;•how financial aid recipients are selected;•how eligibility was determined, including all resources the aid officeconsidered available to the student;•how and when funds will be disbursed;•an explanation of each type of award received;•for any student loan received: the interest rate, total amount to berepaid, when repayment begins, the length of the repayment period,and the cancellation or deferment provisions of the loan;•for any Federal Work-Study or university-funded job: a description ofthe job, the hours to be worked, the rate of pay, and how and whenthe student will be paid;•the criteria used to determine satisfactory academic progress forfinancial aid purposes; and•how to appeal a decision by the Office of Financial Aid concerningany aid award.STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIESIt is the student’s responsibility to:•read directions thoroughly, complete all application forms accurately,and to comply with any deadlines;•provide any supplemental information or documentation required bythe Office of Financial Aid or other agency if applicable;•read, understand, and keep copies of any forms the student isrequired to sign;•repay any student loans received;•attend an entrance interview and an exit interview if federal, state oruniversity loans are received while in attendance at Lehigh;•notify the Office of Financial Aid of any change in enrollment statusor financial status (including any scholarships or grants receivedfrom outside sources); changes of address and enrollment statusmust also be reported to lender(s) for any loan(s);•satisfactorily perform the work agreed upon in a Federal Work-Studyor university-funded work program; and•know and comply with all requirements for continuation of financialaid, including satisfactory academic progress requirements.For additional information write to the Office of Financial Aid, LehighUniversity, 27 Memorial Drive W, Bethlehem, -2019 PER CREDIT HOURCollege of Arts & Sciences$1,500College of Business & Economics$1,075College of Education, and for fulltime elementary andsecondary teachers and administrators enrolled in theother three colleges$565College of Engineering & Applied Science$1,500Special Programs MBA & Engineering$1,500MBA/Educational Leadership$825MS/Analytical Finance$1,500MS Accounting and Information Analysis$1,235M² - Masters of Science in Management - 9 monthprogram (30 credits)$47,950Accelerated MBA (1-year)$64,750Audit charge per course – same as credit charge in theappropriate collegeMaintenance of candidacy – same as a one-credit chargein the appropriate collegeMaster's candidate registration fee – same as a onecreditcharge in the appropriate collegeLIVING ACCOMMODATIONSThe university maintains a graduate student housing complex in theSaucon Valley that has 135 living units.

Inquire in your department.Financial AidFinancial aid is available only for regular, full-time graduate students.Teaching assistantships, research assistantships, graduateassistantships, fellowships, and scholarships are academic awardsmade by individual academic departments. Several graduateassistantships unrelated to a particular area of study can be obtainedby applying to administrative offices. International students are alsoencouraged to apply for funding to outside sponsoring agencies and/orhome governments. Finally, please note that all student loan programsare administered by the Office of Financial Aid located at 27 MemorialDrive West. (Please read the section below regarding loans and work-study.)ACADEMIC AWARDSRequests for fellowships, scholarships, research assistantships,teaching assistantships, and graduate assistantships to begin in the fallsemester must be filed with academic departments no later than January15. (Some departments have earlier deadlines.) Generally, a specialcommittee formed by department faculty selects the recipients of theseawards based upon merit; students are not required to submit a financialstatement.In addition to their stipends, graduate students holding half-time teachingappointments generally receive tuition remission. Fellowship holdersalso receive a stipend and tuition award. Scholarship recipients areawarded tuition. Research assistants receive a stipend for researchservices, but their tuition is commonly paid directly by research projects.TEACHING ASSISTANTS AND GRADUATE ASSISTANTSTeaching assistant and graduate assistant (TA/GA) are technical termsused to describe specific types of Lehigh University graduate students.The duties of TAs and GAs are generally set by the departments oroffices that appoint them, but certain conditions must be satisfiedbefore a student can be classified as a teaching assistant or a graduateassistant. These include:•Each TA/GA must be a regular full-time resident Lehigh graduatestudent, which normally requires registration for at least nine credithours per semester.•A TA/GA is a half-time position and each TA/GA provides services toLehigh University of up to twenty hours per week. Quarter-time andeighth-time TA/GA appointments are possible for full-time residentgraduate students, with stipends and tuition remission appropriatelyreduced.•Each TA/GA must be paid a specific stipend, which is set forthe academic year by the dean of the appropriate college afterconsultation with the Director of Budget.•Qualified TAs/GAs receive tuition remission for at most ten credithours in a regular semester. No TA/GA may register for more thanten credit hours. A student who is a TA/GA during the precedingacademic year is entitled to at most three hours of thesis, research,or dissertation registration (not course credit) in the followingsummer without payment of tuition (except in the College ofEducation).•Each TA/GA is appointed by a process which begins with aformal letter of appointment issued by the appropriate departmentchairperson. The appointment letter specifies standard universityconditions including stipend level, time of arrival, length of service,and the requirement of satisfactory academic progress andperformance of duties. Each department chairperson submits writtennotification of TA/GA appointments to the appropriate college deanor vice president.The Graduate and Research Committee endorsed academic guidelinesfor new teaching assistants which exceed minimum admissionrequirements. Each TA should satisfy one of the following: have a GPAof 3.0 or better in the undergraduate major field of study; have a GPAof 3.5 in the senior year major field; rank in the 85th percentile or higheron the Graduate Record Exam or other standardized test; or have aGPA of 3.5 in at least twelve hours of graduate work in the major field.Exceptions to these guidelines shall be made only with the approval ofthe appropriate dean.In addition, each teaching assistant must make normal progress towarda graduate degree. The definition of normal progress may vary amongdepartments, but the criteria for satisfactory progress are establishedby the department faculty and the Graduate and Research Committee.Teaching assistants who fail to satisfy these criteria are ineligible forreappointment.In addition to achieving the minimum TOEFL iBT scores necessaryfor admission, potential Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistantswhose first language is not English who will be working with Lehighundergraduates in academic settings (classrooms, recitations, labs,office hours, etc.) must pass Lehigh University’s Test of Presentationand Speaking Skills (TOPSS) prior to beginning their instructionalresponsibilities. At the Department’s discretion, students who score inthe conditional range on the TOPSS may be appointed as a TA or GAbut will be required to attend English as a Second Language courses,re-take the TOPSS, and achieve a passing score within one semester.Tuition remission for qualified TAs/GAs is authorized by the appropriatedean or vice president as part of the registration process. Each collegedean or appropriate vice president will be provided tuition remissionaccounts against which TA/GA remissions will be charged. The accountswill be budgeted at an amount equal to the nine-hour TA/GA tuition ratetimes the approved number of TA/GA positions and will be includedin the annual operating budget. The budgets shall not be exceeded.If additional TA/GA positions are desired on a temporary basis, theaccount executive must provide for the transfer of budget support to theremission account. These budgets are to be used exclusively for tuitionremission for authorized TA/GA positions.There are a limited number of summer TA/GA appointments. These TA/GAs must receive the same monthly stipend as academic year TAs/GAsand devote up to twenty hours per week to the GA/TA responsibilities.A summer TA/GA registers for a maximum of three credit hours in eachsummer session of appointment and receives tuition remission for thatregistration.OTHER GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPSGraduate students may apply directly to administrative offices forgraduate assistantships unrelated to their areas of study. The availabilityof these assistantships is based upon the needs of the individualdepartments. GAs are appointed regularly by the office of the viceprovost for student affairs, the dean of students office, the universitycounseling service, and by career services.LOANS AND WORK-STUDY AWARDSGraduate students may apply for Federally funded loans (DirectUnsubsidized Loan or Graduate PLUS Loan) through the Office ofFinancial Aid. Federal funds are awarded using the Free Application forFederal Student Aid (FAFSA) which can be completed on the web atwww.fafsa.ed.gov.  In addition to the FAFSA, Lehigh University requiresa university application (Graduate Student Financial Aid Application). Applications for Federal loans cannot be processed and funds cannot bedisbursed, until the FAFSA is received and reviewed.38         Degree InformationEligibility for student loans is based on the number of credits to betaken and the total amount of assistance received. Any change tothe number of credits to be taken or the amount of aid received mayaffect loan eligibility. To avoid problems with your loan application, itis important that you notify the Office of Financial Aid of any changesin your enrollment or in the amount of aid received. It is the student’sresponsibility to notify the Office of Financial Aid of any changes.Visit the Office of Financial Aid website for additional information:www.lehigh.edu/financialaidDegree InformationThe following degrees are offered by the university: the master ofarts, the master of business administration, the master of businessadministration and educational leadership, the master of businessadministration and engineering, the master of education, the master ofengineering, the master of science, the doctor of philosophy, the doctorof education, and the doctor of arts.Students pursuing multiple graduate level degrees must meet minimumunique degree credit-hour requirement for courses taken at Lehigh. Asingle master’s degree requires a minimum of 30 credits (see transfercredit policy for any exceptions); a single doctoral degree requires aminimum of 72 credits, or 48 for a student with a prior master’s degree.A student seeking two master’s degrees will be required to take at least60 credits at Lehigh, but may petition to transfer in credits towards thefirst master’s degree. No credit used for a master’s degree may becounted towards reducing the minimum requirement of 48 Lehigh credithours for a doctoral degree.Candidates for the master’s degree have six years in which to completetheir programs. Students should confer with their advisers to be certainthat specific department and program course requirements are met. Thefollowing requirements must be satisfied by master’s candidates in alldepartments.PROGRAM FOR THE MASTER’S DEGREEA student’s program must include: not less than 30 credit hours ofgraduate work; not less than 18 credits of 400-level coursework(research or thesis registration counts as part of the 400-levelcoursework requirement); and not less than 18 credits of courseworkin the major, of which 15 credits must be at the 400 level. Courseworkfor the master’s degree must be taken under at least two instructorsand must be approved by Lehigh University. With the approval of thedepartment chair, between 9 and 15 credits of graduate courseworktaken elsewhere may be transferred to a Lehigh master’s program.The number of credits that may be transferred depends on the numberof credits in the master’s program: Up to 9 credits for programs of 36credits or less; up to 12 credits for programs of 37 to 48 credits; and upto 15 credits for programs of 49 to 60 credits.  Programs, departmentsand colleges may have more restrictive transfer rules, however, andstudents should consult their program offices to learn of any suchrestrictions.Course transfers require submission of completed course-transferpetitions, with course descriptions and transcripts, as well asdepartmental recommendation. Final course marks of B or betterare required, such courses may not have been applied toward anyprior degree, the courses must have been completed at an institutionaccredited by one of the six regional accrediting associations, andthose courses must have been completed within four years of the firstenrollment in the Lehigh master’s program.Students pursuing a second Lehigh master’s degree can apply alimited number of credits to both the first and second masters degrees.Individual program requirements limit the level to which this can bedone, but in all cases the credits counted toward any single mastersdegree cannot include more than 50% of credits that are also utilized tosatisfy a second masters degree.A student must complete the form, “Program for Master’s Degree,”setting forth the courses proposed to satisfy the degree requirements.This form should be approved by the department and then submitted toRegistration & Academic Services as soon as possible after 15 credithours toward the degree have been completed. Approval of the programby Registration & Academic Services signifies that the student hasformally been admitted to candidacy for the master’s degree.THESIS AND COMPREHENSIVE EXAMCandidates in some programs may be required to submit a thesis ora report based on a research course of at least three credit hours, orto pass a comprehensive examination given by the major department.The department will specify which of these requirements apply and mayrequire both. If required, the thesis or report shall not count for morethan six credit hours, and thesis registration is limited to a maximumof six credit hours. If the thesis or research project involves humansubjects, the student must complete the university human subjectsreview packet and receive written approval from the InstitutionalReview Board. All approved thesis/dissertations copies must besubmitted by the appropriate deadlines in electronic form by followingthe procedures and guidelines found on the LTS Web site URL: http://libraryguides.lehigh.edu/etd.  Please contact your college dean’s officefor further clarification.A non-thesis option exists for certain programs in the Colleges. Studentsshould check with their departments regarding that option.PROGRAM FOR THE DOCTORAL DEGREEA candidate for the doctor of philosophy degree ordinarily is expectedto devote at least three academic years to graduate work. In no case isthe degree awarded to someone who has completed fewer than two fullacademic years of graduate work. All post-baccalaureate work towardthe doctorate must be completed within ten years. A student beginningdoctoral coursework after an elapsed period of at least one semesterafter the master’s degree has been conferred is granted seven years inwhich to complete the doctoral program.Doctoral students whose graduate study is carried out entirely atLehigh University must register for a minimum of 72 credits beyondthe bachelor’s degree.  Students who have earned a master’s degreeat another university must register for a minimum of 48 credits. Theserequirements include registration for research or dissertation credits.Students participating in approved dual-degree doctoral programsinvolving external institutions may transfer up to 25% of their totalrequired doctoral program research credits to Lehigh for work that wasperformed at the external partner institution. Approval of such programsis required by the dean of the relevant Lehigh college.Full-time students working toward the doctorate normally register fora minimum of nine credits each semester. If the minimum degreeregistration requirement of 72 or 48 credits is attained prior to formaladmission to doctoral candidacy, continued registration of at leastthree credits per semester is necessary. Such registration does notautomatically grant full-time student status, however. Full-time studentstatus must be confirmed on the graduate full-time certification form.Students seeking to receive both a master’s degree and a doctoraldegree must complete a minimum of 72 graduate credits at Lehigh andmust meet all requirements of both degrees.After admission to doctoral candidacy, a student must maintaincandidacy by registering at least two times each calendar year (in eachacademic semester or in one academic semester and one summersession). After completion of the minimum registration requirement, plusany additional requirements of the student’s department or program,students are permitted to register for ‘Maintenance of Candidacy’ andwill be charged a single credit hour of graduate tuition at the appropriaterate for the degree program in which they are enrolled. Full-time statusmust be certified on the full-time certification form each semester.CONCENTRATED LEARNING REQUIREMENTEach doctoral degree candidate must satisfy Lehigh’s concentratedlearning requirement. This requirement is intended to ensure thatdoctoral students spend a period of concentrated study and intellectualassociation with other scholars. Two semesters of full-time Lehighgraduate study, or 18 credit hours of Lehigh graduate study, either on oroff campus, within a fifteen-month period must be completed.Individual departments may impose additional stipulations. Candidatesshould check with their advisers to be certain that they have satisfiedtheir concentrated learning requirements.Lehigh University 2018-2019       39LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTSLanguage requirements for the Ph.D. are the option of, and in thejurisdiction of, the candidate’s department. Since proficiency in alanguage is not a university requirement, each department decideswhich languages, if any, constitute part of the doctoral program.QUALIFIERSMany departments require students who wish to enroll in doctoralprograms to pass qualifying examinations. Since these examinationsvary among departments, students should ask their advisers ordepartment chairpersons for more detailed information. If a qualifyingexamination is not used, students should find out how and wheneligibility to pursue doctoral studies is determined.ADMISSION TO CANDIDACYWith the help of an academic adviser, the student names the facultymembers of the doctoral committee, a special committee formed toguide the student through the doctoral program. The committee isresponsible for assisting the student in formulating a course of study,satisfying specific departmental requirements, submitting a suitabledissertation proposal and for overseeing progress in research, andevaluating the completed dissertation. At least four faculty are appointedto the committee; one must be a member of an outside department.Committee membership must be approved by the university’s Graduateand Research Committee or its designee.A doctoral student should apply for candidacy no later than two yearsafter completion of the master’s degree or its equivalent and afterpassing qualifying examinations, if they are required by the majordepartment. The prospective doctoral candidate must submit tothe doctoral committee a written program proposal that includes adiscussion of proposed dissertation research. Upon receiving committeeapproval of the proposal, the candidate submits the proposal, signedby the committee members, to the appropriate dean for action by theGraduate and Research Committee or its designee. The dean will advisethe student of the committee’s decision.If the dissertation research involves human subjects, all researchprocedures and instruments must be approved by Lehigh University’sInstitutional Review Board (IRB) prior to the involvement of the subjects.GENERAL EXAMINATIONSExaminations composed and administered by the members of thestudent’s doctoral committee are designed to test the candidate’sproficiency in a particular field of study. These examinations, which maybe either written or oral, should be passed at least seven months beforethe degree is to be conferred. If a student fails the general examination,a second examination may be scheduled not earlier than five monthsafter the first. If the results of the second examination are unsatisfactory,no additional examination is scheduled.DISSERTATION AND DEFENSEThe doctoral candidate is required to write a dissertation preparedunder the direction of a Lehigh University professor. The dissertationmust address a topic related to the candidate’s specialty in the majorsubject, show the results of original research, provide evidence of highscholarship, and make a significant contribution to knowledge in thefield.Upon approval of the advising professor and, if required by thedepartment, secondary readers, the final draft of the dissertation issubmitted to the appropriate dean (or designee) for inspection by thedate posted in the academic calendar. Upon its return, the studentshould distribute copies of the draft to the members of the doctoralcommittee for review and for suggestions for revision. The candidatethen schedules a dissertation defense before the doctoral committee,additional faculty members the department may add to the examiningcommittee, and the general public. After the dissertation has beendefended and revised accordingly, the student must submit the finisheddissertation to the appropriate dean for review by the university’sGraduate and Research Committee (or its designee) no later thanthe date specified in the academic calendar for completion of alldegree requirements. All approved dissertations must be submittedby the appropriate deadlines in electronic form by following theprocedures and guidelines found on the LTS Web site URL: http://libraryguides.lehigh.edu/etd. Please contact your college dean’s officefor further clarification. Guidelines stipulating the standard form of thedissertation are available in the dean’s office.Graduate Studies OrganizationsTHE GRADUATE AND RESEARCH COMMITTEEThe Graduate and Research Committee consists of twelve membersrepresenting the faculties of Lehigh’s colleges: four from the College ofArts and Sciences; two from the College of Business and Economics;four from the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science;and two from the College of Education; plus the college deans, theregistrar, the vice provost for research, the director of the office ofresearch, two non-voting graduate student members, and a member ofthe student senate.The committee formulates policies and regulations on graduateeducation and it recommends policies and procedures for research-related activities. The committee interprets and applies faculty rulesgoverning graduate students and degrees, including questionsconcerning student petitions and appeals.GRADUATE STUDENT SENATEThe Graduate Student Senate is comprised of graduate studentrepresentatives from each academic unit. The general assemblymeets bi-monthly during the academic year. This body represents thegraduate student community regarding graduate programs and graduatestudent life at Lehigh. Graduate students selected by the GraduateStudent Senate are non-voting members of the Graduate and ResearchCommittee and other university committees.The Senate provides a forum for discussion with university officials andcommittees, advocates for policy change, disseminates information, andplans social events in order to facilitate communication and communitybuilding among graduate students.Research Centers and InstitutesLehigh has developed a number of centers and institutes to providegreater research and academic opportunities for students and faculty.Centers and institutes are generally interdisciplinary and complementthe scholarly activities of academic departments and representscholarship and research based on the expertise and capabilities of agroup of faculty members. Frequently, centers relate to the broad-basedresearch needs of government, industry, and the social community.RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS/ DIRECTORS AND STAFFDirectors and staff members of the university’s research centers andinstitutes are listed.

Additional verification paperwork is required to begin thetransfer credit process.•Courses must be taken at an institution that is accredited by one ofthe six regional associations.Course AuditingA student who is in good academic standing and has not failed anycourses in the previous term may be approved to audit not morethan one course per semester, which must be outside the curriculumrequirements.  Application to audit a course is by petition approved bythe departmental chair and the Standing of Students Committee.  In nocase shall a student who has attended a course as an auditor be givenan anticipatory examination for credit or register for the same coursein the future. A student completing a course in this manner will havethe course and the notation AU indicated on the permanent record. Astudent rostered on an audit basis may be withdrawn from the coursewith a grade of W for poor attendance. Audit courses do not counttoward full-time status.Review-Consultation-Study PeriodThe Review-Consultation-Study (RCS) period is intended to provide aperiod of time for informal academic work between the end of the formalinstruction period and the beginning of the final examinations.It is expected that students will use this period to consolidate theircommand of the material in their courses. Faculty members makethemselves available to their students at announced times during thisperiod.No quiz or exam may be given during the last five class days of thesemester.Graduation HonorsBeginning with all new degree seeking students in the Fall of 2004 orany students graduating in the Spring of 2008, degrees with honors areawarded by vote of the university faculty to those students who haveattained an average of not less than 3.40 in a minimum of 90 credithours in residence at Lehigh University or in programs approved by thefaculty to have grades and credit accepted toward the undergraduatedegree.Degrees with high honors are awarded by vote of the university facultyto those students who have attained an average of not less than 3.60in a minimum of 90 credit hours in residence at Lehigh University or inprograms approved by the faculty to have grades and credit acceptedtoward the undergraduate degree.Degrees with highest honors are awarded by vote of the universityfaculty to those students who have attained an average of not less than3.80 in a minimum of 90 credit hours in residence at Lehigh University orin programs approved by the faculty to have grades and credit acceptedtoward the undergraduate degree.For the purposes of graduation honors calculations, courses taken morethan once at Lehigh will only have the most recent grade used in thecalculation. Courses taken under the cross-registration policy of theLVAIC and the Washington Semester program will be used.Students who spend part of their career at another institution, or aretransfer admits to degree programs, must have at least sixty earned28         Department Honorscredit hours of regularly graded (not pass/fail) courses that meet theresidency requirement in order to be eligible for graduation honors.Department HonorsMany departments offer honors work adapted to its curriculum forstudents who wish to demonstrate unusual academic ability and interestin exploring a chosen field through independent study and research.The precise nature of the program for each student is determined bythe academic major department, but may include: unscheduled work orindependent study, participation in graduate (400-level) courses, and anhonors thesis or project.Qualified candidates should inform their academic advisers by theend of the junior year of their intention to work for departmentalhonors. The adviser will give the college and Registration & AcademicServices names of graduating seniors working for departmentalhonors in particular majors. Student names will be published on theCommencement website.Honor SocietiesThere are at least 18 honor and course societies. The three best-knownare:Phi Beta Kappa. The oldest honor society in the United States isrepresented at Lehigh by the Beta chapter of the Commonwealth ofPennsylvania, the 27th oldest chapter in the nation. The chapter’scouncil considers for invitation into its membership those students ineach of Lehigh’s three undergraduate colleges who satisfy the followingprofile:•At least 60 credit hours of coursework completed at Lehigh•A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.75•A minimum of 8 credit hours in the natural sciences (including a lab)•A minimum of 8 credit hours in the social sciences•A minimum of 8 credit hours in the humanities, especially textualanalysis beyond first-year writing (the council typically does notrecognize some courses that carry Humanities credit at Lehigh, suchas Public Speaking, Stage Design, one-credit Music lessons, etc.)•Calculus or advanced mathematics that requires calculus as aprerequisite•Two years of college-level foreign language study or its equivalent(may be satisfied by four years of high school study with excellentgrades)•No disciplinary violations sufficient to warrant probation, suspension,or expulsionPlease note: Satisfaction of this profile guarantees considerationby the Phi Beta Kappa council; it does not guarantee election toPhi Beta Kappa. Any undergraduate who has questions aboutany of the items in this profile should contact Prof. Ziad Munson(https://socanthro.cas2.lehigh.edu/content/ziad-munson), ExecutiveSecretary of Lehigh’s chapter. Office phone: 610-758-3821; e-mail:munson@lehigh.eduBeta Gamma Sigma. Election to membership in Beta Gamma Sigmais the highest scholastic honor that a student in business administrationcan achieve. Beta Gamma Sigma is the only national honoraryscholarship society in the field of business administration recognized byThe Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.Tau Beta Pi. Tau Beta Pi recognizes engineering students who havea history of distinguished scholarship and exemplary character. Thenational organization was founded at Lehigh in 1885. A bronze marker infront of Packard Lab commemorates this event.Among course societies are the following: Alpha Pi Mu, for those inindustrial and systems engineering; Alpha Sigma Mu, materials scienceand engineering (http://www.alphasigmamu.org/). Beta Alpha Psi,accounting; Chi Epsilon, civil engineering; Eta Kappa Nu, electricalengineering; Lambda Mu Sigma, marketing; Omicron Delta Epsilon,economics; Omicron Delta Kappa, leadership; Order of the Omega,leadership in Greek activities; Phi Alpha Theta, history; Phi Beta Delta,international; Phi Eta Sigma, freshman scholastic excellence; Pi TauSigma, mechanical engineering; Psi Chi, psychology; Sigma Tau Delta,English; and Sigma Xi, research.Special Undergraduate Academic OpportunitiesThe academic programs in the colleges are supplemented by five-year,two-degree programs as well as opportunities for advanced, foreign, andexperiential study.ARTS-ENGINEERING OPTIONThe curriculum in arts-engineering is designed for students wanting aprofessional education in a field of engineering and also the opportunityto study a second field.Arts-engineers fulfill all requirements for the professional engineeringdegree for which they are working. However, the first three years ofscience and engineering courses are scheduled over four years for thearts-engineer. During this period the arts-engineer is a student in theCollege of Arts and Science pursuing a bachelor of arts or bachelor ofscience major program.In many instances it may be advisable to take the two degrees at theend of the fifth year. Arts-engineers working towards the bachelor ofscience in biology, computer science, environmental science, geologicalsciences, geophysics, molecular biology, and statistics are advised topay special attention to the engineering humanities and social sciencerequirements, which must be met in time for the student to qualify for theB.S. in engineering.Arts-engineers have the same opportunities for multiple majors andspecial interdisciplinary majors as are available to students working forthe baccalaureate (B.S. or B.A. degree only) in the College of Arts andSciences. Additional information may be obtained by contacting Prof.Nikolai Nikolov, Art and Architecture, Chandler-Ullmann.BACHELOR/MASTER DEGREE PROGRAMSOf increasing interest to undergraduates are the two-degree programsthat may lead to both a bachelor and a master’s degree in five years.The fifth-year program in the School of Education enables thosereceiving a B.A. or B.S. degree to accomplish professional teachertraining and serve as salaried interns in public schools. After thecompletion of one year of full-time teaching, secondary teachers canreceive the master of arts and elementary teachers can receive masterof education degrees.Many other five-year, graduate-level combination programs exist, andstudents are advised to consult with their adviser in planning suchprograms. All students receiving masters degrees must be registered asfull time degree graduate students for at least one full term.Apprentice TeachingThe apprentice teaching program is designed to benefit juniors andseniors who wish to learn about teaching under the guidance ofan experienced teacher. Apprentices often do a limited amount ofsupervised lecturing or leading of discussions, assist in making upand evaluating written assignments, and are available for individualconsultation with students.To participate in the apprentice teaching program a student must:1.Have an over-all cumulative grade point average of 2.80 or better;2.Have a cumulative major grade point average of at least 3.3 andhave completed at least two courses in the major field in whichapprentice teaching is done;3.Have previously taken for credit the course or its equivalent in whichthe apprentice teaching will be done;4.Meet the guidelines on file in each college dean’s office.A student may register for apprentice teaching only once each semester,only once in a given course, and only twice during a college career.To register for apprentice teaching each student-teacher partnershipwill submit an apprentice teaching agreement, indicating the dutiesand obligations for approval to the department chair and the dean ofthe student’s college in which the course is taken. This form must besubmitted to Registration & Academic Services before the first dayof classes in the semester. To complete the course, the apprenticeteachers must submit a written report of their experience to thesupervising teacher, who will forward it to the Office of the Provost.Lehigh University 2018-2019       29International Center for Academic and ProfessionalEnglishMark Ouellette, Ph.D.Director    246 Maginnes Hall9 W.

For program information, dates,fees, and registration forms, visit the ICAPE website: global.lehigh.edu/eslCredit by ExaminationUpon petition and presentation of evidence that he or she has qualifiedfor it, a student already enrolled at Lehigh may be permitted by theStanding of Students Committee to take a special examination forcredit towards graduation. Special examinations are granted only forextraordinary reasons and upon petition. There must be adequatesupporting evidence of sufficient cause accompanying each petition.There is a fee for all special examinations.Students taking a special exam after matriculation at Lehigh will havethe grade and credits assigned to their permanent Lehigh record.Special exam credit will be counted as in residence credit and the gradewill be used in all grade point average calculations. No special exam willbe granted in a course that the student has already taken (except seniorreexaminations) for credit or on an audit basis, or in a course in whichthe student has already completed more advanced work at Lehigh.Preparation for Graduate WorkStudents planning to continue in graduate programs should takeadvantage of the flexibility in many undergraduate programs to designan upper-division curriculum that meets requirements in the anticipatedgraduate program.The policies of the colleges provides as much flexibility as possible forstudents who wish to change to new but related fields of study afterthe baccalaureate degree. Students should consult with their previousprogram adviser and the department representative of the new fieldto establish an academic program that will remedy any deficiencies inbackground.Guidelines for Undergraduates to Take Graduate LevelCourses1.No undergraduate student may take 400-level courses during aterm where the student’s total credits are greater than 18 (includingaudits).2.All students receiving a graduate degree must be enrolled one fullsemester or summer as a regular student prior to the awarding of agraduate degree.3.An undergraduate student may use no more than 12 credits taken asan undergraduate toward a graduate degree. These courses mustbe at the 300 and 400 level and beyond all undergraduate degreerequirements.4.Students should have achieved junior standing and a grade pointaverage of 3.0 to take 400 level courses.5.Students must petition the Standing of Graduate Students and theStanding of Students for permission via the Undergraduate SOSPetition Form.6.Students requesting a second graduate level course in a giventerm must petition the Standing of Graduate students committee.(Students should not expect to take a second graduate level courseif enrolled for more than 15 credits.)Curricular FlexibilityThe undergraduate curricula are flexible, designed to accommodatethe changing interests and needs of students. Boundaries betweencolleges are fluid, providing many options in an educational program.For instance, students may take a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree inthe College of Business and Economics or the College of Engineeringand Applied Science with a minor in journalism in the College of Arts andSciences. There are five-year programs for which degrees are awardedin two colleges.Students who wish to transfer from one undergraduate college toanother may do so provided that they have achieved sophomorestatus and have completed at least 12 credits while in their college ofmatriculation. Students on academic probation may transfer betweencolleges with the permission of the committee on standing of students.In addition, each receiving college may require the completion (witha minimum grade of C-) of no more than three introductory courses– courses without prerequisites – before transfer occurs. Studentsconsidering such a transfer must confer with their advisers to begin theprocess. Students who transfer to another college may require morethan the traditional eight semesters to complete the course sequence intheir degree program.The College of Business and Economics requires a student tosuccessfully complete either  Speech Communication for International Speakers ofEnglish 1 CreditSpoken English improvement through the practice of American Englishin “real contexts.” This course is for first or second year undergrads whohave advanced English skills, but who need to improve their advancedcommunication and idiomatic language skills for the advanced speakingcontexts of the American university classroom and campus.

Topic approved by individual faculty member.Typically taken in the last semester of course work.Repeat Status: Course may be repeated.Art, Architecture, and DesignThe three primary disciplines of the Department of Art, Architecture andDesign share a common focus on design, visual literacy, the creativeprocess and the making of the built environment. The emphasis ondesign as a broad concept begins to shape aesthetic principles, andinitiates the structuring of the individual’s creative process. To that end,the department offers undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degrees in fourmajors: art, architecture, design, and art history. Minor programs areavailable in studio art, architecture, graphic design, product design,history of the visual arts, history of architecture, and museum studies.Many studio courses require department permission. The studentinterested in enrolling in any of the department’s courses should contactthe program coordinator to schedule an appointment with an advisorwell before preregistration so that he or she can be rostered at theappropriate time.An art major centers on studio education wherein principal disciplinessuch as drawing, sculpture, painting and photography are explored. Thestudent is required to engage in an intense concentration in studio workat Lehigh and when appropriate at other Lehigh Valley colleges that offercomplementary courses. Studio work is enhanced by courses in historyand theory, both within the department and throughout the university.For the student interested in becoming a creative artist, the majorprovides a foundation for a life in art, or more immediately the potentialpath into a graduate degree program in fine art. A major in art may becombined with theater for those interested in costume design, or witharchitecture and theater for those who aspire to be set designers. Amajor in art combined with a minor in education is available for studentsinterested in becoming primary, secondary or special education artteachers.The architecture major is a pre-professional course of study focusedon architectural design studios, complemented by art studios, historyand theory courses, and introductory materials and building technologycourses. The major results in a Bachelor of Arts degree.The architecture major is a comprehensive undergraduate educationthat is the first step in a series of educational and apprenticeshiprequirements leading to professional registration. Architecture majorsregularly go on to the most respected graduate schools of architecture,with Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, University of Virginia, andWashington University in St. Louis, among scores of institutions, activelyseeking Lehigh graduates for their programs.Alternatively, many architecture majors choose to work in fields allied tothe discipline, such as interior design, adaptive reuse building, historicpreservation, construction management, real estate development,etc. Since for such paths professional architectural registration is notrequired, the Lehigh degree alone is the springboard to various careersthat involve the making of the built environment.(The Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in architecture should notbe confused with the Bachelor of Architecture, a professional five-yeardegree. Those students who major in architecture and graduate withthe Bachelor of Arts degree and wish to pursue a professional career inarchitecture will be required to obtain a Master of Architecture from aninstitution offering a graduate program in architecture.)The Arts-Engineering program, a five-year, dual-degree course ofstudy, allows students to link complementary disciplines of engineeringand architecture. The result is two degrees from two different collegeswithin Lehigh, one a professional degree in engineering, one the pre-professional degree in architecture.A design major engages students with new technologies, materialsand media in developing the creative processes and critical thinkingnecessary for the modern designer. The major centers on studiowherein an emphasis on visual communication through digital media iscomplemented by the traditional focus on art making. Courses in art anddesign history and theory and in specific media techniques supplementthe series of required studios.A student may take a range of department courses in design or maychoose a specific concentration in either graphic design or productdesign. The graphic design concentration introduces students tothe tools and media related to print applications, web-based media,exhibition design, publishing and advertising. Product design concernsthe creation of objects used in industrial applications, art objects,furniture, toys, exhibits and trade design, electronic products, householditems and recreational equipment.An art history major provides students with a comprehensive educationin the history of art and architecture, and an opportunity to learn aboutthe changing form and status of the visual arts and built environment inculture and society. Through introductory and advanced coursework,as well as museum and site visits, students learn how to examine,evaluate, and interpret works of art and architecture, and acquire aworking knowledge of the methods, theories and research practices ofart historical analysis.The study of art and its history is a vital and fundamental part of aliberal arts education, and art history is unique among academic fieldsin the breadth and diversity of its objects of study: drawing, painting,sculpture, and printmaking; architecture, design, and urban planning;photography and film; material culture; as well as a variety of othercultural forms. Students majoring in art history go on to careers in art,architecture, design, curating, communications, imaging, advertising,education, and many other fields. The major also provides an importantLehigh University 2018-2019       67foundation for students who plan to pursue advanced graduate studiesin the arts and humanities. Art history majors choose one of three areasof concentration: history of the visual arts, history of architecture, ormuseum studies.All programs are philosophically cross-disciplinary, as students areencouraged to take advantage of the many learning environments thatconstitute a university. Significant resources for all disciplines in thedepartment include the Lehigh University permanent art collection andarchives as well as the numerous on-campus galleries and the ZoellnerArt Center. Students are encouraged to make use of the collections andfacilities to enhance and enrich studios and courses, and to help shapetheir own creative work.The department offers minor programs in studio art, architecture,apparel design, graphic design, product design, history of the visualarts, history of architecture, museum studies that are available to allundergraduate students. The purpose of these minor programs is toenable students from any major to be introduced to the studio practicesof art, architecture, and design, and to help form an understanding of therole that art plays in human history and culture.DEPARTMENTAL HONORSExceptional students in art, architecture or design may apply fordepartment honors at the end of their junior year or the beginningof their senior year. To be eligible, a student must have attained a3.5 GPA in the major program and a minimum overall GPA of 3.0.Candidates should submit to the department chair a written proposal,prepared in consultation with a faculty member who will serve ashonors sponsor. The project could result in a research paper, designproject, or exhibition. Successful completion of the project will resultin a “Department Honors” designation being affixed to the student’stranscript.Professors. Berrisford W.

The program focuses on the rich historical and cultural heritageof the countries of Asia, as well as their growing importance in worldaffairs.The overall program is administered by the Asian Studies Committee,an interdisciplinary body of faculty with special interests in the region.This committee oversees both the formal academic work within theprogram as well as extracurricular activities. It also cooperates with theAsian Cultural Society and other student organizations involved in AsianStudies.The courses listed are regularly offered in the program and new onesare currently under development in several subject areas. (Consult theSchedule of Classes for specific offerings in any particular semester.)Courses offered at other LVAIC institutions may be taken for credit byLehigh students. Students are encouraged to participate in a variety ofextracurricular activities that are offered by the Asian Studies Program,such as special lectures and seminars, films, performances, andexhibits.MAJOR IN ASIAN STUDIESThe Asian Studies major is designed to accomplish three goals: toground the student in a regional language and culture, to survey variousdisciplines in Asian Studies more broadly, and to provide advancedresearch opportunities. The program, when successfully completed,prepares the student for further graduate work, professional education,or employment in the public or private sector. There is an increasingdemand for graduates who combine a major in a disciplinary field (e.g.,business, economics, international relations) with a second major (orminor) in Asian Studies, including Chinese or Japanese languagecompetence.The major in Asian Studies requires a minimum of 35 credits.  Studentsare required to demonstrate the intermediate language proficiency(Intermediate II) in an Asian language in addition to required coursework as described below.

Studentsare free to survey the field broadly or concentrate in a specific area suchas Chinese or Japanese studies. The minor comprises a minimum of 4courses (16 credits) in Asian studies, chosen from an approved list inconsultation with the director of the Asian Studies Program.While students minoring in Asian Studies are encouraged to studylanguages, only 8 credits of language study count towards theAsian Studies minor.

Current departmental research activities includethe following:Condensed matter physics.  Areas of interest include the opticaland electronic properties of defects in semiconductors and insulators,quantum phenomena in semiconductor devices, collective dynamicsof disordered solids, structural phase transitions in ferroelectrics andsuperconducting crystals, theory of quantum charge transport innanotubes and single molecule systems, physics of nano devices.Atomic and molecular physics.  Research topics include atomicand molecular spectroscopy and collision processes. Recent workhas addressed velocity-changing collisions, diffusion, energy-poolingcollisions, charge exchange, fine structure mixing, light-induced drift andradiation trapping.Cosmology and string theory: This research area examines thefundamental structure of spacetime and the quantum nature of gravity.Research directions include a wide range of topics in quantum fieldtheory and string theory, with applications to strongly coupled gaugetheories, gravity and theoretical cosmology.High-energy physics: The department provides both theoretical andexperimental research opportunities in the field of high-energy physics.Experimental work involves the examination of the quark gluon plasma(QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions by using particle jets and heavyflavor quarks as probes of the medium. These studies make use ofthe Solenoidal Tracker (STAR) detector at the Relativistic Heavy IonCollider (RHIC), and other accelerator experiments. Theoretical studiesaddress fundamental aspects and phenomenological applications ofstring theory, gravitational descriptions of quantum field theory, andgauge/string dualities.Nonlinear optics and photonics.  Research topics include nonlinearlight-matter interaction that enable the control of light with light,four-wave mixing, phase conjugation, resonant Brillouin scattering,ferroelectric domain patterning for quasi phase matching, waveguides,photonic crystals, holey and other specialty fibers, and the application ofphotonics to biological systems.Plasma physics.  Computational studies of magnetically confinedtoroidal plasmas address anomalous thermal and particle transport,Lehigh University 2018-2019       219large scale instabilities, and radiofrequency heating. Laboratory studiesaddress collisional and collisionless phenomena of supercritical laser-produced plasmas.Statistical physics.  Investigation is underway of nonequilibriumfluctuations in gases, chaotic transitions and 1/f dynamics, light-scattering spectroscopy, colloidal suspensions, the nonlinear dynamicsof granular particles, and pattern formation in nonequilibrium dissipativesystems, including the kinetics of phase transitions and spatiotemporalchaos.Soft condensed matter and biological physics.  Current researchtopics include both the experimental and theoretical studies of complexfluids including biological polymers, colloids, and biological cells andtissues. Laser tweezers, Raman scattering, photoluminescence andadvanced 3-D optical imaging techniques are integrated for investigatingthe structures and dynamical properties of these systems. Theoreticalstudies focus on the kinetics of phase transitions, including thecrystallization of globular and membrane proteins and also the modelingof interactions of proteins and nanotubes.Complex fluids.  Polymers in aqueous solutions, colloidal suspensions,and surfactant solutions are investigated using techniques such as “lasertweezers,” video-enhanced microscopy, and laser light scattering. Areasof interest include the structures of polymers at liquid-solid interfacesand microrheology of confined macromolecules. Recent work addressessystems of biological significance.Computational physics.  Several of the above areas involve the useof state-of-the-art computers to address large-scale computationalproblems. Areas of interest include atom-atom collisions, simulationsof tokamak plasmas, the statistical behavior of ensembles of manyparticles, the calculation of electronic wave functions for molecules andsolids, and the multi-scale modeling of nano-bio systems.Candidates for advanced degrees normally will have completed, beforebeginning their graduate studies, the requirements for a bachelor’sdegree with a major in physics, including advanced mathematics beyonddifferential and integral calculus. Students lacking the equivalent of thispreparation will make up deficiencies in addition to taking the specifiedwork for the degree sought.At least eight semester hours of general college physics using calculusare required for admission to all 200- and 300-level courses. Additionalprerequisites for individual courses are noted in the course descriptions.Admission to 400-level courses generally is predicated on satisfactorycompletion of corresponding courses in the 200- and 300-level groups ortheir equivalent.FACILITIES FOR RESEARCHResearch facilities are housed in the Sherman Fairchild Center forthe Physical Sciences, containing Lewis Laboratory, the ShermanFairchild Laboratory for Solid State Studies, and a large connectingresearch wing.

Students in these programs receive a B.A. from Lehighand a graduate degree from the designated professional school within aseven-year period. For details concerning admission to these programs,see Health Professions (p. 53).GRADUATE STUDY IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCESRigorous, research-oriented graduate programs leading to a Doctor ofPhilosophy are offered in three divisions of the Department of BiologicalSciences: biochemistry, integrative biology and neuroscience, andcell and molecular biology. To complete the program students mustsuccessfully complete core courses, pass a qualifying exam, prepare,submit, and successfully defend a written research proposal, completethe research described in the proposal, and submit a written dissertationand defend the completed research to the department.Once students enter the department, their progress is monitored bythe graduate committee until they are admitted to candidacy. Membersof the committee meet with the student each semester to assessthe student's progress towards the degree and to assist students inchoosing the appropriate courses to provide a solid scientific foundationand an up-to-date understanding of the discipline. This will be assessedby the qualifying exam.The qualifying exam generally should be taken after the third semesterand no later than the fourth semester of course work. It will be prepared,administered and graded by the faculty associated with the specificgraduate program in which the student is enrolled. It consists of a two-day written exam and an oral examination. The exam can be repeatedonce. Admission to candidacy is granted after successful completion ofthe qualifying exam and the thesis proposal. The proposal is a writtendescription of an original research project developed under the guidanceof a faculty member chosen by the student to be his/her advisor. Theproposal will be presented orally to the thesis committee, typicallyafter the fifth semester. Following the presentation of the proposal,an oral examination will take place in which the thesis committee willquestion the student about general science related to the project. Thiswill constitute the general examination.Core requirements for each division are listed below. The graduateschool requires students to register for at least 72-post baccalaureatecredits to earn the Ph.D. In addition, all students must take "

Sands, PHD (The Pennsylvania State University)ChemistryChemistry is a versatile subject area and the pursuit of a career inchemistry can be a most intellectually satisfying experience. No otherbasic science touches and shapes as many aspects of modern societyas does chemistry. The study of chemistry has provided solutions tocomplex problems and has improved the quality of all phases of humanlife from soft contact lenses and synthetic blood to longer-lasting paintand alternative fuels. A particular strength of this department is insurface and interface chemistry, which bridges many areas of modernscience and technology.Chemists at all levels of education find a market for their skills andknowledge in many employment areas. Chemists provide the technicalbackbone for the manufacturing industries (pharmaceuticals, plastics,paper, semiconductor electronics technology, and agriculture),for service industries (clinical and forensic laboratories, academe,environmental protection, and information science) and for governmentalpositions in regulatory agencies and in science policy analyses. Manychemists are employed in nontraditional areas, such as patent law,insurance underwriting, sales, product management, journalism, andeven banking.The alluring challenge of chemistry inspires many bachelor degreerecipients to study for advanced degrees within the discipline ofchemistry and in other areas, as well. Chemistry or biochemistry isthe strongest preparation for graduate studies or for professionalschool in the health-related disciplines (medicine, pharmacology, andbiochemistry), and for other science programs (materials science,polymers, biotechnology, environmental studies, and mineralogy).The study of chemistry opens doors to satisfying careers, to astimulating view of the world, and to a professional life in which one’snatural tendency to ask “Why?” can lead to personally rewardingendeavors. The undergraduate curriculum in chemistry contains manyof the prerequisites for biology, earth and environmental sciences,materials science, molecular biology, physics, and chemical engineering.This allows students to transfer credits among these majors through thesophomore year.96         ChemistryChemistry students have the opportunity to design their undergraduatecurricula for specialization in a variety of fields through the ChemFlexcurriculum.THE CHEMFLEX CURRICULUMThe Department of Chemistry offers degrees in both the Collegeof Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering and AppliedSciences. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences have threeoptions: the B. S. in Chemistry, the B. A. in Chemistry, and the B. S. inPharmaceutical Chemistry. In addition we offer an interdepartmentalB. S. in Biochemistry in collaboration with the Department of BiologicalSciences. For students in the College of Engineering and AppliedSciences we offer the B. S. in Chemistry.In the College of Arts and Sciences, the traditional degree certifiedby the American Chemical Society is offered; the B. S. degree in theCollege of Engineering is the ACS certified degree and is identicalin terms of degree program requirements. All B. S. programs have aCommon Chemistry Core and similar collateral science requirements.These programs are pre-professional in nature, and students planningto attend graduate school in chemistry or an allied science should electthe B. S. program in the college to which they have been admitted. Thetraditional B. A. Program in the College of Arts and Sciences is not apre-professional program and may be elected by students who do notplan to do graduate work in chemistry or allied sciences but who desire astronger background in chemistry than is provided by a chemistry minor.In addition to the traditional certified B. S degree and B. A. degree, theB. A. and B. S. Chemistry programs in the College of Arts and Sciencesfeature an alternative flexible curriculum, called ChemFlex, whichenables a student to concentrate in a specific area. The concentrationspossible for the B. S. are Physical/Analytical, Polymers, and Materials.The B. A. has two areas of concentration: Business and the HealthProfessions. All concentrations in ChemFlex share a CommonChemistry Core; all students complete the core and then follow one oftwo paths for collateral courses (Path A or Path B for math, physics, andprogramming) as outlined in the following lists.Students may transfer from a B. S. program to a B. A. program easily,but the reverse is more difficult. Students in a B. A. program who makethe decision to attend graduate school in chemistry or allied sciencescan achieve a minimum preparation for this transition by electing 307 Advanced Inorganic Chemistry.DEPARTMENT MODERN LANGUAGE AND LITERATUREREQUIREMENTThe modern foreign language requirement is met by one of threeoptions:1.Completion of the second semester of a modern foreign language;2.Certification of language equivalent to this level taken in high school;3.Substitution of six credits of science electives. If science electivesare chosen, the non-science distribution requirement must still bemet.Professors. Gregory S Ferguson, PHD (Cornell University); RobertA.

Biochemistrydegree with the Department of Biological Sciences. The ChemFlexCurriculum allows the flexibility for a student to develop a concentrationin a specific area if he/she wishes to do so. The specific concentrationsare noted in the following Table.Table: ChemFlex Curriculum OverviewSpecialization RequirementsB.S. Chemistry (ACS)1,2,3B.S. Chemistry Analytical/Physical1,2,3B.S.

Biochemistry (interdepartmental degree)1,2, 3 or 41Common Chemistry Core2Courses required for specific concentration3Path A (see below)4Path B (see below)With regard to the B.S. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry, the pharmaceuticalindustry is focused on exploring the biochemistry of disease anddesigning or finding drugs to cure or ameliorate disease. Biochemists,organic chemists, biologists, and chemical engineers collaborate toachieve this end. The majority of chemists hired today go into thepharmaceutical industry. The B.S. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry is achemistry degree option which focuses on core chemistry, biochemistry,and molecular biology to prepare students for careers in this field. Sinceit is a highly interdisciplinary field it requires the breadth of knowledgeoffered by this degree program.Freshman chemistry coursesThe freshman courses "

This study is by natureinterdisciplinary: the study of language and literature, history, philosophyand religion, archaeology, economics and science all contribute to anappreciation of Greco-Roman civilization.Students in either major or minor programs may concentrate in variouscombinations of these and other disciplines as they relate to ancientcivilization. The diversity of the program should encourage the studentto follow her or his special interests while simultaneously gaining anoverview of classical civilization.Courses in ancient Greek and Latin lead to proficiency in language whileintroducing the student to major literary texts. The Joseph A. MaurerClassics Prize is awarded yearly, at the discretion of the program, to thesenior(s) who has demonstrated outstanding achievement in Classics(ancient Greek or Latin) and/or classical civilization. Courses in classicalcivilization require no knowledge of the ancient languages; they offerintroductions to various disciplines of Classics with frequent referenceto modern perspectives. Upper-level courses tend to be small, fosteringcloseness between faculty and students.Petitions are required for freshmen to take 100-level or higher coursesand for sophomores to take 200-level or higher courses.MAJOR PROGRAMSStudents may major either in Classical Civilization or in Classics. TheClassics major offers a comprehensive view of language and culture; itis possible to begin an ancient language at Lehigh and to complete themajor program successfully. The Classical Civilization major enables thestudent to gain a broad perspective on Greek and Roman civilization.The program welcomes double majors and the educational perspectivesto be derived from combining ancient and modern studies.Classics as a major has stood the test of time, offering helpfulpreparation for careers in widely diverse fields in the professions,business, and public service. Lehigh Classics majors have gone on tolaw school, to the ministry, to business school, with appropriate sciencecourses to medical school, to graduate work in Classics, and to all kindsof entry-level employment.Departmental HonorsA student may be recommended for program honors by vote of theprogram based on the student’s course work.Study AbroadLehigh University is a cooperating institution of the Intercollegiate Centerfor Classical Studies at Rome. Lehigh students are eligible for tuitiongrants in Athens and Rome.MAJOR IN CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONThis major allows the student to gain an overview of Greco-Romanculture through the literature, archaeology, and history along with basiclanguage study. A minimum of 36 credits is expected, but adjustmentsmay be made for prior language study. Students need to consult theProgram Director to determine appropriate adjustments to the guidelinesfor major requirements.108         Classical StudiesSelect four of the following:16CLSS/"

This interdisciplinary field, encompassingthe fields of psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy,anthropology, and neuroscience, provides excellent preparation forlife in the age of information.  The program aims to instill in students asolid grasp of the intellectual problems, frameworks, and methodologiescurrently available; to provide experience exploring these throughguided research; and to foster the desire to create and disseminate newknowledge. With this foundation, students are well prepared for a widevariety of careers in technology, human thought and behavior, or theirinteraction, and for graduate studies in Cognitive Science or any of thecontributing disciplines.We offer an undergraduate major in Cognitive Science, anundergraduate minor, a graduate minor, and a graduate certificate.

Matters of environmental quality andnatural resources will increasingly impact people and society in theyears to come, and the EES department offers a range of undergraduateand graduate programs that provide students with an understanding ofEarth’s biosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere, with anemphasis on how these components function as an integrated Earthsystem. Training in Earth and Environmental Sciences can lead totechnical and scientific careers in research, environmental consulting,conservation ecology, government agencies, and the petroleum industry,and can also serve as an excellent liberal arts degree that providescontext and preparation for careers such as law, policy, journalism andeconomics.Faculty in the EES department have a wide range of interests andstrong reputations in the fields of geology, ecology, and environmentalsciences. In instruction at all levels, the department emphasizes fieldexperiences, laboratory techniques, and experiential learning, as wellas the development of quantitative and communication skills. The EESdepartment maintains a relaxed and personal atmosphere in whichstudents can interact with faculty in many ways, including seminars,special symposia on topics of the students’ choice, field research, anddepartmental field trips.EES is a core department in the Environmental Initiative Program(EI), which offers students access to interdisciplinary training inEnvironmental Science, Engineering, and Policy.At the undergraduate level, students may choose from a B.A. or aB.S. degree in Earth and Environmental Sciences. The flexible B.A.program provides students an opportunity to acquire breadth, designa specialized program, or find room for a double major. A popularchoice is a double major in Earth and Environmental Sciences andin Environmental Studies, a major offered through the EnvironmentalInitiative (http://www.ei.lehigh.edu). This degree is well suited to studentswith career aspirations in areas such as engineering, environmental law,journalism, economics, government, among many other possibilities.The B.S. degree, while still offering considerable flexibility, providesthe more in-depth technical training required for graduate school andscientific careers, and is well suited for students seeking sciencegraduate degrees or employment as professionals in the earth andenvironmental sciences.An accessible minor program is available for students wishing to addEarth and Environmental Science insight into any number of othertechnical or non-technical degree programs, helping students distinguishthemselves as they prepare to enter today’s fast-evolving job marketsand graduate programs.For students with strong interests in areas such as hydrology, waterand soil remediation, hazards and associated geotechnical strategies,EES, in conjunction with the Department of Civil and EnvironmentalEngineering (CEE), offers a five-year program leading to dual B.S.degrees in EES and CEE (students having these interests may alsowant to see the description of the B.S. in Environmental Engineeringin the catalog entry for the Department of Civil and EnvironmentalEngineering).EES offers graduate training leading to either M.S. or Ph.D. in Earth andEnvironmental Sciences. The EES graduate program is marked by closefaculty-student collaboration. Graduate students can take advantage ofstrong externally funded faculty research programs and the extensive114         Earth and Environmental Sciencesanalytical and computing facilities available in the department; thesefacilities and specific EES research programs are described in somedetail on the EES departmental web page at www.ees.lehigh.edu.FIELD WORK AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNINGField experiences are a hallmark of the EES undergraduate program.The goal of these experiences is to place students into learningenvironments that are distinct from the classroom or lab, where allthe complexities and subtleties of the field can be appreciated in theirnatural setting. The Department runs a nationally recognized ~5 weeklong (6 credit) summer field camp in the Rocky Mountains, which offersintense field training in hydrology, geology, and field methods includingcomputer-based mapping. As part of the Lehigh in Costa Rica Program,the Department teaches a field course in Costa Rica every winterterm that focuses on tropical ecology and natural history. Studentscan participate in the department’s longstanding research programs inlimnological and ecological research in the Pocono Lakes region andin the Lehigh River watershed. Supervised internships allow studentsat all levels to become engaged in projects involving cross-disciplinaryresearch, assessment, and consulting work. Undergraduate studentscan also become involved in forefront research programs. In recentyears, students have played a role in research in the Himalaya, Alaska,California, Idaho, Argentina, and Italy, in addition to more nearby sitesin the mid-Atlantic states. We strongly encourage all EES majors totake advantage of the special field programs and opportunities madeavailable by the department. Most EES courses also include fieldexperiences in the form of one-day or weekend-long field trips, andseveral courses include weekly or bi-weekly field trips.PROGRAMS IN EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCESThe descriptions of the following programs in the Department of Earthand Environmental Sciences are organized as follows:•Minor in Earth and Environmental Sciences•Bachelor of Arts Degree in Earth and Environmental Sciences•Bachelor of Sciences Degree in Earth and Environmental Sciences•Department Honors in Earth and Environmental Sciences•Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth and EnvironmentalSciences•Graduate StudiesProfessors.

The committee should approve the research proposaland the honors thesis by signing the required form and cover sheet,which will be filed with the Department.CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND EARTH ANDENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCESThis program is designed for students interested in combining programsin two departments: Civil & Environmental Engineering and Earth &Environmental Sciences, leading to two bachelor of science degrees,a civil and environmental engineering B.S. degree and a B.S. degreein earth and environmental sciences. Both degrees would be awardedat the end of the fifth year. This program is one of the dual degreeprograms mentioned in the Five-Year Programs section. The studentwill have a primary advisor in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineeringand Applied Sciences and a secondary advisor in the College of Artsand Sciences. The program provides alternatives for students who maydecide not to complete the dual-degree program. Students who makethis decision prior to the beginning of the fourth year may qualify at theend of that year for the bachelor of science in civil or environmentalengineering, as well as a minor in earth and environmental sciences.Also, if a student decides after two years to pursue only a B.S. degreein the EES department, it is possible to complete the requirements infour years. If the decision to work toward this degree is made duringthe fourth year, at least one additional semester is required to qualifyfor either B.S. degree. Interested students should consult with therespective departmental advisors to create a schedule of courses toresolve conflicts or if a specified course is not offered that semester.Required courses and major electives for the EES B.S. degree are listedin the catalog entry for EES. Crosslisted EES/CEE courses used tosatisfy Civil Engineering Approved Electives can reduce the individualsemester and total program credits when chosen to satisfy EES programrequirements. The dual degree, and a suggested schedule of courses,is described more fully elsewhere in the catalog (p. 373). Additionaluseful information can be found on the web sites (www.lehigh.edu/~incee/ and www.ees.lehigh.edu).GRADUATE STUDIESThe Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences offers graduateprograms leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. in Earth and EnvironmentalSciences. These degrees emphasize what we feel is an important andgrowing trend in ecology, environmental science, and geology, namelythe blending of expertise and perspectives from many disciplines.Research is an integral component of all EES graduate programs andleads to an M.S. thesis or Ph.D. dissertation prepared under a researchsupervisory committee and chaired by a departmental faculty researchadvisor. An advising commitment by one or more faculty members isrequired for graduate admission.The University has outlined the general academic requirements for M.S.and Ph.D. students in its Graduate Student Handbook, and EES hasadditional Departmental requirements that must also be fulfilled. It isthe student’s responsibility to insure that all graduation requirementsare met. All graduate students work with an advisor who chairs thestudent’s research supervisory committee.

Our classes fostera series of related activities:  an exploration of how studying literaturecontributes to questions of social justice; an immersion in historicalperiods informed by strong theoretical commitments; and engagementwith contemporary literature and culture; and an emphasis on theorizedpedagogy, reflective practice and the scholar-teacher model.  Ourfaculty interact with Lehigh's varied interdisciplinary programs, includingAfricana Studies; Classics; Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies;Jewish Studies, and American Studies.The major in English is designed to give students experience in readinganalyzing, and formulating thoughts about people and ideas that matter;an understanding of how literary artists find the appropriate words toexpress their thoughts and feelings; and a basic knowledge of thehistorical development of British, American and world literature.Students who major in English go on to careers in teaching, writing,law, business, science, medicine, engineering--and many others.  Theanalytical and communication skills acquired in the study of literatureand writing will be of use in almost any profession or human activity.  Depending on their interests, abilities, and career plans, studentswho major in English are encouraged to consider double majors or oneor two minor fields.  The major in English is flexible enough to allowcross-disciplinary study with ease.  The student majoring in Englishchooses from an extensive list of courses.  Only one course is requiredof all students, the introduction to the major, English 100.  To ensurebreadth and depth of knowledge, each English major is required to takefive courses at the 300 level, typically one in each of the four historicalperiods listed below1 and one as an elective.

The curricula include courses in fourcolleges and 10 departments in social sciences, humanities, education,science, mathematics and engineering. Earth and EnvironmentalSciences (http://www.ees.lehigh.edu) and Civil and EnvironmentalEngineering (http://www.lehigh.edu/~incee) are core Departments in theprogram.UNDERGRADUATE STUDIESThe Environmental Studies BA program examines the cultural,economic, historical, communication, political and social factors thatinfluence local, national, international and global environmental issuesand policies. Investigating a wide range of perspectives, it includes abroad exposure to many factors confronting humans as they strugglewith complex problems and possible solutions to environmentalquestions.The program has been designed so students will develop a broadunderstanding of social science environmental concerns, along witha basic familiarity with environmental science, statistics and researchmethods. Of benefit to all students interested in environmental issues,this B.A. degree complements existing B.A. and B.S. programs in Earthand Environmental Sciences and the B.S. program in EnvironmentalEngineering. The B.A. program is intended for students who areinterested in environmental affairs from the perspective of the socialsciences and humanities. This degree will prepare students for a varietyof career options including positions in policy agencies at the federal,state and local government levels, corporate management, nonprofitorganizations, environmental journalism, environmental education orenvironmental law. It also will prepare students for graduate studies ina number of environmental policy and social science fields. The B.A. isspecifically designed to be broadly inclusive yet flexible enough to allowfor double majors and minors in other fields.

Poverty. The dollar. Climate change. The World Cup.Immigration. K-pop. The United Nations. Zika. McDonald’s.Almost every aspect of human existence has been touched by thedynamic of globalization, which may be the defining characteristic of the21st Century.Yet, the origins, history, evolution, and impact of globalization – evenits very definition – are subject to intense debate. We can surely say,however, that every student leaving college and entering the workforce –the world – should have a fundamental understanding of globalization.Such understanding will give students crucial knowledge and skillsthat will set them apart in this new world and help them succeed in anincreasingly globalized context. It will help them anticipate the social,cultural, economic and political changes brought about by globalization— and the resistance to globalization. It will better prepare students todraw connections in an interdependent and interconnected world.Global Studies is a relatively new and increasingly popular major atuniversities worldwide, including Yale, UCLA, the London Schoolof Economics and others. Different from study in an individualdepartment, Global Studies is emphatically interdisciplinary, withprofessors from anthropology, journalism, sociology, modern languagesand literature, religion studies, political science, history, internationalrelations, and others. Increasingly, the most important questions cannotbe answered by one discipline but by the combined efforts of multipledisciplines.Although study of globalization has been conducted at Lehigh for years,the University formally created the Globalization and Social ChangeInitiative in Fall 2006, and the major in Global Studies followed soonafter.Rooted in these areas of interest, the major examines how the forces ofglobalization shape and are shaped by history, culture, economics, art,politics, communication, and other fundamental aspects of the humancondition.In many Global Studies programs, students choose from a sprawlingarray of courses tied together by virtue of international content. GlobalStudies at Lehigh directs students in a more focused manner to corecourses that confront, from the perspectives of multiple disciplines,perhaps the single, central force shaping the world today – globalization.The program requires a total of 40 credits, advanced languageproficiency, a semester of study abroad, and a senior seminar.The program also takes advantage of Lehigh’s NGO (non-governmentorganization) status at the United Nations. Students have the opportunity142         Global Studiesto meet and work with UN officials. A number of Global students becomedelegates to the UN for international NGOs while they are still at Lehigh.Careers in Global StudiesCareer opportunities are numerous for graduates of Global Studies.Professions in the 21st century increasingly are demanding globalunderstanding and expertise as well as the ability to take oninterdisciplinary work across boundaries. People trained in theinterdisciplinary field of Global Studies have increasing advantagesover those trained in a single discipline.Through the Global Studies major, students acquire a strong groundingin global affairs and an understanding of the complex phenomenonof globalization. They engage in problem-solving across boundariesand cultures. They are able to critically and analytically evaluateinformation from a comparative perspective. They learn to be effectivecommunicators and learn to argue and defend complex views in writing,such as policy papers, and public speaking, such as individual andgroup presentations, to a variety of global audiences.Lehigh’s Global Studies graduates have gone on to work for employersin the areas of business and finance (Credit Suisse First Boston, EdwardJones, Goldman Sachs, IBM Consulting, JP Morgan), media (A&ENetworks, Getty Images, Hearst Magazines, News China, Viacom NewMedia), and nonprofits and the public sector (Habitat for Humanity,Israel Teaching Fellows, Peace Corps, Teach for America). Others haveestablished careers with governmental, non-governmental, and for-profitorganizations in the fields of public policy, energy consulting, publicrelations, and health care.Professor. John F.

Edwards, Ph.D. (University of Chicago)Email: sme6@lehigh.edu Phone: 610-758-4441Website: http://humanitiesctr.cas2.lehigh.edu/General contact information for the Humanities Center: 224 W. PackerAve.; 610-758-4649; humanities@lehigh.eduThe humanities consider how we understand and record humanexperiences. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines includingphilosophy, history, literature, religion, visual arts, music, and language,humanistic study teaches us how to think creatively and critically aboutour own identities and our connections to others—whether they liveacross the street or across the world, whether they lived long ago orwill live in the futures we imagine. The Humanities Center at LehighUniversity is thus vital for building community both on and beyond ourcampus. The Humanities Center creates interdisciplinary intellectualopportunities for students, faculty, and staff engaged in humanisticinquiry across departments and programs. Through speaker series,reading groups, conferences, an undergraduate research journal,research grants, and informal gatherings, the Humanities Center fostersa broad community rooted in vibrant, rigorous, and creative inquiry intowhat it means and has meant to be human. The Humanities Center hasdesigned an annual speaker series on a theme, hosted scholars, writers,artists, and activists to speak on a single issue and organized year-longfaculty seminars to address specific intellectual topics. Recent themeshave included Home, Movement, Contagion, Speaking Bodies, and thePosthumanities.COURSE OFFERINGSThe Humanities Center hosts and sponsors the production of the LehighReview, an undergraduate research journal founded in 1992 by theLehigh humanities faculty. Original articles range in topic and subjectacross the spectrum of undergraduate study, from English to Economicsand Physics. Published annually, the entire publication process—fromreviewing submissions to editing to design and illustration—is handledalmost exclusively by undergraduate students and supervised by agraduate student instructor.Any scholarly articles, academic essays or book reviews written for aLehigh course may be submitted. The Review does not ordinarily acceptfiction or poetry.All submissions should reflect sustained intellectual engagement in anyof Lehigh’s many fields of study. We are especially interested in essaysthat draw from the content or methodology of more than one discipline.The Review expects students to submit well-researched and well-writtenworks that exceed a mere synthesis of existing sources. The Review publishes submissions which demonstrate imagination, original insightand a mastery of the subject.Courses"

The economicfortunes of countries, firms, and individuals have become so sensitiveto trade, monetary, and investment decisions made elsewhere thateconomic policy that is purely national has become all but impossible.Nuclear weapons, which can kill thousands in minutes, do not respectinternational boundaries; neither do the consequences of ethnic andcommunal conflicts. Non-state actors, from terrorists to human rightsactivists, also act across boundaries. The Internet has made it easierthan ever to form networks and political movements that span borders.Climate everywhere is affected by environmental decisions anywhere.In the 21st century, no state – not even the United States, though ithas become the first sole superpower in the history of the moderninternational system– and no citizen can make important choices in asound manner without understanding how their decisions are shaped bywhat happens outside the boundaries of their homeland; moreover, theirdecisions often affect people who live far beyond those borders.International Relations (IR) is the study of world politics in all of itsaspects: International security covers issues related to war and peace,among and within societies. International political economy focuses onthe political dimensions of trade, investment, development, and poverty.International law, organizations, and ethics and norms involve the studyof how legal principles and agreements and moral values contributeto the creation of order, create the basis for stable expectations, andregulate transactions among states and other participants in worldaffairs. IR theory exposes students to the major explanatory frameworksthat have been developed for the study of international relations.IR investigates the gamut of economic, technological, social, and culturaland military forces that create the increasing interdependence thatwe call “globalization.” IR examines the ways in which globalizationand other factors have sometimes contributed to the creation oforder but also often to the breakdown of order, violence among andwithin states, and to assertions of particularity, whether based onethnicity, nationalism, or on differences in culture, or wealth. Muchof IR is devoted to explaining the behavior of states, but IR alsoencompasses many entities besides sovereign states. These includeinternational organizations (such as the United Nations and its affiliatedorganizations); nongovernmental organizations; and intergovernmentalorganizations, such as the World Trade Organization, the EuropeanUnion, the African Union, or Mercosur, the Latin American trading bloc.Lehigh University has one of the few Departments of InternationalRelations in the United States. At Lehigh world, politics is not simplya division of political science. The IR Department is, therefore, able tooffer a concentrated and multifaceted program, and one that is trulyinterdisciplinary. Some IR faculty study world politics as scholars ofparticular geographic regions, others as theorists seeking to explain themajor processes of world politics regardless of where and when theyoccur: for instance, the causes and consequences of different formsof warfare; the rise and decline of empires; the challenges posed byenvironmental degradation; and the forces that create both wealth andpoverty. What we share is the dedication to teaching and scholarshipand the commitment to encouraging our students to engage new ideasand to subject familiar ones to thorough scrutiny.Judging by the number of students who choose IR as their major, it isone of the most popular disciplines at Lehigh. Moreover, as befits a fieldthat cuts across so many disciplines, we draw students who also pursuecoursework, minors, or “double majors” in fields ranging from Religion164         International RelationsStudies, Modern Languages and Literatures, Economics, and History toComputer Science, Biology, Engineering, and Environmental Policy.THE CURRICULUMStudents considering coursework in international relations arestrongly encouraged to visit the International Relations website (http://ir.cas2.lehigh.edu). Prospective International Relations majors shouldenroll in "
IR 388,") in thesenior year;2.attain a GPA of at least 3.5 in the courses constituting the IR majorprogram at the time of graduation. See department website foradditional information.BEYOND THE IR CURRICULUMIn close cooperation with the international education office, thedepartment assists students interested in study abroad programs.In addition, Lehigh has an array of summer programs, which involvecoursework and/or internships in such countries as China, the CzechRepublic, and the United Kingdom.Every semester speakers with expertise on various aspects of worldaffairs visit Lehigh. Featured speakers have included Dr. MadelineAlbright, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; Dr. ShashiTharoor, former U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Communications andPublic Information; Dr. Ernesto Zedillo, former President of Mexico andDirector of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization; and GeneralAnthony Zinni, 40 year Marine Corps veteran and U.S. peace envoy tothe Middle East.The student-run World Affairs Club sponsors a number of activities eachyear, including student-faculty socials, guest speakers, and relatedprograms. It organizes the Model United Nations program to whichLehigh sends a delegation each year. From time to time, delegations arealso sent to other student conferences, including at West Point and theU.S. Naval Academy.The department has an active program in conjunction with CareerServices to help place students in internships. We strongly encouragestudents to obtain an internship. Most of these internships are likely tobe in New York or Washington, D.C.UPON GRADUATINGWhile a degree in international relations does not lead to a specificcareer in the way that, for example, accounting or engineering does,a major in international relations, by emphasizing clarity in speechand writing, analytical skills, and a detailed knowledge of world politicsprepares students for careers in international business, government,journalism, law, nongovernmental organizations, and teaching andresearch.

Courses in anthropology;archeology; foreign policy; history; language and literature; politics;sociology; and art, architecture and design allow students to explorevarious aspects of Latin American and Latino cultures and societies froman interdisciplinary perspective.  The program contributes to a liberalarts education by offering students an international vantage point fromwhich they can examine the cultural complexity of their own society,preparing them to meet the challenges of an increasingly interdependentworld.  Additionally, the unprecedented movement of peoples and ideasbetween the American continents in recent decades makes the studyof Latin America and its connections to the U.S. Latino population anessential component for understanding the history and culture ofglobalization in the Americas. The major and minor in Latin Americanand Latino Studies thus complement the study of other disciplines witheither an international or a domestic focus, and enhance the relevanceof a Lehigh education by preparing students to be citizens of a culturallydiverse society and, more generally, of the Americas.Assistant Professors.

This is a principal reason behind the perpetualneed and demand for mathematicians in education, research centers,government, and industry.The department offers three major programs leading to the degrees ofbachelor of arts in mathematics, bachelor of science in mathematics(with a general mathematics and an applied mathematics option), andbachelor of science in statistics. It also offers several minor programs forundergraduates.At the graduate level, it offers programs leading to the degrees of masterof science in mathematics, master of science in applied mathematics,master of science in statistics, doctor of philosophy in mathematics, anddoctor of philosophy in applied mathematics.The Division of Applied Mathematics and Statistics is a part of theDepartment of Mathematics.CALCULUS SEQUENCESMany degree programs throughout the university include a mathematicsrequirement consisting of a sequence in calculus. The Department ofMathematics offers three calculus sequences:"

These programs have the flexibility and versatility neededLehigh University 2018-2019       183to prepare students for a wide variety of careers in government, industry,research and education.Students in the degree programs in mathematics must satisfy threetypes of requirements beyond those required by the college: CoreMathematics Requirements, Major Requirements and General Electives.The Core Mathematics Requirement ensures a common core ofknowledge appropriate for students in each program. The MajorProgram Electives consist of courses with specific mathematical orstatistical content chosen by the student in consultation with the majoradvisor to complement the student's interest and career aspirations.With these further breadth and greater depth of knowledge are achieved.The General Electives consist of additional courses chosen from amongthose offered by the university faculty. Students can use these electivesto pursue interests beyond the major, or may use these to expand uponthe basic requirements of the degree program. Students are stronglyencouraged to use some of these electives to earn a minor in anotherdiscipline.Students in the degree program in statistics must satisfy four types ofrequirements beyond those required by the college: Required MajorCourses, Major Electives, Professional Electives and Free Electives.Each student is provided a faculty advisor to guide an individual programand supervise the selection of electives.B.A. WITH A MAJOR IN MATHEMATICSThe B.A. program in mathematics emphasizes fundamental principlesas well as the mastery of techniques required for the effective use ofmathematics.

Proficiency in modern languagesis indispensable in a broad range of professions such as journalism,government, international affairs, law, the armed forces, and business.A bachelor of arts degree with a major in languages provides excellentpreparation for professional careers in law, business, and the media.Language study is required for graduate study in many disciplines, aswell as for research in science and technology. International experienceis personally enriching and enhances career prospects.Languages offeredLehigh offers Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Hebrew,Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. Courses include oral, reading, andwriting skills, literature, film, culture, civilization, and professional areassuch as business and health careers. A number of literature and culturecourses are given in English, but most offerings stress classroom use ofthe target language.Language requirementsThe Global Studies major, the Joint IR/MLL major, the Asian StudiesMajor as well as the major in Latin American and Latino Studies requirelanguage study. The minors in Latin American and Latino Studies, andAsian Studies require language study.

The candidate for the major is expected to demonstrateadequate written and oral command of the language, as well asknowledge of its literature and culture. A period of study abroad isstrongly recommended.Double majors and Arts-Engineering majors including a languagecomponent are well-received by employers. Studies in the two areas arecarefully coordinated by major advisers.Major in ChineseThe major in Chinese will require 36 credits: a minimum of 24 creditsin courses taught in Chinese, including 8 credits at the 200 or 300 levelof Chinese language and literature (marked CHIN). Courses offeredin English in MLL on Chinese literature and history may be included inthe major and a maximum of two courses outside of MLL in the AsianStudies Program that are concerned specifically with China, such asthose available in International Relations, Political Science, Religion,Sociology, etc., by approval of the major adviser. Majors in Chinese arestrongly encouraged to study abroad in a Chinese speaking country.Major in GermanThe major in German requires 32 credits in German language, literature,and culture beyond German 12. This includes all German coursesthat are 100 level and above, and emphasis should be on 200 and300 level courses. One of these courses may be taken in Englishwhen the class is taught by a German faculty member and when thewriting assignments are completed in German. For specific courserequirements, see the language major adviser.Majors in German are strongly encouraged to participate in a studyabroad program in a German speaking country for the equivalent of onesemester or more.

In fact, studyingphilosophy promotes the proficiencies that are increasing necessary toa full and prosperous human life: Logical Argument, Critical Thinking,Creativity and A Fundamental Understanding Of What It Means ToBe A Moral Agent. These skills are the cornerstones of all humanendeavors and actively support the varied careers of the future worker,who, according to the Pew Research Center (2017), must “learn todeeply cultivate and exploit creativity, collaborative activity, abstract andsystems thinking, complex communication and the ability to thrive indiverse environments.”With a major or minor in philosophy, it will become “…second nature,for the student to view everything from the perspective of systematicinquiry, see individual things not in isolation but rather in theirintellectual interconnection and place them in a larger context” (FriedrichSchleiermacher, 1808). Philosophical proficiencies will provide one withthe expertise to navigate through the challenges of the present, but,in providing an understanding of the evolution of critical thought andits application to human beings as agents in the economic and socio-political world, also prepare students for challenges and lives not yetimagined.Originally encompassing all fields of study, philosophy remains thefoundational discipline of all the disciplines at the university and thecore of a liberal arts education. At once both highly theoretical andprofoundly practical, philosophical thinking is reflective and criticalconceptual activity concerned with some of the most enduring andchallenging of fundamental questions about the nature, meaning, andpossibilities of human existence, the world, and the ways we thinkabout them. What makes humans human? What is the best way tolive?  What can we know?  What really exists? How can we think well? What are goodness, truth, beauty, space, time, causation, language,consciousness, happiness, freedom, rationality, justice?  Philosophersare gripped by such questions and seek to address them throughcreatively critical thinking, reasoned analysis and argumentation, andthoughtful discussion, instead of making assumptions or acceptinganswers to them based on opinion or prejudice. The study of philosophydevelops skills in careful and flexible thinking, critical analysis, soundreasoning and argumentation, objective evaluation, clear and persuasivewriting, and the toleration of uncertainty.Professors.

Students also study applicationsof the basic theories to the description of bulk matter, including themechanical, electric, magnetic, and thermal properties of solids, liquids,gases, and plasmas, and to the description of the structure of atomsand nuclei. In addition, students develop the laboratory skills andtechniques of the experimental physicist, skills that can be applied inthe experimental search for new knowledge or in applications relating toknown theories.A majority of physics graduates go to graduate school in physics,often earning the Ph.D. degree. These graduates take universityor college faculty positions, or work on research in a variety ofuniversity, government, or industrial laboratories. Some studentschoose employment immediately after the bachelor’s degree. They usetheir many approved and free electives to supplement their sciencebackground with applied courses, such as engineering, to develop theskills needed for a position in a particular area.Because of the fundamental role of physics in all natural sciences,students also use the physics major as an excellent preparationfor graduate study in many other scientific areas, such as opticalengineering, applied mathematics, computer science, biophysics,molecular biology, astrophysics, geology and geophysics, materialsscience and engineering, meteorology, or physical oceanography.Attractive engineering areas with a high science content include opticalcommunications, aeronautical engineering, nuclear engineering,including both fission and fusion devices; electrical engineering,including instrumentation; electronics and solid-state devices, electricaldischarges and other plasma-related areas; and mechanical engineeringand mechanics, including fluids and continuum mechanics. The broadscientific background developed in the physics curriculum is also anexcellent background for professional schools, such as law (particularlypatent law), medicine, and optometry.Lehigh offers three undergraduate degrees in physics and twoundergraduate degrees in astronomy or astrophysics. The threephysics degrees are the bachelor of arts with a major in physics and thebachelor of science in physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, andthe bachelor of engineering physics in the College of Engineering andApplied Science. The B.A. with a major in astronomy and the B.S. inastrophysics are in the College of Arts and Sciences and are describedin the Astronomy and Astrophysics section of this catalog.In addition, there are several five-year, dual-degree programs involvingphysics: The Arts-Engineering program (see the Arts-EngineeringLehigh University 2018-2019       215section of this catalog), the combination of the bachelor of scienceprogram in the College of Arts and Sciences with electrical engineering(described below), and the combination of electrical engineering andengineering physics (see the Electrical Engineering and EngineeringPhysics section of this catalog).The bachelor of science curriculum in the College of Arts and Sciencesrequires somewhat more physics and mathematics than the bachelorof arts major, while the latter provides more free electives and fewerhours for graduation. By making good use of the electives in theseprograms, students can pursue graduate work in physics or physicalaspects of other science or engineering disciplines, or technical careersrequiring a basic knowledge of physics. The bachelor of arts curriculumis particularly useful for those planning careers in areas where someknowledge of physics is needed or useful, but is not the main subject,such as science writing, secondary school teaching, patent law, ormedicine. The bachelor of science in engineering physics curriculum inthe College of Engineering and Applied Science requires an engineeringconcentration in either solid state electronics or optical sciences, inaddition to regular physics and mathematics courses. This four-yearprogram prepares students to do engineering work in an overlap areabetween physics and engineering.  This may involve engineering in aforefront area in which it is desirable to have more physics knowledgethan that typically provided in an engineering program.  It may be afield of experimental physics which either relies heavily on forefrontengineering or in which the nature of the problem dictates that scientistsand engineers will accomplish more working together rather thanseparately.Requirements and recommended course sequences are describedbelow for programs in the College of Arts and Sciences and in the P.

Research areas available to undergraduates arethe same as those available to graduate students; they are describedbelow under the heading For Graduate Students. Undergraduatestudent research is arranged informally as early as the sophomore (or,occasionally, freshman) year at the initiation of the student or formallyas a senior research project. In addition, a number of students receivefinancial support to do research during the summer between their juniorand senior years, either as Physics Department Summer ResearchParticipants or as Sherman Fairchild Scholars.The use of electivesThe electives available in each of the physics and astronomy curriculaprovide the student with an opportunity to develop special interestsand to prepare for graduate work in various allied areas. In particular,the many available upper-level physics, mathematics, and engineeringcourses can be used by students in consultation with their facultyadvisors to structure programs with special emphases in a varietyof areas such as optical communications, solid-state electronics, orbiophysics.DEPARTMENTAL HONORSStudents may earn departmental honors by satisfying the followingrequirements:•Grade point average of at least 3.50 in physics courses.•Complete 6 credits of )Can be taken Concurrently: "

Fife, Ph.D, Professor and Department ChairE:mail: blf218@lehigh.edu / Phone: 610-758-3338 / Fax:  610-758-3348http://cas.lehigh.edu/polsThe major in political science is designed to promote understandingof political ideas, institutions and processes and to develop skills inanalyzing and evaluating political problems.A balanced program within the discipline, one that exposes the studentto various areas of inquiry in political institutions and political processesas well as in the comparative and philosophical perspectives of politicalanalysis, has been the way in which the goals of the major programgenerally have been achieved. While the major program outlined belowwill prove adequate for most student needs, it may be that some specialfactors such as late transfer or unusual interests and/or abilities theoutlined program does not accommodate some students. In that casethe students may, in consultation with their advisers, develop a majorprogram that in their judgment will more adequately fulfill those needs.The faculty adviser to the student majoring in political science isdesignated by the department. The adviser consults with the student andapproves the major program. The adviser attempts to help the studentrelate courses offered by the department to the student’s educationalgoals. The adviser also may act as a resource for the student, and maysuggest courses in other disciplines, language courses, and courses inresearch techniques that may be of benefit.A variety of experiential opportunities are available to undergraduatesmajoring in political science. The department, for example, offers aCommunity Politics Internship every semester that includes opportunitiesfor internship placements in either local government, private agenciesor law offices. Students are also encouraged to apply for off-campusinternship opportunities, e.g., American University’s WashingtonSemester Program and The Philadelphia Center’s Internship inPhiladelphia.Completion of the political science major is considered suitable trainingfor the undergraduate who wishes to go on to law school, to becomea social science teacher, or to work as a governmental official, partyor civic leader, public affairs commentator, or staff member of agovernment research bureau. In addition, the business sector continuesto provide opportunities in areas such as banking, insurance, andmarketing for bachelor of arts graduates with training in the socialsciences. Graduate study is advisable for students contemplating certaincareers: college teaching, research, or public management, for example.Professors.

All other 300-levelpsychology courses can be used to fulfill this requirement.Optional ConcentrationStudents in the B.A. program may choose to complete an optionalconcentration. Concentrations are available in four areas: Cognition andCognitive Neuroscience; Developmental; Social and Personality; andClinical and Behavioral Health. Completion of a concentration involvesselecting specific 100-level breadth courses and 300-level seminarswithin the concentration. See listings of individual concentration coursesbelow.Recommended ElectivesThe B.A. program in psychology is a flexible preparation for a numberof fields. With suitable selection of additional courses, students canprepare themselves for graduate study in any subfield of psychologyor for careers in areas for which psychology is a desirable and relevantmajor such as neuroscience, law, social work, marketing, management,and education.Depending on the specific subfield of interest, many courses inother departments within CAS, and in other Colleges, may berelevant. Examples include Biological Sciences (especially theBehavioral Neuroscience program), Philosophy, Sociology andAnthropology, Marketing, Economics, Management, Education, and inthe interdisciplinary programs of Cognitive Science; Women, Gender,and Sexuality Studies; Health, Medicine, and Society; Global Studies;and Africana Studies.For graduate programs in psychology, neuroscience, and related fields,additional coursework in research and statistics is desirable, as isengagement in supervised research and participation in the honorsprogram.Preparation for programs in health-related areas such as nursing,medicine, and dentistry will include additional coursework in biology,chemistry, and physics. Students should consult with the appropriatepre-professional advisors to determine specific requirements.Students interested in applying psychology to fields such as law,marketing, social work, management, or education should consult withfaculty in those areas to discuss relevant courses.B.S. MAJOR PROGRAM IN PSYCHOLOGYThe Bachelor of Science in psychology is a highly structured andcomprehensive behavioral science major requiring 14 courses(approximately 53 credit hours) in psychology and 9 collateral courses(approximately 31-36 credit hours) as described below. Students arerequired to complete a portfolio of written work that provides a record oftheir learning and accomplishments throughout the major. Students mustalso fulfill college and university degree requirements. Students pursuinga wide-range of post-graduate plans may find this program fits theirneeds and interests. One difference between the B.S. in psychology andother B.S. programs is that the collateral requirements for the B.S. inpsychology allow for a level of breadth that is not always possible in B.S.programs. The collateral courses for the B.S. in psychology span threeareas (Mathematics and Computer Science; Natural Science; and Socialand Cognitive Science). Hence, students with wide-ranging interestsmay find that they can pursue their varied interests while fulfilling thecollateral requirements for this B.S. program. For students consideringgraduate programs in psychology, neuroscience, and related fields,additional coursework in research and statistics is desirable, as isengagement in supervised research and participation in the honorsprogram.Students in the B.S. program must complete a concentration inCognition and Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental; Social andPersonality; or Clinical and Behavioral Health. Progression through theprogram is best served through early commitment. Students who donot declare their majors early may find it difficult to complete the B.S.major program. Transfer credits and study abroad course work may beapplied toward the major; however, students must take a minimum oftwo 100-level breadth courses, three 300-level seminars, and the PSYC201, 202, and 203 sequence at Lehigh to earn a psychology major fromLehigh.Requirements for the B.S. in PsychologyCollateral RequirementsFor students in the B.S. program, collateral courses can be used tofulfill the college distribution requirements in mathematics, naturalscience, and social science. To fulfill natural science college distributionrequirements, at least one course must include the associated lab.Please consult the course listings for information on prerequisites.Mathematics and Computer Science7-8Select two from the following: or to fulfill this requirement.

SOC 454," Urban Education: Inequality and Public Policy 1-4 CreditsSocial inequality is found throughout American Society but problems ofinequality related to education have perhaps received more attentionthan those of any other contemporary social institution. Researchers,scholars, journalists, social critics, and observers have studied, written,and talked about educational inequality to an enormous extent. Socialservice organizations, activists, policymakers, legal professionals, andgovernment officials have focused massive reform efforts and politicalagendas to tackle inequality in education. Many sociologists have longviewed education not just as an arena of inequality but as the solutionto the widespread inequalities they see reflected in society. Urbaneducation has been an especially complex and controversial subject ofscrutiny in recent scholarly and popular debates. This course will focuswith a sociological perspective on urban education, inequality, and publicpolicy in the contemporary United States. The first portion of the courseexamines research and literature relevant to the contemporary socialproblems of urban education and inequality.

SOC 490," Master's Thesis 1-6 CreditsTheatreTo study theatre is to examine its many internal disciplines. Acting anddirecting combine with design, technical theatre, dramatic literature andtheatre history to form the body of our art. Students may pursue generaltheatre studies or focus on particular areas such as performance,design or history and literature. They may major in theatre, minor intheatre or participate strictly in our production program. Students mayeven complete a minor in theatre from outside the College of Arts andSciences.The bachelor of arts degree in theatre is granted after at least 48credit hours of study. Because we believe that undergraduate theatreeducation should be broad based with an emphasis on diversity ofexperience, students are encouraged to take a variety of coursesoutside the major. Many students complete double majors. Thosewith the talents and aspirations for a career in theatre have gone tograduate schools offering intense, pre-professional training. Othermajors who have not pursued a theatrical career have gone fromour program directly into careers in business, social services, sales.Theatre study is an excellent preparation for vocations in which selfpresentation is important, such as law. The problem solving, analyticaland interpersonal skills gained from this discipline are applicable acrossa wide range of careers. An understanding and appreciation of thecomplex art of the theatre will enrich a lifetime.The department’s active production program is curricular and promotescollaborative projects involving students, faculty, staff and guest artists.Our large performance facility is the Diamond Theater, a 300-seatthrust theatre housed in the Zoellner Arts Center. The core of our workin this space is dedicated to productions featuring primarily studentactors directed by faculty or guest artists. When possible, a highlyqualified student may direct or design in this space. In addition to ourown productions, we regularly invite outside professional performers andensembles to work with us and perform. We also operate a lab theatre(Fowler Black Box Theater) for student and faculty experimentation.The availability of valuable hands-on experience and the very closeworking relationships developed between students and faculty uniquelycharacterize the department of theatre. The department enjoys a specialrelationship with Bethlehem’s professional theatre company, TouchstoneTheatre. Performance and administrative internships with the companyare available to qualified students and the department and Touchstoneoften collaborate on workshops and seminars.Students interested in designing a major or minor in theatre shouldconsult with the department chairperson. Experienced theatre studentswith questions regarding accurate placement in any theatre courseshould, likewise, consult with the chairperson.Lehigh University 2018-2019       259Lehigh University is an accredited institution of the National Associationof Schools of Theatre.Professors.

Typically, this includes five 4-credit courses and two 2-credit theatre production courses. The minor intheatre must include some academic diversity beyond a single curriculararea.DEPARTMENTAL HONORSThe exceptional student may elect to pursue departmental honors in thesenior year. This student must have a GPA of 3.3 in all theatre coursespresented for the major. No later than the fall of the senior year thestudent, with faculty supervision, elects a special project in a particulararea of theatre. This may take the form of preparing to direct a play,researching a role to be performed, preparing a design presentationor researching in an area of theatre scholarship in preparation for thewriting of a substantial report. In the next semester, usually the springof the senior year, the report or project would be executed.

In the best tradition of a liberal arts education, Women,Gender, and Sexuality Studies encourages thinking that is critical andconstructive, multifaceted and intersectional in order to redesignknowledge, and gain a better understanding of how identities shapeand are shaped by the social world in which we live. Offering anundergraduate major and minor, a Graduate Certificate, and a host offaculty and student-focused events and resources, WGSS works to be aspace of professional growth, intellectual development and maturity, anda knowledge leader on campus, in the surrounding Lehigh Valley, andabroad.Associate Professor. Jacqueline Krasas, PHD (University of SouthernCalifornia)UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN WOMEN, GENDER, AND SEXUALITYSTUDIESThe Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies BA will provide studentsan in depth education in an interdisciplinary field of academic inquirythat critically examines the diverse realities of women's lives and theways in which gender and power differentials shape human lives andhuman societies. WGSS pursues a fundamental critique of knowledgeby challenging the basic assumptions, methods of inquiry, theoreticalframeworks, and knowledge claims of traditional fields of inquiry thathave thought it unimportant to study women, gender, or sexuality.WGSS seeks to create new paradigms of knowledge and inquiry, todevelop more truthful and comprehensive understandings of humansand our world, and to explore nonsexist alternatives for more richlyhuman lives and more fully human social orders.Each semester, a complete list of WGSS  course offerings can be foundon the web site or in the Office of Interdisciplinary Programs, WilliamsHall, Suite 101.  The WGSS major requires 34-36 credits of coursework and is designedto complement other areas of study within CAS in order to facilitatedouble-majors for our students. WGSS majors can stand alone;however, many students find the major an invaluable asset as part ofa double major. The major will have a core curriculum, a concentration(social sciences or humanities), electives, and a senior experience.Major Core CoursesMajor Core Courses"

The Certificate is a small, flexible program that providesstudents with breadth and the challenge of working outside their homediscipline in concentrated interdisciplinary study of women and gender.In recognition of contemporary educational and employment contextsthat are increasingly diverse and international, the WGSS Programoffers the graduate certificate as a means to enrich academic, personal,and employment horizons. A certificate in WGSS will be especiallybeneficial to those who wish to incorporate a broader perspective intotheir teaching (either in secondary or higher education), and qualifiesthem for positions that require such expertise. Additionally, individualsinterested in fields such as social policy, human resources, and businesswill also gain from understanding how gender operates at individual,organizational, and institutional levels.

The second is an explorationof gender (the social construction of differential identity for males andfemales) and of the ways in which gender distinctions shape humanconsciousness and human society. The third is an examination of sex/gender and sexuality systems.Nearly all academic disciplines have defined human nature andsignificant achievement in terms of male experience and haveunderestimated the impact of gender on social structures andhuman lives. By contrast, WGSS courses attend to women's diverseexperiences and perspectives and acknowledge the critical significanceof gender and sexuality. By shifting the focus to women, gender,and sexuality, WGSS seeks to provide an alternative paradigm forunderstanding human experience. Students in WGSS courses areencouraged to reevaluate traditional assumptions about human beings,human knowledge, and human culture and society, and to explorenonsexist alternatives for a more fully human social order.The minor in WGSS consists of a minimum of 18 credit hours.

(https://ise.lehigh.edu/content/masters-programs-courses/#Management)Materials Science and EngineeringAs science and technology advance in the 21st century, progress inmany fields will depend on the discovery and development of newmaterials, processed in more complex ways, and with new kinds ofproperties. It is widely recognized that the progress of history has beendivided into periods characterized by the materials that mankind hasused, e.g., the stone age, the bronze age, the iron age. Today, materialsscience and engineering is critical to all other fields of engineering, andadvances in other fields are often limited by advances in materials.Interest in new materials for solid-state devices, space technology, andsuperconductivity, as well as a better understanding of the behaviorof materials in the design of structures, automobiles and aircraft, plantprocessing equipment, electronic devices, biomedical devices, etc.,have increased the need for people trained in science and technology ofmaterials.Education for this field of engineering requires basic studies inmathematics, chemistry, physics and mechanics, plus a generalbackground in engineering principles, followed by intensive trainingin the application of these principles to the development and use ofmaterials in a technological society.Professors.

IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERINGThe undergraduate program is designed to prepare graduates forresearch, development, operations, management, and sales careersin industry or for graduate study in various specialties of the field,including the improvement of properties in metals, ceramics, polymers,composites, electronic materials, and biomaterials. While somegraduates go directly into materials-producing companies, most serve asengineers in the transportation, electronics, chemical, communications,space, and other industries. A number of students pursue graduatestudy leading to careers in research and teaching, medicine, or the law.Materials Science and Engineering majors have opportunities togain valuable experience in related fields, including other areasof engineering or science, by choosing to concentrate electivecourses in one of these areas. Requirements for the Minor includeacquiring at least 15 course credits in that area, which may be takenas technical or free electives in the student's major. It is particularlystraightforward for students to obtain a minor in Chemical Engineering,in Manufacturing Engineering, in Nanotechnology, or in Polymer Scienceand Engineering.Materials Science and Engineering majors can also participate inundergraduate research at universities in Great Britain and elsewhereduring the summer between the Junior and Senior years. The MaterialsScience and Engineering Industrial Option program enables students togain work experience during the Senior Year. The Materials Science andEngineering Research Option program provides senior undergraduateswith research experience.Five-Year programs are available to broaden the Materials Science andEngineering undergraduate experience. One such program is the Arts-Engineering Program, in which students can earn both the Bachelor ofScience degree in Materials Science and Engineering and the Bachelorof Arts degree in some area within the College of Arts and Sciences,such as biology, physics, chemistry, or history. Another is the B.S./M.Ed.Program, which leads (in five years of study and internships) to the B.S.degree in Materials Science and Engineering and a masters degree(M.Ed.) in Education, with elementary or secondary teacher certification.MINOR IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERINGThe Department of Materials Science and Engineering offers minors tostudents majoring in other subjects. The Department is enthusiastic inits support of students who wish to broaden their education by takinga minor.

Successful professional experience is requiredfor admission to candidacy. The requirements for the Ed.D. degreeparallel those already stated for the Ph.D. degree.NON-DEGREE OPTIONSThe non-degree options are designed for those individuals interestedin taking a few courses in the College but not interested in pursuing agraduate degree. For information on the non-degree program, contactDonna Johnson at 610-758-3231 or email education@lehigh.edu.  Thereare two non-degree options as well:1.Regular non-degree and2.Non-degree for external certification.Regular non-degree admission is for students who wish to take up to12 credits of graduate coursework at Lehigh University without seekinga degree. Any transcript or other record from the University will clearlyindicate the student status as non-degree. Non-degree students are notpermitted to audit courses. University admissions criteria for non-degreegraduate students are (a) a bachelor's degree from an accreditedinstitution with an overall grade point average of at least 2.75 on a four-point scale (Applicants with undergraduate GPAs slightly below 3.0 maybe admitted with approval from the department of Education and HumanServices) or (b) to have achieved a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a four-point scale for a minimum of 12 graduate credits at another accreditedinstitution. If English is not your first language, you must submit TOEFLscores.Non-degree for external certification students are admitted to pursuecoursework for the purpose of obtaining certification through an externalaccrediting agency. Applicants are expected to have an undergraduateGPA of 3.0 or higher on a four-point scale or to have achieved a GPA of3.0 or higher on a four-point scale for a minimum of 12 graduate creditsat another accredited institution. Applicants are assigned certificationadvisers on admissions and must work with the adviser to assure thatthey complete all requirements for certification satisfactorily. Studentscomplete the coursework and any other required field experiencesfor the appropriate certification, with the number of credits and fieldexperiences being dictated by the external accrediting agency. Giventhis external control of credit requirements, the number of credits willvary and will typically exceed the 12 credit limit for regular non-degreestudents. Certification involves qualitative components as well ascredits; a non-degree student seeking such certification must meet thequality standards of the certification program, as well as completing thenecessary coursework and field experiences.CHANGING FROM NON-DEGREE TO DEGREE STATUSNon-degree students of either type may seek admission to a degreeprogram. Non-degree students who seek admission to a degreeprogram must meet all regular admissions criteria, complete all regularapplication procedures, and present all documents normally requiredof degree-seeking applicants to that program. Courses taken by a non-degree student who later enters a degree program will count towardsthe completion of the program to the extent that those courses fallwithin the normal requirements of the program and to the extent thatthe student's performance in the course(s) is acceptable for degreeprogram purposes. Any course that is counted towards the completionof a degree must be completed within the established time limits for thatdegree, whether taken initially as a degree or non-degree course.Professor.

The CIE program also offers a Lehighgraduate certificate program in International Education for Development.Graduates completing their degree in the CIE program may moveinto positions in international education, as government officialsand education policy makers, research/policy institute scientists,development program officers, or work in various non-governmentaland educational organizations either in the United States or in countriesaround the world.The Comparative and International Education (CIE) program providesa unique blend of global community, content, interaction, context,perspective and purpose. Highlights of these innovative qualities include:•An international learning community. The CIE Program is a vibrantlearning community where internationalization thrives in formalclassroom instruction, as well as in daily socialization of studentsand faculty in academic, professional, and personal realms.  CIEstudents have a unique opportunity to engage in a myriad ofinternational experiences as a part of their graduate educationexperience, including conducting education research and evaluationworldwide, engaging in international education developmentconsultancy, internships at the United Nations, and assisting injournal/book editing in comparative and international education.•Multiple opportunities for student/faculty interaction. CIE faculty haveextensive experience in the field as teachers and leaders, as well asa theoretical and methodological grounding in a discipline, which isrelevant to global research and comparative educational issues. Werecognize that students bring a wealth of expertise and knowledgethat complements the faculty’s expertise and knowledge. Therefore,the CIE program provides a framework through which studentsand faculty can build professional relationships that extend beyondthe classroom, including collaborative projects, directed study, andintellectual discourse.•Interdisciplinary perspectives. Given that education is the productof many converging forces from politics to society to economicsto history to business and philosophy, education and schoolingissues are too complex and diverse to be addressed by just onedisciplinary perspective.  Unless we understand the various factorsimpacting decisions, we cannot understand why schools in countriesaround the world are structured the way they are, or why educationalLehigh University 2018-2019       309policies in our own communities deal with the topics they do. Working closely with the graduate programs in the College ofEducation and across the university, the CIE degree programsbreach the boundaries of disciplines, thus creating an opportunityfor students to examine education-related issues from multipleperspectives.There are several projects that exemplify the CIE Program’s signatureand distinctive properties. They are,•International Education and Research. CIE faculty and studentsparticipate in research and academic exchange with colleaguesaround the world.  One example is through the CIE Program-based Tübingen-Lehigh International Partnership (TüLIP). ThroughTüLIP, Lehigh students have the option to take either full-termor short schedule courses taught in English at the University ofTübingen (Germany).  Research or field-work may also be taken forLehigh academic credit and is collaboratively supervised by bothLehigh and Tübingen professors.  One recent project connectedto TüLIP through the CIE Program is the Mountaintop Experiencecalled “Transitions for Refugees through Empowerment andEducation” (TREE).  The TREE project unites Lehigh students,refugee advocates and education experts in both the U.S. andGermany to investigate the dynamic factors facing resettled refugeeyouth.•Scholarly Publication and Editing. The CIE Program is home totwo professional academic publications in the field: The AnnualReview of Comparative and International Education (ARCIE) and theFIRE: Forum for International Research in Education.  ARCIE is theflagship academic review in the field of comparative and internationaleducation, and is published annually.  FIRE is an international, peer-reviewed, open-source, online journal promoting interdisciplinaryscholarship on the use of internationally comparative data forevidence-based and innovative change in education worldwide.  CIEfaculty serve as senior editor for both publications and CIE studentsserve as both editorial assistants and frequent co-authors for theseprestigious publications.•International Development and Consulting. CIE Program faculty andstudents engage in short-term development and program-relatedconsultancy projects on a regular basis.  For example, a CIE facultyand student team has worked with a youth village for orphaned andvulnerable youth in post-genocide Rwanda to develop a village-wide monitoring and evaluation system.  This consultancy project,developed with the support of a CIE degree program graduateworking with the Rwandan village, involved both Lehigh-basedand Rwanda-based planning, research, workshops, and otherconsultancy-related activities, and complemented graduate-levelcoursework in the CIE program.For additional information about the program, please visit:   http://coe.lehigh.edu/academics/disciplines/cieAssistant Professor. Peggy A Kong, PHD (Harvard University)Professors Of Practice. Lisa Mareike Damaschke-Deitrick, PHD(Mason Tenders Dist C); Sothy Eng, PHD (Texas Tech University)Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative and International EducationThe Ph.D. degree program in Comparative and International Education(Ph.D. CIE) prepares students for research, scholarly inquiry, andadvanced professional careers in the field of comparative andinternational education.  A hallmark of this program is the bridgebetween educational theory, research, and practice.  The Ph.D.degree program will build on and continue the strengths of the M.A. inComparative and International Education program by being practical,research-oriented, and policy-focused, while adding a robust theory-oriented and research-driven component.  The Ph.D. in CIE degreeoffers a combination of rigorous training in comparative education; keyskills in policy analysis, monitoring and evaluation and advocacy; as wellas provides students with the flexibility to pursue in-depth research ina variety of areas critical to comparative and international education.  Graduates are prepared to work in higher education institutions,educational research and policy organizations, government offices,ministries of education, and international development organizations.Comparative & International Education Core (15 credits)"

The TLT Ph.D. program employs ascientist/practitioner model of learning. That is, research is not separatefrom application or practice. Our doctoral students collaborate closelywith faculty to generate new theories and classification systems,innovative curricula, technology-integrated learning environments,authentic approaches to assessing learning, and a wide range ofcreative methods of teaching and learning in a global world highlyinterconnected by technology.In keeping with the scientist/practitioner model, our doctoral studentslearn through innovative approaches, including research-basedstrategies for curriculum delivery, synchronous and asynchronousenvironments, and a wide range of other technology-enhanced designsand approaches for learning.  Students take about 42 credits ofcoursework in addition to their qualifying examination preparation,doctoral research project, and dissertation project.  Coursework isindividualized according to the concentration students decide to pursue.Also, many of the course assignments are project-based, which willallows students to apply concepts they are learning to their particulararea of interest. In addition, the choice of research topic and projects isalso up to the student --in consultation with his/her faculty adviser andwithin the broader context of the field, of course.Foundations (12 credits)Required:nternship in: (with subtitle)1-6nternship in: (with subtitle)1-6"

Rossin College of Engineering andApplied ScienceThe Applied Science Program enables students to createinterdisciplinary specialties that prepare them for careers in a world thatincreasingly bridges academic disciplines. Students pursue subject-areaconcentrations that represent academic interests they wish to integrateinto a meaningful program. The core offers students the intellectualtools to identify connections between the concentrations and engage ininterdisciplinary problem-solving and critical thinking.The program leads to the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science. Eachstudent’s curriculum combines a general engineering education with acarefully customized concentration in engineering and/or science as wellas another area of emphasis, which may include courses taken insidethe P.C. Rossin College of Engineering & Applied Science and may alsoinclude courses taken in one or more of the other three Colleges withinthe University.In order to ensure the success of this individualized approach toeducation, Applied Science places primary emphasis on advisement.Each student is teamed with an advisor who helps the student plan thecourse of study and who supervises independent study and internships.The advisor remains the student’s advisor throughout his or herundergraduate career.Unlike students in the traditional college programs, students in theApplied Science program of individualized study do not declare amajor in a particular academic department. Instead, they develop aconcentration that may combine study in several areas. Students areencouraged by their advisor to develop the concentration in such away that the student will be well prepared for further study in graduateschool or for pursuing a particular career path. While the chosenconcentration can be highly customized in consultation with the advisor,examples of concentrations include: Technical Communications, DigitalMedia, Entertainment Science, Technology/Science and Education,Technology/Science and Pre-law, Technology/Science and Pre-Medicine, Technology Management, Technology Marketing, andEngineering and Architecture.

CREG 257C,"omputer Science and EngineeringThe department of computer science and engineering (CSE) offersundergraduate and graduate programs of study in computer science ,computer science and business, and computer engineering, alongwith research opportunities in these fields. Computer science is thestudy of computer algorithms, software systems, and the effectiveuse of computers to solve real-world problems and to develop newapplications. Computer engineering is the study of how to developnew computer systems and how to integrate computers with electronicdevises. Lehigh’s majors prepare students for graduate school or forany of the different careers in computer science , computer engineeringor computer systems analysis. Computer science and computerengineering and their related careers represent, in the US workplace,the largest field of engineering larger than all others, including electricalengineering, combined. More discussion on the career potential, aswell as the most up to date course offerings can be found on ourdepartmental web site, www.cse.lehigh.edu.Lehigh University offers a bachelor of science degree in computerscience from the P. C. Rossin College of Engineering and AppliedScience; the bachelor of science degree in computer science, and thebachelor of arts degree with a major in computer science, from theCollege of Arts and Sciences; and a bachelor of science in ComputerScience and Business, jointly supported by the P.C. Rossin Collegeof Engineering and Applied Science and the College of Business andEconomics. A minor in computer science is available except to studentsmajoring in computer engineering, computer science or computerscience and business. Graduate study in the department leads tothe degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) incomputer science. In conjunction with the department of Electrical andComputer Engineering (ECE), a bachelor of science degree in computerengineering and the master of science and Ph.D. degrees in computerengineering are also offered in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineeringand Applied Science.  In conjunction with the College of Businessand Economics, the CSE department also takes part in the mastersof business and engineering (MB&E) program and in the integratedbusiness and engineering major.The undergraduate programs emphasize the fundamental aspects oftheir respective areas, with extensive hands-on experiences for thestudents. Electives permit students to tailor their programs according totheir interests and goals, whether they be in preparation for graduatestudy or entry into industry. The department highly recommends thatstudents give focus to their electives by following one of the trackslisted in the department website at www.cse.lehigh.edu/TRACKS.Students have the opportunity to synthesize and apply their knowledgein a senior design project. Students are encouraged to becomeinvolved in the many research projects within the department, and mayuse independent study courses and their senior project as a way toparticipate while receiving course credit.The graduate programs enable students to deepen their professionalknowledge, understanding, and capability within their subspecialties.Each graduate student develops a program of study in consultation withhis or her graduate advisor. Key thrust areas in the department include:Computer Systems Engineering: computer architecture, sensornetworks, robotics, mobile and wearable computing, and networking.Software Systems Engineering: software architectures, parallel anddistributed computing, object-oriented soft ware, middleware, Web-based systems and networked software systems.Information Systems Engineering: database, data mining,bioinformatics, computer graphics, optimization, multimedia systems,expert systems, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.Both graduate and undergraduate research are encouraged. Thedepartment maintains a number of computer laboratories in supportof computer science and computer engineering. The department hasresearch laboratories in robotics, networking, image processing, artificialintelligence, security, and web mining. These laboratories and theirassociated research activities are described more completely in thedepartmental web site (www.cse.lehigh.edu). While these laboratoriesare research oriented, they are also used for undergraduate projects.Computer laboratory usage is an essential part of the student’seducation. The primary department resources include a network of morethan 60 workstations, file servers, and compute servers running the Unixoperating system. These systems provide an array of software toolsfor our students and researchers including programming languages (C,C++, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Matlab, etc.), software developmenttools, software and hardware simulators, and computer-aided designpackages. One of our teaching labs contains workstations specificallydesigned for flexibility in running different operating systems so thatstudents can become system administrators, network defenders, ordesigners of high-performance code utilizing graphical processing units(GPUs) within a controlled environment.The department’s computers are connected via gigabit Ethernetto the university’s backbone network. The university is connectedthrough multiple high-capacity connections to the Internet as well asa connection to Internet2. Neither the department nor the universityrequires a student to own a personal computer. In addition to thedepartmental resources, the university provides campus-widewireless network access, public sites containing hundreds of PCsand Macintoshes, multiple large-capacity compute servers, and mostclassrooms are equipped with a PC and a video projection system.Professors.

ROSSIN COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCEGraduate ProgramsNote: For information about graduate degrees in Computer Engineering,see the catalog entry for Computer Engineering. (p. 374)Graduate programs of study provide a balance between formalclassroom instruction and research and are tailored to the individualstudent’s professional goals. The programs appeal to individualswith backgrounds in computer or information science, in computerengineering, in electrical engineering, in mathematics, or in the physicalsciences. Research is an essential part of the graduate program. Theresearch topics were listed earlier in the departmental description.The Master of Science degree requires the completion of 30 credit hoursof work and may include a three credit hour thesis. A program of studymust be submitted in compliance with the graduate school regulations.An oral presentation of the thesis is required.The Master of Engineering degree requires the completion of 30credit hours of work, which includes design-oriented courses andan engineering project. A program of study must be submitted incompliance with the college rules. An oral presentation of the program isrequired.The Ph.D. degree in computer science requires the completion of 42credit hours of work (including the dissertation) beyond the master'sdegree (48 hours if the master's degree is not from Lehigh), the passingof departmental qualifying requirements appropriate to each degreewithin one year after entrance into the degree program, the admissioninto candidacy, the passing of a general examination in the candidate'sarea of specialization, and the writing and defense of a dissertation.Competence in a foreign language is not required.The CSE department has a core curriculum requirement for graduatestudents in each of the degree programs. The purpose of thisrequirement is to guarantee that all students pursuing graduate studiesin the department acquire an appropriate breadth of knowledge of theirdiscipline.Computer Science: PhD students in the CS program must satisfy a"Graduate Breadth" requirement which involves taking, in addition tothe four mandated first-year courses, another four regular graduate-level courses in Computer Science and Engineering or a closely relatedsubject. Courses appropriate to the student's educational objectivesshould be selected in consultation with the student's advisor. The planmust be approved by the advisor, the Director of Graduate Studies forCSE, and the Chair of the CSE Department. To satisfy the requirement,courses must be at the 400-level and may not be research, independentstudy, experimental, or special topics courses (for example, coursesnumbered "
CSE 450," or CSE 49X will not satisfy the requirement).This new requirement applies to CS students entering the Ph.D.program in Fall 2010 or later (i.e.,those who fall under the new rulesregarding the first-year curriculum). For details on these requirements,see the department's web site www.cse.lehigh.edu.Courses from other universities or undergraduate studies may beused to satisfy these requirements, by petition, at the discretion of thedepartment faculty. Additional graduate program information may beobtained from the department’s graduate coordinator.Courses"

Majoremployers of our graduates include management consulting firms,manufacturing companies, banks, hospitals, railroads, the postalservice, and transportation/logistics services. A typical career path of anindustrial and systems engineer is to start in an entry level engineeringposition or as a technical analyst and to progress through variousmanagement positions in the firm or institution. Significant numbers ofindustrial and systems engineers ultimately become chief executiveofficers, chief operating officers, and chief technology officers in theirrespective organizations.Production Systems Career OpportunitiesThe discipline of industrial & systems engineering is applicable innearly all industries, whether the industry involves manufacturing ofa product or delivery of a service. Job functions performed by ISEsinclude: systems analysis, cost estimation, capital equipment selection,engineering economy, facilities planning, production planning andscheduling, inventory control, quality control, project management,operations management, engineering management, as well as methodsanalysis and work measurement. Manufacturing systems engineering(MSE) is a specialty field associated with industrial and systemsengineering that emphasizes functions and technologies such asprocess planning, plant layout design, manufacturing resource planning,production management, production line design, automation, robotics,flexible manufacturing systems, and computer integrated manufacturing.Information Systems Career OpportunitiesThe Industrial & Systems Engineering program can also producegraduates who understand the complex facets of modern informationsystems, and the integration of these systems in industrial, serviceand financial organizations. The ISE student has an opportunity tofocus on three important areas that are key to a successful informationsystems-oriented career. (1) Information Economics, (2) QuantitativeSystems Analysis, and (3) Information Technology. These areasare coupled with general engineering and business backgroundcourses. Information economics studies the formulation, structure, andoperational dynamics of information-centric systems in the contextof industrial organizations, service sector economics, and financialinstitutions. Quantitative systems analysis studies operations researchand computational tools for analyzing complex systems and theirinformation components. Information technology and applicationsstudies computer and communication technologies needed to designand implement information system applications. Topic areas include theapplications of information technology in manufacturing and businessenvironments, including electronic commerce, supply chain andenterprise information systems, manufacturing information systems, andfinancial enterprises.ISE CurriculumThe ISE curriculum is designed to provide graduates with the skillsand knowledge that employers expect of young industrial and systemsengineers beginning their professional careers, and to instill the abilityfor lifetime learning. It includes the basic mathematical, physical, andsocial sciences, together with the principles and methods of engineeringanalysis and design that are specific to industrial and systemsengineering. These principles and methods include probability andstatistics, engineering economy, cost accounting, operations research,computer simulation, work methods and measurement, manufacturingprocesses, production and inventory control, and information technology.In the junior year, an ISE student may elect to specialize more inproduction systems by choosing a course in modern manufacturingmethods. Alternatively, a student may elect to specialize more ininformation systems by choosing a course in computer algorithm design.An ISE student must choose at least one of these courses, but may electto choose both for a broader preparation for a career.Specialized ISE electives in the senior year include: advancedoptimization models, stochastic models, operations research, operationsmanagement, organization planning and control, statistical qualitycontrol, database design, web technologies, and data communicationstechnologies. Electives related to manufacturing systems engineeringinclude: industrial robotics, facilities planning and material handling,logistics and supply chain, and production engineering.Program Educational ObjectivesThe set of key, over-arching objectives of the Industrial and SystemsEngineering program are to prepare our students, within the first severalyears of the beginning of their careers, to1. meet the expectations of employers of industrial and systemsengineers,2. pursue advanced study, if desired,3. be active leaders in their profession and/or community.Specifically, these general objectives can be met by graduates that1. recognize and analyze problems, design innovative solutions, andlead their implementation,2. excel as industrial and systems engineering professionals who areable to operate effectively in a global, culturally diverse society,3. communicate effectively using written, oral, and electronic media,4. pursue life-long learning and professional growth as ethical andresponsible members of society,5. form, lead, and participate on multi-disciplinary teams that solveproblems in engineering and business.In each course in the Industrial & Systems Engineering program, asubset of the student outcomes, listed below, are pursued to preparestudents to achieve the Industrial and Systems Engineering program’sstated objectives.

Becauseof technological innovations and the long term demands of globalcompetition, the department seeks to prepare our students to adapt tothe rapid advances and changes in technology, and to serve as agentsand leaders in effecting these changes, while being cognizant of theneeds and concerns of the society at large.The graduate program bridges between the generalizedundergraduate studies and the more focused research and remarkableaccomplishments of our faculty. New graduate students participate inresearch by working closely with their faculty advisors; however, theyare quickly encouraged to work and think independently, assuminggreater responsibility for critical research functions. This learningprocess prepares the students for future research and developmentpositions in industry or academia, where they can contribute toward theimprovement and advancement of the community and society at large.Professors.

IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERINGMechanical engineering is one of the broadest of the engineeringprofessions, dealing generally with systems for energy conversion,material transport and the control of motions and forces.Mechanical engineers may choose from among many different activitiesin their careers, according to their interests and the changing needs ofsociety. Some concentrate on the conversion of thermal, nuclear, solar,chemical and electrical energy, or on the problems of air, water, andnoise pollution. Some concentrate on the design of mechanical systemsused in transportation, manufacturing or health care industries or byindividual consumers. Some will be working, a decade from now, infields that do not yet exist. Most will be engaged with concepts involvingall four dimensions of space and time.STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND GRADUATION DATAThe Mechanical Engineering undergraduate program is  accreditedby the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (http://www.abet.org) and is the largest undergraduate program withinLehigh's P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. Ourenrollment and graduation figures can be found in this table (http://www.lehigh.edu/engineering/academics/accredited/#mechanical).PROGRAM OBJECTIVESIn harmony with the mission stated previously, the departmenthas adopted three Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) for theundergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering.Program graduates are expected, three to five years from graduation, to:1. Successfully practice mechanical engineering and/or pursueadvanced education, possibly towards other professions such as law,medicine, business, etc.2. Participate at varying degrees in research and development, andother creative efforts in science, engineering, technology and/ortechnological entrepreneurship.3. Engage in activities that demonstrate a commitment toprofessionalism and personal development and demonstrate leadershipqualities.By "successfully practice mechanical engineering” we mean:•      Advancement in careers in Mechanical, other Engineering, orcareers such as health care, consulting, entrepreneurship, finance,management etc. assuming the utilization of basic engineering andscience/mathematics principles and/or methodology taught in an MEprogram.424         Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics•      Assuming increased levels of responsibility is a clear indicator ofsuccess.•      Effective communication with peers and working/leading diversemulti-disciplinary teams.•      Recognizing the global, societal and ethical contexts of their work.In order to achieve these objectives the ME program ensures that itsgraduates are capable of the Student Outcomes (1-7) proposed by theaccreditation organization ABET and adopted verbatim by the LehighUniversity ME program. These outcomes are:1)      An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineeringproblems by applying principles of engineering, science, andmathematics.2)      An ability to apply the engineering design process to producesolutions that meet specified needs with consideration for public healthand safety, and global, cultural, social, environmental, economic, andother factors as appropriate to the discipline.3)      An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation,analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to drawconclusions.4)      An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.5)      An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilitiesin engineering situations and make informed judgments, which mustconsider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic,environmental, and societal contexts.6)      An ability to recognize the ongoing need to acquire newknowledge, to choose appropriate learning strategies, and to apply thisknowledge.7)      An ability to function effectively as a member or leader of a teamthat establishes goals, plans, tasks, meets deadlines, and creates acollaborative and inclusive environmentAchievement of the aforementioned educational objectives is served firstthrough a sound education in mathematics, physics, and engineeringsciences; second, by exposure to the engineering process (creation,innovation, analysis, and judgment) through design courses, projects,laboratories, and a choice of technical electives that permits a degreeof specialization; and third, by the development of cultural awarenessthrough courses in humanities and social sciences. Students may alsotake elective courses that transcend traditional disciplinary lines, whilestill satisfying the requirements for mechanical engineering.The curriculum leading toward the bachelor of science in mechanicalengineering combines a broad base in mathematics, physical sciences,and the engineering sciences (mechanics of solids, materials, dynamicsand fluid, thermal and electrical sciences), including laboratory. Specialemphasis is placed on the practice of modern Integrated ProductDevelopment, combining state-of-the-art computer aided design andmanufacturing methods in a business oriented framework. Severalspecific application fields are chosen toward the end of the programin the form of four or more courses elected from a wide variety of 300-level offerings. Courses in mechanical engineering and engineeringmechanics are equally available.The course requirements for a B.S. degree in mechanical engineeringare listed below. In addition to required mathematics, physics, chemistryand basic engineering courses, the program includes a minimum ofseven courses in humanities and social sciences (see humanities/socialsciences), two free electives and five approved electives.

MECH 499," Dissertation 1-15 CreditsInterdisciplinary and Inter-College Undergraduate StudyThe university’s interdisciplinary programs are designed to crossthe boundaries between colleges to accommodate new anddeveloping fields as well as the interests of students. Some of Lehigh'sinterdisciplinary programs draw on disciplines within a single college;these are housed within that college. Other interdisciplinary programsdraw on faculty and curricula in two or more colleges; these areconsidered inter-college (IC) programs, and these programs are nothoused within a specific college. Prospective undergraduate studentsinterested in these programs apply not to one of Lehigh's colleges butinstead apply to the IC program.Computer Science and Business ProgramThe College of Business and Economics and the Computer Science andEngineering department in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering andApplied Science jointly offer the Computer Science and Business (CSB)program. The mission of the program is to provide rigorous computerscience education integrated with in-depth business training thatprepares high quality undergraduate students with diverse backgroundsfor lifelong learning and to assume positions of leadership in thebusiness community. This carefully crafted 136 credit hour degreeintegrates technology skills in software development with a solidbackground in business and economics. Deep immersion in bothof these areas distinguishes CSB from programs offered by otheruniversities. At the same time it is well balanced with approximately onethird of the courses in liberal arts, one-third in computer science, andone-third in business.After four years the program leads to a degree in Computer Scienceand in Business, which is jointly awarded by the College of Businessand Economics and the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering andApplied Science. Graduates of the program will be ideal candidates forplacement within public accounting firms, consulting companies, andstartup companies. This program provides students with the backgroundneeded to become the CIO’s, decision makers, and general managers ofinformation age corporations.While honors-like in quality and rigor, the CSB program is open toany student wishing to accept the challenges it offers. Students maymatriculate at Lehigh specifically into CSB or enter the program at alater point. Transferring into CSB after freshman year, however, mayrequire students to take additional credits to graduate. The CSB programis accredited in Business (AACSB International) and is accredited by theComputing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.The co-directors of the CSB program are James A. Hall, PeterE. Bennett Chair in Business and Economics (jah0@lehigh.edu)and Henry Korth, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering( hfk2@lehigh.edu).For additional information visit the CSB web site at: www.cse.lehigh.edu/csbMISSION FOR PROGRAMThe Computer Science and Business program's mission is to provide itsstudents with a strong education in mathematics, science, business, andcomputer science fundamentals and to prepare them to be able to adaptto future changes in the practice of Computer Science.PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVESGraduates of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science andBusiness Program will:•Apply their education in computer science to the analysis andsolution of business and industrial problems.•Account for ethical and social issues when solving business andindustrial problems.•Function effectively in a collaborative team and effectivelycommunicate with members of the team.•Engage in continued education in their field of expertise.•Attain positions of expertise in their chosen field.•Apply their training to problems where information technologies andbusiness processes converge.DEGREE REQUIREMENTSThe required courses for the CSB degree constitute the fundamentalsof structured programming, discrete mathematics, algorithms, computerarchitecture, programming languages, software engineering, accounting,finance, marketing, management, and economics. None of the programrequirements for the CSB major may be taken pass/fail.436         Computer Science and Business ProgramThe requirements are stated below.

How will individuals from differentnational, religious, and cultural traditions understand their personalresponsibilities in a world increasingly strained by resurging nationalismand the pressures of globalization?The Global Citizenship Program prepares students for engaged livingin a culturally diverse and rapidly changing world. Emphasizing criticalanalysis and value reflection, the program structures educationalexperiences through which students learn to negotiate internationalboundaries and develop their own sense of personal, social, andcorporate responsibility to the global community. The program isdesigned to be flexible so that undergraduate students in any collegemay participate. Students bring perspectives of their own disciplines tothe fore as the group explores questions of what it means to be a globalcitizen as an engineer, or a businessperson, or an artist or a social ornatural scientist.

Rossin College ofEngineering and Applied ScienceIDEAS is a four-year honors program resulting in an integrated Bachelorof Science (BS) Degree—jointly administered by the College of Artsand Sciences and the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and AppliedScience.Interdisciplinary education in the arts and sciences and engineering isof significant value to students who will pursue a wide variety of careers.The complex challenges and problems confronting us in the 21st centurydramatically underscore the importance of liberally educated andtechnologically sophisticated individuals whose habits of thought arethoroughly and comfortably interdisciplinary. Moreover, Lehigh is one ofa small number of universities with the resources necessary to providesuch an education. The students in this program will benefit from theintegrated strategic leveraging of strengths across college boundaries.This program cultivates a new breed of cross-disciplinary innovators.It provides an education that produces students well versed in dualfocus areas, one in engineering and one in the arts, humanities,social sciences, mathematics or natural sciences. This educationalenvironment also cultivates a multitude of thinking styles. It isrenaissance thinking for the technological era.Entry Requirements1.Admitted students who have expressed an interest when applyingwill be considered for the IDEAS program. Only a limited number ofstudents will be accepted. Students are invited to join this honorsprogram by invitation.2.To remain in the IDEAS program students must maintain a 3.25GPA. At the end of the first year, a student with a GPA below 3.25is given two semesters to achieve a GPA of 3.25; otherwise thestudent will be asked to transfer to a regular degree program.3.Students may transfer into the IDEAS program at the end oftheir first semester or year if space becomes available. A formalapplication to the program must be filed and approval from the co-directors must be obtained.4.Students who are interested in the IDEAS program should indicatethat interest when applying.The IDEAS program is designed so that students who transfer out of theprogram at the completion of the first year will still be able to completean arts and sciences or engineering degree in four years. The four-yearIDEAS program does not lead to an ABET accreted engineering degree.It is possible for students to complete a BS degree in IDEAS and anABET accredited BS engineering degree (dual degrees) in one or twoadditional semesters.PROGRAM COMPONENTSThe IDEAS degree requires a minimum of 136 credits in the programcomponents shown below:IDEAS core 1"

This is one of the oldest ROTC programs in the nation. TheArmy ROTC program provides a means for students to qualify for acommission as an officer in the Active Army, Army Reserve, or ArmyNational Guard.OVERVIEWThe objectives of the military science program are to developleadership and management ability in each student; to provide abasic understanding of the Army’s history, philosophy, organization,responsibilities, and role in American society; and to developfundamental professional knowledge and skills associated withofficership. These objectives are achieved through classroominstruction, leadership laboratories, realistic training scenarios, exposureto Army doctrine, professional development, leadership simulations, andindividual assessment and counseling. Army ROTC offers a four-yearprogram and a two-year program. The four-year program consists of atwo-year basic course and a two-year advanced course. The two-yearprogram consists of the two-year advanced course offered to studentswith previous military experience, and those who have successfullycompleted the four-week ROTC  Cadet Initial Entry Training.  Basiccourse students incur no obligation for service in the Army as a result oftaking these courses.Basic CourseThe basic course, normally taken in the freshman and sophomoreyears, provides training and instruction in leadership, public speaking,and basic military subjects, such as the Army’s role and organizationalstructure, history and philosophy of the Army, basic tactics, landnavigation, first aid, group dynamics, and leadership traits andcharacteristics. Basic course students incur no military obligation and isonly available to freshman and sophomore students.Advanced CourseThe advanced course is normally taken in the junior and senioryears. The instruction includes management, military skills, advancedleadership and tactics, logistics, administration, military law, ethics,and professionalism, and includes attendance at the ROTC CadetLeadership Course (CLC). Students receive subsistence pay during theirjunior and senior years.To enroll in the advanced course, an applicant must complete eitherthe basic course or the four-week Cadet Initial Entry Training (CIET); orhave received basic course credit for previous military experience.Note: The Advanced course (300 and 400 level) is a requirementfor Scholarship and contracted cadets only and is not offered toparticipating students.Uniforms and EquipmentUniforms are provided to contracted and scholarship cadets only. In theevent of lost equipment or uniforms, students will be charged for thoseitems not returned upon leaving the program.TransfersQualified students transferring from another institution may enter theROTC program at the appropriate level and year, provided they havereceived the necessary credits, the recommendation of their formerprofessor of military science (if applicable), and the approval of CadetCommand and the university. Please contact the ROTC office for details.Obligation after GraduationUpon graduation, a student will receive a commission as a SecondLieutenant in either the Active Army, Army Reserves, or National Guard.If offered active duty, scholarship students serve at least four years ofactive duty and four years of inactive ready reserve. If offered reserveduty, students normally serve eight years in a Reserve or NationalGuard unit.Graduate StudiesROTC graduates may request to delay their active service to pursuea full-time course of instruction leading to an advanced degree. Theonly four major areas of concentration are medical school, law school,444         Military Scienceveterinary school and seminary. Delay does not lengthen the activeservice obligation unless the degree is obtained at government expense.Course CreditStudents in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College ofBusiness and Economics may substitute military science advancedcredits for six hours of electives. In the College of Engineering andApplied Science, six credits of advanced ROTC work are permissiblewithin the normal program of each student, irrespective of curriculum.For curricula that include more than six hours of personal electives in thejunior and senior years, inclusion of the more than six hours of ROTCcredit with normal programs can be effected only with the approval ofacademic advisers. All military science credits, including those in thebasic course, apply toward the student’s overall cumulative grade pointaverage.CAREER OPPORTUNITIESIndividuals are commissioned as officers in the United StatesArmy after completion of the ROTC program including the CadetLeadership Course (CLC), and the completion of their bachelorsdegree requirements. They then qualify in one of seventeen branches(specialties) such as the Corps of Engineers, Infantry, Armor, Aviation,Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, Signal Corps, Cyber Corps, MilitaryIntelligence, Chemical Corps, Ordnance Corps, Finance, Transportation,Military Police, Adjutant General, Quartermaster, Medical ServiceCorps, or Nursing.

TE 402P,"hotonicsPHOTONICSThe Master of Science Degree in Photonics is an interdisciplinaryprogram designed to provide students with a broad training in thevarious aspects of photonics, including topics in electrical engineering,materials science, and physics. Admission to the program requires aB.S. or M.S. in either the engineering or physical sciences.Applications should be directed to one of the three sponsoringdepartments (Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Scienceand Engineering, or Physics). Procedures and admission criteria are thesame as those followed by the home department. International studentsmust satisfy minimum university language requirements. The admissionsprocess is under the supervision of the individual department to whichyou apply.Lehigh University 2018-2019       453Polymer Science and EngineeringLehigh has a diverse group of faculty members with strong, primaryinterest in polymer science and engineering. In order to provide betteropportunities for courses and research in this interdisciplinary field,activities are coordinated through the Center for Polymer Science andEngineering (CPSE), and its academic Polymer Education Committee.Polymer faculty from traditional departments of chemical engineering,chemistry, materials science and engineering, physics, and mechanicalengineering and mechanics, are participants of the CPSE.There are two ways in which qualified graduate students, with degreesin the above or related fields, may participate. Students may pursuegraduate studies within an appropriate department. Departmentalprocedures must be followed for the degree sought. The student’sadviser must be in that department and the student receives a normaldepartmental degree, with emphasis in polymer courses and research.Such students are encouraged to pursue a graduate certificate inpolymer science and engineering.Alternatively, students may elect to pursue studies toward aninterdisciplinary M.S., M.E., or Ph.D. degree in polymer science andengineering. The procedures for this latter case are summarized asfollows.Students are admitted through one of the participating departments andmust meet that department's admissions criteria. When the student isready (must have taken/be taking at least one polymer course and be ingood standing in the department), the student petitions to transfer to thePolymer Science and Engineering graduate program. After the petitionis approved, his/her degree program becomes Polymer Science andEngineering, but the student remains in the home department.Master of Science Degree in Polymer Science and EngineeringMaster of Science Degree in Polymer Science and Engineering requiresa total of 24 credits in course work and six credits in research. Themasters thesis is directed and signed by a faculty member of the Centerfor Polymer Science and Engineering and co-signed by the chairman ofthe Polymer Education Committee or the director of the CPSE.Master of Engineering Degree in Polymer Science and EngineeringMaster of Engineering Degree in Polymer Science and Engineeringrequires a total of 30 credits of course work. This option is intended forthose students who do not work in a laboratory setting, or for whomthesis research is not practical, but who wish to obtain an advancededucation in polymer science and engineering.Ph.D. in Polymer Science and EngineeringFor the Ph.D., the student must satisfactorily complete a qualifyingexamination administered by the Polymer Education Committee;satisfactorily complete graduate course work determined in consultationwith the doctoral committee; pass a general examination administeredby the Polymer Education Committee; and defend to the satisfaction ofthe doctoral committee, a dissertation in the field of polymer science andengineering. Students deficient in polymer science or related topics maybe required by their committee to take remedial course work.The doctoral committee consists of the research adviser, at least twoother members of the center for polymer science and engineering, andat least one outside person. The committee’s composition is subject toapproval by the Polymer Education Committee and the Graduate andResearch Committee of the university.For more information, write to Dr. Raymond A.
