This includes synchronous and asynchronous modes of education. Definitions By the words, “create opportunities,” the University offers the means for persons to have choices and options opened before them and to develop the confidence and maturity to choose appropriately. By the term, “learning community,” the University extends its mission to all persons who seek development of the whole person and who would choose to pursue the aspiration through Bethel University. The learning community of Bethel University includes undergraduate students in traditional and non-tra-ditional programs, graduate students, faculty, staff, the local community, and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Intellectual development focuses on the cognitive aspect of the human; cognitive development incorporates analysis, critical reflection, and synthesis of knowledge of multiple disciplines. To achieve this outcome, the university will leverage developing technology to efficiently create learning experiences for the community. Social development focuses on the affective and behavioral aspects of the human; social development incorporates the ability to interact and communicate with other humans with civility and tolerance. Spiritual development focuses on the metaphysical aspect of the human; spiritual development incorporates the ideas of faith, morality, and practice. 8 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesBy the term, “Christian environment,” the University draws upon the thought of St. Ignatius that the college environment should facilitate knowledge and contemplation such that actions are based on unbiased reason and reason-able faith. Synchronous modes of education means Bethel University offers courses to students in the face-to-face classroom setting, whereas asynchronous means Bethel University offers courses to students in the online classroom platform. By utilizing both the synchronous and asynchronous learning platforms, Bethel University seeks to provide additional educational opportunities to students in the 21st century.Core Values Bethel University creates a learning community which: • Accepts individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs • Offers opportunities for individuals to contribute to the University and to other communities in a variety of ways • Emphasizes human dignity and ethics consistent with the Christian tradition • Encourages inquiry and the examination of values, self, and society • Prepares individuals for the life-long pursuit of knowledge in a complex and constantly changing world History of the Institution Since its founding in McLemoresville, Tenn., in 1842, Bethel University has grown and changed in ways its founders could have never imagined. Chartered by the State of Tennessee in 1847, Bethel began as a seminary for the Cumberland Presbyterian Church with the purpose of training young male pastors for the growing denomination. It was not until the college moved to McKenzie in 1872 that it first began to admit women as students. The oldest existing building on Bethel’s campus is Campbell Hall, built in 1923. It was given to the college, along with 11 acres of land, by the city of McKenzie. At that time it offered every facility the college needed in a single building including classrooms, offices, laboratories, a prayer room and an auditorium. It was named for Richard and Alice Campbell in 1983, and it now Overview | 9 contains offices and the Lavinia Cole Chapel. Additionally, it boasts the Hall of Presidents, which displays a picture of every president of the college since its inception in 1842. The Log Cabin was constructed outside Campbell Hall by the freshman class in 1925. The purpose of the building was to show the humble beginnings of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and to remind each student, staff and faculty member that the school was built “On the Faith of Our Fathers.” When building the cabin each log cost $35, and whoever donated the money to buy a log would have his or her name engraved on the metal plate on that log. Today, the Log Cabin is used for offices. Bethel’s Theological Department, which had become the Cumberland Pres-byterian Theological Seminary, moved to Memphis and changed its name to Memphis Theological Seminary in 1964. In 2009, Bethel College was renamed Bethel University. Affiliation Bethel University is joined in a covenant relationship with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Bethel is proud of its heritage as a Cumberland Pres-byterian university and of the service it provides to the church in the form of education for current and future leaders. Accreditation Bethel University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, and masters degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 3033-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Bethel University.Bethel University is chartered by the State of Tennessee. Bethel University is approved by the Tennessee Board of Education as a teacher preparation institution for the State of Tennessee. Bethel University’s Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is approved by the Tennessee Board of Nursing. The Baccalaureate degree in Nursing at Bethel University is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), One Dupont Circle, NW, Suite 350, Washington, 1 from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm. Bethel University accepts up to 60 hours of CLEP, DSST, and military. However, a stu-dent may earn no more than 30 hours of ACE credit, which includes CLEP and DSST credit. Grades and quality points are not given for advanced standing credit.  As a result, a passing examination score will not act as a repeat of a previous grade in any class.  It is also important to note that students will not be allowed to duplicate credit in any of the sections or transfer credit.  InternshipsThe Bethel off-campus internship program is designed to help all students bridge the gap between the classroom and the world of experience. Intern-ships open students to possibilities for career development and personal growth and challenge them to creative participation in their own learning. Students may select two internships, but the maximum credit toward gradu-ation is 12 semester hours (excluding state requirements for teacher educa-tion). Internship work is calculated at a rate of 45 clock hours of internship work per semester-hour of credit. Internship applications and guidelines are available in the Office of the Registrar. Students intending to participate in the internship program should register for internship credit in the appropriate department prior to beginning the internship. If a student undertakes an internship without prior registration, a maximum of three hours of individual study credit may be granted if the academic advisor and individual study advisor agree that the experience met the requirements for an internship and includes an additional paper or project. In no case will individual study credit or internship credit be granted for a non-classroom based participatory learning experience begun more than six months prior to application for credit. Individual studies credit may not be used to substitute for an internship in those majors where an intern-ship is required.44 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesDirected and Individual StudyUnder extenuating circumstances, some Bethel courses can be completed outside the traditional classroom setting through a Directed Study arrange-ment between the faculty member and the student provided that the student has never received a grade of F or FA  in the course and that the student is in good academic standing.  Individual Study is available in most subject areas and is an opportunity to pursue in depth subjects of interest beyond available courses for academic credit.  Students are required to be enrolled at Bethel University, register for the Directed Study or Individual Study course(s), complete the required forms with appropriate signatures (including the Aca-demic Dean), secure the required textbooks and materials, schedule meetings with the faculty instructor, complete all assignments on time, take the required quizzes/exams, and complete the faculty evaluation form for each course.  Faculty instructors will require regular meetings with the student, give the student regular feedback regarding assignments and quizzes/exams, and assign a final grade appropriate to the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the course.  Note:  Credit will be awarded according to Bethel University’s credit hour policy.Auditing ClassesAny class may be audited with the approval of the faculty member teaching the course. No transcript record is maintained for audited courses. Audited classes must be registered with the Registrar. (See “Special Fees for the Academic Year” in the Financial Information section.)Developmental EducationOn the basis of the results of ACT tests and other information, such as tran-scripts, some students will be placed in developmental courses to remedy deficiencies which would otherwise prevent success in the university curric-ulum. Students failing to obtain a grade of C or better in any developmental course after three attempts will receive an automatic suspension. Credit in developmental courses will not be counted toward graduation requirements.Academic Policies | 45 Division of EducationThe Division of Education offers undergraduate majors in Child Learning and Development (K-5), Exceptional Learning and Development Interventionist (K-8 and 6-12), and Secondary Education with minor fields in Professional Edu-cation (Licensure) and Learning Theory and Communication (Non-Licensure).Requirements for Admission to Teacher Education ProgramEach applicant applying for admission to an initial undergraduate program completes a Teacher Education Program (TEP) Application during the semester prior to beginning the junior year of coursework.

For more details about the unique offerings, campus rules, and regulations at Bethel University, please see the college’s student handbook, The Log.Student OrganizationsStudent GovernmentEach year, the student body elects representatives to serve as part of the Student Government Association. This group gives voice to student concerns on various faculty and staff committees.Honors SocietiesGamma Beta Phi, a national honor society, recognizes superior scholastic achievement and is composed of membership by invitation only to the top 20% of each class. The group participates in service projects and attends national conventions each year.Greek OrganizationsBethel University offers multiple Greek sororities and fraternities. These groups participate in various community service projects and campus events throughout the year.Academic/Social OrganizationsBethel University’s many organizations that blend academic knowledge and social activities, such as the Student Members of the American Chemical Society, Beta Sigma Phi, Criminal Justice Honors Society, and Student Tennes-see Education Association (STEA).  In addition, there are several service and special interest groups available such as Circle K, Rotaract, and the Reading Club.Student Activities at BethelEach semester, multiple student activities are scheduled by the Office of Student Life. In the past these activities have included: exercise night, old time photos, craft night, karaoke night, movie night, Xbox night, game shows, General Admissions | 15 dances, laser tag, spades tournaments, caricature portraits, Sundae Monday study breaks, and self defense seminars. Students are invited to become a part of the Student Activities Board to help plan these and other activities each month.Athletic ActivitiesIntercollegiate AthleticsIntercollegiate Athletics have become an important and exciting aspect of life for the many students, alumni, and community friends of the University who support Bethel’s teams. As members of the National Association of Intercolle-giate Athletics (NAIA), the Wildcats and the Lady Wildcats regularly compete against many top-rated teams. The men’s program has teams in basketball, baseball, bass fishing, bowling, cheer, cross-country, football, golf, in-line hockey, shooting, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track. The women’s program has teams in basketball, bass fishing, bowling, cheer, cross country, golf, softball, soccer, shooting, swimming, tennis, track, and volleyball.Intramural AthleticsIntramural sports offer a variety of competition for the enjoyment of Bethel students, faculty, and staff. The program promotes enthusiasm, leadership, and good sportsmanship. The use of student directors, captains, coaches, and game officials creates a uniquely student-oriented program. Regulations for participation may be found in The Log.Exercise and FitnessStudents are invited to exercise daily at the Wildcat Health and Fitness Com-plex, which features state-of-the-art cardio and strength training equipment, and at the Gaines Indoor Pool.Christian LifeWe strive to glorify and enjoy the Lord in every aspect of life.  The campus chaplains strive to lead the campus community in living out this belief in many ways.  This includes weekly chapel and communion services.  In the chapel services, ministers and speakers from different denominations are invited to preach.  Bethel University works cooperatively with many different Christian denominations to meet students’ needs.16 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesBethel works closely with the Cumberland Presbyterian denomination.  The University supports Christian musical and dramatic presentations that are performed in individual churches and encourages student involvement with specific churches.  We also provide facilities for continuing education oppor-tunities within the denomination. Other organizations represented on campus include:  Cumberland Presbyte-rian Ministry, Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM), Bethel Wesley Fellowship, Christian Medical and Dental Association Student Chapter (CMDA), and Fellowship Christian Athletes (FCA).  All students are welcomed and encour-aged to participate in these organizations.Campus SecuritySecurity is very important on the Bethel campus. The city of McKenzie has a very low incidence of crime. The rural setting lends itself to a secure environment that the community and students enjoy. A well-lit campus, 24-hour armed campus security, and good communications with local law enforcement officials create a comfortable and safe environment. Copies of the Bethel University annual security report are available in the Office of Student Development.  Campus security can also provide assistance with campus escorts, vehicle unlock, airing vehicle tires, battery jumps, and other calls for service.Campus RegulationsEach student at Bethel is provided with a handbook that identifies and explains all campus activities, facilities, student organizations, and policies. All Bethel students are expected to behave according to accepted norms that ensure a climate wherein all can exercise their right to learn. Such norms are set forth in the student handbook, The Log. All students should read and un-derstand the handbook. No faculty member will tolerate classroom behavior that violates these norms. Such behavior will be grounds for withdrawal from the class, judicial proceedings, or failure of the course. If warranted, students engaging in such behavior will be removed from class by security personnel and may be required to undergo counseling.Emergency Closures PolicyBethel University takes appropriate steps to maintain a safe and secure environment for its students, faculty and staff.  Infrequently, weather or other General Admissions | 17 emergency situations may require alterations in the normally scheduled operations of the institution.  This may include closure of the institution for brief periods of time including the cancellation of classes or closure of campus facilities.  In these events, all students, faculty, and staff are required to follow instructions from Bethel University’s Security Department or civil authorities.  This may include relocation or suspension of classes. Announcements of closure will be through the university’s web site(s) and through local media channels. If the university cancels classes (either in McKenzie or at a satellite campus), it is the responsibility of the instructor to determine whether alternative assignments, additional sessions, or make-up work are appropriate.  Course outcomes will not be altered because of a class cancellation.  Instructors will make themselves available through alternative means (phone, e-mail, video conferencing) to students to cover the course content.   18 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesCollege of Arts & SciencesGeneral Admission Requirements Note: Some academic programs may have additional admission requirements for the major that are not noted below.

No class can be dropped after the last day to drop a class as referenced above, and the student will receive a punitive grade of F (Failure) or FA (Failure due to Non Attendance) in any such course.  Transcript Request for Dual Enrollment StudentsDual enrollment students follow the same process for requesting tran-scripts as do traditional students.  Please see the section entitled Proce-dure to Request a Transcript in this catalog.  Transferring ClassesAlthough Bethel University representatives may assist in answering ques- tions about the transferability of classes taken, it is the responsibility of the student and/or parents/legal guardian to determine if any classes taken through Bethel University will transfer to the college or university the student wishes to attend in the future.26 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesReadmissionAny student who once attended Bethel University and did not return the following semester for whatever reason must file an Application for Read-mission with the Enrollment Services (no fee required).  The student must request that an official transcript be sent to Bethel University from any institution attended since leaving Bethel.  Any financial obligations at Bethel University must be cleared before re-enrollment.  Bethel University reserves the right to deny readmission to any student.If the student withdraws or leaves Bethel University before the required semester hours in the Laptop Agreement are completed, then the purchase price of the laptop computer (less any pro-rated amount as explained in the Agreement) will be charged to the student’s account.  If the student with-draws during the first week of his or her initial term of enrollment AND the student has received a computer, the student may petition the Director of IT for permission to return the laptop.  If the Director of IT grants permission to return the laptop to the IT Help Desk, the Laptop Agreement will be terminat-ed upon return of the laptop.If a student: • applies for readmission to Bethel University AND • returned his/her laptop to the I.T. Desk when he/she left AND • is a freshman, sophomore, or junior who can be continuously enrolled for 18 semester hoursthe student may receive a new laptop.  Only one laptop will be issued per student.  For example:  a student leaves Bethel as a freshman and keeps the laptop.  The student’s account is charged for the laptop according to the Laptop Agreement.  If the student then applies for readmission, the student will NOT receive another laptop.Transient Admission Admission as a transient student is granted on the basis of a statement of good standing from the university or college most recently attended or an official transcript indicating good standing. The student must also file an application for admission.General Admissions | 27 Transfer AdmissionTransfer students who have completed less than 12 semester hours at an accredited institution must submit high school transcripts or GED scores, and unless otherwise exempt, SAT or ACT scores. All students transferring to Bethel must submit the $30 application fee and official transcripts from any college/university previously attended.

Any education courses completed at Bethel University and which have been completed ten years or more prior to admission or readmission must be repeated for credit.  The repeated course grade must meet any grade point and/or grade point average requirement by the Department of Education for that course.Special Student StatusStudents who wish to enroll in less than a full time load of classes and are not college degree-seeking are placed in a special student status category until such time that they wish to apply to the University for full admission degree-seeking status.Student On-Campus HousingAll full-time undergraduate students attending Bethel University must reside in campus housing. Exceptions to this rule are granted to students who are married, have dependents, living with their parents, living within a  50 mile radius, or who have achieved senior standing. Students with health issues which prohibit them from living in a communal environment may live off campus with appropriate medical documentation and upon the  approval of the Director of Housing. During full occupancy, junior status students may also be given permission to live off campus. Changing one’s address on the FAFSA does not justify one for off-campus status.28 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesRequired Disclosure of Felony Conviction  and/or Status as a Registered Sex Offender While Bethel University maintains an “open door” admission policy, Bethel University is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for its students and staff.  As part of this commitment Bethel University requires all applicants who have been convicted of a felony and/or applicants who are registered sex offenders to disclose this information to Bethel University.  If an applicant has been convicted of a felony and/or is a registered sex offender, he or she is required to provide a letter of explanation with his or her application along with certified copies of documentation from the Court where he or she was convicted.  Further, the applicant must provide informa-tion regarding the conditions of parole, probation and/or supervised release if any exist.  This documentation must be provided to the University before any admission decision is made.  Applicants will not be denied admission solely on their disclosure of a conviction or status as a registered sex offend-er.  However, failure to disclose a conviction or status as a registered sex offender will result in denial of admission or revocation of admission.Once the applicant has provided the relevant information required regarding his or her conviction and or status as a registered sex offender, the admis-sions committee will review all of the pertinent information and make a decision on the suitability of an applicant’s enrollment and any conditions that may apply to that decision.Students already enrolled in the University who are subsequently convicted and or charged with a felony and or given status as a registered sex offender are required to notify the University immediately.Academic Policies | 29 College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Policies Academic IntegrityFalsification of records and official documents is prohibited by Bethel University. Students are expected to uphold the University’s values. Cheating of any kind, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty are prohibited.

Students found committing an act of academic dishonesty will receive the following punishments: • For a first offense, the student will receive a zero on the assignment. • A second offense results in a grade of “F” for that course. • A third offense results in expulsion from the University. Offenses are cumulative over the course of the student’s studies at Bethel. Faculty is required to present notice of each offense to the Academic Dean. The Dean adjudicates the offense and maintains an official student record for each offense. Students may appeal the decision of the Dean and finally to the Vice-President of the College. Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. (An “eligible student” under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution at any age.) These rights include:1. The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days after the day the Bethel University receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.30 | Bethel University College of Arts & Sciences2. The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in viola-tion of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA. A student who wishes to ask Bethel to amend a record should write to the Chief Academic and Compliance Officer, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.If Bethel decides not to amend the record as requested, Bethel will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment.Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provid-ed to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.3. The right to provide written consent before Bethel discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.Bethel discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is typically includes a person employed by the Bethel in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trust-ees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the Bethel who performs an institutional service of function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official typically has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the Bethel.Upon request, the school also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.Academic Policies | 31 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education con-cerning alleged failures by the Bethel to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

The summer term may be used by students on probation or suspension to raise the GPA to the level required for good standing.  Readmission to the University after a term of suspension is not automatic.  Upon receipt of a sus-pension notice, the student may send a letter of appeal to the Academic Dean.  The Academic Dean will notify the student when a decision has been made regarding enrollment in the following fall or spring semester.

Challenge credit may not be used as a repeat of a course taken earlier. Credit will be awarded on a “Pass” basis only. A “Pass” is considered a level of work earning a C grade or higher. A failure on an exam will be recorded as an F on the transcript for that course. A maximum of 12 semester hours in 100- and/or 200-level courses may be earned through Challenge Examinations. No upper division courses are available for Challenge Examinations. Completed applications for Challenge Examinations must be submitted to the CAS Registrar before credit will be recorded. (Challenge Examinations are not available for any courses in which CLEP or DSST examinations are offered. Students who fail a CLEP or DSST examination cannot take a Challenge Examination in that subject.)Students may qualify for advanced standing (maximum of 30 hours) by submitting acceptable scores as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) on the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the Dantes Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) academic subjects or by submit-ting acceptable scores (minimum of 3) on the College Board’s Advance Place-Academic Policies | 43 ment Program (AP). Note: No science lab credit is available through CLEP or DSST. ACE educational credit by examination, including credit transcripts by regionally accredited community colleges and ACE credit for training pro-grams are also included in this area.

Eligible students have a right to inspect and review the record of disclosures. A postsecondary institution may disclose PII from the education records without obtaining prior written consent of the student —• To other school officials, including teachers, within Bethel whom the school has determined to have legitimate educational interests. This includes contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other parties to whom the school has outsourced institutional services or functions, provided that the conditions listed in § 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)(1) - (a)(1)(i)(B)(3) are met. (§ 99.31(a)(1))• To authorized representatives of the U. S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or State and local educational authorities, such as a State postsecondary authority that is responsible for supervising the university’s State-supported education programs.

The disclosure may only include the final results of the disciplinary proceeding with respect to that alleged crime or offense, regardless of the finding. ( 99.31(a)(13))• To the general public, the final results of a disciplinary proceeding, sub-ject to the requirements of § 99.39, if the school determines the student is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense and the student has committed a violation of the school’s rules or policies with respect to the allegation made against him or her. (§ 99.31(a)(14))• To parents of a student regarding the student’s violation of any Federal, State, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the school, governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if the school deter-mines the student committed a disciplinary violation and the student is under the age of 21. (§99.31(a)(15))This act provides for confidentiality of student records; however, it also provides for basic identification of people at Bethel without the consent of the individual. Release of information to third parties includes name, address, telephone number, place of birth, E-mail address, classification, photograph, major/minor, dates of attendance, degree, university honors/awards, the most recent previous educational agency or institution attend-Academic Policies | 33 ed, participation in school activities and sports and weight and height of members of athletic teams. The institution may release other information on students without written permission of the students if the release can be justified under one of the exceptions to written permission found in FERPA. The student has the right of access to his or her educational records and the right to challenge any inaccurate, misleading, or inappropriate information in those records. Bethel University will release information to comply with the Solomon Amendment.Statement of Non-DiscriminationBethel does not discriminate, either in the admission of students or in the administration of any of its educational policies, programs, activities or employment on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, or military service. Bethel University com-plies with the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, the IRS Anti-Bias Regulation, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Ms. Rachael Brooks, Vera Low Building, Bethel University, 325 Cherry Avenue, McKenzie, TN  38201 (731-352-4246) is the Title IX and Preventive Services Director.Attendance PolicyBethel University considers regular class attendance to be essential to the teaching and learning process. Any unnecessary absence decreases the con-tribution by and to the students and faculty. For those reasons, the following guidelines will be honored by faculty and students:1. All faculty will report in writing to the Office of the Registrar all students whose total absences exceed the limit published in the class syllabus. The Registrar will record an automatic grade of F. This report is due when the limit has been exceeded. If any time after the fifth week of classes a student obtains automatic F’s in all classes due to non-attendance, that student will be asked to leave the Bethel University campus within 48 hours after notification. There is no tuition refund after the fifth week of classes, but meal charges will be pro-rated according to the length of time (in weeks) that the student has had meals in the cafeteria, except in the case of withdrawal due to disciplinary action. Note: A separate pro-rated refund applies to the student who is asked to leave during the first term of enrollment.34 | Bethel University College of Arts & Sciences2. The responsibility for notifying the instructor of anticipated absences and reasons for emergency absences, and for fulfilling all assignments, rests entirely on the student. The final determination of true emergency will be at the discretion of the instructor of the course.3. Class absences due to mandatory participation in or mandatory atten-dance at events that are sanctioned by the University/College will not re-sult in penalty to the student through attendance, testing and/or grading. Absences beyond mandatory participation in University functions may result in an adjustment of grade or an automatic failure according to the course syllabus. Guidelines for submitting missed assignments or taking make-up exams are determined by each individual faculty member as published in the course syllabus.4. A student cannot request to withdraw from any class in which a grade of F has been received for violation of the attendance policy as published in the course syllabus.Grades (see also “Attendance Policy,”  and “Academic Integrity”)Grading SystemThe level of academic performance of each student is described in terms of the grade point average (GPA). The grade point average is determined by di-viding the total grade points earned by the total hours attempted. The letter grades awarded, the interpretation of their meaning, and the grade points for each hour of credit are as follows:• A: Excellent, 4 points• B: Very Good, 3 points• C: Good, 2 points• D: Passing, 1 point• F: Failure, 0 points• I: Assigned Work Incomplete, 0 points• P: Pass, 0 points• W: Withdrew, 0 points• FA: Failure due to violation of class attendance policy, 0 pointsAcademic Policies | 35 In extenuating circumstances, students must arrange with a professor to receive an I (Incomplete) grade.  The student must be passing the course to request the I grade, and the professor of the course will make the determi-nation of whether or not the circumstance warrants an Incomplete.  I grades must be removed within the first four weeks of the beginning of the next term (including summer).  Failure to remove the I grade will result in an automatic grade of F for the course.Pass/Fail grades are given for all internship and activity courses. Juniors and seniors may take one elective course per semester on a Pass/Fail basis with advisor approval. The decision to take the elective on the Pass/Fail basis must be made at the time of registration. All course requirements must be completed in order to qualify for the P grade. No grade points are given with the P grade; the hours attempted are computed for the grade of F.Receipt of GradesGrades are not mailed each semester.  Students may view or print a student copy of their grades through the student E-Portal or submit a written request for their grades to the Office of the Registrar.  If a student has an account balance, he or she will be unable to access his or her grades.  In this case, the student will need to contact the Bethel University Business Office to clear the account before the grades will be made accessible. Repeating CoursesOnly courses in which a student earns a grade of D or F may be repeated for purposes of replacing the lower grade. The last grade earned will be used to compute grade point average. Any course in which a grade of D and/or F is earned three times at Bethel University may not be repeated at Bethel.AppealsAny student who wishes to appeal a course grade must follow the process of appeal to the faculty member, Program Director , Division Chair, Associate Academic Dean (where applicable). All appeals must be in writing and given to the appropriate person no later than five days after the decision being appealed is made. The appeal must state on what grounds the appeal is being made and why the student believes an appeal is warranted. Between the time the decision being appealed is made and the time of the appeal hearing the decision being appealed stands and must be obeyed by the student.36 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesAcademic Probation and SuspensionStudents are placed on academic probation at the end of the semester in which the cumulative GPA falls below the required minimum for their class standing:• Freshman (0-27 hours completed): 1.5 GPA• Sophomore (28-59 hours completed): 1.8 GPA• Junior (60-95 hours completed): 2.0 GPA• Senior (96 or more hours completed): 2.0 GPAThe period of academic probation will continue as long as the GPA fails to meet the minimum GPA requirement.

To the extent that a discrepancy exists between this policy and State policy, State policy shall take precedence. VII. Electronic Signatures This policy identifies Bethel University (hereafter “the University”) re-quirements for the use of electronic signatures (hereafter “e-signatures”) , electronic transactions (hereafter “e-transactions”), in conducting the uni-versity’s business operations in support of the institutional administration of the university’s teaching and service operations (“University transactions”). Under this policy, the University may require that members of the University community use e-signatures to conduct certain university transactions that previously required handwritten signatures and approvals on paper docu-ments. This includes all documents pertaining to application, payment, or any other contractual obligation between the student and the University. By enrolling at the University, members of the University community agree that e-signatures are valid and binding. Changing Class SchedulesDropping or Adding a ClassClass schedules are changed by officially adding or dropping a class. Merely attending a class does not constitute official registration. Merely failing to attend a class does not constitute an official dropping of a class. Classes may be added to a schedule only during the first week of a term. Classes may be dropped during the first 11 weeks of a term. Any class schedule change may have consequences for financial aid. Check first with the Office of Financial Aid before changing class schedules.In order to drop or add a course, students must first secure a Drop/Add Form from the Registrar’s Office in Campbell Hall. Students must complete the form and secure the signature of their faculty advisor, and then must deliver the completed form to the Registrar’s Office. The date of the drop or add is determined when the form is received by the Registrar. A delay at this point can have expensive and severe academic consequences. A $25 fee is charged Academic Policies | 55 for each Drop/Add Form processed. Students dropping or adding courses should check with the Office of Financial Aid prior to submitting the Drop/Add form. Each student must carry 12 credit hours to maintain a full time course load and remain qualified for financial aid.Grades for Dropped CoursesIf a student drops a class in the first week of the term, no grade will be recorded for the class. If the student drops a class in the second through the eleventh week of the term, a grade of W will be recorded. After the eleventh week of the term, no class can be dropped unless the student can prove that one of the following conditions exists: serious illness or injury of the student as documented by a physician, serious family problems as documented by a physician or minister, or change in work schedule as documented by the employer. All documentations must be submitted to the Registrar. Non-at-tendance of classes will result in F grades. Note: No student can withdraw from any class in which a grade of F has been received for violation of the attendance policy.Withdrawal ProcedureSome personal or family emergencies require a student to withdraw from school. Permission to withdraw is not automatic and may be denied or discouraged. Students who transfer, withdraw, or do not return within a semester must complete the following formal withdrawal process to avoid unwarranted failing grades and unwanted financial obligation:• Discuss the situation with a faculty advisor.• Secure a withdrawal form from the Registrar’s Office and fill in all appropriate spaces.• Secure all required signatures.• Deliver the completed form to the Registrar’s Office. Failure to complete this step may result in failing grades and heavy financial obligations.• There is a $25 fee for withdrawal.Voluntary withdrawal does not guarantee permission to be readmitted to the University.56 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesGrades for WithdrawalIf a student withdraws from classes during the first week of the term, no grades will be recorded. If the student withdraws from classes in the second through eleventh week of the term, a grade of W will be recorded. Note: No student can withdraw from any class in which a grade of F has been received for violation of the attendance policy.Administrative Withdrawal PolicyFaculty will report in writing to the Registrar any student on the class roster who has not attended class for a period of two weeks (consecutive class days) during a traditional semester without notifying the faculty member. This student may be administratively withdrawn from the class. Any student who is administratively withdrawn from all classes will not be allowed to stay on campus. Administrative withdrawal from a class may affect the student’s financial aid, full-time or part-time status, and participation in sports or other extracurricular activities and does not guarantee permission to be readmitted to the University.TranscriptsTranscript Policies A transcript will not be issued unless the student’s financial account is clear with all offices of the University. Transcripts will be released at the written request of the student and in conformity with existing state and federal statutes pertaining to the release of student academic records. The official academic record is the property of the University. Therefore, the University reserves the right to withhold the release of a transcript of that record if the student has an obligation to the University. Bethel will accept a faxed request as a written request. Procedure to Request a Transcript Students who need transcripts of their college record must file an online request (including signature) with the Registrar.

Acceptable financial aid plans are: Federal Pell Grant; Tennessee State Assistance Corporation Grant; Hope Lottery Scholarship; Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan; Unsub-sidized Federal Stafford Loan; Federal Parent Plus Loan Program; Bethel University Scholarships; external scholarships; Work-Study.Since students must reapply for funding each academic year or term, reappli-cation must be fully completed on or before the appropriate due date. In the event a student fails to timely reapply, qualification for tuition deferment will be terminated and the student will be required to comply with the terms and conditions of the cash plan. The following documentation is required to be filed by the due date for the Federal/State Loans or Grants:• Accepted Admission Decision• Student Financial Agreement Form• Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)• Direct Loan Master Promissory Note (MPN)• Direct Loan Entrance Counseling• Verification documents (if required)• Financial ContractStudent AccountsStudent are required to pay all tuition and fees at the beginning of each term, and registration is not complete until all fees are paid. Students may not re-en-roll for another term, graduate, or receive a transcript until all amounts owed to the University  have been paid. If external collection efforts are utilized, the student is resposible for all collection costs, attourney fees, and any other charges necessary for the collection of any amount not paid when due. Financial Information | 59 Payment PolicyIn order to provide sound fiscal policy and stewardship for Bethel University the administration and staff are charged with the duty of ensuring that all student accounts are fully and timely collected. It is the responsibility of each student to have suitable financial arrangements in place well before enroll-ment to fully pay all sums owed Bethel. Likewise, it is the responsibility of the administration and staff to communicate the school’s requirements, provide assistance to prospective students in procuring financing, and faithfully enforce the school’s policies and procedures. Accordingly, the following procedures and guidelines will be followed in arranging for the payment and collection of student accounts: • Cash Plan • Federal/State Loans or Grants • Tuition Reimbursement Plan • Tuition Management Systems• Third Party Billing Plan • Private Loans Cash Plan The cash plan requires 100% of tuition and fees paid by the due date. (The due date for all options is defined hereafter.) Under this plan, students may pay by check or automatically charge the tuition and fees to their credit card. Automatic payments will be charged on the due date for each successive term. The following documentation is required for the cash plan: • Student Financial Agreement Form • Student Credit Card Authorization to Charge Form • Completed Admissions Application Federal/State Loans or Grants The financial aid plan requires the student to complete all documentation required for the respective Federal or State program by the due date in order to qualify for tuition deferment. In the event 100% of the tuition and fees are not covered under this plan, the student must make arrangements for the payment of the balance due by one of the other financial options listed above. Such arrangements must be complete by the due date. Acceptable financial 60 | Bethel University College of Arts & Sciencesaid plans are: Federal Pell Grant; Tennessee Student Assistance Grant; Hope Lottery Scholarship; Subsidized Federal Direct Loan; Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan; Federal Parent Plus Loan Program; external scholarships. Since students must reapply for funding each academic year or term, reappli-cation must be fully completed on or before the appropriate due date. In the event a student fails to timely reapply, qualification for tuition deferment will be terminated and the student will be required to comply with the terms and conditions of the cash plan. The following documentation is required to be filed by the due date for the Federal/State Loans or Grants: • Accepted Admission Decision • Free Application for Federal Aid (FAFSA) • Direct Loan Master Promissory Note (MPN) • Direct Loan Entrance Counseling • Verification documents (if required). Tuition Reimbursement Plan Tuition reimbursement from an employer is an acceptable financial option. However, it is subject to the following conditions: • The student must make acceptable arrangements through one of the other financial options to pay all tuition and fees during the initial deferral period. Thereafter, tuition reimbursement proceeds will be applied to future enrollment periods. • Complete documentation of terms and conditions of the employer’s reimbursement plan. • A completed Tuition Reimbursement Certificate and Authorization Form which allows Bethel to automatically charge the student’s credit card in the event full reimbursement is not paid by the employer. Students must be advised that terms and conditions are not contingent upon the completion of a course or the receipt of a grade and that the credit card will be charged for any amount necessary to repay Bethel 100% of the amount due. A declined credit card will cause the account to be assessed a $50 late fee which is immediately due and payable. A second declined credit card will terminate this financial option and the student will be required to comply with the terms and conditions of the cash plan. Financial Information | 61 The following documentation is required to be filed by the due date for the Tuition Reimbursement Plan: • Student Financial Agreement Form • Tuition Reimbursement Certificate and Authorization Form • Credit Card Authorization to Charge Form • Copy of Employer’s Tuition Reimbursement Plan • Completed Admissions Application Tuition Management SystemsStudents have the option to submit payments through the Bethel University TMS portal. Service fees apply. Third Party Billing Plan Third party billing plans are available for students of employers approved for direct billing, active duty military personnel, civilian government contract employees, and students’ eligible benefits pursuant to the Veterans Affairs Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program. Students will be required to comply with the terms and conditions of the cash plan if employ-ment ceases or the employer ceases to remit payments as agreed. The following documentation is required to be filed by the due date for the third party billing plan: • Student Financial Agreement Form • Employer’s voucher approved by Bethel OR authorized military or government assistance vouchers • Completed Admissions ApplicationPrivate Loan Plan Students may prefer a private loan arrangement with a lender based on credit- worthiness. Failure to pay under this plan will revert the student to the cash plan. The following documentation is required to be filed by the due date for the private loan plan: • Student Financial Agreement Form • Completed Loan Application • Signed Promissory Note • Loan Approval from Lender • Completed Admissions Application62 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesChanging Finance OptionsStudents may change finance options provided they are in compliance with their current finance option.

Note: All students residing in campus housing must have a meal plan. There is no refund for meals missed. Meals do not “roll over” from semester to semes-ter. Any meals left unused will expire at the end of each semester, including “Dining Bucks”. Refund PoliciesA snapshot of enrollment is made each term at the end of the official regis-tration period as published by the University. No adjustments are made to tui-tion or financial aid after this date in the case of a student processing a drop form changing the enrollment hours unless the student officially withdraws or ceases to attend all classes.  Any refund due after financial aid has been applied to a student’s account will be paid through an electronic ACH deposit Financial Information | 67 directly to a savings or checking account.  If an ACH Authorization Form has not been filled out in a timely manner (two weeks prior to refund being issued) then a check will be automatically issued to the student and mailed to the billing address on file. Students who enroll and formally withdraw are subject to a recalculation of any federal, state, or institutional aid that was received during the term. Federal regulations mandate a recalculation of Title IV funding (Federal Pell, SEOG, Federal Stafford/Parent Plus/Grad Plus/Perkins Loans) based on the number of days in the term versus the number of days the student attended classes (as determined by the date of withdrawal). This calculation gives a percentage, and if the percentage is greater than 60% no Title IV funds must be returned. If the percentage is equal to or less than 60%, then a recalcu-lation of Title IV fund eligibility must be completed based on the time the student did attend classes with a set policy on what funds are returned first.Students who fail to formally withdraw and/or cease attending classes (unof-ficial withdrawal) may have federal funds returned per federal regulations.  Students who receive all “FA” grades (failure for non-attendance) could also have financial aid funds returned.Bethel University institutionally funded aid is also pro-rated when a student formally withdraws by the following policy in conjunction with the tuition refund policy:On-Campus Undergraduate• First Week of Class—All tuition dropped and all institutional aid withdrawn.• Second Week of Class—80 percent of tuition and institutional aid withdrawn.• Third Week of Class—60 percent of tuition and institutional aid with-drawn.• Fourth or Fifth Week of Class—50% of tuition and institutional aid withdrawn.• After the Fifth Week of Class—No tuition or institutional aid will be withdrawn.No discounts will be made for dorm rooms if a student withdraws, but meals will be pro-rated for the unexpired time, except in the case of a withdrawal due to disciplinary action. 68 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesNOTE:  Due to the length of summer terms, drop rates are pro-rated differ-ently. Please see the Office of Financial Aid for details.

The information that follows represents current University practices.  Regulations and funding for federal, state, and University programs are subject to change, as Bethel University administers programs accordingly.Student financial assistance is based on the premise that parents have the primary obligation to provide for the education of dependent children.  Additional responsibility rests with the student to contribute to his or her own education from personal assets, earnings, and appropriate borrowing.Merit and need are the basic principles of financial aid eligibility.  Merit includes good citizenship, performance and leadership ability, and satisfacto-ry academic progress.  Need is the difference between what it costs to attend Bethel University and what the family is reasonably expected to pay toward these costs.  Need is demonstrated through the information requested on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).  A report generated by the FAFSA is used by the Financial Aid Office to determine eligibility for federal loans, federal work study, and federal and state grants.  Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA at https://fafsa.gov as soon after October 1 as possible each year.  This is especially true for Tennessee residents as the Tennessee Grant usually runs out of funds quickly.Bethel University’s Policies Governing Financial Aid and Satisfactory Aca-demic Progress Policy can be found on the Bethel University website (www.bethelu.edu/admission/financial_aid).  Please make sure you read and-understand these two important documents.  Should you have any questions, contact the Financial Aid Office.  A printed copy of the policies is available upon request.70 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesFederal Financial AidFederal Pell Grant  The Federal Pell Grant provides a foundation for financial assistance.  Eligibil-ity is determined through the FAFSA need analysis process.  Award amounts are determined by the EFC calculated on the FAFSA and number of credit hours taken each semester.  Pell Grants are limited to twelve semesters or its equivalent.SEOG (Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant)  The Federal SEOG Grant is based on need and is awarded to students who demonstrate the greatest financial need.  Students who receive SEOG must also be Federal Pell Grant recipients.  Teach Grant The TEACH Grant is for students who plan to teach or are currently teaching in high need subject areas.  If a student receives the grant but does not fulfill the stringent requirements of the program, the grant amount received becomes a loan with accrued interest compounded from the time of initial disbursement of the grant.Federal Work Study Federal Work Study is not a scholarship or grant, but rather an opportunity to work and earn funds for educational expenses.  It is awarded based on federal need per the FAFSA.  The average work assignments are ten hours per week.Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized LoansA Direct Subsidized Loan is awarded based on financial need.  The govern-ment pays the interest on these loans while the borrower is in school at least half-time.  A Direct Unsubsidized Loan is not awarded based on financial need.  Interest accrues from the date of disbursement until the final payment.  Repayment on both types of loans begins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled at least half-time.  A Master Promissory Note (MPN) and En-trance Counseling must be completed by all first time Direct Loan borrowers.  Dependent undergraduate students can borrow yearly up to $5500 as a freshman, $6500 as a sophomore, and $7500 as a junior or senior if their Cost of Attendance budget allows.  Should a dependent student’s parent apply for and be denied a Direct Parent Plus Loan, the student can request additional Financial Aid | 71 unsubsidized funds based on their grade level and Cost of Attendance budget.  Independent undergraduate students can borrow yearly up to $9500 as a freshman, $10,500 as a sophomore, and $12,500 as a junior and senior if their cost of Attendance budget allows.  Aggregate loan limits are:  $31,000 for Undergraduate Dependent students and $57,500 for Undergraduate Indepen-dent Students.  No more than $23,000 may be subsidized.  Graduate students can borrow up to $20,500 Direct Unsubsidized Loan yearly if their Cost of Attendance budget allows.  Graduate aggregate loan limit is $138,500 of which no more than $65,500 may be subsidized.  (Graduate student aggregate limit includes their undergraduate and graduate amounts.)There is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that a student can receive direct Subsidized loans if the student is a first-time borrower on or after July 1, 2013.  In general, a student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150% of the published length of their pro-gram of study.  This is also called the “maximum eligibility period.”Federal Direct Parent Plus LoanThis is a loan to the parent, not the student.  A credit check is required each year.  Repayment begins 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed unless the parent requests a deferment.  A Master Promissory Note (MPN) is required.  The parent must reapply each academic year.  Should the Parent Plus loan be denied, the student can request additional Unsubsidized loan based on their grade level and Cost of Attendance budget. Plus borrowers who are denied with an adverse credit history but are determined eligible by appeal because of satisfactorily meeting the extenu-ating circumstances provision or by obtaining an endorser are REQUIRED to complete special PLUS loan counseling.Federal Direct Grad Plus LoanDirect Grad Plus loans are for Graduate students.  A credit check is required each year.  Repayment begins 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed unless the student requests a deferment.  A Master Promissory Note (MPN) and Entrance Counseling are required for all first time borrowers.  The student must reapply each academic year.For more information on Federal Student Aid, please visit https://studentaid.ed.gov/72 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesState Financial AidTennessee offers several grants and scholarships.

REL 111,", 112, 113Progress toward meeting the outcomes of the Liberal Arts Core is measured in a number of ways; through standardized, nationally-normed tests, inter-nally generated tests, class activities, and survey data.The Program CoreAs part of Bethel University’s effort to simplify and clarify its curriculum, the College has incorporated a program design that features a program core. The program core is the next logical step for a student to take as he/she moves from the core curriculum and wishes to explore coursework that pertains to a major field before completely committing to a major. This intermediate step allows for greater flexibility in course selection and major exploration.The Major and the MinorStudents must select a major field of study in their pursuit of a bachelor’s degree at Bethel University. Depending on the major, a student will work toward a Bachelor of Science, or a Bachelor of Arts degree. Some majors also require the student to select a minor. Curriculum Organization | 81 Majors (Programs of Study)• Art• Biology (Emphasis: Biology Education)• Biology (Emphasis:  Field/Environmental Biology)• Biology (Emphasis:  General Biology)• Biology (Emphasis:  Pre-Professional Health)• Business of Administration (Emphasis: Accounting)• Business of Administration (Emphasis: Computer Information Systems)• Business of Administration (Emphasis: Management)• Chemistry• Chemistry (Emphasis: Biochemistry)• Child Learning and Development• Christian Studies• Criminal Justice Studies• English• Exceptional Learning and Development• Fitness and Wellness Promotion• History• Human Services• Interdisciplinary Studies• Mathematics• Music• Music (Emphasis: Performance)• Music (Emphasis: Music and Worship)• Music Education• Music Industry Studies (Emphasis: Music Business)• Music Industry Studies (Emphasis: Music Production & Recording Arts)• Physical Education• Pre-Pharmacy (3 + 1 Program)• Psychology• Sociology• Student Initiated Major• TheatreNote:Refer to the College of Health Sciences catalog for a list of majors in Health Sciences related fieldsRefer to the College of Professional Studies catalog for a list of majors for adult degree-completion programs.82 | Bethel University College of Arts & SciencesMinors• Accounting• Art• Biology • Business of Administration • Chemistry• Computer Information Systems• Computer Science• Criminal Justice Studies• English• Environmental Studies• Health• History• Human Services• Learning Theory and Communication• Mathematics• Music• Music Industry Studies• Physics• Pre-Engineering• Pre-Professional Health Studies• Professional Education for Child Learning and Development (K-5)• Professional Education for Exceptional Learning and Development: Interventionist (K-8) (6-12)• Professional Education Secondary Subject Areas (6-12)• Professional Education for Music Education (K-12)• Professional Education for Physical Education (K-12)• Psychology• Religion• Sociology• Spanish• Sports Management• Student Initiated Major• TheatreCurriculum Organization | 83 The Major in ArtBachelor of Arts DegreeA.

The purpose of the Student Initiated Major/Minor (SIM) is not merely to avoid existing majors and minors, nor is it to create a major or minor in the absence of an existing field of study. In certain rare cases students may desire to pursue a program of study not specifically offered by the university though the university may offer course work which would in fact support such a program of study. In such cases a student may petition the Academic Dean and the College of Arts and Sciences Registrar of the univer-sity with a proposal for a student initiated major or minor as outlined below. The advantage to the student who completes the SIM is that the integration of learning and the research involved are prized assets of a liberal arts educa-tion.Upon completing 30 or more semester hours of course work a student with a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 or above may choose to design a course of study which must combine more than one discipline. The student, with the help of a panel of three or more faculty members, integrates the courses of study from the various disciplines so that the goals set forth in the written proposal by the student can be met.  The requirements of the SIM are as follows:1. All work toward the proposal should begin with a discussion of the SIM with the student’s academic advisor.2. Must involve two or more distinct disciplines.3. Must incorporate three or more faculty (at least one of whom holds a terminal degree) who will constitute the SIM faculty advisory committee.4. Must include a proposal prepared by the student which must defend the Disciplines and provide a rationale for the SIM request.  5. After obtaining the approval signatures of the three or more faculty members, the proposal must be presented to and be approved by the Academic Dean and the Registrar.  6. All courses selected must be Bethel University catalog courses (or trans-fer equivalent) and must be listed in the proposal. Courses previously completed may be included.7. At least one Individual Study as an integrated capstone course (XXX-499) Curriculum Organization | 125 must be included which will incorporate the knowledge of the major or minor.  8. The semester hour total for the proposal is 45 to 60 hours for the SIM major which does not require a minor and 21 to 30 hours for the SIM minor.9. Any student choosing an SIM must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above at the time the proposal is submitted and must have earned a minimum of 30 semester hours.  A transfer student must have completed at least one full time semester at Bethel University prior to submitting the SIM request and must meet all additional SIM requirements.10.  All required assessment procedures related to the major field must be completed no later than the last day of classes for the term in which graduation occurs. 11.  All graduation requirements apply to the SIM major and the SIM minor.Curriculum for the Student Initiated MajorA. Liberal Arts Core (33 hours)− , 201− PED Activity (1 hour) − 3 hours from:  .
